  "<p>It is 2.30pm on a weekday afternoon. Sunlight filters through the willow oaks and beech, descending from a perfect blue sky. Beneath the trees, rows of marble headstones stretch away, seemingly without end, rising up green, closely cropped slopes towards the house of perhaps the American civil war's most famous general, Robert E Lee. There is a stillness here that envelops everything, a silence that demands respect.</p> <p>Then suddenly, without warning, a rifle volley thunders out, then another, and another. A bugle sound Taps, the US army's equivalent of the Last Post. In a separate part of the vast Arlington National Cemetery, another American hero is being laid to rest with full military honours.</p> <p>But in Section 60 of the cemetery, it is quiet. Here is where many of the more than 4,100 men and women killed in Operation Iraqi Freedom are buried. It is a work in progress. Newly filled graves await headstones. Vacant lots await fresh occupants. Casualties of Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan are now being buried here, too. There is plenty of room left.</p> <p>Section 60 has been called America's saddest acre. It may also be its most forlorn. Because it is here that the extent to which the US has begun to turn its back on a conflict that defined a presidency and divided the world can be measured.</p> <p>As far as many Americans are concerned, it seems that Iraq has become a forgotten war. Some believe, along with the Republican vice-presidential candidate, Sarah Palin, that \"victory\" has already been won. For others, the war feels like a painful memory, a subject best not discussed.</p> <p>In the presidential election campaign, surveys show only 8-9% of Americans rate Iraq as the most important issue. Economic worries, healthcare, energy prices and taxes have all taken precedence as the global financial crisis bites.</p> <p>In last week's presidential debate between Barack Obama and John McCain, Iraq was barely mentioned. The Democrat has set a 16-month timetable for withdrawal. The Republican says that is defeatist. \"I will bring our troops home in victory and honour,\" said McCain.</p> <p>But the watching audience, judging by instant graph lines measuring their reaction, did not want to know. Iraq is a distraction from their real concerns. Iraq is a turn-off. And in Section 60, that leaves a hurtful question hanging in the warm, still air: what was it all for?</p> <p>Michael Gainey, a staff sergeant who returned from a year's tour in Iraq in December, firmly believes his friend and fellow serviceman Russell Shoemaker, who was killed by a roadside bomb in Salman Pak, south of Baghdad, on May 24 2007, did not die in vain. Gainey has come from Charlotte, North Carolina, to visit Shoemaker's grave.</p> <p>\"Russell would have thought it was worth it. He made an impact. He fulfilled his mission,\" Gainey said. \"Russell was a real great guy. We were involved in training the Iraqi police. </p> <p>\"The day he died he was going to a meeting with local Iraqis. We couldn't train them properly. It was a combat zone. But I think we helped.\"</p> <p>Gainey said he was not surprised the public appeared to have lost interest in Iraq. \"Iraq's off the agenda,\" he said. \"Americans have got complacent. They've got used to it. It's not on the TV so much. And the situation there is better than it was. It's right that people are focusing on their pocketbooks. I understand that.\"</p> <p>His views were echoed by a female US army colonel who had also come to Section 60 to honour fallen comrades. She asked not be named.</p> <p>\"Americans have been desensitised to Iraq,\" she said. \"We've been at it now for seven years in the war on terror. I think many people just shut it out. Americans are still very supportive of our troops. That doesn't necessarily mean they support the policy.\"</p> <p>According to her father, a second world war veteran, people were thinking too much about their own problems. \"The attitude has changed quite a bit since the war started,\" she said. \"You've got to protect your own country. But there are too many soft-hearted people. There's too much greed.\"</p> <p>Recent surveys confirm a sharp falling-off in political support. Asked last month in an ABC News/Washington Post poll whether the Iraq war had been worth fighting, 61% said \"no\" while 36% said \"yes\". Fifty-eight percent of respondents told Gallup that the whole thing had been a mistake; while 59% told the Associated Press in September they wanted a timetable to bring the troops home.</p> <p>Sitting on the grass by the grave of his brother, Captain Ian Patrick Weikel, who was killed in Balad, north of Baghdad, in April 2006, Chad Weikel believes that America's unique sense of mission to improve the world must not become a casualty of Iraq.</p> <p>Weikel, from Colorado Springs, believes this so strongly, he has signed up to go to Iraq, following in his brother's footsteps despite his wife's opposition. </p> <p>\"I joined [the army] because of my brother. I wouldn't be doing it otherwise. Whether people support the war depends on party lines. I'm surprised they're not more interested. But people don't get the real picture of what we're doing over there,\" Weikel said, shielding his eyes from the sunlight.</p> <p>\"It's my brother's birthday today. He's 34 today. He was always awful at birthday presents. He'd buy crappy gifts or else he'd forget. I've been talking to him about that. I talk to him a lot. But he never really answers back.\"</p>",
  "<p>John Adams is working on a new piece, but he can't describe it, he says, because it's not going well. \"Starting is always hell. Right now, I'm the most unpleasant person to be around: grumpy, uncommunicative, selfish. I have a vague idea of what I want it to be, but it's just not working out. Worst of all, my wife won't listen any more.\" </p> <p> Hearing Adams admit to self-doubt is something of a surprise. Now 61, the composer cemented his international reputation more than 20 years ago with Nixon in China, his opera about the former US president's extraordinary meetings with Mao Zedong. Next week, Dr Atomic, his 2005 opera about the testing of the first atomic bomb, receives its New York premiere at the Metropolitan Opera. This month also sees the publication of Adams' autobiography, Hallelujah Junction. </p> <p>In music and in life, Adams chose a difficult route. From his early experimental compositions for homemade synthesiser to the minimalism of Grand Pianola Music (1982), from the chromatic Chamber Symphony (1994) to the orientalism of his most recent opera, A Flowering Tree (2006), he has yet to settle into any kind of comfort zone. He arrived at Harvard in 1966 to study music, but knew he wanted to compose, and abandoned his studies for a factory job in San Francisco. What was he running from? \"I came of age,\" he says, \"when the operative model for a composer was a pseudo-scientist. If you read the early essays of [Pierre] Boulez and Milton Babbit, you'd get the impression music is all about finding the correct formula to suppress all individuality and emotion.\" </p> <p>But then, this was the 1960s; the tide of counterculture was rising fast, and while composers such as Babbit and Boulez were busy theorising, the rest of the country was discovering the Beatles and John Coltrane. And LSD. Did Adams take acid? Yes, he says. Did it change the way he composed?</p> <p>\"It can certainly amplify and alter one's perceptions,\" he says. \"The experience was powerful and amazing, and certainly changed the way I thought about things at the time. On the few occasions I was high, I did have these very powerful flashes of understanding about musical structure, and also about the usual holy-holy stuff. Although I wouldn't say LSD changed the way I compose music, the culture of seeking mind-expanding experiences is something we miss now more than ever. The mindset of George Bush's America is more closed than ever before. We're all hunkered down, living in the shadow of our fears, most of them imaginary.\"</p> <p>It's not hard to guess Adams' politics. \"We're on the cusp of what could be real, reinvigorating change,\" he says of the presidential election. \"Or of sliding further into the repressive, reactionary, mind-numbing fear.\" He believes that what he calls \"contemporary serious music\" has a role to play in changing mindsets; exactly what kind of a role became clear to him after 9/11. He was in London at the time, rehearsing for a film version of The Death of Klinghoffer, his controversial opera about the 1985 hijacking of a cruise ship by the Palestine Liberation Front. </p> <p>He had also planned to attend a performance of one of his racier forays into minimalism, Short Ride in a Fast Machine (1986), at the Last Night of the Proms, but the programme was changed in the wake of the attacks. Adams' sparse, stately Tromba Lontana was performed instead, alongside Beethoven's rousing Ninth Symphony. </p> <p>\"The resort to Beethoven, both in London and all over the world, made many of us painfully aware of a distressing reality,\" he says. \"Despite having created arguably the most vibrant musical culture of any country over the past half-century or so, there didn't seem to be any American piece that could answer the country's emotional needs at that time.\"</p> <p>The New York Philharmonic picked Adams as the man to plug the gap, and commissioned him to write a commemorative work for the first anniversary of the 9/11 attacks. Adams remains unhappy with the resulting work - a meditative choral piece, On the Transmigration of Souls. He feels the Republican administration manipulated the memory of the attacks, to create what he calls an \"orgy of narcissism and collective victimisation\". </p> <p>Nor is he happy about the state of contemporary music. \"We're in danger of an overflow of extremely mediocre music,\" he says, \"partly because composing has become dangerously easy. Everyone can carry around software programs on a laptop and compose a new piece in a single evening. But the trouble is, of course, that the software dictates the parameters of what you can do, how you can think.\"</p> <p>So will there be no more Beethoven's Ninth Symphonies or Mozart C minor masses? \"I'll certainly never be able to reach that level,\" he says. \"The great works of the past come about as a perfect collision of good fortune. You get a technology that just happens to have peaked at that time and a creative intelligence of just the right kind to exploit it. I'm not sure the Symphony Orchestra is going to see another Mahler, another Beethoven.\"</p> <p>Adams pauses, as if to reflect on whether he has just talked himself out of a job, then resumes. \"But anyway, who the hell am I to talk like that? When I think of literature, everyone's always said there'll never be another Shakespeare, another George Eliot. But literature never ground to a halt. People go on writing truly great plays and novels. Maybe that's what I'm doing, without even realising it\".</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Hallelujah Junction: Composing an American Life</strong>,<strong> </strong>by John Adams, is published by Faber &amp; Faber.</p>",
  "<p>An elder statesman of the Republican party cast doubt about the legitimacy of the presidential election yesterday - three weeks before Americans go to the polls - by declaring the process was already \"tainted\" by voter fraud.</p> <p>The assertion from John Danforth, a former Missouri senator and ambassador to the UN, dramatically escalates charges by the John McCain camp that Barack Obama and the community organisation Acorn are trying to steal the election by bringing new voters into the electoral system.</p> <p>Danforth said canvassers for Acorn, which has registered 1.3 million new voters - mostly African-Americans, Latinos and young people - had committed widespread fraud in several battleground states.</p> <p>\"This election now has been tainted by something that is just plain wrong,\" he said. He raised the spectre of the 2000 elections, which was undermined by the hanging chad issue. \"We believe that this is a potential nightmare,\" he said.</p> <p>\"The issue could be whether it is fair at all and whether the losing side believes it has been fairly defeated or it has been cheated.\"</p> <p>Danforth's appearance yesterday at a press conference in Washington marked the first time such a prominent figure - Republican or Democrat - has questioned the legitimacy of the November 4 elections because of the dramatic rise in voter participation this year.</p> <p>It comes as the McCain camp turns increasingly vocal in accusing Obama and Acorn of seeking to steal the elections. </p> <p>The charges against Acorn have grown more pointed with McCain's slide in the opinion polls. Yesterday Sarah Palin sought to rally the party base with a fundraising email attacking Acorn.</p> <p>\"We can't allow leftist groups like Acorn to steal this election,\" the email said.</p> <p>The attacks on Acorn have also become a running thread on rightwing talk radio.</p> <p>A number of press reports have surfaced recently about a large number of invalid registrations submitted by Acorn - some of which were revisited by Danforth. </p> <p>In Nevada, canvassers submitted the names of members of the Dallas Cowboys football team and Mickey Mouse as new voters. In Indiana, they put in the name of a local restaurant - Jimmy John. In Ohio, one man registered 73 times. In Missouri, 10 registrations were submitted in the name of a dead woman.</p> <p>Danforth noted that state election officials had rejected large numbers of the new registrations: 57,000 out of 233,000 alone in the Philadelphia area. However, when asked he could not say how many were rejected because of incomplete or incorrectly filled forms, or fraud - or how many were later reinstated on appeal.</p> <p>Democrats and voting rights experts say that the incidence of actual voter fraud is minimal in US elections, and easily outweighed by the number of people, mostly poor and members of minority groups, who are denied the right to vote.</p>",
  "<p>John McCain yesterday threatened to up the ante in tonight's final televised presidential debate, which offers possibly his last chance to prevent a rout in November's election.</p> <p>The Republican candidate said he would raise Democratic candidate Barack Obama's links with Bill Ayers, one of the founders of an urban guerrilla group, as new polls showed McCain slipping further and Obama extending his reach into states normally considered solidly Republican. US analysts and pollsters said that no one in recent modern history had been so far behind in mid-October and gone on to win an election.</p> <p>A CBS News/New York Times poll last night gave Obama a 14 percentage point lead over McCain.

After the debate last week in Nashville, Tennessee, Obama noted that McCain had not had the courage to raise Ayers with him face to face, even though the McCain campaign had been pursuing the issue each day.</p> <p>McCain said yesterday that Obama's remarks \"probably ensured\" that he would bring up Ayers. \"I was astonished to hear him say that he was surprised I didn't have the guts,\" McCain said.</p> <p>His campaign team is mounting a relentlessly negative campaign to try to discredit Obama, seen as the only realistic opportunity left for turning the election.</p> <p>Some of his team argue that the attacks on the links with Ayers have been ineffective and that McCain should bring up the Democratic candidate's association with his former pastor, Jeremiah Wright, which McCain has resisted so far.</p> <p>David Plouffe, Obama's campaign manager, yesterday distributed a video through the internet criticising McCain's team and associated groups for putting out what he described as \"vile\" adverts full of lies about Obama's policies on abortion, sex offenders and guns. Plouffe predicted that Republican groups would spend millions more on such ads as the election draws closer.</p> <p>Negative campaigning, effective in previous elections, has so far failed to provide traction for McCain, partly because the electorate is focused on the impact of the financial crisis on their lives.</p> <p>McCain yesterday set out a $52.5bn (\u00a330bn) economic plan, his most detailed since the financial crisis began, to try to alleviate the plight of working families struggling with job losses, mortgage problems and squeezed pensions. This included buying up mortgages for families in danger of defaulting, offering lower taxes for people over 59 who need to dip into retirement funds to see them through the crisis, and scrapping for the next two years tax on unemployment benefit.</p> <p>\"What we need to see now is swift and bold action to lead this country in a new direction,\" McCain told supporters in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania.</p> <p>His plan came a day later than intended, indicating disarray inside his campaign team in the face of Obama's increasing poll leads. By delaying, McCain was beaten to the draw by Obama, who released his own economic proposals on Monday.</p> <p>One of McCain's advisers, Douglas Holtz-Eakin, yesterday disputed talk of infighting and said the plan had always been to unveil the policies yesterday.</p> <p>Earlier polls yesterday showed Obama winning the economic argument among independent voters and extending his lead in states previously considered swing states or even safe Republican states. The Quinnipiac University Polling Institute put Obama on 52% to McCain's 43% in Colorado, on 55% to McCain's 37% in Michigan, and on 51% to McCain's 43% in Minnesota and Wisconsin.</p> <p>\"Those margins may be insurmountable barring a reversal that has never been seen before in the modern era,\" said Peter Brown, at the Connecticut-based institute. \"The only possible bright spot for Senator McCain is that he is holding roughly the same portion of the Republican vote.

  "<p>The term \"game changing election\" has been bandied about with such frequency by the US punditry that it's almost a clich\u00e9 at the moment. But like most clich\u00e9s, it survives because there is a core of absolute truth to it that refuses to be dismissed. Both presidential campaigns are playing the game. Their approaches to it seem tied to the personal recreations preferred by the candidates: McCain, the designated maverick, is <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/28/us/politics/28gambling-web.html?hp\">playing a hand</a> of high-stakes poker and attempting an audacious bluff for all the marbles. That might be useful, if Obama were also playing poker \u2013 but he's not. Obama <a href=\"http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/multimedia/photo_gallery/0712/price.obama/content.1.html\">prefers basketball</a>.</p> <p>McCain's strategy to this point has been that of a good poker player, distracting attention from perceived weaknesses with bluster and misdirection while he builds his position. Of course, the cards in his hand are poor, so he cannot hope to win by calling his opponent's hand. The best he can hope for is for Obama to fold by making a devastating gaffe that turns the bulk of the US electorate against him.</p> <p>McCain seems to see politics as a series of hands: the primaries, the conventions, the debates, the television ads, the six-second soundbyte for the evening news. Choosing Sarah Palin for a running mate was a bold, high-stakes move. It's a one-man show (plus the hot babe standing next to him cooing flattering encouragement in his ear) and every hand adds something to the pot. Lose on one, try to make it up on the other, and hopefully at the end of the day you come out just enough ahead in the electoral college to take the pot. </p> <p>It's political brinksmanship at its most acute. When you seem desperately behind, you raise the stakes and change the game. It's a dangerous game, but you don't become a fighter pilot \u2013 however mediocre \u2013 without learning how to play poker. McCain has just the sort of devil-may-care, Top Gun mentality (with accompanying set of brass testes) to possibly pull off a bluff of this magnitude. Not many men have the nerves to do it. Poker is his game, and <a href=\"http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1819898-2,00.html\">he's a gambler</a>. It all comes down to that one last bluff, and whether Obama (or the other players at the table, the American people) will raise, call or fold. </p> <p>I actually don't know much about poker except what I pick up on cable, but since I live in one of the global hotspots for competitive collegiate basketball \u2013 between powerhouses <a href=\"http://www.goduke.com/SportSelect.dbml?SPID=1845&amp;SPSID=22724\">Duke</a> and <a href=\"http://tarheelblue.cstv.com/sports/m-baskbl/unc-m-baskbl-body.html\">UNC</a> \u2013 I know that game better. In basketball the strategy is far less about storming the basket manfully and making points \u2013 although that's the showy part. It's about having more points than your opponent when the buzzer sounds the end of the game. Obama's campaign understands that.</p> <p>Obama has fielded a wide-ranging zone defence, putting trusted, competent people in positions of responsibility, giving them enough direction to keep them actively supporting each other but enough freedom for them to improvise if the ball lands in their hands. He's kept the <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-na-money13-2008oct13,0,6436466.story\">constant resources flowing</a>, augmenting his substantial paid staff with hordes of <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/10/11/AR2008101102119.html\">enthusiastic volunteers</a>. He's running the court by making the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/13/us/politics/13caucus.html?_r=1&amp;oref=slogin\">Republican party compete in states</a> they never suspected that he'd be strong in. He's adeptly used competent proxies to attack his opponents, allowing him to appear above the fray, and he's kept the ball moving by maintaining focus on the most pressing issues of the campaign \u2013 the war and the economy \u2013 while dismissing the distractions.</p> <p>His surrogates aggressively guard him from the smears by going on the offensive, man-to-man. And they are prepared for everything. Hillary Clinton tempered the campaign for all of Obama's negatives during the Democratic primary. Now they immediately and aggressively counter.</p> <p>William Ayers? The Alaskan Independence Party. Tony Rezko? Keating Five. Earmarks? One trillion dollars in Republican deficit spending on the wars alone. The potential of higher taxes? The certainty of higher health insurance premiums. Didn't back the surge in Iraq? Didn't back the dumb war to begin with. Every argument has a counter, and the Obama campaign has a full arsenal of responses to these last-second misdirections because he understands the game.</p> <p>While all the attention is being paid to the star players of the team and the huge rallies and favourable poll numbers, the Obama campaign is counting far more on basic fundamentals of the game to win: the ground game, including Obama's heavily wired multi-state organisation, get-out-the-vote efforts, neighbour-to-neighbour initiatives and the historic voter-registration drives that have already permanently altered the electoral map. Basketball is a team sport, and Obama is relying heavily on his team to keep their opponents off his back while he drives for the score.</p> <p>In basketball the most important aspect of the game is the clock. At the end of the game there is a buzzer and then it's over. For the US, that buzzer is election day, and all the polls and rallies in the world don't matter if the buzzer sounds while you're still down a point or two.</p> <p>Obama will run the clock just like any good basketball coach would. When you're ahead and there's only two minutes left in the game, every shot counts, every possession counts and you can expect plenty of fouls by the frustrated opposition to try to break your rhythm and stop your momentum. You bring in your best players \u2013 <a href=\"http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5gGn1Qiwx3uBAtrv66H46rHWSYoZQ\">Bill and Hillary Clinton</a>, Joe Biden and <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/10/09/michelle-obama-makes-idai_n_133232.html\">Michelle Obama</a> \u2013 and let them work out those fouls for you while you keep control of the ball and the initiative. And then you wait for the other team to throw that wild full-court shot right at the buzzer \u2013 for all the good it will do them.</p> <p>'Cause Obama got game.</p>",
  "<p>Labour's candidate for the Glenrothes byelection formally launched his party's campaign today, ending several weeks of phoney war between the main parties by unveiling his \"action plan for Fife\".</p> <p>Lindsay Roy, the headteacher of Gordon Brown's former secondary school in Kirkcaldy, pledged that he would dedicate himself to campaigning against poverty, protecting the elderly, improving local transport and cracking down on antisocial behaviour.</p> <p>A resident of Glenrothes, Roy acknowledged he had little political experience but added: \"I know what we need to do to sort things out here. My priorities are to help Fifers through these economic times, bring down household bills and help families and older people.\"</p> <p>The byelection will be held on November 6, two days after the US presidential election, following the death of the sitting Labour MP John MacDougall from cancer in August. </p> <p>Gordon Brown later confirmed that he would campaign in the constituency with his wife, Sarah, despite claiming previously that an historic protocol barred him from campaigning in the Glasgow East or Crewe and Nantwich byelections because he was prime minister.</p> <p>In an open letter urging Labour MPs and peers to support the party during the byelection, Brown said Glenrothes was a \"vital campaign\". </p> <p>He also praised Roy: \"He has spent much of his professional life dedicated to helping young people in Fife reach their potential \u2026 He will make a first class Labour MP.\"</p> <p>His expected visit has been carefully trailed by Labour, so the Scottish National party, seen as favourite to win the seat, immediately challenged him to meet voters in person rather than hold a set piece rally with a selected audience.</p> <p>Labour are defending a 10,664-vote majority, and are hoping to avoid another byelection defeat by the Scottish National party, which won the equivalent seat in the Scottish parliament elections last year and is in coalition with the Liberal Democrats running Fife council. </p> <p>Although the SNP had been expected to inflict another embarrassing defeat on Brown, whose own constituency is next door, observers and senior SNP figures believe it is becoming a very closely fought contest.</p> <p>While the nationalists have carefully cultivated the seat since MacDougall's terminal illness with cancer emerged last year, Labour has used the near two month gap before it formally confirmed the byelection date last week to mount a vigorous local campaign.</p> <p>Buoyed in part by Brown's performance during the banking crisis, Labour claims it is also in a stronger position than it was in Glasgow East, the formerly Labour seat won by the SNP in July, because the SNP candidate is Peter Grant, the leader of Fife council.</p> <p>They again attacked his record as leader by highlighting further confusion within his coalition administration about whether Fife could afford to pay for the SNP government's new policy to give free school meals to 5-to-8-year-olds. </p> <p>Grant's Lib Dem deputy, Councillor Elizabeth Riches, said that his statements that Fife had \u00a32m set aside for the policy were \"premature\" and a \"surprise\". </p> <p>Roy said that his SNP opponent ought to \"get off his knees\" and guarantee the money was available. </p> <p>\"He should go to his SNP bosses in Edinburgh and not come back until he has the money Fife needs to buy the schools meals for these kids,\" he added. </p> <p>The SNP will launch their formal campaign tomorrow, and Grant was out campaigning today with Shona Robison, the Scottish public health minister, at a chemist in Cardenden.</p> <p>He cited the SNP's pledge to first cut and then abolish prescription charges as proof of his party's efforts to help people during the economic downturn \u2013 a crisis worsened by Labour's failure to tackle soaring fuel costs. </p> <p>\"Labour ducked and dived on this issue, and it is fairer that people do not have to face the choice of paying for prescriptions or their heating bills,\" he said.</p> <p>The SNP also point to the abolition of bridge tolls for the Forth road bridge, increased spending on Fife schools, and measures to cut business rates and boost police numbers.</p> <h2>Glenrothes candidates declared so far</h2> <p><strong>Labour: </strong>Lindsay Roy</p> <p><strong>Scottish National party: </strong>Peter Grant</p> <p><strong>Liberal Democrats: </strong>Harry Wills</p> <p><strong>Conservatives: </strong>Maurice Golden</p> <p><strong>Scottish Socialist party: </strong>Morag Balfour</p> <p><strong>Solidarity:</strong> Louise McLeary</p> <p><strong>UK Independence party:</strong> Kris Seunarine</p>",
  "<p>Still trailing in the polls, and with conservative commentators hammering his performance to date, John McCain adopted a radically different approach to his underdog status yesterday: he embraced it. In a speech in Virginia that had been billed as a \"reboot\" for his ailing campaign, the Republican contender sought to present himself as a plucky fighter, written off by Barack Obama and the \"national media\", but now ready for a comeback. For the time being, at least, McCain abandoned attacks on Obama's background, opting instead to warn of dark times ahead, and of the perils of electing a leader who would have to learn on the job. Sometimes, his fighting tone bordered on the implausible. \"We have to fight,\" he said. \"We have 22 days to go. We're six points down ... My friends, we've got them just where we want them.\" The speech was notably policy-free - but last night McCain aides insisted that had been the plan all along, and that the candidate will make major economic announcements in a separate speech today.</p> <p>Barack Obama, meanwhile, sought to consolidate and increase his poll lead with a $60bn economic rescue plan aimed at creating more jobs and easing the burden on the middle class, Ewen Macaskill writes in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/14/uselections2008-barackobama\">today's Guardian</a>. The measures, laid out in a speech in Ohio, include a programme of public infrastructure works that echoes the 1930s New Deal, and a three-month moratorium on home foreclosures. But in his warnings of hard times ahead, there were signs of the other challenge Obama now faces: as his victory seems more and more likely, he must somehow ready the electorate for the huge economic challenges of the near future, without corroding the enthusiasm on which his success so far has been built.</p> <h2>What to watch for</h2> <p>Obama remains in Ohio, McCain and Sarah Palin are in Pennsylvania - where McCain is expected to deliver his own speech on the economy today - and later New York. Then tomorrow comes the final presidential debate. Oddly, given yesterday's shift in the tone of the Republican campaign, McCain adviser Tucker Bounds seemed to say on Fox News yesterday that McCain would challenge Obama during the debate over his association with William Ayers. \"So much of a debate is determined by the moderator and the questions that are posed to the candidates,\" Bounds said, \"[but] I expect that it could come up. And I expect John McCain will ask Barack Obama to speak truthfully about his relationship with friend and unrepentant terrorist Bill Ayers.\"</p> <h2>Latest polls</h2> <p>Obama slightly increased his lead in Gallup's tracking poll, which puts the candidates at 51% to 41%, and slightly reduced it in Rasmussen's, which is at Obama 50%, McCain 45%. A Washington Post/ABC News poll of likely voters echoed Gallup's 10-point lead, putting McCain at 43% to Obama's 53%. \"Though every race is different,\" an ABC pollster said, \"no presidential candidate has come back from an October deficit this large in pre-election polls dating to 1936.\"</p> <h2>Quote of the day</h2> <p>\"Jobs, baby, jobs.\" Hillary Clinton, parodying the Republican chant of \"drill, baby, drill\", seemed finally to be enjoying herself, stumping for Obama in Pennsylvania.</p> <h2>On theguardian.com</h2> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/14/uselections2008-johnmccain1\">McCain plays valiant underdog as once-loyal south looks uncertain</a></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/uselectionroadtrip/2008/oct/14/roseanne-barr-marc-maron\">Video: 'A nation run by old men on Viagra', says Roseanne Barr</a></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/14/uselections2000-barackobama\">Obama campaign finds prejudice lingers in blue-collar heartlands</a></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/14/uselections2008-sarahpalin\">Is it a boy?

  "<p>Securing a new agreement with the Iraqi government within the next few weeks to allow the continued presence of British troops in the country is of \"critical\" importance, a Foreign Office minister said today. </p> <p>Bill Rammell, the new minister for the Middle East, said that the British government was working towards a new, \"civilian-led\" relationship with Iraq in 2009 as the Iraqi forces increasingly take charge of the security situation.</p> <p>But without a Status of Forces Agreement, the UK would have to seek the rollover of its United Nations mandate to maintain a military presence in Iraq, which Rammell said would send out an \"unfortunate\" message and undermine progress towards normality in the country.</p> <p>The UN mandate runs out at the end of the year, and there are concerns that a bid to renew it may face opposition in the security council from Russia or others opposed to the US-led war. </p> <p>Negotiations between the US and the Iraqi government over a State of Forces Agreement for American troops have been stuck for months on the question of legal jurisdiction and immunity for possible crimes. </p> <p>Rammell, who is making his first visit to Baghdad, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme said the government was seeking to secure a Status of Forces Agreement for British troops when the UN mandate runs out at the end of this year. </p> <p>\"The Americans are currently in detailed discussions. As that concludes, as I hope it will very shortly, we will then secure our own arrangements,\" he said. </p> <p>\"I think that will be very important because it will be a further demonstration that actually the troops are no longer here at the behest of the UN. It is an explicit agreement that's been negotiated and agreed with the Iraqi government and a further indication that the Iraqis are transforming their situation and becoming a more mature democracy and government ... </p> <p>\"What is critical is that in the next few days and weeks we resolve the issue, because were we to reach the end of the year and had to roll over the UN mandate, I think that would send out an unfortunate message that would undermine the genuine progress that is being made in taking Iraq forward and the Iraqis increasingly taking on their own responsibility in terms of governance.\" </p> <p>The foreign minister said that he expected there to be no difference to the US approach to obtaining a Status of Forces Agreement for their own troops whether Barack Obama or John McCain won the November 4 presidential election. </p> <p>And he restated Gordon Brown's July prediction that next year would see a \"fundamental change of mission\" for British troops in Iraq.<br> Nouri al-Maliki, the Iraqi prime minister, was yesterday quoted as saying that Britain's military presence in Basra was \"not necessary for maintaining security and control\", though he added that there might be a need for their experience in training. </p> <p>Rammell said Maliki's comments acknowledged the shift that had taken place over the last year whereby British troops had moved from a combat role to one based much more on training and mentoring.</p> <p>British troops had trained 20,000 Iraqi troops, which had helped the Iraqis to secure their own situation.<br> Rammell said: \"As a result of that kind of initiative, the security situation in Basra has transformed in recent months. </p> <p>\"Our forces are concluding their task, so at that point we do expect in 2009 a fundamental change in mission as we make the transformation to a long-term civilian-led future relationship with Iraq ... </p> <p>\"I think we will be able to do that really fundamental shift from a combat role to training and mentoring because we are - despite some continuing difficulties - seeing a huge and positive change in Iraq.\"</p> <p>He said violence was at the lowest levels since early 2004, Iraqi forces were in charge of 11 out of 18 provinces, an election law recently passed would hopefully in a short time lead to provincial elections, and there was much stronger engagement from Arab neighbours of Iraq.</p>",
  "<p>It's a boy - at least according to powerful hints from the teenage father of Sarah Palin's first grandchild.</p> <p>In his first interview since his romance and pregnancy with Palin's daughter, Bristol, 17, almost overnight made him a topic in the presidential campaign, Levi Johnston, 18, yesterday held forth on fatherhood and relationships.</p> <p>\"I'm looking forward to having him,\" Johnston told the Associated Press in an interview conducted outside his home in Wasilla, Alaska. </p> <p>\"I'm going to take him hunting and fishing. He'll be everywhere with me,\" Johnston said.</p> <p>Johnston, an avid hunter who spoke to the AP from a front yard strewn with caribou and elk antlers, did not discuss baby names.</p> <p>He also said he liked Barack Obama, although he hoped his future mother-in-law's campaign was successful. However Johnston will not be called upon to put his loyalties to the test in this election. He apparently did not register in time to vote, according to the local elections office.</p> <p>The Palin-Johnston baby is due on December 18, the most high profile teenage pregnancy in America.</p> <p>Its disclosure, after Palin emerged as the surprising pick for the vice-presidential nomination and on the eve of the Republican convention in September, briefly turned Johnston from a hockey playing local heart throb and high school drop out into a minor celebrity.</p> <p>Given Palin's sudden celebrity and her well-known evangelical leanings, including opposition to sex education and abortion, the pregnancy became immediate tabloid fodder.</p> <p>Johnston was caught up in the swirl. He was on the tarmac to welcome John McCain when the Republican presidential nominee arrived at the convention in St Paul. McCain made a point of lingering with the couple, and Johnston was hauled out in front of tens of thousands of Republican activists when Palin delivered her speech.</p> <p>Johnston's Facebook page, in which he claimed to be a redneck who never wanted children, was dissected. So was his high school hockey career, and his decision to leave school with graduating to get a job as an apprentice electrician on Alaska's oil fields.</p> <p>There were reports that he was being forced into marriage.</p> <p>\"None of that's true,\" he said yesterday. \"We both love each other. We both want to marry each other. And that's what we are going to do.\"</p> <p>He said the couple had been dating for three years. \"We were planning on getting married a long time ago with or without the kid,\" he said. \"That was the plan from the start.\"</p> <p>The wedding will now take place next summer.</p>"

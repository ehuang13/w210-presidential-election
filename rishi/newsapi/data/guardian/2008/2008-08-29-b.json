  "<p>His enemies had mocked him as a celebrity, a self-styled messiah, a would-be emperor, puffed up on his own rhetoric and grandiosity. But by the time Barack Obama had completed his speech to an ecstatic crowd of 84,000 in Denver's huge Invesco Field football stadium, he looked like something else entirely: a plausible President of the United States. </p> <p>By relocating the Democratic national convention to an outdoor arena, he had chosen a setting that would have overwhelmed most speakers. But Obama had no such trouble. He emerged soon after sunset, the night sky lit up by floodlights, a thousand popping flashbulbs and that billion-dollar smile projected on the enormous TV screens. For most in the stadium, he was no more than a pencil line on the stage, a slight, skinny man standing alone. Yet when he uttered the words: \"I accept your nomination for the presidency of the United States,\" he caused an eruption, a long, sustained roll of human thunder. </p> <p>He had barely started but, all around, the tears were flowing - whether from Oprah Winfrey in the VIP area or the flag-waving party activists four tiers up in the sky. Many saw fate's hand in anointing the first African-American presidential nominee on the anniversary - to the day - of the moment in 1963 when Martin Luther King stood on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial and told the world he had a dream, of an America where black and white would at last live together as equals.</p> <p>Obama brought them to hush. Behind him a stage set, mocked by the Republicans as looking like a Greek temple suited to Obama's imperial pretensions, glowed with warm amber light. </p> <p>His voice filled the stadium, holding everyone rapt. No one doubted that Obama had the oratorical gifts to make a fine, soaring speech. The advance pressure on him was of a different kind. He had specific, earthier tasks to accomplish - and so, methodically he set to work. </p> <p>First, he needed to show there was policy substance behind the inspiring talk.</p> <p>He did that, promising to cut taxes for \"95% of working families\". He would make college affordable to all those who undertook national service. He would invest $150bn (\u00a382bn) over 10 years in renewable energy. And he made a promise: to wean the US off its dependence on \"Middle East oil\" in 10 years. </p> <p>Still, this was no laundry list of programmes and policies. Obama rested it all first on the clear premise that America's economy is ailing and, more striking, on an unabashed case for the role of government itself. \"Government cannot solve all our problems,\" he said, \"but what it should do is that which we cannot do for ourselves.\" He went on: \"That's the promise of America ... the fundamental belief that I am my brother's keeper; I am my sister's keeper.\"</p> <p>Obama had a second, related task on Thursday. His critics had said he was too aloof, too remote from the workaday concerns of ordinary Americans currently feeling the squeeze. He needed to show, as Bill Clinton once did, that he could feel their pain. He did that effectively, binding his own life story to those of the most vulnerable Americans. He said that in the faces of the young veterans returning from Iraq and Afghanistan he saw his grandfather who had \"marched in Patton's army\". When he saw those working the night shift, he thought of his mother, who had brought up her children alone and once had to turn to the state support of food stamps. When he met workers laid off, he recalled those he had fought for as a community organiser in the deprived South Side of Chicago. </p> <p>It was a skilful passage, making himself indivisible from the very people with whom he has struggled to connect and whom he must win over in November. He rounded it off with a masterful line, designed to puncture what has proved to be one of the McCain camp's most effective attacks on him: that his star power puts him in the world of Paris Hilton and Britney Spears, out of reach of most Americans. Obama said sharply: \"I don't know what kind of lives John McCain thinks that celebrities lead, but this has been mine.\" </p> <p>There was a third doubt Obama needed to lay to rest. Does he have the toughness, the steel to take on and defeat the notoriously vicious attack machine that has seen the Republicans win all but three of the last 10 presidential elections?</p> <p>Obama left no doubt. He dared attack McCain in his strongest area: national security. He launched into a devastating critique of the Bush administration, casting McCain as nothing more than a loyal echo for its fatal combination of \"tough talk and bad strategy\". </p> <p>He lectured him on folly after folly: \"You don't defeat a terrorist network that operates in 80 countries by occupying Iraq.\" He said Bush's decision to switch the focus from Afghanistan to Iraq had let the real culprits of 9/11 slip out of America's sights. \"John McCain likes to say that he'll follow Osama bin Laden to the Gates of Hell - but he won't even go to the cave where he lives.\"</p> <p>That was delivered with a hint of aggression not many had seen before. But it was as nothing next to the moment when he truly threw down the gauntlet, declaring: \"If John McCain wants to have a debate about who has the temperament and judgment to serve as the next commander-in-chief, that's a debate I'm ready to have.\"</p> <p>One former Democratic speechwriter used to say: \"There is a subtext of male violence to American politics.\" He meant that presidential candidates have to signal a kind of gladiatorial toughness, a readiness to stand up and throw a punch. Obama did that in that line, not least by daring to raise what has been much talked about in Washington circles but not raised explicitly: the question of McCain's emotional and mental balance. </p> <p>It ended with a passage alluding to King's speech of 45 years ago. \"We cannot walk alone,\" he said. The response was rapturous, of course. It was the delight of a party that had witnessed a historic breakthrough, but something more exciting still: an extraordinarily gifted man demonstrating the fundamental seriousness to serve in the highest office in the land.</p> <h2>What the papers said</h2> <p>One test of a presidential candidate's strength, and often his best shot at winning, is how much he can mould his party in his image and rally it around a powerful argument for his election. Barack Obama left Denver having made significant progress on both fronts.<br><strong>New York Times </strong></p> <p>Mr Obama ended his speech last night with a stirring reprise of his call to end old-style politics ... Mr Obama presented a pretty clear view of where he would lead the nation.<br><strong>Washington Post </strong></p> <p>In recent weeks, the echoing criticism of Barack Obama has been that he is perceived by many as intellectual and aloof - not just someone who might bring a knife to a gunfight, as the cliche goes, but arrive unarmed and try to talk his way through it. Thursday night, accepting his nominating for the presidency, Obama pulled out his rhetorical revolver.<br><strong>USA Today</strong></p>",
  "<video data-media-id=\"gu-video-337128463\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\">  </video>   <p>John McCain took the biggest gamble of his campaign so far when he yesterday chose as his running mate Sarah Palin, the relatively unknown and inexperienced governor of Alaska, in the hope of reaching out to women voters.</p> <p>Introduced by McCain at a rally in Dayton, Ohio, Palin made a direct appeal to supporters of Hillary Clinton still upset over her defeat by Barack Obama, praising Clinton for her \"determination and grace\" in the nomination battle.</p> <p>Palin's place on the ticket means the November 4 election will produce either the first African-American president or the first female vice-president.</p> <p>She was a surprise choice, with even senior Republicans confessing on television yesterday that they had never met her or knew much about her. Before becoming governor, she had been mayor of the Alaskan town of Wasilla, with a population of 9,000.</p> <p>At the rally, McCain, who celebrated his 72nd birthday yesterday, lauded her as reformer and Washington outsider. Explaining why he had picked her over established politicians, he said: \"I have been looking for a running mate that will shake up Washington.\"</p> <p>He also hopes to win over women voters, noting that her appointment coincided with this week's anniversary of American women being given the vote.</p> <p>Palin, only the second woman to be a vice-presidential candidate - Geraldine Ferraro was on the Democratic ticket in 1984 - noted that Clinton had received 18 million votes in the Democratic nomination fight and that Clinton had characterised this as putting 18 million cracks in the ceiling that limits women's options.</p> <p>Palin said the women of America were not finished yet and \"we can shatter the glass ceiling once and for all\".</p> <p>Aged 44 and describing herself as a \"hockey mom\", she is a social conservative who will help offset suspicions of traditional Republicans over McCain because of his maverick behaviour.</p> <p>McCain's choice allowed him to wrest media attention from Obama, whose speech in front of a crowd of 80,000 in Denver on Thursday night is believed to be the most watched convention speech ever. Nielsen Media Research said it averaged 38.4 million US viewers across all major networks, reaching nearly a quarter of all US households. It easily eclipsed the acceptance speeches of both of Obama's two immediate Democratic predecessors and the 27.6 million viewers George Bush drew on the fourth night of the Republican national convention in 2004, when he was nominated for a second term. </p> <p>Obama's team seized on Palin's lack of experience. Bill Burton, a campaign spokesman, said: \"John McCain put the former mayor of a town of 9,000 with zero foreign policy a heartbeat away from the presidency.\"</p> <p>Her appointment undercuts one of the main charges of McCain against Obama: that he lacks experience to be president.</p> <p>McCain could be disappointed in his hopes of winning over disenchanted Democratic women. Among socially conservative views held by Palin that many Democrats would find unattractive is her strong anti-abortion position.</p> <p>The choice of Palin was kept a secret until only hours before the rally. She had briefly surfaced as a potential candidate about a month ago and then disappeared, in part because of an investigation under way in Alaska.</p> <p>Speculation was revived early yesterday when a staff worker at the airport in Dayton reported that a plane, owned by a wealthy supporter, had flown in from Anchorage, Alaska.</p> <p>McCain opted against the names that have been on the shortlist over the last few months: Mitt Romney, the former governor of Massachusetts and wealthy businessman; Joe Lieberman, the former Democratic senator and now an independent; and Tim Pawlenty, governor of Minnesota.</p> <p>There was puzzlement among senior Republicans over his choice.</p> <p>Kay Bailey Hutchison, the Texas senator who had been on McCain's shortlist, expressed support for her in a CNN interview but had to admit: \"I do not know too much about her. But maybe that is good news.\"</p> <p>McCain heads to the Republican convention scheduled to start in Minneapolis-St Paul on Monday. But organisers said the opening might have to be delayed by a day or two, if there is widespread devastation in the Gulf coast states from Tropical Storm Gustav.</p> <p>Bush is due to join McCain on the platform on Monday but the White House said that he might instead have to go to the Gulf states.</p>",
  "<p>There he goes again. John McCain went out and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/aug/29/uselections2008.johnmccain1\">found himself a vice-presidential candidate</a> today, but as is often his way, he made sure that political gain was his master, while potential to lead this nation during troubled times was placed on the back burner.</p> <p>And he accuses Barack Obama of \"not putting his country first\"? </p> <p>McCain's choice was governor Sarah Palin of Alaska, a former mayor of a town the size of the building where I grew up in New York. More recently, she has been <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/29/johnmccain.uselections2008\">performing her gubernatorial duties</a> for an entire 1.5 years since her election in November of 2006. In other words, compared to her, when it comes to foreign policy experience, Obama is practically Napoleon.</p> <p>Meanwhile, she is what you might call a bit slow on the uptake. When asked on CNBC's talkshow Kudlow &amp; Co about some of the vice-presidential speculation surrounding her only a month ago, <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0808/12969.html\">Palin's reaction</a> really speaks for itself:</p> <p>\"But as for that VP talk all the time, I'll tell ya, I still can't answer that question until somebody answers for me, what is it exactly that the VP does every day?\"</p> <p>Perhaps the vice-president, unlike Palin, might spend part of their day worrying about what to do about global warming rather than denying it, as she has.</p> <p>Making matters worse, Palin is currently <a href=\"http://thinkprogress.org/2008/08/29/palin-corruption-investigation/\">under investigation</a> for pressuring Alaska's former public safety commissioner, Walt Monegan, to fire her former brother-in-law Mike Wooten from his job as a state trooper. Her sister was embroiled in a nasty divorce with Wooten, and when Monegan didn't investigate, he was fired from his job. Palin denied any involvement at first, yet has since <a href=\"http://www.adn.com/monegan/story/492964.html\">admitted that staff members contacted Monegan</a> about this matter. But she, of course, new nothing about it.</p> <p>The Alaska legislature, apparently filled with sentient beings, took that denial as seriously as you probably just did, and decided to <a href=\"http://www.adn.com/monegan/story/494556.html\">hire an independent investigator</a>.</p> <p>It is clear why McCain made this choice. He is hoping to win over still-angry Hillary Clinton supporters and other independent women, although when these women become aware of the fact that she believes abortion should be outlawed, voted for \u00fcber-right-wing commentator Pat Buchanan for president in 2000 and recently called senator Clinton a \"whiner\", well, many women may conclude that she just doesn't quite speak for them. </p> <p>They might also worry, like the rest of us, about a female Dan Quayle being a heartbeat away from the presidency. John McCain just turned 72 today (happy birthday senator!) and has had skin cancer.</p> <p>In the end, this is one more example of the real John McCain. He was against tax cuts for the wealthy before he was for them. He was against offshore oil drilling before he was for it. And he was against \"risking\" putting someone as untested as Obama in the White House, until he chose to put someone with the experience of Dudley Moore in the West Wing.</p>",
  "<h2>Mitt Romney</h2> <p>Had Mitt Romney been picked, it would've been akin to Barack Obama choosing Hillary Clinton for his running mate. Romney, former governor of Massachusetts, was McCain's chief rival for the Republican nomination, and as such spent several months savaging the Arizona senator in debates and in the press. He bowed out of the race in February and spent the ensuing months currying favour with conservatives.</p> <p>The scion of a prominent Michigan political family \u2013 his father was governor of the state \u2013 Romney spent his early adulthood as a Mormon missionary in France. He was heralded for his management of the 2002 winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, and grew extremely wealthy as a venture capitalist. Elected governor of Massachusetts in 2002, he governed as a moderate \u2013 necessary in that liberal state.</p> <p>Romney is acclaimed for his business acumen and can speak fluently on the economy \u2013 an admitted weakness for McCain. His ties to Michigan may have helped win that crucial swing state, which has not voted Republican since 1988.</p> <p>But in the wake of McCain's \"houses\" gaffe \u2013 the senator was unable to tell a reporter how many homes he and his wife, heiress to a beer distributing company, own \u2013 the Republican party may have been reluctant to present a ticket with two extremely wealthy men. Romney is also perceived as unfriendly to workers, having presided over layoffs during his tenure in the private sector.</p> <p>Another strike against Romney is his Mormon faith. The evangelical Christian faction of the Republican party, powerful in recent years, already distrusts McCain.</p> <p>Some conservatives remain distrustful of Romney's commitment to social conservative fundamentals like opposition to abortion rights and gay rights. Massachusetts is one of the most liberal states in the union, and during the Republican primary, Romney was criticised for backing a universal healthcare programme in the state during his tenure as governor.</p> <h2>Tim Pawlenty</h2> <p>Minnesota governor Tim Pawlenty's staid reputation and uncharismatic manner mask a self-deprecating sense of humour: in spring, he praised his wife's willingness to watch hockey games with him, but said 'Now, if I could only get her to have sex with me.'\"</p> <p>Crass jokes aside, Pawlenty had many attributes favourable among the Republican base: long-time attendance at an evangelical church, consistent conservative stances on social issues, and opposition to tax increases. He also has the blue-collar background much sought after among American politicians. That presents a marked contrast to McCain, the son and grandson of admirals. </p> <p>At 47, his relative youth would have provided a needed contrast to McCain's advanced age, and he is fresh on the national scene. Minnesota has not voted for a Republican presidential candidate in recent memory, but in 2004 chose Democrat John Kerry by 51% to 48%. </p> <p>Pawlenty was first elected governor in 2002. He won re-election in 2006 by a narrow margin, leading national Republicans to question his popularity in his home state. Also, he is an unproven debater, while Joe Biden, Barack Obama's running mate, is skilled and experienced.</p> <h2>Joseph Lieberman</h2> <p>This Connecticut senator would have surely shaken things up in the race. He is a career-long Democrat who split with the party in 2006 over the Iraq war, and he is an orthodox Jew. But he is well used to the rigours of a vice-presidential campaign, having run alongside Democrat Al Gore in 2000 and come within a hair's breadth of the White House. Lieberman and McCain also enjoy a friendly personal relationship and the two have travelled together extensively. </p> <p>A McCain-Lieberman ticket would've also blunted one of the Democrats' major campaign themes \u2013 that the Republican party failed the nation in eight years in power and it is time to replace them.</p> <p>But the Connecticut senator had several major drawbacks. For one, many Republicans simply won't trust a former Democrat on the ticket and would be unenthusiastic. An independent senator, Lieberman votes with the Democrats on most issues and has amassed a moderate voting record. Also, as a supporter of abortion rights and an orthodox Jew, he could have clashed with social conservative voters.</p> <p>A former state attorney general, Lieberman was first elected to the senate in 1988. He won re-election in 2006 as an independent after being defeated in the Democratic primary by an antiwar candidate.</p> <h2>Eric Cantor</h2> <p>This young Virginia congressman took part in early August in a conference call with reporters to attack Barack Obama's energy plan, leading to speculation he was auditioning to be McCain's running mate.</p> <p>At 45, Cantor is relatively inexperienced, first winning election to the US House of Representatives in 2000. But he could've added much-needed youth to the Republican ticket, and he is good looking and would have been presented as a Washington outsider.</p> <h2>Tom Ridge</h2> <p>The former Pennsylvania governor may have helped deliver that key swing state and as the first secretary of homeland security under President George Bush, can claim national security credentials. Ridge was a US congressman from 1983 to 1995, then served six years as governor of Pennsylvania before moving to Washington to be a homeland security adviser.</p> <p>But Ridge is a supporter of abortion rights. Conservative leaders have warned that Ridge on the ticket would've been disastrous for McCain's chances in the fall, as anti-abortion Republicans would be inclined to stay home instead of rally for the candidate.</p>",
  "<p>With the nomination of its governor, Sarah Palin, as the Republican vice-presidential candidate, the quiet state of Alaska is suddenly at the centre of media attention.</p> <p>The state likes to think of itself as the last frontier and prides itself on its natural beauty, particularly its mountain ranges with exotic names such as Talkeetna, Aleutian and Tordrillo.</p> <p>It boasts 100,000 glaciers, more than 600 of them named. The Malaspina glacier is larger than the small north-eastern US state of Rhode Island. Another, the Nebesna glacier, is 80 miles long. There are 17 national parks, and Wrangell-St Elias is America's largest at more than 13.2m acres.</p> <p>In a state that likes to crow about the biggest this and the highest that, it is fitting that the world's biggest salmon \u2013 97lb 4oz \u2013 and the world's biggest halibut \u2013 459lb - were caught in Alaska. </p> <p>The state's pristine wilderness explains the uproar that ensued when the Exxon Valdez tanker struck a reef and spilled millions of gallons into the Gulf of Alaska in one of America's largest environmental disasters.</p> <p>One of America's most protracted environmental battles happens to be raging in northern Alaska. Since 1977, environmentalists have been fighting the oil industry over whether there should be oil exploration in the <a href=\"http://arctic.fws.gov/\">Arctic National Wildlife Refuge</a>. </p> <p>George Bush tried unsuccessfully to overturn a ban on drilling in the refuge. Both presidential candidates, John McCain and Barack Obama, oppose oil exploration in the refuge. Obama, though, does support an Alaska natural gas pipeline.</p> <p>Politically, Alaska, which the US bought from Russia in 1876 for $7.2m, is a pygmy. Because of its tiny population of just over 670,000, the state has just three electoral votes \u2013 half the number of Delaware, home to Joe Biden, the Democratic vice-presidential candidate. Firmly in the Republican camp, Alaska last elected a Democrat to Congress in 1974. </p> <p>The last time Alaska went Democratic in a presidential election was in 1976, when Jimmy Carter won office. In the 2004 election, George Bush easily took Alaska, winning 61% of the vote while John Kerry took 36%.</p>",
  "<video data-media-id=\"gu-video-337128463\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\">  </video>   <p>Republican presidential nominee John McCain today selected Alaska governor Sarah Palin, a relative political novice, as his vice-presidential running mate. </p> <p>The move is a bold play for the potentially millions of disaffected Hillary Clinton supporters who yearn to vote for a woman candidate in the November election and who have remained impervious to Democratic pleas for party unity.</p> <p>McCain introduced Palin at a rally in Dayton, Ohio before a crowd of 15,000. He praised her as a woman of \"strong principles, fighting spirit and deep compassion\".</p> <p>\"She's got the grit, integrity, common sense and fierce devotion to the common good that is exactly what we need in Washington today,\" McCain said.</p> <p>Palin appeared confident and enthusiastic in her first appearance on the national stage. She took the podium alongside her husband Todd, a member of the steelworkers union, and said the two celebrate their 20th wedding anniversary today.</p> <p>\"I had promised my husband a little present for our anniversary, and I hope he can see I delivered,\" she said, to raucous laughter and cheers.</p> <p>She thanked McCain, and after a few words about herself turned her talk back to the senator.</p> <p>\"This is a moment when great causes can be won and great problems can be overcome,\" she said. \"In a dangerous world, it is John McCain who can lead America's friends and allies in preventing Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons.\"</p> <p>She was effusive in her praise for Hillary Clinton, claiming for herself the groundbreaking role Clinton played during the Democratic primary race. \"It turns out the women of America aren't finished yet,\" Palin said. \"We can shatter that glass ceiling once and for all.\"</p> <p>The announcement came the morning after Barack Obama's well-received address on the final day of the Democratic convention, a transparent effort to keep pundits from discussing Obama. </p> <p>Texas senator Kay Bailey Hutchinson, one of the senior women in the US Senate, praised Palin as \"a breath of fresh air\".</p> <p>\"They wanted to show that they are independent and that they are the agents of change and they have gone outside the [Washington area] to do it,\" she told MSNBC television. \"Of course there's a risk, and I think John McCain assessed that risk\".</p> <p>Conservative activists today applauded the pick.</p> <p>David Keene, chairman of the American conservative union, said the selection is \"great news for conservatives\".</p> <p>\"Her dedication to principle, her courage both before and after her election as governor of Alaska and her personal qualities make her a perfect choice for vice-president,\" he said. </p> <p>\"Any conservatives who have been lukewarm thus far in their support of the McCain candidacy will work their hearts out between now and November for the McCain-Palin ticket.\"</p> <p>The conservative Washington anti-tax group Club for Growth was quick to praise Palin, lauding her \"fiscal responsibility\" and opposition to the use of public money on a notorious bridge project in an empty quarter of Alaska.</p> <p>\"At a time when many Republicans are still clinging to pork-barrel politics, Governor Palin has quickly become a leader on this issue,\" said Club for Growth President Pat Toomey. \"She is a principled reformer who understands how badly wasteful spending has marred the Republican brand.\"</p> <p>Barack Obama spokesman Bill Burton mocked the selection and noted Palin's anti-abortion stance.</p> <p>\"Today, John McCain put the former mayor of a town of 9,000 with zero foreign policy experience a heartbeat away from the presidency,\" he said. \"Governor Palin shares John McCain's commitment to overturning Roe v Wade, the agenda of big oil and continuing George Bush's failed economic policies - that's not the change we need, it's just more of the same\".</p> <p>Palin's selection is sure to excite the news media and thrill voters at the prospect that the next administration will feature either the first female vice-president or African-American president.</p> <p>As unexpected and unusual as Palin's selection is, she is not the first woman to stand for vice-president. That was Geraldine Ferraro, a New York congresswoman who in 1984 ran alongside Democratic presidential nominee Walter Mondale.</p> <p>Palin, 44, is Alaska's first female governor. She was sworn in December 2006, making her one of the least experienced people to run for vice-president in recent memory. Alaska is one of the smallest states in the US, with only 670,000 residents.</p> <p>Before becoming governor, Palin served two terms as mayor of Wasilla, Alaska, a town of 9,800 people, and was on the city's council before that. In the 2006 Alaska gubernatorial race, Palin bested the incumbent Republican governor during the primary election.</p> <p>In recent days, McCain personally interviewed Palin at his ranch in Sedona, Arizona.</p> <p>In selecting a decidedly unconventional running mate, McCain passed over establishment favourites Minnesota governor Tim Pawlenty and former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney.</p> <p>Palin will have to face Democratic vice-presidential nominee Joe Biden in a televised debate September 2 in St Louis, Missouri. </p> <p>Biden, a Delaware senator, is known as a skilled and tactful debater, and is a foreign policy expert, chairing the Senate foreign relations committee. Obama announced his selection of Biden last weekend.</p> <p>The Democrats will raise questions whether Palin passes the \"commander-in-chief test\", that is, will Palin be able to assume the presidency should McCain, who has suffered skin cancer, become incapacitated. </p> <p>The announcement was eagerly anticipated among Republicans, who travel this weekend to St Paul, Minnesota, for their national convention, which kicks off on Monday. Palin is to address the convention on Wednesday, and will likely launch blistering attacks on Obama.</p> <p>Today is John McCain's 72nd birthday, and the youthful Palin is a welcome contrast. She is three years younger than Obama. In addition, she was a runner-up to the Miss Alaska beauty pageant.</p> <p>She would present a new face unfamiliar to most of the country and would stir up the race.</p> <p>Palin would be a youthful addition to the ticket. She brings several characteristics sure to encourage the Republican base, such as her opposition to abortion rights and her support of expanded drilling in the Alaska National Wildlife Refuge.</p> <p>However, she also brings several risks. She has been in office less than two years, and will be hard pressed to go toe-to-toe in debate with Biden.</p> <p>The news media may also seek to tie Palin to longtime Alaska Republican senator Ted Stevens, who is soon to stand trial on corruption charges. </p> <p>In the Alaska capital, Juneau, Palin is under her own ethics cloud: The Alaska legislature is investigating whether Palin sacked a public safety commissioner who declined to fire a state trooper that was engaged in a custody battle with Palin's sister.</p>",
  "<p>Picking the Alaska governor is a bold play from John McCain for the potentially millions of disaffected Hillary Clinton voters who have remained impervious to Democrats' pleas for party unity.

Lieberman and McCain enjoy a friendly personal relationship and the two have travelled together extensively. </p> <p>He is well used to the rigours of a vice-presidential campaign, having run alongside Democrat Al Gore in 2000 and come within a hair's breadth of the White House. </p> <p>But he brought several major drawbacks. For one, many Republicans simply would not have trusted or been enthusiastic about having a former Democrat on the ticket. An independent senator, Lieberman votes with the Democrats on most issues and has amassed a moderate voting record. Also, he is a supporter of abortion rights, and is an orthodox Jew, both sure to have troubled socially conservative voters. It was also unlikely that Lieberman could have delivered his home state for the Republicans. </p> <p><strong>Eric Cantor</strong></p> <p>This young Virginia congressman took part in early August in a conference call with reporters to attack Barack Obama's energy plan, leading to speculation that he was auditioning to be McCain's running mate.</p> <p><strong>Tom Ridge</strong></p> <p>The former Pennsylvania governor and the first secretary of homeland security under George Bush was able to claim national security credentials. But as a supporter of abortion rights, conservative leaders warned that Ridge having on the ticket could have been disastrous for McCain's chances, as anti-abortion Republicans would have been inclined to stay at home instead of rallying for the candidate.</p>",
  "<p>Opposition to Russia's recognition of the breakaway regions of South Ossetia and Abkhazia has been almost universal, even among its friends and allies. The G7 nations have accused Moscow of breaking international law. The EU is considering sanctions. And, most significantly, China has failed to endorse Russia's actions.</p> <h2>What are the Chinese saying and why?</h2> <p>At the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation summit in Tajikistan, which brought together Russia, China, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan and Tajikistan, a final statement gave the Kremlin little comfort: \"We express grave concern in connection with the recent tensions around the South Ossetian issue and urge the sides to solve existing problems peacefully, through dialogue, and to make efforts facilitating reconciliation and talks.\"</p> <p>Analysts say China wants to avoid any anti-western gestures and, with its own restive ethnic minorities, showing any support for separatism.</p> <h2>How has Russia reacted to the criticism?</h2> <p>Defiantly. The prime minister, Vladimir Putin, went on CNN to accuse the US of provoking the conflict by arming the Georgian army, and suggested that this was part of an <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/aug/29/russia.georgia\">election ploy</a> to help the Republican presidential candidate, John McCain, in his campaign for the White House. \"Russia does not feel isolated and is not afraid to be isolated,\" said the Russian ambassador in Brussels.</p> <h2>What could happen next?</h2> <p>The first significant development will be at the emergency summit of the EU on Monday, when discussion of sanctions will be on the table. These could include a visa ban on officials from the breakaway regions, a ban on Russian property investment in Europe or the postponement of new partnership accord talks between Moscow and the EU, which are scheduled for September 15. </p> <h2>Will the EU go that far?</h2> <p>While some of the former Soviet countries have pushed for a firm response, others such as Germany, Italy and France \u2013 which brokered the peace plan \u2013 want to keep lines of communication open and constructive. There will be more condemnation of Russia's \"illegitimate\" action and moves to provide humanitarian aid to Georgia. </p> <h2>What of the speech by the British foreign secretary, David Miliband, in Ukraine about building a \"coalition against Russian aggression\"?</h2> <p>It has not been well received, particularly because many Ukrainians have no wish to join Nato. They do want to join the EU, which has yet to give a pledge of future membership. The Financial Times commented in an <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/f4a72d5e-752e-11dd-ab30-0000779fd18c.html\">editorial</a> today: \"Brussels must now summon up the courage to offer a positive response.\"</p>",
  "<p>On a warm evening in Denver, 45 years to the day since Martin Luther King delivered his I Have A Dream speech, Barack Obama accepted the Democratic presidential nomination before a crowd of almost 80,000 people, telling them: \"America, we cannot turn back. Not with so much work to be done.\" And yet despite the drama of the occasion - the vast stadium in which he delivered the speech, the firework display, the elated and weeping onlookers - Obama's task was to talk policy: to demonstrate that there was substance behind the rhetoric. As <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/aug/29/uselections2008.democrats20082\">Ewen MacAskill and Suzanne Goldenberg write today's on Guardian.co.uk</a>, Obama allied his soaring oratory to long passages on how he would deal with America's ailing economy, offering a programme of education, health and energy reforms, allied to job creation and tax cuts. </p> <p>Answering supporters who had bemoaned his apparent unwillingness to make tough criticisms of George Bush and John McCain, he launched stinging attacks on both, telling spectators: \"America, we are better than these last eight years. We are a better country than this ... Tonight, I say to the American people, to Democrats and Republicans and Independents across this great land - enough!\"</p> <p>It had been rumoured that John McCain would seek to steal some of Obama's thunder by announcing his vice-presidential pick just before the speech; later, it was reported that he planned to release a television ad last night that would seek to undermine his rival. Instead, he made no VP announcement \u2014 he's expected to do so today \u2014 and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/aug/29/uselections2008.johnmccain\">the message of the ad turned out to be rather different</a>.\"Senator Obama, this is truly a good day for America,\" he is shown saying. \"Too often the achievements of our opponents go unnoticed. So I wanted to stop and say, congratulations. How perfect that your nomination would come on this historic day. Tomorrow, we'll be back at it. But tonight, Senator, job well done.\" </p> <h2>Next week: the Republicans in Minnesota, or not</h2> <p>McCain's party is due to hold its nomination gathering in St Paul, Minnesota, next week, in a four-day event that will include an awkward appearance by George Bush. But yesterday the McCain campaign unexpectedly announced that they were considering postponing the convention because of Tropical Storm Gustav, which is approaching hurricane strength as it nears America's Gulf Coast. The reason, essentially, is public relations: images of Republicans celebrating while storms ravaged New Orleans and environs would be disastrous for McCain.</p> <h2>On theguardian.com now</h2> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2008/aug/29/barack.obama.acceptance.speech\">Video: Obama says it is 'time to change America'</a></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/michaeltomasky/2008/aug/29/barackobama.democrats2008\">Michael Tomasky: Just the right speech</a></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/aug/29/uselections2008.democrats20083\">Carnival spirit in Mile High Stadium</a></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2008/aug/28/uselections2008.barackobama?picture=337053946\">In pictures: The last day of the convention</a><br><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/oliverburkemanblog/2008/aug/29/uselections2008.barackobama\">Oliver Burkeman's Denver speech liveblog</a></p> <h2>Best of the rest</h2> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0Fru4dZLGA\">MSNBC: Conservative commentator Pat Buchanan reads out - to cheers - his favourite Obama quote</a></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/29/us/politics/29dems.html?hp\">New York Times: Obama takes aim at Bush and McCain with forceful call to change</a></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/08/28/AR2008082802853.html\">Washington Post: So many miles from Selma</a></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/news/politics/la-na-bertha29-2008aug29,0,915235.story\">LA Times: 88-year-old civil rights activist watches Obama speech</a></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/blogs/blogs/xxfactor/archive/2008/08/28/i-have-a-plan.aspx\">Slate: Obama gives his I Have A Plan speech</a></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"http://www.campaignsandelections.com/stories/?StoryID=0CED766B-1422-17E0-F8E222CAF01C0F93\">Campaigns and Elections: Two speechwriters, two views on Obama's speech</a></p> <h2>Latest polls</h2> <p>Obama received a small but significant \"convention bounce\", according to Gallup's daily tracking poll, which gave the Illinois senator 48% to John McCain's 42%.

  "<p><a href=\"http://www.cityofclovis.org/\">Clovis</a> is a stone's throw over New Mexico's border from Texas. It has just over 40,000 people, which makes it the great metropolis of this corner of the state. If you're heading west, you have to drive 200 miles to Albuquerque to come to the next city of that size in New Mexico. This is high-plains country, geographically more similar to the Texas panhandle just to its east than to the epic desert landscape to the west. Like the places I've <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/28/uselections2008.useconomy\">written about</a>, it's a poor part of America, with an increasing number of struggling, hardscrabble farm in the outlying areas.</p> <p>New Mexico is one of several newly politically competitive states in the mountain and desert west. CNN reported that <a href=\"http://www.santafenewmexican.com/Local%20News/Poll--Obama-up-by-13-points-in-N-M-\">Obama is leading McCain in the state by 13%</a>. Like neighbouring Colorado, and McCain's home state of Arizona, it's a state that had Republican state leadership when Bush won the presidency in 2000 and that has seen its governors and other top positions go Democratic in the years since. Voters out here haven't voted Democratic because of any sudden enthusiasm for higher taxes and the other bug-bears rightly or wrongly associated with national Democrats. At least in part, the region has gone Democrat because, unlike the Oklahoma Panhandle communities I drove through earlier this week, its live-and-let-live population has come to loathe the authoritarian strain of thinking the Bush-Cheney team represents and deeply distrusts the direction government has taken since 2000.</p> <p>A few years back, one-time Colorado Senator and presidential hopeful Gary Hart <a href=\"http://www.westerndemocrat.com/files/GaryHart-DemocratsandtheWest.pdf\">penned a memo</a> to the Democratic Party's leaders arguing the West was ripe for picking and calling on his party to adopt a Western strategy. Choosing Denver to host the convention was a part of this strategy, as was inviting New Mexico governor Bill Richardson onto the stadium platform a couple hours before Obama's speech tonight. (He gave a powerful, emotionally charged speech, far better than that delivered by Al Gore immediately after.) If the Democrats win the west on the tails of popular governors like Richardson and Arizona's Janet Napolitano, they can afford to lose a couple of battleground states in the Midwest and still come out victorious. </p> <p>I figured I would drive into Clovis and find a bar or restaurant at which to watch the Obama speech and talk to people about their reactions. It wouldn't be hard \u2013 surely every television set in America would be tuned in to watch. </p> <p>But, as they say about the best laid plan. In a town with numerous restaurants and bars, not a single one was showing the speech. Some had no televisions; others did have TVs, but they were tuned to one or another sports channel and the owners and bar-tenders were damned if they were going to change channel for the convention. One waitress embarrassedly told me the owners had forbidden the staff to put on anything \"political\" on the television. I even phoned several restaurants to find out if they'd tune their TVs to the convention. To a person, the answer was an incredulous \"no.\"</p> <p>So, I watched the speech in my hotel room. In a way, the experience was instructive. If you've been watching cable news recently, you could be excused for thinking the entire world was about to stop to watch Obama, and you could be forgiven for concluding that nothing but politics was dripping from ordinary-Joes' lips from New York City to Los Angeles and everywhere in between. But, here in Clovis, if people were watching they were doing so in the privacy of their homes; and if they were out at the bars, as many were as the long Labor Day weekend got underway, they weren't imbibing politics. </p> <p>Potentially, that could be a problem for the Democrats, who had staked a huge amount of political capital on wowing America with an amphitheatre-like spectacle to conclude their four day show. It's not enough to get crowds watching in Times Square, or in house parties in LA. For Colorado to produce the needed polling bump, they have to reach the heartlands.</p> <p>On the other hand, the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/aug/29/uselections2008.democrats20082\">sheer majesty of Obama's speech</a>, the confidence he exuded, the promises he made, will, I believe, ricochet through the next two months. People in Clovis might not have watched the speech tonight, but you can be sure they'll be seeing extracts on the news and in political commercials from here until November. They'll see Obama going after McCain on economics and even on national security and military strategy, the Republican's terra firma. They'll see Obama pledging a new economic deal for working Americans. And they'll see footage of Michelle Obama and their two adorable children watching ecstatically as Barack spoke. That's all money in the bank for the Democrats.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/aug/29/uselections2008.barackobama2\">Obama's speech</a> was extraordinary, both in the ambition of its promises \u2013 a commitment to universal healthcare, to a renewed compact on quality education, a $150b investment in renewable energy technologies, a new foreign policy, a fairer tax system \u2013 and in the stunning delivery. It takes chutzpah and cajones, to address a crowd of 80,000 people. It could all too easily have gone horribly wrong \u2013 indeed, when he came onto the deep blue stage, initially Obama seemed slightly lost, saying \"thank you, thank you so much\" again and again and again in an ineffective effort to tamp down the crowd. But once he got into the meat of his speech, the candidate nailed it.</p> <p>There were echoes of Franklin Roosevelt, John Kennedy, Martin Luther King. This was speech-making at its very finest. </p> <p>Clovis might not have tuned in tonight, but its residents will be hearing about this speech for the next two months. And as the undecideds and the I-don't-cares start to line up with candidates, Obama's speech will filter into the heart of the country. This election will likely be a close-run thing, but eventually this remarkable feat of oratory might just tip the balance.</p>",

Adopting the cadences of a southern preacher, Obama said it was the promise of America that had brought people from every corner of the country to hear King on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial.</p> <p>Bush had betrayed that promise during the last eight years and the country could not take the chance of another four under John McCain, Obama said.</p> <p>Quoting from King's call to march forward together and not turn back, he echoed the father of the civil rights movement: \"America, we cannot turn back. Not with so much work to be done \u2026 We cannot walk alone. At this moment, in this election, we must pledge once more to march into the future.\"</p> <p>After months of criticism that there was no substance behind the dazzling oratory, Obama allied his soaring rhetoric to long passages on how he would deal with America's ailing economy, the biggest election issue. He offered a programme of education, health and energy reforms, allied to job creation and tax cuts.</p> <p>He finally went after McCain with newfound aggression, to the relief of Democrats despairing at their candidate's unwillingness to go toe-to-toe with his Republican rival. He tied him to Bush, accused him of being out of touch with working- and middle-class Americans, and blamed him for adopting scare tactics and negative campaigning. </p> <p>Showing that in spite of his lofty rhetoric, he can get down and dirty he made sly digs over McCain's volatile temperament and age: McCain turns 72 today.</p> <p>To cheers from the crowd, he challenged McCain's foreign policy judgment and rounded on him for supporting the Iraq war at the expense of failing to go after Osama bin Laden in Afghanistan and Pakistan. \"John McCain likes to say that he'll follow bin Laden to the Gates of Hell - but he won't even go to the cave where he lives.\"</p> <p>The Obama campaign had intended last night's address to be a people's event, a radical change from the insider nature of most conventions that aides said symbolised the grassroots nature of his candidacy. He was only the third Democratic candidate to accept the party's presidential nomination outside a convention hall: Roosevelt did in Chicago in 1932, and Kennedy in Los Angeles in 1960.</p> <p>Tens of thousands took the chance to be part of last night's event, with long lines snaking for miles around the stadium under a blazing sun and filling the stadium three hours before he spoke.</p> <p>They came in Martin Luther King t-shirts and in full Obama regalia - t-shirts, hats, and buttons. A few came in Native American traditional dress. One man was dressed as the devil, with smears of red paint on his face and legs.</p> <p>Vendors sold Obama dolls and life-sized figures of Obama dressed as Uncle Sam.</p> <p>Inside the stadium, there was a collective sense of history in the making. Flash bulbs popped incessantly from the stands, as people waved small American flags, bopped to Motown and shouted \"Yes, we can\" as Will.i.am and other performers took to the stage.</p> <p>Obama came to his first Democratic convention eight years ago short of cash and frequently frisked by security because of his name. Last night he recalled his arrival on the national scene at the next one in when his speech caught the imagination of a despondent Democratic party.</p> <p>\"Four years ago, I stood before you and told you my story - of the brief union between a young man from Kenya and a young woman from Kansas who weren't well-off or well-known, but shared a belief that in America, their son could achieve whatever he put his mind to,\" he said.</p> <p>\"It is that promise that has always set this country apart - that through hard work and sacrifice, each of us can pursue our individual dreams but still come together as one American family, to ensure that the next generation can pursue their dreams as well.\"</p> <p>He used his own life story, too, to address the negative campaign that McCain has mounted over the last two months, in particular that he was too fond of his new-found celebrity status.</p> <p>He spoke about the sacrifices made by his family. \"I don't know what kind of lives John McCain thinks that celebrities lead but this has been mine,\" he said.</p> <p>He also responded to charges by Republicans questioning his patriotism. He adapted a line from that 2004 convention speech in Boston to argue that the men and women fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan may have been of different parties but all died under the same flag.</p> <p>\"They have not served a red America or a blue America - they have served the United States of America,\" he said. \"So I've got news for you, John McCain: We all put our country first.\" </p> <p>He took McCain to task for his negative campaign ads. \"What I will not do is suggest that the senator takes his positions for political purposes,\" Obama said. \"Because one of the things that we have to change in our politics is the idea that people cannot disagree without challenging each other's character and patriotism.\"</p>",

  "<p><strong>DENVER</strong> \u2014 There isn't really any other way to say it: to step out into the main arena here at Invesco Field, where Barack Obama will soon accept the Democratic nomination as the first black presidential candidate of a major American political party, is to taste history in the making, in the air. The stadium hasn't yet nearly reached its capacity of 75,000, but already, the emotion hits you in waves when you step into the crowd; almost everyone seems on the brink of tears. (A delegate from Kentucky just stopped me to ask directions to the hamburger stand; within two more sentences \u2014 all I did was ask her how she was finding the occasion so far \u2014 her eyes were glistening.) We've already heard from the daughter and eldest son of Martin Luther King, in two highly moving speeches; Stevie Wonder and Al Gore are due on any minute. You can consider tonight's liveblog officially started, but the key hour begins at <strong>8pm Denver time</strong> (<strong>10pm eastern, 3am UK time</strong> \u2014 coffee, people, coffee!): join me for what can't really help but be an extraordinary night.</p> <p><strong>6.46pm:</strong> Actually, Stevie Wonder's been and gone, to a rapturous reception. Here's Al Gore, with a nice line: \"Today, we face essentially the same choice we faced in 2000, though it may be even more obvious now, because John McCain, a man who has earned our respect on many levels, is now openly endorsing the policies of the Bush-Cheney White House and promising to actually continue them. The same policies, all over again? Hey, I believe in recycling, but that's ridiculous.\"</p> <p><strong>6.57pm:</strong> In a risky line, addressing the \"experience\" criticism of Obama, Gore notes that Abraham Lincoln, \"now regarded by most historians as our greatest president,\" had almost exactly the same experience in elective office as Obama: \"Eight years in his state legislature in Springfield, Illinois, and one term in Congress.\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-337056955\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2008/8/29/1219971979247/crowd1.jpg\" alt=\"crowds\" width=\"458\" height=\"137\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>7.05pm:</strong> Despite all the elation here, the word that Obama's campaign aides have been using to describe the speech we can expect to hear tonight is 'workmanlike'. In any circumstances, there would be <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/29/us/politics/29stage.html?ref=us&amp;pagewanted=print\">significant political risks</a> involved in staging an event as vast and high-profile as this one. But the Obama campaign planned this historic public nomination acceptance before the McCain campaign started vigorously pushing its \"celebrity\" line in the media, so now it's even more crucial that Obama tries to anchor the occasion with some down-to-earth policy talk. \"I'm not aiming for a lot of high rhetoric,\" he said yesterday. \"I am much more concerned with communicating how I intend to help middle-class families live their lives.\" Given the pitch of emotion here already, keeping this event down-to-earth could be a struggle. But adulatory crowds coupled with workmanlike language from the podium is probably a combination that Team Obama would like just fine.</p> <p><strong>7.11pm:</strong> CNN isn't taking any risks with its headlines: <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/08/28/dnc.day/?iref=mpstoryview\">Obama expected to address change in speech</a>.</p> <p><strong>7.25pm:</strong> An appearance from Joe Biden. Meanwhile, SPOILER ALERT! It would be wrong not to inform you that an advance version of Obama's speech has been released, and is in various places online. I've posted it <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/oliverburkemanblog/2008/aug/29/1\">here</a>.</p> <p><strong>7.50pm:</strong> Just back from the floor to my computer. It's crazy out there. We heard from six \"American voices\", including the cannily selected Barney Smith, who got a huge cheer for saying the government should care more about Barney Smith than Smith Barney...</p> <p><strong>8pm:</strong> Illinois senator Dick Durbin is here to introduce Obama. And now a video tribute, in which Obama says he \"probably was shaped more by his [father's] absence than his presence.\"</p> <p><strong>8.05pm:</strong> The updated full advance version of Obama's remarks are <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/oliverburkemanblog/2008/aug/29/1\">here</a>. </p> <p><strong>8.08pm:</strong> In that other story, no leak yet to disrupt the media coverage of this event, but lots of people <a href=\"http://talkingpointsmemo.com/archives/211096.php\">seem to think</a> John McCain is about to pick \u2014 or in fact has picked \u2014 Minnesota governor Tim Pawlenty.</p> <p><strong>8.11pm:</strong> It's that Barack Obama guy! The applause, by my count, lasts justs under two minutes. Wild.</p> <p><strong>\"With profound gratitude and great humility, I accept your nomination for the presidency of the United States.\"</strong></p> <p>(Yesterday, he was the official nominee. Today, he's officially officially the nominee. No, like, he's <em>really</em> the nominee now.)</p> <p><strong>8.18pm:</strong> Thanks for Hillary Clinton, Bill Clinton, Joe Biden. \"Four years ago, I stood before you and told you my story -- of the brief union between a young man from Kenya and a young woman from Kansas who weren't well-off or well-known, but shared a belief that in America, their son could achieve whatever he put his mind to. It is that promise that has always set this country apart -- that through hard work and sacrifice, each of us can pursue our individual dreams but still come together as one American family, to ensure that the next generation can pursue their dreams as well.\"</p> <p><strong>8.20pm:</strong> \"America, we are better than these last eight years. We are a better country than this... Tonight, I say to the American people, to Democrats and Republicans and Independents across this great land -- enough!\" He really shouted \"enough\" -- nothing \"conciliatory\" about that at all. The audience here loved hearing it. </p> <p>\"Next week, in Minnesota, the same party that brought you two terms of George Bush and Dick Cheney will ask this country for a third. And we are here because we love this country too much to let the next four years look like the last eight. On November 4th, we must stand up and say: 'Eight is enough.'\" That's a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight_Is_Enough\">TV reference</a>.</p> <p><strong>8.27pm:</strong> A reprise of something we've heard a lot in this convention -- a \"more-in-sorrow-than-in-anger\" criticism of John McCain, beginning with the respect that the Obama team know it's wise to pay to his military service and his former maverick ways. \"Now, I don't believe that Senator McCain doesn't care what's going on in the lives of Americans. I just think he doesn't know. Why else would he define middle-class as someone making under five million dollars a year? How else could he propose hundreds of billions in tax breaks for big corporations and oil companies but not one penny of tax relief to more than 100m Americans?... It's not because John McCain doesn't care. It's because John McCain doesn't get it.\" The focus here is, as many predicted, largely economic, reaching out to the much-focused-on hard-up voters, especially in key swing states.</p> <p>\"Born into poverty? Pull yourself up by your own bootstraps - even if you don't have boots. You're on your own.\" Nice line. A reference to economic prosperity under Bill Clinton gets a big cheer.</p> <p><strong>8.31pm:</strong> A direct hit back on the \"celebrity\" line, after a list of struggling but inspiring Americans, including his own mother: \"I don't know what kind of lives John McCain thinks that celebrities lead, but this has been mine. These are my heroes. Theirs are the stories that shaped me. And it is on their behalf that I intend to win this election and keep our promise alive as President of the United States.\"</p> <p><strong>8.34pm:</strong> A raft of economic specifics, and then this: \"And for the sake of our economy, our security, and the future of our planet, I will set a clear goal as President: in ten years, we will finally end our dependence on oil from the Middle East.\"</p> <p>\"I'm on the fourth floor with Sarah Silverman,\" my colleague Richard Adams emails from elsewhere in the stadium, annoyingly.</p> <p><strong>8.42pm:</strong> Just back from the stadium floor, where I arrived in time for a passage on tax and education spending. It was loud out there before. Now it is VERY VERY LOUD indeed. There's also a big, big echo, which makes it hard to hear Obama, though seeing him's no problem, thanks to the gigantic screens.</p> <p><strong>8.44pm:</strong> And on to foreign policy: Obama's opposition to the war... \"John McCain likes to say that he'll follow bin Laden to the Gates of Hell -- but he won't even go to the cave where he lives.\" McCain is even more stubborn than Bush on Iraq, he's saying now.</p> <p><strong>8.47pm:</strong> I don't really understand this line, which is clearly an attempt to seize the moral high ground: \"But what I will not do is suggest that the Senator takes his positions for political purposes.\" He does, though, doesn't he?</p> <p>\"Because one of the things that we have to change in our politics is the idea that people cannot disagree without challenging each other's character and patriotism...\"</p> <p><strong>8.52pm:</strong> AK47s are bad; letting gays and lesbians visit people in hospital is good.</p> <p><strong>8.54pm:</strong> And now the stirring closing passage. \"You have shown what history teaches us -- that at defining moments like this one, the change we need doesn't come from Washington. Change comes to Washington.\" And up to the crescendo, which is this:</p> <p>\"...It is that promise that forty five years ago today, brought Americans from every corner of this land to stand together on a Mall in Washington, before Lincoln's Memorial, and hear a young preacher from Georgia speak of his dream. The men and women who gathered there could've heard many things. They could've heard words of anger and discord. They could've been told to succumb to the fear and frustration of so many dreams deferred. But what the people heard instead -- people of every creed and color, from every walk of life -- is that in America, our destiny is inextricably linked. That together, our dreams can be one. 'We cannot walk alone,' the preacher cried. 'And as we walk, we must make the pledge that we shall always march ahead. We cannot turn back.' America, we cannot turn back. Not with so much work to be done. Not with so many children to educate, and so many veterans to care for. Not with an economy to fix and cities to rebuild and farms to save. Not with so many families to protect, and so many lives to mend. America, we cannot turn back. We cannot walk alone. At this moment, in this election, we must pledge once more to march into the future. Let us keep that promise -- that American promise -- and in the words of Scripture, hold firmly, without wavering, to the hope that we confess. Thank you, God bless you, and God bless the United States of America.\"</p> <p>In accordance with US law, they play him out with <a href=\"http://www.cowboylyrics.com/lyrics/brooks-and-dunn/only-in-america-4920.html\">this horrible country rock song</a>.</p> <p><strong>9pm:</strong> Here's Joe Biden and Michelle and the kids and various others. FIREWORKS! Streamers, and a patriotic rock-orchestral medley. Top marks for the fireworks, no marks for the classical rock.</p> <p><strong>9.15pm:</strong> So how'd it go? Ezra Klein <a href=\"http://www.prospect.org/csnc/blogs/ezraklein_archive?month=08&amp;year=2008&amp;base_name=obama_1\">puts it well</a>: \"This has been the most aggressive speech of the week. And the most substantive I've seen Obama give. It's not a thematic address: It's not about hope or values or the universality of the American experience of the illusory obstacles that divide us. It's concrete. It's about the failure of the Republican Party, and the promises of the Democratic Party.\" </p> <p><strong>9.20pm</strong> Stunningly, the McCain campaign doesn't agree. \"Tonight, Americans witnessed a misleading speech that was so fundamentally at odds with the meager record of Barack Obama. When the temple comes down, the fireworks end, and the words are over, the facts remain: Senator Obama still has no record of bipartisanship, still opposes offshore drilling, still voted to raise taxes on those making just $42,000 per year, and still voted against funds for American troops in harm's way. The fact remains: Barack Obama is still not ready to be President.\" But they would say that. </p> <p>Then again, after all the hype about a McCain attack ad that was going to be released tonight, we get <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/aug/29/uselections2008.johnmccain\">this</a>: \"Too often the achievements of our opponents go unnoticed. But I wanted to stop and say congratulations \u2026 tomorrow we'll be back at it. But tonight, senator [Obama], job well done...\"</p> <p>...There was almost nothing more on Hillary Clinton, and plenty on Bush and McCain. (The way Obama shouted \"Enough!\", and some of his other remarks, still seems surprising, given how much we've read about his need to avoid the appearance of anger.) After a convention week devoted in significant part to working through the Democrats' internal issues, it was emphatically faced forward to the coming election battle. It's always more fun to listen to a lofty speech, but there were good reasons that Obama, for the most part, avoided loftiness; this speech's solidity and substance should prepare the party well for the high profile attacks they're going to endure all next week. And ultimately, of course, the fact of this speech \u2014 who was delivering it, and where \u2014 was as important as its content. </p> <p>Now all Obama has to do is win the election.</p> <p>====</p> <p>POSTSCRIPT</p> <p>Some immediate responses from the audience...</p> <p>\"I'm numb,\" said Maureen Gallaty, originally from New Orleans, who lost her brother in Hurricane Katrina. \"I teared up, and I'm no a cryer. The symbolism of him being here \u2014 it's like the whole Kennedy era came back, and now we have the same spirit as president Jack Kennedy, as Martin Luther King, alive and well... it gives me chills to say those words.\"</p> <p>\"No Democrat could be displeased with it,\" said Barbara Diffay, from Tuskegee, Alabama, who spent the last few days volunteering for the convention \u2014 shepherding people in and out of the Pepsi Center \u2014 in return for a ticket. \"He said everything that he needed to say.\"</p> <p>\"It was an enormous risk to do this,\" Jonathan Starr, a Hawaii delegate, told my colleague David Munk. \"And if it hadn't been such a success, it would have looked really bad.\" (Elana Schor has been questioning the crowd in more detail, and in the story she's busy writing now, shortly to be seen <a href=\"http://guardian.co.uk/uselections\">here</a>, she'll report that the attendees she spoke to seemed much more excited by the substance of Obama's speech than the theatrics \u2014 specifically, his tax plans, including the elimination of capital gains taxes for some small businesses, and his promise to \"finally end our dependence on oil from the Middle East\" within 10 years.)</p> <p>====</p> <p>Thanks for reading and commenting. Now I've got to try to leave the stadium, which may take a number of hours.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-337059033\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2008/8/29/1219983774155/theend.jpg\" alt=\"The end\" width=\"459\" height=\"329\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>",
  "<p>Maybe it hardly bears thinking about the morning of November 5 if Barack Obama has lost to John McCain the previous day. And it may seem perverse to think about it at all on a day like today, when Obama yet again commands the stage. But let's try to do it, right now, partly because the closeness of the polls suggests a narrow McCain win is a real possibility \u2014 partly because there has been so much underlying nervousness, as well as renewed exhilaration, among Democrats in Denver this week; and partly just out of common political prudence. </p> <p>So, why might McCain win on November 4? I think there are five main reasons to consider. </p> <p>The first is that these remain insecure times. The economic downturn has been very real in the US, in spite of yesterday's good growth figures. America's fear of rising fuel prices remains a potent electoral issue, laced as it now is with the fear that high oil prices are lining the coffers of America's enemies in places such as Russia, Iran and Venezuela. American soldiers are fighting difficult wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. McCain has a big poll lead on national security, foreign policy and ability to deal with a crisis. Every Russian tank rumbling around the Caucasus is harvesting votes for McCain \u2014 and the electorate may prefer to entrust the country to a leader with warrior credentials than take a chance on a visionary neophyte. </p> <p>The second reason why McCain might win is that this election is no longer about George Bush. America in late 2008 has a president who is a member of the political living dead. His name was barely mentioned at the Democratic convention this week. Along with Dick Cheney he will make an early appearance at St Paul on Monday at the Republican convention; after that, he's out of it. And with him may go many of his negatives. That leaves McCain some elbow room to fight the campaign his own way. McCain is a tough campaigner. He is also a smart one. He could do well in the televised debates. Compared with the midterms in 2006, the Democrats may find it hard to make this an election about Bush. </p> <p>Which brings us to reason No 3. American presidential elections are always close these days. Bush beat John Kerry with just 51% of the popular vote in 2004 and was neck-and-neck with Al Gore in 2000. In the electoral college Bush won by 286-251 against Kerry and by 271-266 against Gore. In the past four presidential elections \u2014 even the two that Bill Clinton won \u2014 no Democratic candidate has ever polled more than 49%. Democratic landslides have not been in fashion since 1964. This year's polls \u2014 in which Obama's average lead is now just 1.8% \u2014 are beginning to point to yet another 50:50 election. In these close races discipline, negative campaigning, and get-out-the vote organisation in the battleground states all matter. Over the years these have been Republican strengths, not Democratic ones. </p> <p>Recent polls also point to the fourth piece of good news for McCain: voters may be suffering from Obama fatigue. Obama is still fighting a campaign that is centred on self. His own story, his own vision and his own uniqueness are at the heart of his message. He consciously takes the whole weight of the campaign on his own slim shoulders, as he did again last night by taking his acceptance speech out of the convention hall and into the local football stadium, where he spoke against a backdrop of Greek pillars. Hubris? What if the nation that fell in love with Obama in the first phase of his great campaign decides he is yesterday's rock star as the real election nears. I think Obama is well aware of this \u2014 but voters don't just want big vision and soaring oratory. </p> <p>The final reason is simply Obama's race. The nomination of a black man to be president is not something marginal but something massive. It goes to the heart of whether America's self-identity is genuinely multiracial, or whether , in spite of everything, it is still white. This election isn't just about the possibility of a black president, but the possibility of a black first family. It asks white voters to see themselves embodied and represented by African-Americans, and to vote to be led by black people. This is something bigger than electing a woman leader would be, were that on offer. Race and slavery are America's original sin. The election of Obama would be, beyond question, one of the noblest gestures of historical redemption that Americans have ever been called upon to make. But that is precisely why it may not happen. </p> <p>So if, on January 20 2009, it is McCain, not Obama, who stands in the winter's air on Capitol Hill to be sworn in as Bush's successor, what would that mean for America and the world? The first thing to say is not to exaggerate the domestic or even the international impact; McCain would be the president of an already humbled, not newly triumphalist, conservatism. The economy would dominate his agenda. The next, umbilically linked point is to remember that McCain would have to work with a Congress in which, on the same election day, the Democrats are likely to strengthen their majority in the House of Representatives and secure firm control of the Senate. He could very easily find himself a weak president. </p> <p>Yet there could be no disguising the lessons for the Democrats, who would have lost three winnable presidential contests in a row. If Obama loses, there will not be another African-American nominee for at least a generation. Hillary Clinton might have the consolation that she would become, overnight, the overwhelming favourite to finally win the Democratic nomination in 2012. But who would bet against such a divisive figure not extending the losing streak from three to four? It would begin to look as if the only way of getting a Democrat into the White House would be as the result of an armed uprising. </p> <p>All that would be as nothing to the global dismay that would greet the election of President McCain. Much of the world would simply despair of the American people \u2014 and so would many Americans. Anti-Americanism would have a new recruiting sergeant, and global confi dence in the democratic progressive project would suffer a historic blow. November 5 would be a bonfire night of the liberal vanities. I tend to think it won't happen that way \u2014 but it certainly could. And it may all be just 10 short weeks away.</p>"

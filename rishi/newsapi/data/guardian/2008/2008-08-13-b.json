  "<p>Robert Mugabe will shortly install a new government in Zimbabwe following the collapse of political negotiations with his principal rival, Morgan Tsvangirai, according to the state-run press.</p> <p>But the leader of a breakaway opposition faction, Arthur Mutambara, denied claims by Mugabe's officials that he will join the administration, which Zimbabwe's president is portraying as a government of national unity in an attempt to win international backing.</p> <p>Senior ruling Zanu-PF party officials said on Tuesday that Mutambara had reached agreement with Mugabe on the shape of a new administration. South Africa's president, Thabo Mbeki, who was mediating the negotiations, confirmed that the two men did agree the division of powers in the next government, to be led by Mugabe.</p> <p>But Mutambara, who heads a splinter group from Tsvangirai's Movement for Democratic Change, said that did not mean he is prepared to serve in a new administration while there is still no deal between the two principal players. The talks broke up after Tsvangirai refused to drop his demand that Mugabe relinquish power and become a ceremonial president.</p> <p>\"This is a tripartite negotiating framework. You cannot get an agreement where only two parties agree,\" said Mutambara. But he made clear his antipathy to Tsvangirai's insistence that Mugabe surrender power by calling on his MDC rival to \"put national interest before self-interest\".</p> <p>Tsvangirai's aides treated with suspicion Mutambara's claim not to have done a deal with Mugabe, noting that the opposition faction leader had shifted his position considerably in recent days and was praised by Zimbabwe's president in a speech earlier this week.</p> <p>But Mutambara was also under pressure from his own members of parliament yesterday, some of whom threatened to desert him if he did a unilateral deal with Mugabe. The Mutambara faction holds 10 seats in parliament, which represent the balance of power.</p> <p>One Mutambara faction MP, David Coltart, said that he would not back a unilateral deal with Mugabe. \"The political impasse will only be broken when we have an agreement that reflects the will of the people as expressed in the March election,\" he said.</p> <p>Despite the lack of progress during three days of talks on the central issue of who wields power, Mbeki insisted a deal was possible soon. \"We are indeed convinced that it is possible to conclude these negotiations quite quickly,\" he said yesterday. \"They are working on a truly inclusive government.\" </p> <p>Publicly, Tsvangirai said his party remains committed to dialogue but that the outcome must reflect the democratic will of the people established in the last generally accepted election result - the first round of presidential elections in March, won by Tsvangirai.</p>",
  "<p>Bone-crushing handshakes, along with endless speeches and travel, are among of the perils of being a presidential candidate's spouse, as Cindy McCain was reminded Wednesday.</p> <p>The wife of Republican contender John McCain made a trip to hospital for x-rays after shaking hands during an event at a golf club outside Detroit.</p> <p>\"We had a great luncheon fundraiser, and I shook hands with a very enthusiastic supporter and it got me the wrong way,\" Mrs McCain said after she reappeared on the campaign trail with her right arm in a sling.</p> <p>The McCain campaign said the handshake \"exacerbated an existing carpal tunnel condition\", and described the injury as a minor sprain.</p> <p>After her husband's 2000 campaign Cindy McCain said she had broken her wrist from repeated handshakes, which required pins.</p>",

  "<p> The Wall Street Journal compares presidential dimensions in a graphic earlier this month<br>The Washington Post <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/08/11/AR2008081102827_pf.html\">revisits</a> the timeworn but always entertaining Presidential Height Index, according to which the tallest candidate for US president has won on almost every occasion over the last century or so -- especially if you count Al Gore in 2000, cruelly denied the office thanks to some <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1197470/bio\">short Supreme Court judges</a>. So far, the minuscule size of John McCain, who under some conditions cannot actually be seen at all without the aid of an electron microscope, hasn't been a major problem, since he's mostly been standing on the podium alone. But as the blogger Saccharinist <a href=\"http://saccharinist.blogspot.com/2008/06/running-short-tall-tale-of-john-mccain.html\">notes</a>, that's about to change: at the post-convention presidential debates, the 6'1\" Obama will tower over him. As might his vice-president, depending on who he picks -- and that could spell trouble:</p> <blockquote> When Dukakis chose the 6'1\" (1.85m) Lloyd Bentsen as his running mate for the 1988 presidential campaign against 6'2\"\" (1.88m) George Bush the elder, it seemed like a good idea at the time -- an undoubtedly concerted effort to present a more balanced height average for the Democratic ticket. Sadly for Dukakis, none of his advisers succeeded (if they even tried) in predicting just how unfortunately silly a presidential candidate looks when his lesser-office partner towers above him. </blockquote> <br> <p>Generally speaking, pundits and political thinkers laugh off theories like the Presidential Height Index. They shouldn't. Gut reactions to the impression that a candidate makes, along with many <a href=\"http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2008/06/080623-polling-places.html\">other completely unexpected factors</a>, are <em>exactly</em> what determines election outcomes. And research has <a href=\"http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4179/is_20000113/ai_n11739190\">already established</a> that taller men are more likely to marry and have children...</p>",

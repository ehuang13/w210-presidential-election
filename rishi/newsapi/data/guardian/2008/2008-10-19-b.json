  "<p>Like virtually no one else in the country, I stayed up to watch the final US presidential debate the other night, which started at the user-friendly time of 2am and lasted 350 hours, if you count all the post-match analysis. All the rolling news channels were covering it live, of course, so my choice of network was largely based on aesthetics. Sky News had the colour turned up to cartoon levels, so that was out. The BBC had a more sober palette, and was showing it in widescreen, but there weren't enough distracting tickers and graphics to maintain my attention - I know they're bad, but I just can't help myself - so before long I started channel-surfing. The moment I alighted on CNN, I knew I was going to stay there. Why? Because they had an animated graph.</p> <p>It looked like a heart monitor. For a moment, I thought it was displaying the opponents' pulses. Or maybe it was hooked up to a pad in their seats, and was scrupulously monitoring the amount of arse sweat they'd generate if a tricky question reared its head. But no. Instead it was supposed to be a visual representation of the ever-shifting mind-set of a group of uncommitted Ohio voters.</p> <p>Rather than shoving electrodes into said voters' brains, so they looked like miserable cats in an anti-vivisection poster, CNN had taken the humane route and given them some sort of approval-rating widget. So if you were holding one, and Obama said something you didn't like, you turned the dial down, and if McCain said something you did like, you turned it up. And vice versa. There was one line for women and another for men, so you could see how the different sexes had different reactions. Sadly, that was the full extent of demographic separation. They could've broken it down a little further. It would've been fascinating to see how, say, overweight ginger-haired postmen felt about the possibility of a new free trade agreement with Colombia, but the lazy bastards at CNN couldn't be arsed to tell us.</p> <p>This shocking oversight aside, watching the wobbly line snake up and down as the candidates spoke was mesmerising. So mesmerising you couldn't really hear what they were saying. In fact, it turned the debate into a video game - like SingStar, the PlayStation karaoke thing where you get drunk and try to belt your way through Girls Just Wanna Have Fun without hitting too many bum notes.</p> <p>When the delicate subject of abortion came up, the line became yet more fiddly, and turned into one of those infuriating puzzles where you have to move a metal loop along a twisty-turny electrified wire without touching the sides.</p> <p>Since it's impossible not to root for one candidate or another, this meant that you found yourself egging your favourite on in craven and bizarre ways. \"Shit, the line's dropping - quick, make a rash promise to the American people! Say you'll eliminate taxes! Claim to be Christ! Offer free hand-jobs! Anything!\"</p> <p>At one point I found myself thinking it'd be useful if people had those approval-monitor graphs on their faces in real life, so when you were talking to them at parties you could tell, at a glance, just how interested or bored they were. Then I remembered that's what basic facial expressions are for. Nature always gets there first.</p> <p>Speaking of facial expressions, during the eight or nine nanoseconds I wasn't focused intently on the animated line, the lingering reaction shots provided much entertainment. The screen was split in two so you could see their faces while the other was talking. Obama smiled a lot, so much in fact that he started resembling a reality show contestant watching a compilation of his \"best bits\". McCain's face didn't know quite what to do with itself. It kept trying to look furious. Then you'd see him remember that looking furious doesn't play well, so he'd arrange his face into a tight, eerie grin, while appearing to grow increasingly furious with himself for failing to hide his earlier fury, thereby creating an unfortunate anger-based feedback loop. He should've worn a mask. Is the world ready for a masked president? Hell, yeah. How about one in a Sarah Palin mask? Or Chico Marx? Or Jason Voorhees from Friday the 13th? That'd really have thrown Obama off his stride, and given the networks something else to debate ad nauseam, thereby putting McCain back at the top of the news agenda. Is this a new maverick strategy, or a mental breakdown? The pundits would be at it for hours.</p> <p>Despite the visual distractions, a few words and noises did register in my brain. Obama's voice is so soothing, I kept thinking he was about to start advertising coffee. \"I want to say to the American people: this is the finest, mellowest blend your money can buy.\" McCain, meanwhile, was narrating a children's story about Joe the Plumber. Maybe it's a back-up plan: if he doesn't win the presidency, he's going to launch a stop-motion animation series on Nickelodeon. There's probably a warehouse full of Joe the Plumber action figures out there somewhere in the Arizona desert just waiting for the say-so.</p> <p>I kept waiting for Obama to counter McCain's talk of Joe the Plumber by bringing up Boris the Spider or Dennis the Menace or something, but no. He started addressing Joe too. Before long they were both at it, appealing to Joe straight down the lens, which meant I had to keep looking behind me in case he was standing there, fixing a pipe.</p> <p>Then it was over and I went to bed. At least I think I did. Perhaps it was all a dream. Certainly felt that way. An election in Narnia. And they all lived happily ever after. The end. </p> <p>\u2022 This week <strong>Charlie struggled to understand the interface on his new phone</strong>: \"It's like a cross between Windows and a sarcastic cartoon about Windows, with the added disadvantage that you have to try to operate it with your stubby little thumbs.\"</p>",
  "<p>Voters in key swing states from Colorado to Ohio have been targeted with automated phone calls seeking to portray Barack Obama as an extremist who has befriended terrorists and Hollywood celebrities.</p> <p>Opening with the words, \"Hello. I'm calling for John McCain and the RNC [Republican national committee],\" the \"robocalls\" have kicked off a political storm, with Democrats and some Republicans denouncing the McCain campaign for resorting to a tactic the candidate himself has consistently repudiated.</p> <p>Several versions of the calls, addressing topics from abortion to terrorism, were reported by voters in Ohio, Colorado, New Mexico, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Missouri, North Carolina, Florida, Texas, West Virginia, Maine and Georgia.</p> <p>The call focusing on Republican claims that Obama is close to the 1960s radical William Ayers, states: \"You need to know that Barack Obama has worked closely with terrorist Bill Ayers, whose organisation bombed the US Capitol, the Pentagon, a judge's home, and killed Americans. Democrats will enact an extreme leftist agenda if they take control of Washington.\"</p> <p>Another call states: \"Barack Obama and his fellow Democrats got caught putting Hollywood above America. On the very day our elected leaders gathered in Washington to deal with the financial crisis, Barack Obama spent just 20 minutes with economic advisers, but hours at a celebrity Hollywood fundraiser. Where are the Democrats' priorities?\"</p> <p>A third call reprised an attack used in the final presidential debate: \"You need to know that Barack Obama ... opposed a bill requiring doctors to care for babies born alive after surviving attempted abortions ... Barack Obama and his liberal Democrats are too extreme for America ...\"</p> <p>The Senate Democratic majority leader, Harry Reid, expressed surprise at the \"scummy\" tactics. \"[I] can't believe John McCain knows what's going on.\"</p> <p>\"These kind of tactics have no place in Maine politics,\" a spokesman for the Maine Republican senator, Susan Collins, said. Collins is engaged in a tough re-election battle.</p> <p>Critics of the campaign's use of robocalls noted that McCain's professed opposition to the tactic was underpinned by the belief that his downfall in the 2000 Republican presidential primary campaign was due in part to the use of such tactics by his rival, George Bush. With that race tightening, voters in South Carolina received calls asking: \"Would you be more or less likely to vote for John McCain ... if you knew he had fathered an illegitimate black child?\"</p> <p>Bush won South Carolina after the allegation, a distortion of the McCains' adoption of a daughter from Bangladesh. That campaign was orchestrated in part by a former South Carolina attorney general, Charlie Condon. Earlier this year, Condon was appointed chairman of the McCain campaign in South Carolina.</p> <p>This week's calls were reportedly the work of a company owned by a Republican consultant named Jeff Larson, as were those made against McCain in 2000. At the time, McCain denounced the practice, saying: \"I promise you I have never, and will never, have anything to do with that kind of political tactic.\"</p> <p>Asked on Sunday if he would stop the calls, McCain said that this time was different. \"These are legitimate and truthful and they are far different than the phone calls that were made about my family ... this is dramatically different and either you ... didn't see those things in 2000 ... or you don't know the difference between that and what is a legitimate issue, and that is Senator Obama being truthful with the American people.\"</p> <p>An Obama campaign spokesman told the New York Times that the use of robocalls reminiscent of the 2000 campaign showed \"just how much McCain has changed since then - adopting not only President Bush's policies but his tactics\".</p> <p>A spokesman for the McCain campaign defended the latest calls, telling the New York Times, \"I would argue that much of these calls are based on hardened facts that American voters should consider.\"</p> <p>During this year's Republican primaries, McCain campaign manager Steve Schmidt decried robocalls, saying, \"[It's] a conveyance to introduce new information - and a lot of that information on the phone is slanderous and smearing.\"</p> <p>The robocalls are reported to be part of a $70m get-out-the-vote campaign being waged by the Republican party and the McCain campaign in key battleground states.</p> <p>Although common in the closing stages of a campaign, the calls' effectiveness is open to question, according to Vanderbilt University's John Geer.</p> <p>Robocalls, he told the Washington Post, \"may stimulate turnout, but they would have to be targeted to the right people. It could backfire, and if the attacks get in the mainstream media, the push back, too, could be substantial.\"</p> <p>The Guardian's coast-to-coast team attend a get-out-the-vote rally in Sante Fe and talk to some of the hundreds of Obama supporters lining up to cast their vote ahead of polling day on November 4.

  "<p>Only in the US has the political fallout from the financial meltdown been more visceral than in Scotland. Americans have a presidential election to worry about. But the Scots have two of their biggest, most cherished national institutions at risk: RBS and HBOS. In the 1690s a bank crisis pushed Scotland into union with England. Does 2008's crisis threaten the SNP's vision of renewed independence ?</p> <p>Labour and the SNP are so scornful of each other's analysis that there must be votes at stake. Sure enough, there are. On November 6 six candidates are contesting Labour-held Glenrothes in Fife (Labour majority 10,664), next door to Gordon Brown's seat. It will be the first reality check for the new Brown, or \"Fife man saves world\", as Labour canvassers remind voters on the doorstep.</p> <p>Two soundbites encapsulate the dispute. The SNP has rested much of its case for independence on high prices for Scotland's oil and on the wealth-creating splendour of its two great banks. RBS's HQ near Edinburgh airport looks like a city. </p> <p>Alex Salmond, the first minister, has cited the so-called northern \"arc of prosperity\" - from Ireland to Finland via Iceland and Norway as all small countries doing well: we can too, he says.</p> <p>Now things look different. Iceland has gone bust, Ireland has cut spending and raised taxes to pay for its unilateral bank bail-out. Even Norway's famous oil fund has shrunk as stocks, as well as oil prices, tumble. After a Scots columnist coined the phrase \"arc of insolvency\" Jim Murphy, the new and keen Scottish secretary, adopted it. </p> <p>Gordon Brown weighed in to emphasise how an independent Scotland simply couldn't have done what the UK has done. The \u00a332bn sought by HBOS and RBS exceeds the Salmond government's total budget (\u00a331bn). Scottish banks' share of the overall package is estimated at \u00a3100bn, Scotland's GDP. </p> <p>Salmond (once an RBS economist) tried to blame the crisis on short-selling \"spivs and speculators.\" But everyone knows RBS overreached itself.</p> <p>Salmond is not a man to roll over and expire. He has challenged Brown to debate the economy \"toe to toe\" (knowing he will refuse) and has called for reflation and interest rate cuts.</p> <p>Sensitive to London parochialism, SNP strategists accuse Labour of a patronising reflex which depicts helpless Scots as \"Albanians of the north\". So Scots are leading efforts to save HBOS from merger with Lloyds. </p> <p>As Scottish unemployment rose sharply to 124,000 last week, Platinum Point, another luxury flat project outside Edinburgh, went bust. </p> <p>Brown is determined that Lindsay Roy (head of his old school) holds Glenrothes against Peter Grant, SNP leader of Fife council. </p> <p>He will not stay away as he did when Labour lost Glasgow East in July. Labour voters are coming back, say canvassers. The stakes are high and a lot can happen in a fortnight, especially this one.</p>",

The other was the news that his campaign had raised a record $150m (\u00a386m) in September, dwarfing his previous monthly high of $65m in August, and bringing the total raised to $605m.</p> <p>At the weekend, Obama also attracted his biggest US audience of the campaign, when 100,000 people attended a rally in St Louis, Missouri. On Saturday evening, 75,000 people attended an Obama rally in Kansas City. The huge turnouts came as the latest national polls showed the presidential race essentially static, with Obama maintaining a lead of 4%-7%.</p> <p>Speaking on the TV programme Meet the Press, Powell, 71, offered an impassioned endorsement of Obama, and a harsh repudiation of the McCain campaign.</p> <p>\"It was not easy for me to disappoint Senator McCain in the way that I have done this morning,\" Powell said. \"We need a transformational figure, a president who is a generational change, That is why I'm supporting Barack Obama.</p> <p>\"Because of his ability to inspire, because of the inclusive nature of his campaign, because he is reaching out all across America, because of who he is and his rhetorical abilities - and you have to take that into account - he has both style and substance, he has met the standard of being a successful president, being an exceptional president.\"</p> <p>He said race was not a factor in his decision, but added: \"It will be an historic event for an African-American to become president, and, if that happens, all Americans should be proud.\"</p> <p>Powell, who said he had made up his mind over the last two months, was damning about McCain's response to the economic crisis, about what he described as the Republican party's drift further to the right during the campaign, and the attack politics of recent weeks.</p> <p>He also had harsh words for McCain's selection of Alaska governor Sarah Palin as running mate. \"He [McCain] was a little unsure about how to deal with the economic problems,\" Powell said. \"That concerned me. I was also concerned at the selection of Governor Palin ... I don't believe she's ready to be vice-president of the United States. That raises some questions ... about the judgment Senator McCain made.\"</p> <p>He also criticised the McCain campaign for focusing on Obama's alleged ties to the 1960s radical William Ayers. \"Why do we keep talking about him and why do we have these robocalls going on?\" he asked. \"This goes too far ... it's not what the American people are looking for. The party has moved even further to the right ... The approach of the Republican party and Mr McCain has become narrower and narrower. Obama has been more inclusive,\" Powell said.</p> <p>Obama said he was \"beyond honoured and deeply humbled\" by Powell's support. At a rally in Fayetteville, North Carolina, he said: \"[Powell] knows, as we do, that this is a moment where we need to come together as one nation - young and old, rich and poor, black, white, Hispanic, Asian, Native American, Republican and Democrat.\" Addressing a crowd of 10,000, Obama added: \"He reminded us that at this defining moment we don't have the luxury of relying on the same political games, the same political tactics that have been used in so many elections to divide us from one another and make us afraid of one another.\"</p> <p>McCain said he was not surprised by the endorsement. He was pleased he had the backing of four other former secretaries of state and many military leaders. Speaking on Fox television, he said: \"We're very happy with the way the campaign is going. I've been on enough campaigns, my friend, to sense enthusiasm and momentum, and we've got it.\"</p> <p>Despite Obama's lead in both poll ratings and fundraising, McCain said he could sense \"things are heading our way.\"</p> <p>\"I love being the underdog. You know every time that I've gotten ahead, somehow I've messed it up,\" McCain said.</p> <p>Powell's endorsement should aid Obama in foreign policy and national security, areas in which he is thought to be weaker. Powell served as national security adviser to President Ronald Reagan, was appointed chairman of the joint chiefs of staff by the first President George Bush, and was secretary of state during the current president's first term.</p> <p>While his endorsement carries great weight with Republicans, his standing among liberals was knocked following his speech to the UN before the invasion of Iraq. His enthusiastic support for Obama's \"steadiness\" and \"intellectual vigour\", however, will reassure many Democrats.</p> <p>The money raised in September enables Obama to push his campaign into Republican areas, forcing the McCain campaign to spend money to shore up support in what should be safe states. The Obama campaign said the average donation was less than $100. September brought 632,000 new donors, bringing the total number during the campaign to 3.1 million.</p> <p>The Democratic national committee also raised $49.9m in September.</p> <p>McCain chose to accept public funding of his campaign, which limits the amount he can spend in September and October to $84m. The Republican National Committee raised $66m in September.</p> <p>Much of Obama's financial advantage can be seen on the country's TV screens, where Democrat campaign commercials outplay McCain by three or four to one. The Obama campaign has even purchased a half hour prime-time slot on the major networks a week before the election day.</p> <h2>Endorsements</h2> <p><strong>Obama</strong></p> <p>Oprah Winfrey</p> <p>Bruce Springsteen</p> <p>JK Rowling</p> <p>Christopher Buckley</p> <p>George Clooney</p> <p>Caroline Kennedy (daughter of JFK)</p> <p>Susan Eisenhower (granddaughter of Republican president Eisenhower)</p> <p><strong>McCain</strong></p> <p>Sylvester Stallone</p> <p>Clint Eastwood</p> <p>Robert Duvall</p> <p>Jon Voight</p> <p>Curt Schilling (star pitcher for Boston Red Sox baseball team)</p> <p>John Elway (former star quarterback for Denver Broncos football team)</p> <p>Richard Petty (Nascar car-racing veteran)</p>",

He was the first African-American to hold the post. Along with General Norman Schwarzkopf, he led the coalition to victory in the first Gulf war against Iraq in 1991, becoming a national hero, and was urged by some to stand for president in the late 1990s.</p> <p>Born in Harlem and raised in the South Bronx of New York to Jamaican immigrant parents, he joined the army after graduating from college and had a 35-year career as a soldier, including tours of duty in Vietnam. He has said he is still haunted by the nightmare of Vietnam and believes the war was characterised by poor leadership.</p> <p>In 2001 he became the highest-ranking African-American in any US administration when George W Bush appointed him as his secretary of state. Powell was seen as a moderate voice in the Bush cabinet, particularly on Iraq, and gradually became more critical of the administration after being replaced by Condoleezza Rice following Bush's 2004 re-election. According to the Washington Post, he had been asked to resign by the president's chief of staff, Andrew Card.</p> <p>After the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/flash/0,,423247,00.html\">1991 Gulf war</a>, Powell's approach to intervention - described as his \"doctrine\" by the media - was characterised as exercising caution when sending US troops to fight abroad and ensuring there was a clear national interest and exit strategy.</p> <p>However, he was criticised in some quarters for his support for the invasion of Iraq in 2003 and his support for now-derided intelligence on Saddam Hussein's weapons of mass destruction. In the run-up to the conflict, Powell told the UN military action was needed against Iraq because \"there can be no doubt that Saddam Hussein has biological weapons and the capability to rapidly produce more, many more\". He also praised the UK's notorious <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/sep/04/iraq.iraq\">\"dodgy dossier\"</a> as a \"fine paper\".</p> <p>In spite of his protestations that reports of a cabinet split over Iraq had been exaggerated, Powell's relationship with Bush deteriorated after he was forced to justify the invasion. Powell is said to have doubted the accuracy of some of the \"evidence\" against Saddam and last year himself revealed that he once spent two and a half hours trying to persuade Bush not to invade Iraq.</p> <p>Since leaving office, Powell has campaigned against the appointment of the former Pentagon official John Bolton as the US ambassador to the UN, criticised the Bush administration's response to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/hurricanekatrina\">hurricane Katrina</a> and there has been growing anticipation he would back Obama.</p>",
  "<p>The states of Nevada, Colorado and New Mexico are key to what has been called Barack Obama's Western strategy. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._presidential_election,_2004\">All three states helped send George W Bush</a> to a second term, but they are all leaning, even if slightly, to Obama. New Mexico shows why these states have been challenging for Democrats and also why Barack Obama might win here.</p> <p>We're now in Colorado. We've been to Nevada and New Mexico, and here is The Nation's Ari Melber talking about Obama's western strategy:</p> <p><strong>Western Democrats, a different breed</strong></p> <p>Politics in these western states is very different than on the coasts. Take Democratic Bill Richardson for example. He touts his support for <a href=\"http://www.ontheissues.org/2008/Bill_Richardson_Gun_Control.htm\">gun rights and won the endorsement of the National Rifle Association</a>. He has a permit to carry a concealed weapon, said Heath Haussamen who covers politics for the New Mexico Independent.</p> <p>John McCain's message of \"drill, baby, drill\" also plays well in this oil and natural gas producing state, Heath said. The <a href=\"http://www.ewg.org/oil_and_gas/leaseholder.php?cust_id=-199080\">Yates Petroleum Company headquartered here is the largest holder</a> of oil and gas drilling leases on federal land in the West, and it's been an important industry for the state.</p> <p>This is a traditionally Democatic state, but the majority of Democrats are conservative Hispanic Democrats, Heath said, and they supported President Bush on the war longer than many other groups.</p> <p>\"They are pro-drilling, pro-life, big 2nd amendment supporters, but they also believe in welfare and unions. New Mexico voters have tended to send moderate Republicans to Washington, but the state has been trending leftward,\" Heath said.</p> <p><strong>Economic concerns</strong></p> <p>The state is one of the least affected by the housing crisis, and 25% of jobs in the state are for either the state or federal government, said <a href=\"http://joemonahansnewmexico.blogspot.com/\">New Mexico political blogger Joe Monahan</a>. Despite that, as with the rest of the country, the economy is the biggest issue.</p> <p>When I interviewed Joe, he was working on a story about <a href=\"http://joemonahansnewmexico.blogspot.com/2008_10_01_joemonahansnewmexico_archive.html#3508873368368298623#3508873368368298623\">a possible budget crunch in the state</a>, and the state's most populous <a href=\"http://kob.com/article/stories/S623232.shtml?cat=519\">county had just announced a $10m budget shortfall</a>.</p> <p>Heath lives in Las Cruces in the south of the state, and there are $200m in state or federal construction projects in the city alone. \"People are concerned that the government will have to cut back on spending to pay for financial bailout.\"</p> <p>A month ago, New Mexico was a toss-up state, but now, \"the consensus is that Obama has the edge,\" Heath said. RealClearPolitics shows <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2008/president/nm/new_mexico_mccain_vs_obama-448.html\">Obama with an average 8.4% lead</a> based on polls in the state.</p> <p>Two things in the last four years that have changed to help Barack Obama, Joe said. \"National security issue is not quite as dominant as an issue, and economic security is.\"</p> <p><strong>Obama's organisation</strong></p> <p>One thing that we're seeing in the states we're driving through is the presence of the Obama campaign and the enthusiasm of his supporters. In New Mexico, Obama has 40 field offices to McCain's 10. That number of field offices is unheard of, Heath said.</p> <p>Barack Obama has also been reaching out to Native American voters, which make up 10% of the state. They have volunteers and paid staff focused on getting out the vote in the native nations. They have held rallies focused on Native voters. \"The Obama campaign isn't taking anything for granted,\" said Trip Jennings, the news editor for the New Mexico Independent.</p> <p>Joe says that it's important not to over-emphasise the advantage in field offices and ground organisation by Democrats because theri voters tend to be less reliable. They have to work harder to get them to the polls. John McCain has run a more traditional campaign relying on phone banks and direct mail. Republicans appeal to a \"more likely voter\" so don't have to put as much effort to get voters out, he said.</p> <p>Also in Obama's favour is that Governor Bill Richardson has also been a strong ally since he decided to endorse him over Hillary Clinton, even though he had served <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Richardson#U.S._Ambassador_to_the_United_Nations\">in Bill Clinton's administration</a>, <a href=\"http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2008/04/02/BAVNVU2PJ.DTL\">setting off the former president's famous anger</a>.</p> <p>Governor Richardson has been a major fundraiser for Obama, bringing in $2m for the presidential campaign at a recent event, and he's helped Obama navigate <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/uselectionroadtrip/2008/oct/18/uselections2008-race-newmexico\">the unique politics of the state</a>.</p> <p><strong>The final stretch</strong></p> <p>Two weeks before the election, Joe says that Obama doesn't have the kind of lead that assures victory. \"There are a lot of voters who can be influenced by whatever is the last thing they see. While this election looks likes its trending Democrat and Obama, I don't think the margin is enough to rule out some kind of major development that could lead to an upset.\"</p> <p>The campaigns are fighting hard for the state's votes. <a href=\"http://newmexicoindependent.com/5649/biden-rallies-southern-nm-voters-for-obama\">Joe Biden campaigned in southern New Mexico</a> this week, and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/uselectionroadtrip/2008/oct/18/uselections2008-newmexico\">Sarah Palin is coming to Roswell</a>.</p> <p>A number of people I've spoke to along the way have said that whoever wins the presidential election will actually lose because the problems facing the country are so great, but Joe disagrees.</p> <p>He said: \"The next president is going to have a terrible job, but out of a terrible situation can come often come greatness. You would not have had an FDR without the Depresion. You would not have had a Lincoln with the Civil War. This is really going to test whoever wins the White House.\"</p>"

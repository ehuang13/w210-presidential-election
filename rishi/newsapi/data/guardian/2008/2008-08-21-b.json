  "<p>With candidates posting videos on YouTube and Barack Obama pledging to tell supporters his vice-presidential choice by text, Campaign 2008 has been a new-tech election. But one piece of old technology has proved an unexpectedly powerful player: writing. </p> <p>Obama is the first candidate to have had two bestselling books - not campaign manifestos, but proper memoirs, which he seems to have written himself - before even gaining the nomination. His pro-prose, though, has been answered by a wave of hostile volumes. The No 1 non-fiction slot he once occupied is filled by Obama Nation, a title that sounds supportive until the explanation that is meant to be spoken quickly and spittingly: \"Abomination\". </p> <p>In Britain, too, political rivals are throwing books at each other. The GQ editor Dylan Jones published this week his chronicle of following around David Cameron for a year. The Conservative leader was probably too busy to write a book himself, although the more intense schedule of a prime minister has not prevented Gordon Brown from a rate of publication that would have impressed Agatha Christie - Wartime Courage: Stories of Extraordinary Bravery in World War II, due in the autumn, is his third book in little over a year, a successor to Courage: Eight Portraits, and Britain's Everyday Heroes. </p> <p>The fact that Brown has chosen to publish an entire trilogy about guts is revealing of the roots of this mania for political literature. John F Kennedy's Portraits in Courage - calculated to establish cold warrior credentials before the 1960 race - remains the model for leaders in search of readers, even though it is now established that JFK had not done anything as grubby as setting down the words himself. This is a tradition Brown must have followed in order to publish more books during his period in office than most politicians manage to read. So strong is the influence of that Kennedy book that McCain has just published his own version, entitled Hard Call: Courageous Decisions by Inspiring People: Heroes Who Made Tough Decisions. </p> <p>The psychology of these volumes is very odd. Realistically, any politician who has time to produce a book while occupying or seeking high office is either employing a ghost writer or is shirking more important duties through an egotistical desire to see their name lying vertically in a library. Yet the continuing belief that the electorate will be impressed by a glossy oblong talking up the candidate means that those who are running soon run towards a publisher. </p> <p>Cameron's decision feels canny. Rather than pretending to have written a book himself, and reserving that charge for potential teasing of Brown, the Tories have anglicised a French tradition of book-length interviews with candidates - Nicolas Sarkozy was shadowed by the leading French author Yasmina Reza during his campaign. </p> <p>There's a telling moment in the Cameron book when he expresses the view that the Conservatives have been short of ideas in recent years, lazily falling back on formulas about bringing back old values. The book (and the long summer reading list he despatched to MPs) suggests a conscious attempt to rebrand the nasty party as the thinking party. </p> <p>Another possible attraction is that a book is harder to sabotage than subsequent methods of expression. A video posting from a politician can rapidly be morphed into its satirical antithesis; a blog can drag across cyberspace for ever its stinging tail of contradictory comment. A book, however, keeps its content to itself, although there is always the risk of gleeful reports of its speedy appearance in remainder stores. </p> <p>Which is where most campaign-related tomes are heading. In my office, there's a dusty section of shelving holding books written to convince us to believe in politicians long since discredited. Looking Forward: An Autobiography (1988) by George Bush Sr is now most notable for the fact that two pages are given to a family member detailed in the index as \"Bush, C. Fred (dog)\", while the son who is now president is mentioned only in lists of family members. </p> <p>One day, either the McCain or the Obama books will suffer this crushing redundancy. There are two inevitabilities at the end of a political career: tears and books. First, the departed commander's self-justifying memoirs, and then the biographies, progressively questioning their account. But, even in a culture with so many alternatives, aspirants to power still seem to have a touching desire to begin with a book as well.</p>",
  "<p>Barack Obama, generally regarded as a gifted orator, would do well to find time to unwind before he delivers the speech of his lifetime to the Democratic convention next week.</p> <p>A new analysis of Obama's voice patterns and the delivery of his speeches made available to The Guardian today, found the Democratic candidate somewhat restricted in his range of facial expression.</p> <p>Specifically, Obama's face is locked in an almost permanent attitude of anxiety, with his forehead muscles contracted.</p> <p>\"In all topics Mr Obama displays a similar worried, serious-looking facial pattern. Even when talking about more positive subjects, his facial expressions do not signal positive affective states,\" it said.</p> <p>The analysis, undertaken by the Vox Institute in Geneva for the Clearwater consulting group, reviewed footage of Obama's speeches and those of the Republican, John McCain.</p> <p>It relied on footage from four speeches conveying a range of emotions as well as digitised voice samples to rate the effectiveness of the two candidates in connecting with voters on the campaign trail.</p> <p>The habitual worried look is a potential liability for Obama, undermining the image he is trying to project of a confident leader. </p> <p>The disconnect could be disturbing for audiences, said James McBrien, the founder of Clearwater.</p> <p>It also undercuts Obama's outward appearance of extreme confidence.</p> <p>\"There is an element of the fact that he is on the edges of his comfort zone here,\" McBrien said. \"Going into a presidential campaign is not something he has done before and you could say it is written all over his face.\"</p> <p>Despite that failing Obama was the clear winner against McCain in the oratorical contest. The result is unsurprising given that McCain's own campaign team have gone to some effort to conceal his limitations as a speaker.</p> <p>McCain has had particular problems adapting to that staple of public speaking -- the Autocue. On the campaign trail, he has favoured smaller venues, where he can take questions from audiences, rather than the grand venues and stirring speeches that have become Obama's signature.</p> <p>Obama had high scores on six of the eight voice values, including diction, fluency, speed and modulation. His voice could have been a little louder at times, but the study praised his ability to reflect anger, positive emotions, and sadness.</p> <p>\"The dominating attitude as transmitted by his vocal style is that of concern and sincere involvement,\" it said.</p> <p>The study also praised Obama's use of hand gestures.</p> <p>The verdict on McCain was harsh.</p> <p>The acoustic analysis noted that the Republican's voice was pitched slightly high, and that it remained flat, or emotionless, even while he was talking about sad subjects.</p> <p>McCain's range of facial expression was just as unvaried. \"McCain's facial repertory is very poor,\" the analysis said. \"His smile is often not fully developed ie his cheek-raising muscles do not participate enough in the expression of positive affect (to be perceived as genuine).\"</p> <p>McBrien put it in terms that were even more stark. \"He has a poker face,\" he said. The problem with the lack of expression, according to McBrien, was that it makes it difficult for an audience to trust the speaker.</p> <p>The Republican is restricted in his range of motion because of injuries sustained during the Vietnam war. He tends to keep his hands by his side when he speaks.</p> <p>The Vox researchers also picked up on one of McCain's tics. </p> <p>The candidate who made a campaign slogan of his plainspeaking in the Straight Talk Express has a habit of completely shutting his eyes and slightly smiling immediately before coming out with one of his signature sarcastic comments.</p>",
  "<p>From the beginning of the Iraq war, the Bush administration and the military have done their best to stop photographers from taking pictures of American war dead. Their first big controversy arose in 2004 when the Seattle Times angered the Bush administration by <a href=\"http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2001906489_kuwait18m.html\">publishing a front-page picture</a> of flag-draped coffins in a cargo plane in Kuwait, and since then the Bush administration and the military have continued their anti-photo policy. Even the replacement of secretary of defence Donald Rumsfeld with Robert Gates has not made a difference.</p> <p>The Bush administration has, if anything, let its worries about the presidential election heighten its anti-photo policies. This summer Gina Gray, the public affairs director at Arlington cemetery, was <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/story/2008/04/23/ST2008042303339.html\">fired from her job</a> for allowing the media access to Arlington burials when families of the fallen gave their permission for it, and in Iraq, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/jul/29/iraqandthemedia.usa\">Zoriah Miller</a>, a freelance photographer who posted photos on the internet of Marines killed in a suicide attack, was <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/26/world/middleeast/26censor.html?scp=1&amp;sq=zoriah%20miller&amp;st=cse\">barred from working</a> in Marine Corps-controlled areas of the country.</p> <p>For a president caught in an unpopular war, the attempts at censorship are understandable, but what the Bush administration and the military really needs to do is take a page from the second world war's lessons in photographing the fallen. </p> <p>The differences between now and then are striking but not, as we might imagine, because the Roosevelt administration and second world war military leaders were always candid. For the first 21 months of the war, censors withheld all photographs of American dead. As George Roeder notes in his landmark study The Censored War: American Visual Experience During World War II, Roosevelt's memory of visits to European combat zones while assistant secretary of the US navy in the first world war made him fearful of the harm graphic pictures of the dead could cause on the home front. </p> <p>But by 1943 Roosevelt's advisers were warning him of a different danger - home-front complacency about the war that stemmed from the public's underestimation of the toll it was taking on the military. The office of war information, headed by veteran radio commentator Elmer Davis, encouraged the president to authorise the publication of harsher pictures of the war in order to prepare for more casualties and to reduce civilian complaints over food and gas shortages. </p> <p>The advice produced a change in policy. By the fall of 1943, the US war department's bureau of public relations acted to release photos that it had previously withheld, and army chief of staff George Marshall urged his generals to have their photographic units send material that would portray the \"the dangers, horrors and grimness of war\".</p> <p>The big media breakthrough came in the September 20 1943, issue of Life, with the publication of <a href=\"http://www.digitaljournalist.org/issue0309/lm02.html\">George Strock's photo of three American soldiers</a> lying dead on Buna Beach in New Guinea. By historical standards the brutality in Strock's photo was minimal. The three dead Americans it shows seem almost at peace. As they lie sprawled out in the sand, they give no indication of having painfully suffered. Timothy O'Sullivan's US civil war photo <a href=\"http://www.getty.edu/art/gettyguide/artObjectDetails?artobj=64592&amp;handle=li\">A Harvest of Death: Gettysburg, July, 1863</a> was far more graphic than Strock's. </p> <p>Life was, nonetheless, still sufficiently worried about its decision to publish Strock's photo that it paired it with an editorial that observed, \"And the reason we print it now is that last week President Roosevelt and Elmer Davis and the war department decided that the American people ought to be able to see their own boys as they fall in battle: to come directly and without words into the presence of their own dead.\" </p> <p>Neither Life nor the Roosevelt administration ever had reason to regret their decisions. Surveys showed that by 1943 the public was prepared to deal with pictures of the war dead and that these pictures could even help make people more sympathetic to bond drives. In January 1944 George Marshall followed up his 1943 directive with a cable instructing his commanding generals to send onto Washington photos that reveal the war \"as it is actually being fought, without the usual effort to eliminate the tragic aspects of battle\".</p> <p>In a nation that was paying higher taxes, experiencing gas shortages and conducting scrap drives, such candour paid dividends. \"War calls for sacrifice,\" President Roosevelt insisted. \"That sacrifice will have to be expressed in terms of a lack of many of the things to which we all have become accustomed.\" With photos of Americans killed in battle now visible in newspapers and magazines, the Roosevelt administration could push even harder for sacrifice on the home front. The deaths of their citizen soldiers, Americans came to believe, needed to be made meaningful. Carrying on business as usual - as the United States has throughout the Iraq war - was not an option.</p>",
  "<p>Last week, <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-caljobs16-2008aug16,0,178127.story\">California's unemployment rate hit 7.3%</a>. In the Sacramento region, home of the state's government, it's heading toward 7.5%. In some parts of the state, one in 10 workers is now listed as being unemployed. The figures are depressing, but they aren't exceptional these days. All over America, <a href=\"http://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.nr0.htm\">unemployment is rising</a>, with 5.7% of the nation's workers currently looking for employment and industrial towns such as Detroit <a href=\"http://www.bls.gov/news.release/metro.nr0.htm\">seeing double-digit unemployment</a>. At least as worrying, so too is the deeper measure of joblessness rising (this is a more comprehensive figure that includes those who have given up looking for work and are no longer considered to be \"unemployed\"). </p> <p>At the same time, since 2005 Americans have had a <a href=\"http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=%7BD09C8048-99F1-40E4-9805-16EDAB3834B0%7D&amp;siteid=mktw\">negative savings rate</a>, meaning many people are spending more than they're earning, not putting aside rainy day funds and setting themselves up for a tremendous fall should they lose their jobs.</p> <p>Which brings me onto questions of retirement. If you don't have a job, don't have money set aside to cover the bad times and can no longer access home equity loans (since the mortgage crisis and the plummeting value of homes has pretty much put paid to that source of income), there's a pretty good chance you're going to <a href=\"http://www.stltoday.com/stltoday/business/columnists.nsf/jerristroud/story/5E7C338D9B403BB4862574A600811909?OpenDocument\">raid your retirement accounts</a> when the going gets tough. And that's exactly what's been happening in recent years, to the tune of tens of billions of dollars. </p> <p>Luckily, even if you pick your own pockets clean that way, when you get old and infirm there's still social security to fall back on. It's the last real government programme survivor from the New Deal days. And the good news is that, because social security is one gigantic pool of funds, there's no way you, as an individual, can raid that money before retirement. It's a form of forced savings, with the risk taken on by the government rather than by individuals. So, your retirement might not be quite as comfortable as you'd hoped, but you'll still have enough guaranteed money coming in to survive.</p> <p>Of course, all of that might still change. Campaigning for the presidency in 2000, George Bush sided with those who wanted to at least partially privatise social security, arguing that allowing people to invest some of their social security money in the stock market was the only way to ensure the programme stayed solvent over the coming decades. At the start of his second term in office, he actually staked \"political capital\" on moving in this direction. Of course, as his capital shrank (Bush's popularity ratings for most of his second term have hit record lows) so, too, did his ability to transform America's favourite big-dollar spending programme vanish. And here we are, in 2008, heading into another presidential election, with social security still intact.</p> <p>If McCain wins, however, the reformers will be in the driving seat again. Eight years ago, the Arizonan - along, it must be said, with several leading Democrats - defended Bush's proposal to allow seniors to take some of their social security funds and <a href=\"http://archives.cnn.com/2000/ALLPOLITICS/stories/05/04/ss.reform/index.html\">start investing them privately</a>. More recently, McCain has gone further toward endorsing privatisation, floating the idea of allowing young people to remove some of their social security contributions from the overall pool of funds and instead <a href=\"http://www.ncpa.org/pub/special/20080105-sp.html\">invest that money themselves</a> in the stock market.</p> <p>In the abstract, it's a tantalising idea. After all, during the good times stock markets make investors extremely affluent. In 1999 and 2000, when Bush proposed this, the market had been soaring for the better part of a decade. The problem is you have to know what you're doing, and you have to hope to hell the stock market doesn't tank just when you're getting close to retirement. If one or both of these isn't the case, you're left holding a whole bunch of risk and very little actual cash. That's what ended up happening to millions of people saving for retirement in England a decade ago. It's what happened to pensioners in Chile still a few years further back.</p> <p>Given the instability in global markets currently (the Dow has swung from a high of over 14,000 to a low of under 11,000 and back to 11,500 within the past year), one would hope politicians would be somewhat cautious in kicking away the guarantees currently provided by social security. Yes, the social security system faces enormous stresses as more and more baby boomers retire. And, yes, there's a case to be made for bringing in more funds through higher taxes on the wealthy. Perhaps there's also a case to be made for raising the retirement age so as to stretch funds further. In fact, both of these ideas have <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/story/2008/07/08/ST2008070801048.html\">entered the candidates' discourse</a> over the past few months. </p> <p>But why throw the retirees out with the bathwater? For all its faults, a state-run, state-guaranteed, social security system works. And in the nearly 75 years that it has been in existence, arguably, given current economic conditions, it's never been so vital as it is today.</p>",
  "<p>The US and Iraq have agreed on the need for timetables for a withdrawal of American troops, Condoleezza Rice said today although the two have yet to finalise a deal that has been the subject of protracted negotiations.</p> <p>The US secretary of state, who was making an unannounced trip to Baghdad, told a press conference that she had held fruitful talks with the Iraqi prime minister, Nouri al-Maliki, and that a final agreement was near that would \"solidify the significant gains\" in security in Iraq over the last year.</p> <p>\"We have agreed that some goals, some aspirational timetables for how that might unfold, are well worth having in such an agreement,\" Rice told reporters after meeting Iraqi officials. </p> <p>The Iraqi foreign minister, Hoshyar Zebari, who appeared with Rice at the press conference, said Iraq's neighbours need not be concerned about the agreement.</p> <p>\"This decision is a sovereign one and Iran and other neighbouring countries have the right to ask for clarifications. ... There are clear articles [that] say that Iraq will not be used as a launching pad for any aggressive acts against neighbouring countries and we already did clarify this.\"</p> <p>A key part of the US-Iraqi draft agreement envisions the withdrawal of American forces from Iraq's cities by next June 30.</p> <p>Earlier, Rice had downplayed reports that an agreement had been reached on a plan that Iraq has been pushing for that will pave the way for American troops to go home. Ahead of the trip, US officials said more fine-tuning was needed on a schedule for withdrawals, immunity from prosecution for US forces and the handling of Iraqi prisoners. </p> <p>Zebari conceded that officials had hoped to conclude the US-Iraq security pact earlier but internal political factors had prevented this.</p> <p>\"This agreement determines the principal provisions, requirements, to regulate the temporary presence and the time horizon, the mission of the US forces,\" he said. \"Really, we are very, very close to closing this agreement and as we said from the beginning, there is no hidden agenda here.\"</p> <p>Iraq says it would like the agreement to include dates for US forces to withdraw from the country, with the US ceasing routine patrols on Iraqi streets by the middle of next year, and withdrawing combat troops by 2010 or 2011. Withdrawal in two years' time would be in line with proposals by the US Democratic presidential candidate, Barack Obama, who wants American troops out by mid-2010.</p> <p>The Bush administration and John McCain, the Republican candidate, do not want to commit to firm withdrawal dates, preferring vaguer terms such as \"time horizons\" and \"aspirational goals\" for a pullout. The US, which still has about 140,000 US troops in Iraq, insists that it would be wiser to set a target linked to the attainment of certain objectives that would reflect not only security improvements but also progress on the political and economic fronts.</p> <p>Other issues that need to be sorted out include immunity for US troops from Iraqi law and the status of prisoners held by American forces. The US holds some 21,000 prisoners in Iraq who it considers dangerous but have not been charged with any crime.</p> <p>Rice said she would also discuss Iraq's failure to enact an election law to allow provincial polls due on October 1 to take place on time. The election law was held up in parliament because of a dispute between Kurds and other groups over how to run the oil-rich northern city of Kirkuk, despite strong American pressure for Iraqi politicians to reach a deal.</p> <p>A US-Iraq security agreement deal will allow US forces to stay in Iraq beyond the end of this year, when a UN security council mandate expires. The mandate for an international presence was enacted after the US-led invasion that toppled Saddam Hussein in 2003.</p>",
  "<p>Nato's support for Georgia has angered Russia and a US deal with Poland has provoked them further. Some would argue <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/aug/21/nato.russia\">NATO has lost its way</a>.</p>"

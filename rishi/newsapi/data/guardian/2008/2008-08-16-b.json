  "<p>Under fire from Republicans, top Democratic politicians in the United States are considering lifting a ban on new offshore oil drilling.</p> <p>The issue is now at the forefront of the presidential election, as Republican candidate John McCain has made allowing new drilling one of the centrepieces of his campaign, claiming that it will help drive down petrol prices.</p> <p>Democrats have hitherto said new drilling would do little to relieve consumer pain at the pump, accusing Republicans of misleading the public and being a pawn of big oil companies. Yet signs are emerging that they are easing their opposition to the comprehensive ban. </p> <p>Last week House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said she would consider allowing a congressional vote on the issue if drilling was part of a wider energy plan that also focused on promoting alternative energy sources. Pelosi told a television interviewer that she would consider a vote, but 'it has to be part of something that says we want to bring immediate relief to the public, and not just a hoax'.</p> <p>More than 30 Democrats have signed up to sponsors legislation that could pave the way for fresh drilling off America's coasts. Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama has also moderated his stance, moving from staunch opposition to suggesting that new drilling could be part of a new energy strategy. That shift led to accusations from some of his supporters that he had flip-flopped.</p> <p>A group of politicians from both parties, dubbed the 'Gang of 10', has proposed a mixed strategy of new drilling and alternative energy, which could gather wide support.</p> <p>Yet plans for any fresh off-shore drilling have outraged environmentalists. They believe it will take years to develop any oil reserves and that the move represents nothing more than a bonanza for an oil industry that already gets huge tax breaks. They also believe it will eventually pave the way for drilling in ecologically sensitive areas, such as parts of Alaska.</p> <p>But the issue has become a problem for the Democrats after McCain enthusiastically embraced the idea. In the unusual setting of a massive biker rally in the small town of Sturis, South Dakota, the Republican recently told a cheering crowd: 'We're going to drill here and we're going to drill now!' It is a line that has since been repeated on the campaign trail and has struck a chord with those parts of the American public for whom high petrol prices are the key concern. It certainly threw Democrats off-balance, as they tried to push a more balanced energy policy with longer-term aims of reducing oil use. </p> <p>But energy policy has rapidly become the hot topic of the election, overtaking even Iraq or Georgia. In a country whose cultural and economic life is dominated by the car, there are no more passionate debates than over the doubling of petrol prices in the past couple of years. </p> <p>It has offered hard-nosed Republican campaigners an issue to rally around and a stick with which to beat an Obama campaign that has started to make rare missteps. In one recent incident Obama mentioned that, if Americans kept their tyres inflated correctly, it would save petrol consumption and reduce the need for drilling. The comment was factually true, but was seized on by Republicans, who carried out numerous stunts, such as delivering tyre gauges to reporters on the campaign trail. It became a powerful theme on conservative talk radio, where hosts lampooned Obama and accused him of putting tyre pressure at the forefront of his energy policy.</p> <p>In fact, the energy debate has enlivened a Republican party that has recently seemed moribund beside the huge and well-run Obama operation. It has allowed the party to attack the Democrats and set the agenda of the recent political debate, giving Republican activists a sense of hope.</p> <p>'This is a narrow race. Obama has a solid edge, but it is still close,' said Professor Shawn Bowler, a political scientist at the University of California at Riverside. The polls are bearing that out. As the party convention season looms, the RCP national average of polls has Obama ahead by just three points. In the battleground states the picture is mixed, with McCain ahead in Missouri, Virginia and Florida, and Obama leading in Ohio, Michigan and Colorado.</p>",
  "<p>Eagerly they came - the young, the ambitious, the smartest of the smart. They queued impatiently and crowded into the rafters above Charlie's Cafe at the 'Googleplex', the curving glass and steel cathedral of the internet age. Finally, laptops snapped shut and the room hushed. It was time for Barack Obama to preach to the converted. 'There is something improbable about this gathering,' said the presidential hopeful, gazing around a sea of T-shirts at Google's Californian headquarters. 'What we share is a belief in changing the world from the bottom up.'</p> <p>It was last November and Obama was asked whether he lacked political experience. He compared himself with the founders of Google, Larry Page and Sergey Brin, who a decade ago were university students with a big dream. 'I suppose Sergey and Larry did not have a lot of experience starting a Fortune 100 company,' he said.</p> <p>The rock star of American politics resonates at Google. Nicole Resz, a 26-year-old employee, said: 'He's fresh, he's new. There's something about him that's Google-like.' He was also the seventh presidential candidate to visit the company, following John McCain and Hillary Clinton, each seemingly determined to prove they had achieved that summit of modern aspiration - to be 'Google-like'.</p> <p>Can anyone become President of the United States without the patronage of Google? It was once a ridiculous question, but not any more. The fastest growing company in history is also arguably the most powerful. It has the potential to reach into every corner of our lives, from the way we get news, watch entertainment and do our jobs to the way we communicate, seek information and comprehend the world. Its clean white homepage and breezy colourful logo have become so embedded in our psyches that we 'google' without thinking (and use 'google' as a verb). I think, therefore I google. </p> <p>Ten years ago next month, in an innocuous suburban garage, Page and Brin, two geeky students at Stanford University, founded a company called Google. They would go on to create what is regularly voted the world's top brand, earn accolades as the world's best employers and become billionaires many times over. They would also, say their critics, cut a swathe through the laws of copyright, threaten to devour media like a 'digital Murdoch' and harvest more of our secrets than any totalitarian government - smashing the core certainties of advertising executives, book publishers, newspaper owners, television moguls and civil libertarians.</p> <p>Brin and Page's mission is to 'organise the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful'. They are doing it every minute of every day in indexed web searches, in blogs, in books, in email, in maps, in news, in photos, in videos, in their own encyclopedia. They have built a giant electronic brain made up of farms of computer servers connected around the world, a brain that learns and gains intelligence every time someone uses Google.</p> <p>It is the stuff of science fiction and it all happened so fast that no one could quite grasp it, still less try to stop it. Now all of us, from the farmer in Africa switching on his first internet connection to the next President of the United States, are learning to live in a Google world. It is conceivable that future historians will regard the first day of Google Inc on 7 September 1998, and not 11 September 2001, as the true dawn of the 21st century.</p> <p>'I don't think it's possible to exaggerate the significance of this thing,' says Andrew Keen, a British-born author and entrepreneur in California's Silicon Valley, cradle of the hi-tech boom. 'Every time I think of it, I'm amazed at every level. They're absolutely in the business of revolutionising the nature of knowledge; search has become integral in the way we think and act. In 50 or 100 years' time, when the real histories get written of the internet, it will start with those two boys at Stanford.'</p> <p>But Keen has a warning about the gatekeepers of cyberspace. 'They have amassed more information about people in 10 years than all the governments of the world put together. They make the Stasi and the KGB look like the innocent old granny next door. This is of immense significance. If someone evil took them over, they could easily become Big Brother.'</p> <p>Google's recent acquisition of an online advertising company called DoubleClick set alarm bells ringing. There were objections that it would give the company a near monopoly of the online ad market, widening its scope to collect users' personal data, but Google's powerful lobbyists helped ensure the deal was cleared by regulators in America and Europe. Politicians, such as the Democratic senator Herb Kohl, have belatedly started to ask whether it is growing too fast too soon. Last week America's House Committee on Energy and Commerce heard evidence of how Google and other companies track users' web surfing behaviour.</p> <p>Search engines are probably more important than ever to navigate the hyper-inflating internet: Google recently catalogued its trillionth web page. The company does not dominate in every country, notably China, but has just improved its share of the American market to 70 per cent. The technical wizardry surging through its colossal data centres to deliver instant results, however, only goes halfway to explaining how this altruistic start-up came to be seen as a corporate Death Star.</p> <p>From the beginning Page and Brin wanted to make information available for free and did not care much for business. They were backed by investment capital for the first three years and made virtually no profit. It was only when Google started placing relevant adverts beside its search results, and on other websites, that dollars came pouring in by the million and billion. It was a model that redefined the way business is done on the web for all sorts of participants: build traffic by giving content away for free, then make money from advertising. The formula is said to account for 99 per cent of Google's annual revenue of $16.6bn and profits of $4.2bn.</p> <p>The change has rattled old certainties and some producers of content have cried foul. They accuse Google of infringing copyright by using material without their permission or failing to give them a fair share of the profits. The debate will only intensify as eyeballs turn away from television and newspapers towards computer screens, where Google has an estimated two-thirds market share. Yet the company has also begun using its expertise to sell adverts in the old media of newspapers, radio and TV.</p> <p>Furthermore, when Google said all the world's information, it really meant all. Google News, launched in 2002, aggregates breaking stories from traditional media sources around the world. Newspapers complain that their hard-won exclusives are being hijacked to boost Google's profits. A group of Belgian papers successfully argued in court that the company stored their content without paying or asking permission and are now seeking damages of \u00a339m. In 2004 Google announced partnerships with leading libraries and universities to scan digitally millions of books from their collections. Today a visitor to Google Book Search can read on screen or download the full text of Oliver Twist, The Wealth of Nations or innumerable other out-of-copyright titles. A search will also bring up parts of books still in copyright.</p> <p>Google Maps and Google Earth, launched in 2005, offer an astonishing interactive map of the planet, stitched together from aerial and satellite footage licenced from Nasa and various private companies. Google Street View, released in America last year, takes this a step further by providing photographs taken at eye level, which has prompted media alarm about invasion of privacy; the company insists the UK version, yet to launch, will obscure faces and licence plates.</p> <p>But it was Google's acquisition in 2006 of YouTube, the phenomenally popular video sharing site, that caught most attention as a disrupter of the old media landscape. Its willingness to let people post and watch video clips for free has panicked the TV and film industries and provoked a $1bn lawsuit from the US entertainment group Viacom for 'massive copyright infringement'.</p> <p>Google's tentacles are everywhere. It runs services for blogging, email, instant messaging, shopping and social networking. It offers a suite of word processing, spreadsheet and other tools to rival Microsoft's products in the workplace. It is building a software platform for mobile phones that may challenge Apple's iPhone and others. It has just launched Knol, a peer-reviewed encyclopedia to take on Wikipedia. In America, Google Health enables users to maintain their own medical records. The company is also working on language translation, speech recognition and video search. Brin and Page even have their eyes on space: they have offered a $20m prize to anyone who can make a privately financed spacecraft able to land on the moon.</p> <p>Could this be too much responsibility for any single institution, let alone a multinational corporation? Google's informal motto, 'Don't be evil', is put to the test every day. An entity born in the laid-back utopianism of northern California now finds itself a $157bn global business empire, chasing profits, fighting or gobbling up competitors, blowing old business models away like matchsticks. And just as coal, steel and oil barons were once courted by politicians, today it is the turn of the masters of information. There is a political love affair going on with Google that both reflects and reinforces its position at front and centre of world affairs.</p> <p>Shortly after Obama's pilgrimage to the 'Googleplex', it was the turn of David Cameron. Cameron was accompanied there by Steve Hilton, his director of strategy, who has since moved permanently to California with his wife, Rachel Whetstone, Google's vice-president of global communications and public affairs (she is also godmother to Cameron's eldest son, Ivan). Andrew Orlowski, executive editor of the technology website The Register, says: 'The web is a secular religion at the moment and politicians go to pray at events like the Google Zeitgeist conference. Any politician who wants to brand himself as a forward-looking person will get himself photographed with the Google boys.'</p> <p>Washington, also, is keen to bathe in Google's golden light. Al Gore, the former Vice-President, is a long-time senior adviser at the company. Obama has been taking economic advice from Google CEO Eric Schmidt and received generous donations from Google and its staff. Google will be omnipresent at the Democratic and Republican national conventions, providing software for delegates such as calendars, email and graphics. 'Google has moved into the political world this year,' says its director of policy communications, Bob Boorstin, a former member of the Clinton administration.</p> <p>Google's staff in Washington include five lobbyists, among them Pablo Chavez, former general counsel for John McCain. This year Google moved into new 27,000-square-foot headquarters in one of Washington's most fashionable, eco-friendly buildings. Visiting senators and congressmen can now share in the famed 'googly' experience of free gourmet lunches, giant plasma screens and a game room, named 'Camp David', stocked with an Xbox 360 and pingpong. </p> <p>None of this much impressed Jeff Chester, the executive director of the small but influential Center for Digital Democracy, when he was invited there. 'It puts all the other lobbying operations to shame,' he says. 'They invite politicians into their Washington HQ to give advice on using Google to win re-election. It is the darling of the Democratic Party and there's no doubt that a win by Obama will strengthen Google's position in Washington.'</p> <p>Boorstin dismisses the claims, pointing out that rivals such as Microsoft, AT&amp;T and Verizon spend far more on lobbying and have been doing so much longer. He adds: 'It's a statement I find both funny and pathetic.'</p> <p>Chester, however, is an outspoken critic on a crusade. He continues: 'Google have been very hypocritical. They try to place a digital halo around their activities. They should be at the forefront of acknowledging that these are the most powerful marketing tools around and there should be safeguards in place. Google claims it's there to provide information but it's really there to collect data and provide advertising, and they simply can't own up to it.'</p> <p>These concerns do not apply to America alone. As chairman of the parliamentary Culture, Media and Sport Committee, John Whittingdale has clashed with Google several times, including most recently over whether YouTube should do more to block offensive content. 'There's no doubt they are extraordinarily powerful,' he says. 'There is concern about their dominance in online advertising. When someone is in such a strong position, you have to at least look at it. There is also the issue of behaviourally targeted advertising [the supply of ads deemed relevant based on the user's browsing history] which needs a code of conduct.'</p> <p>Like others before him, Whittingdale was struck by the peculiarity of Google's internal culture when he visited the Californian HQ. 'It's a bit like a cross between The Stepford Wives and Logan's Run: lots of happy people in shorts always smiling, and nobody over 40. All these bright young graduates playing softball in grounds while having great thoughts.'</p> <p>Google's laid-back ambience is credited as a key part of its success. Free perks for staff include three healthy meals a day, massages and laundry services as well as an on-site gym and swimming pool. Casually dressed engineers are often seen playing pool, volleyball or roller hockey, or sprawling on multi-coloured bean bags.</p> <p>Despite its environmental projects and its philanthropic arm, the perception of Google is slowly morphing from plucky David to sinister Goliath. In the words of former Intel chief executive Andy Grove, it is increasingly seen as a company 'on steroids, with a finger in every industry'. From a garage in suburbia, they are saying, came the company that ate the world.</p> <p>Number 232, Santa Margarita Avenue, Menlo Park, California, looks like another ordinary house in another ordinary street. Susan Wojcicki bought the four-bedroom property for about $600,000 in 1998 and rented out the garage to two Stanford students for $1,700 a month to help with the mortgage. Larry Page and Sergey Brin had met three years earlier when Brin was a tour guide for new students at Stanford University and Page was in his group. At first the pair, both born in 1973, found each other 'obnoxious'. But it was the start of a lucrative friendship.</p> <p>Page was interested in the maths of the fledgling world wide web and began studying how it linked together. His great insight was to think about websites like academic papers, which build arguments through citations of previous papers (and list them in the footnotes). Similarly, websites contain links which, when clicked on, take the user to another website. Page realised that the number of links to a page would be a useful guide to its relative importance. He worked with the Russian-born Brin to create an unfathomably complex algorithm which could rank pages in terms of relevance, then turn it into a search engine for the web. The first version of Google - named after googol, the term for 1 followed by 100 zeros - was released on the Stanford website in August 1996.</p> <p>Page and Brin have been described as the Thomas Edisons of the internet. Like many of history's great inventors, they were in the right place at the right time, riding the wave of the dotcom boom and riding out the subsequent crash. The co-founders never meant to build a business but now enjoy the fruits of success, flying around the world in a Boeing 767, kitesurfing and pursuing passions such as the environment: both own Toyota Prius cars. Brin and Page remain joint presidents, Brin in charge of technology, Page responsible for product launches, but the rapid growth of recent years has been steered by chief executive Eric Schmidt, 53, who came on board in 2001 as the commercial 'brain', negotiating the founders' evangelism and the shareholders' thirst for profits. It has been jokingly said that he provides 'adult supervision'.</p> <p>Now the biggest issue facing Google - the one that an unnamed Google executive has dubbed the 'atom bomb' - is privacy. Google is the most efficient information-gathering machine ever built. Every time you use it to search the web, the query you typed, the time and date, and the IP address and unique 'cookie' ID assigned to your computer are recorded and retained for 18 months. If you log in to one of Google's personalised services, such as Google Checkout, the company collects data tied to your sign-in. Its main objective is to learn about your preferences so it can give you better search results (did you mean 'Paris Hilton' the celebrity, or the hotel?) and target you with relevant adverts.</p> <p>Peter Fleischer, Google's global privacy counsel, says the company is making every effort to be transparent about what data it is gathering, including a series of explanatory videos on YouTube. He goes on: 'We offer services in two flavours. If you don't sign in, but go straight to search, then for all essential purposes the information is anonymous. If you do sign in, it'll remember your browsing history and give you the benefits of personalised search. Even for these services you can use a pseudonym: Google doesn't need to know and doesn't want to know your real name.' It is true that Google doesn't force anyone to reveal anything. But to quote a book currently popular among politicians, its users are 'nudged' towards entering more and more information about themselves in exchange for personalised services. Google can save you time and money, find a restaurant to your taste or a chemist to cure your illness, but only if it knows you well enough. Help it to help you; that is the siren song. Schmidt raised eyebrows on a trip to London last year when he declared: 'We cannot even answer the most basic questions about you because we don't know enough about you. The goal is to enable Google users to be able to ask questions such as \"What shall I do tomorrow?\" and \"What job should I take?\" This is the most important aspect of Google's expansion.'</p> <p>A month later, the human rights watchdog Privacy International ranked the company bottom in a major survey of how securely the leading internet companies handle their users' personal information. Liberty, the civil liberties organisation, and the National Consumer Council have also expressed concern.</p> <p>These are early shots in a long war over how much Google the world can stomach. Many within the technology industry are unwilling to call on government to clip its wings because it goes against their faith in an open internet, free of state interference. But the European Parliament is already scrutinising Google, and some believe it is only a matter of time before Ofcom, the media regulator in Britain, is forced to intervene. Orlowski of The Register says: 'It's the big regulatory issue of the next 10 years: how politicians deal with Google. If the web is as important as the politicians say, it seems odd that one company sets the price and defines the terms of business.'</p> <p>Others believe the free market will throw up alternatives, just as it did to the mighty Microsoft. Vasanthan Dasan, one of the web's pioneers and now an engineer at Sun Microsystems, perceives three threats to Google's dominance. 'First, social networks such as Facebook and MySpace are transforming information about you in a much more targeted and finely grained way; Google is behind on that. Second, mobile phones will become increasingly useful for information, and Google is behind on that too. Finally, there are quite a few companies working on personal genomics: knowing what your genes are so can you see your profile for genetic diseases and find customised medicine. Google will have a lot of challenges.' </p> <p>But what also seems certain is that, along with its sway over advertising, media and publishing, Google will seek to conquer domains that no one but Page and Brin have even dreamed of. In a world where television schedules are obsolete and content can be summoned on demand, for example, a search engine that can find the clip or programme you want will be more important than ever.</p> <p>'The problem with Google now is that they have to keep growing,' says Andrew Keen. 'If they wanted to, they could destroy the publishing business and kill newspapers. Everything they do has a profound impact. It's like that saying about America: when Google sneezes, the rest of the world catches a cold.'</p> <p>Born into the idealism of Silicon Valley, now courted by candidates for the White House, Google is not like other companies. It is colonising and drilling the mental space, a Shell or BP of information. Its casually dressed young staff, generally the brightest and best, have always typically asked: 'Why not?' It is now employing some wiser heads to explain why sometimes the answer really does have to be 'not'. It may already be too late. The thing of wonder that Page and Brin gave the world 10 years ago became an 800lb gorilla in record time. But no one remembered to ask - what happens when a gorilla just keeps growing and growing?</p> <p>\u00b7 Read David Smith's blog post and let us know your thoughts<br> on Google on the <a href=\"http://blogs.theguardian.com/technology/\">technology blog</a></p> <h2>Google by numbers</h2> <p><strong>Googol</strong> Mathematical term for the figure 1 followed by a hundred zeros, after which Brin and Page named their company (complete with spelling mistake).</p> <p><strong>4</strong> Number of people in the company when it started (in a garage in Menlo Park, California, in September 1998).</p> <p><strong>19,604</strong> Number of 'Googlers' (employees) worldwide, many of whom work at the 'Googleplex', the kooky HQ in Santa Clara, CA.</p> <p><strong>70:30</strong> Ratio of male to female employees. </p> <p><strong>60%</strong> Proportion of worldwide internet searches made on Google. </p> <p><strong>86%</strong> Proportion of total UK searches made on Google.</p> <p><strong>25,000 </strong>Number of web pages indexed by Google early on; today it's in the billions.

  "<p>It began when five men stole into the rustic village of Tkviavi. With its plum trees, walnut groves and vines, Tkviavi was one of a jigsaw of picturesque villages beneath the hulking mountains of central Georgia. Up the road was Tskhinvali - the grim Soviet-style capital of the backward rebel statelet of South Ossetia. Down the road was Gori, a town once more famous for its association with an unpromising cobbler's son, Josef Stalin.</p> <p>The men arrived outside Elene Maisuradze's modest cottage. Waving guns and speaking rapidly in Russian, they wanted to know where Elene had hidden her Lada. One of them was Ossetian; the others had come from Russia. 'I told them I had sold it,' she said. 'They asked me: \"Where are the boys?\" I said my sons were away. They took everything from my house, turned it upside down and left.'</p> <p>Soon more paramilitaries, armed with Kalashnikovs, turned up. 'They wanted to know where my basement was. I told them and said: \"We have plenty of wine. Please take it.\" They went to the basement, shot it up and came back. I was crying. They said in Russian: \"Rastreli, rastreli (kill her, kill her).\" My neighbour, a Russian woman, told them: \"Don't do this.\" They shot into the ground and said: \"Fuck Saakashvili.\" '</p> <p>The militia gangs were part of a murderous wave unleashed by Russia last week on Georgian civilians. The Russian army has now advanced deep into Georgian territory, capturing at least a third of the country, including Gori, the Black Sea port of Poti and the western towns of Senaki and Zugdidi. Yesterday they were within 12 miles of Tbilisi, the capital.</p> <p>At the same time, gangs of Chechen and Ossetian irregulars have been busy carrying out their own private ethnic cleansing. All week fires burned in Tkviavi, Karaleti, Eredvi and other looted villages along the South Ossetian border; smoke plumed across the valley and into the hazy Upper Caucasus.</p> <p>Survivors described how the irregulars roamed from house to house. They sifted out villagers with Georgian surnames, immediately executing all teenage boys. Nugzari Jashashvili, 65, was returning home across the fields when he saw gunmen approach the house of his neighbour, Gela Chikladze, 50. 'They cut his throat,' Jashashvili said. The same five-man gang looted his house and stole his generator.</p> <p>Jasashvili said the gunmen killed his cousin Koba, 40, and another man. They took two other local men hostage. After watching his neighbour's murder, Jashashvili hid in a cornfield.</p> <p>Once they had gone, he escaped, fleeing for three days across the fields towards Gori. 'We lived off peaches, apples and plums,' Jashashvili said. 'There wasn't any water. We drank very little.'</p> <p>Those spared were mainly the elderly. After gunmen came to her home Maisuradze, 73, also fled, packing an icon and other possessions in two plastic bags, and leaving the village on foot. 'The gunmen were laughing at us,' she said. One of her group - a 93-year-old woman - died on the road. 'We had to leave her,' Maisuradze said. She passed through burning villages full of corpses. 'There were bodies everywhere. I saw two dead women from my village lying on the ground. Everything was on fire.'</p> <p>Russia's war in Georgia is about more than just punishing Mikheil Saakashvili, Georgia's pro-American President, whose doomed military incursion into South Ossetia 10 days ago caused the most serious crisis between Russia and the West since the Cold War.</p> <p>The objectives of Russia's Prime Minister, Vladimir Putin, are much bigger: to create a new global order in which the US and Russia are equal partners again. Putin has frequently lamented the demise of the Soviet Union. He has described it as the greatest geo-political catastrophe of the 20th century. For Putin, the 1990s under Boris Yeltsin was a period of national humiliation in which a weakened Russia was forced to accept Western economic help and which saw former members of the Warsaw Pact embrace Nato, the West's military club.</p> <p>Over the past two years, Putin has given ample warning of his intentions to overturn the status quo in international affairs. Last year in Munich he launched a vituperative attack on America, denouncing its 'unilateralism'. The Kremlin has criticised Nato's westward expansion and the Bush administration's deal with Warsaw last week to site missile defence systems in Poland and the Czech Republic. Nato membership for Ukraine and Georgia would, Putin made clear, be the final straw.</p> <p>Putin's aim, it appears, is to rewrite history, in particular the narrative that suggests that Russia lost the Cold War. Over the previous eight years as President, he has fashioned Russia into an advanced post-modern authoritarian state, governed by former KGB officers whose attitudes to the West were forged under communism. Putin has apparently never been reconciled to Russia's new boundaries, which left millions of ethnic Russians living outside the borders of the Russian Federation in Ukraine, Georgia, the Baltic states and Central Asia.</p> <p>Nor is there any doubt about ordinary Russians' views about the war in Georgia. 'Suck it and cry,' announced one piece of graffiti on a Moscow wall, an opinion echoed by most Muscovites.</p> <p>'The Georgians were absolutely in the wrong,' said Igor Pavlov, 23, a driver.</p> <p>'They got what they were asking for.' Andrei Teryoshin, a 35-year-old businessman, agreed: 'We were fighting to defend the people of South Ossetia, and I am proud of that.'</p> <p>Anatoly Pavlov, a theatre director, went further: 'I want to complain about the one-sided reporting from the West. Your reports are not correct; they are not right. The West has been reflecting only the Georgian point of view.' Nor was there any doubt about who was the initial aggressor.</p> <p>'It's perfectly obvious - Georgia, of course. And it's not the first time either,' said pensioner Felix Bezik.</p> <p>'This Saakashvili bloke, it's clear he's just an American puppet,' added Ivan Sidorov, 63, a sports instructor. 'That's how I see it: either he's sick or he's evil, the way he's treated Russia.'</p> <p>At the same time analysts at the Kremlin have given free rein to conspiracy theories. Sergei Markov put the Caucasus crisis down to a dastardly plot by Dick Cheney, US Vice-President, and Republican presidential candidate John McCain. A confrontation with Russia would be extremely useful just before the US presidential election, exposing Democratic candidate Barack Obama's inexperience in foreign and security policy and boosting McCain's chances. Such is the paranoid world view of an analyst well connected to the entourage of Vladimir Putin, who guarantee that such scenarios get an extensive airing on the Kremlin-controlled TV channels.</p> <p>With such views being expressed at home, Putin clearly feels he is in a strong domestic position as he presses to get back some of Russia's old territory. Georgian observers expect Putin swiftly to absorb Georgia's secessionist provinces of Abkhazia and South Ossetia, which broke away from Tbilisi during the 1992-93 civil war. Both regions are likely to hold popular referendums on a formal or semi-formal union with the Russian Federation. Russia will justify this de facto annexation by pointing to the need to protect Abkhaz and Ossetian citizens from Georgian aggression.</p> <p>'I expect this to happen within a couple of days,' said Zaza Gachechildaze, a Georgian analyst who predicted a war between Russia and Georgia in August. South Ossetia would vote to unify with Russian North Ossetia, while Abkhazia would declare itself independent and then associate with Russia, he said. Nor will this bring an end to Putin's ambitions, he said. His next target is likely to be Ukraine - in particular, the Crimea, home to Russia's Black Sea Fleet.</p> <p>For Nana Tetsladi, 35, there were no doubts last week about Putin's ruthlessness, or his nonchalant defiance of world opinion. Russian Sukhoi SU-25 bombers pulverised her five-floor block of flats last Sunday, targeting the residential suburb of Verxvebi, on the outskirts of Gori. They bombed for three consecutive days.</p> <p>'We fled 15 minutes before the bombs hit,' Nana said. Not everyone managed to get out, she added. Her pregnant neighbour, Marca, was killed, she said, together with her husband. Their seven-year-old son was injured. The twisted remains of Marca's car still stood outside yesterday, a blackened ruin, smelling of burnt flesh.</p> <p>The bombs also fell on Gori's Stalin Square, next to the grandiose Soviet-era museum to Stalin and the green railway carriage in which the dictator travelled to the 1945 Yalta conference. At least five civilians, including a Dutch journalist, were killed. With no discernible military target, it seems clear that the Kremlin was effecting its own form of collective punishment on the town, 17 miles from the border with South Ossetia.</p> <p>Two days after Russia's President, Dimitry Medvedev, announced he was halting military operations, Russian tanks rolled into the centre of Gori, parking outside its sandstone church. This swift action took residents by surprise.</p> <p>'I saw a soldier on the street. I assumed he was Georgian and asked him in Georgian for a light. He turned round and spoke in Russian,' Giorgi Maraneli, 48, said. 'He gave me a match and we shook hands.'</p> <p>Russian tanks took up positions just outside Gori, chopping the road that connects the east and west of the country and dividing Tbilisi from its Black Sea holiday coast. Yesterday Georgia said Russia bombed the last rail link between the two divided halves, dismembering the small nation still further.</p> <p>The mood on this new front line has sometimes been friendly. Young, multi-ethnic Russian soldiers posed for photographs as armoured personnel carriers clattered through the undergrowth, noisily squashing small fir trees and leaving swirling patterns on the grey tarmac. One 30-year-old Russian officer, Major Nail, from Dagestan, turned out to be both witty and philosophical. Why had he invaded Georgia? 'There isn't any difference between Georgia and Russia,' he suggested. This was his first trip to Georgia, he said, adding: 'The landscape is beautiful. But we also have big mountains in Dagestan.'</p> <p>This innocuous mood is clearly illusory. On Thursday, a drunken South Ossetian general arrived at the Russian checkpoint in a stolen white Lada. He got out, puffing and red-faced, removed his pistol and started firing in the air. One of his henchmen fired into the ground; he then hijacked a United Nations Jeep. A battered mini-van carrying South Ossetian paramilitaries and flying the Russian flag careened down the road to Tbilisi. One was wearing a black balaclava; all were heavily armed; their mood was exuberant. Asked what they were doing, one joked: 'We're on holiday.'</p> <p>After fleeing for three days, Elene Maisuradze began trudging along the dusty road from Gori back to Tbilisi, 40 miles away. Five other villagers had come with her - an old woman dressed in black; a vigorous woman in her seventies and a couple with a young son wearing a green tracksuit. They had clearly come together in a collective struggle to stay alive. A Russian armoured column approached. The group dived into fields and hid behind a mud embankment. After five minutes they emerged - keening and weeping.</p> <p>'My husband died 14 years ago. I wish I'd died soon after him. I can't walk any more,' Maisuradze said, halting under a tree next to a petrol station. She put down her stick and showed off the few possessions she had salvaged - black-and-white photos of her as a young woman, a Bible and her icon of the Virgin Mary. 'My generation grew up during the Second World War. We were always crying. It was a terrible situation,' she said. She added: 'Now I'm old and I'm in a war again.'</p> <p>With Georgia's army beaten off the field of battle, the Kremlin has sent columns of armoured vehicles trundling through the scenic countryside. Every day the Russians get closer to Tbilisi; yesterday they were blocking a junction 12 miles away.</p> <p>These advances have caused panic in Georgia's shattered military. The Georgians have modern kit and American-style Toyota Jeeps, but they have no air force left and no tanks, and are no match for the Russian war machine.</p> <p>These theatrical Russian advances have a clear purpose: to menace Saakashvili and to underscore the irrelevance of European and US diplomacy. Nobody doubts that Putin wants to overthrow Georgia's pro-Western government. It is also personal: Putin's loathing for Saakashvili is boundless, Georgian officials say. 'The idea is to punish Georgia and the Georgian government. And Misha [Saakashvili]. They hate Misha,' said Irakli Batkuashvili, the head of Georgia's military planning division.</p> <p>On Friday, the US Secretary of State, Condoleezza Rice, condemned Russia's invasion of Georgia and called for an 'immediate withdrawal' of Russian troops. She also said the 'free world' needed to start a debate about the 'profound implications' of Russia's actions. 'You can't be a responsible member of institutions that are democratic and underscore democratic values and on the other hand act in this way against one of your neighbours,' Rice said, after holding almost five hours of talks with Saakashvili at his unfinished hilltop palace in Tbilisi. As she spoke, nine Russian armoured personnel carriers rolled towards her press conference.</p> <p>So far, however, the US assistance to occupied Georgia has only comprised moral support and humanitarian aid. The Bush administration has no plans to offer its ally military assistance with which to take on the Russians. Moreover, the 'free world' has found few levers with which to punish Putin.</p> <p>Rice's comments about the need for the West to re-evaluate its relationship with Moscow appear to be a hint that Russia could soon be excluded - formally or otherwise - from the G8 and other international institutions. The West's most stinging gesture would be to take away the 2014 Winter Olympics from Russia: they are due to be held in Sochi, 12 miles from Abkhazia.</p> <p>None of this is likely to bother the Kremlin much. As Saakashvili pointed out on Friday, the Kremlin has tested the West's reactions with a series of provocative steps, discovering each time that the Europeans generally don't do anything. Dubbing Russia's leadership 'evil' and '21st-century barbarians', Saakashvili lambasted the EU for its feebleness. The Russians had dispatched agents to murder Alexander Litvinenko in a 'nuclear attack', poisoned Ukraine's President, Viktor Yushchenko, and - last month, during Rice's last visit - sent jet fighters into Georgian airspace. The Europeans did nothing, he said. 'Russia has been all the time testing the reactions of the West. It's going to replicate what happened in Georgia elsewhere,' he warned.</p> <p>Certainly there was little sign of any strength of European outrage at events in Georgia. Germany's Chancellor, Angela Merkel, in particular, has said that both sides are to blame, a comment suggesting that Germany's relations with Russia are more important to her than Georgia's struggle for survival.</p> <p>Indeed, it was only until the middle of last week that Europe made any significant diplomatic move to try to end the crisis in Georgia, when the French President, Nicolas Sarkozy, and his Foreign Minister, Bernard Kouchner, exploiting France's European Union presidency, intervened. Kouchner was dispatched first to Tbilisi, then to Moscow, to explore the prospects for a ceasefire and to gauge whether Sarkozy could profit from heading east. The Russians would be happy to talk to Sarkozy, he reported back to the Elys\u00e9e, so the French President went to Moscow and spent hours haggling with Putin instead.</p> <p>The result was a six-point ceasefire plan, essentially on Russia's terms, which Sarkozy then took to Saakashvili in Tbilisi for a midnight session. The proposed pact was a bitter blow to Georgian sovereignty, curbing the activity of its military on its own territory while giving Russia the right to mount patrols and take 'additional security measures' on sovereign Georgian territory. For its part, America was alarmed, though supporting the peace bid in public. En route to Tbilisi, Rice stopped off in France to stiffen Sarkozy's sinews and try to shape the mediation effort.</p> <p>At first the Kremlin said it was in no hurry to sign a deal and only announced late last week that President Medvedev had agreed to the plan. However, Sarkozy could not get Saakashvili to sign at first, and it was only when Rice arrived that the Georgian leader backed down and flourished his pen, bolstered by US emphasis that the Russian security concessions would be limited in time and space. As Rice headed for the presidential ranch in Crawford, Texas, to brief Bush, it appeared that Putin had gambled and won.</p> <p>Nor is it surprising that European reaction to the invasion of Georgia has been so limited. The Europeans - quite simply - have more to lose. Like the Soviet Union's invasion of Czechoslovakia 40 years ago this week, this invasion took place in August. But it is in winter that the Kremlin can exploit Europe's great weakness - by cutting off its oil and gas supplies.</p>",
  "<p>Barack Obama has not yet chosen an official campaign song... except that he sort of has. Following a particularly school-marmy series of barbs from Hillary Clinton back in April, he told a North Carolina crowd: 'When you're running for the presidency, you've got to expect it.' Then he grinned like crazy and reached up and brushed his shoulder off, with exactly the wrist-flicking gesture used by Jay-Z in the video for 'Dirt Off Your Shoulder'. North Carolina (and, moments later, the entire world wide web) went bananas. </p> <p>Obama's grin told everyone that he knew exactly what he was doing; here is a presidential candidate who listens to Jay-Z! Who can reference him slyly, make an inside joke with a whole generation. It was a dicey move to even tacitly use a song who's chorus contains the 'N' word ('If you feelin' like a pimp nigga, go and brush your shoulders off) but Obama managed. </p> <p>'The senator does,' said a spokesman, 'have some Jay-Z on his iPod.' </p> <p>The last time America had a presidential candidate groovy enough to harness the power of rock was 1992. The candidate was Bill Clinton, the band was Fleetwood Mac, and I was still in high school, a few months shy of legal voting age. I saw so much of my parents in the Clintons: when the confetti canons fired to the tune of 'Don't Stop', when the Clintons and the Gores cut loose with their cringey old-folks-at-a-wedding dance all over the stage, it was as if my parents' Big Chill-style reunion weekends had just upped and gone on to the big leagues. Here was a candidate who was, finally, theirs, and to me it all felt very safe. We'd lived through Reagan and Bush (my brother's only documented act of rebellion was sending away, aged nine, for a signed photo of Ronald Reagan) but here was this openly flawed, lefty man with a complicated marriage and goofy-haired past.</p> <p>Forget for a second everything that came after: in that moment he was Elvis for the former war-protesting, Procol Harum-listening baby-boomer set. </p> <p>But he was never mine. He belonged to the people old enough to vote for him, and old enough to swell in the chest at the sound of Stevie Nicks. </p> <p>It's not accurate to say that young people weren't voting before the coming of Barack Obama: the youth vote tide actually began to turn in 2004, an election that saw the highest youth vote turnout since the voting age was lowered in 1972. Some 35 per cent more 18-29 year olds voted than had in the previous presidential election, and they even outnumbered the over-65s by one million voters. The reasons for this are grim: peaceful times breed complacency, and America was hardly in the midst of peaceful times.</p> <p>'One of the very few bright spots of 11 September was that it made politics very relevant,' says John Della Volpe of Harvard's Institute of Politics. 'We had a lot of young people saying, \"I'm not going to leave this to my parents any more because this is where that got us.\"' And then, of course, that generation got us into the war in Iraq. My father called me on the first day of the horrific 'shock and awe' bombing of Baghdad. He was a wreck. 'You would think,' he said, 'that after all we'd been through, my generation would do better.'</p> <p>'High youth voter turnout was very much an anti-war thing,' says Alexandra Acker of the Young Democrats of America. 'Young people were the first to turn against the war because it was our peer group fighting it.' So the younger voters were out and ready, but neither party was offering a candidate who was, you know, for the kids. (Or even a candidate who might understand the sarcasm of that particular vernacular.)</p> <p>Barack Obama talks about things that other generations consider verboten: his past drug use, his struggle to accept and understand his racial identity. He's optimistic. He fist-bumps with his really cool wife. And, of course, he's really handsome. 'He's like a perfect storm candidate for the youth vote,' is how Acker puts it. (And just to return for a second to hip hop: it doesn't hurt that Jay-Z spent much of this spring's 'Heart of the City' tour endorsing Obama. He'd project a huge photograph of the senator's grinning mug up on stage and shout: 'Are we ready for a change?' The crowd would go wild.) </p> <p>According to Della Volpe, the IOP's polls have found that the millennials (his name for 18-29 year old voters) don't consider race much of a factor at the polls; nonetheless there's something about Obama's non-whiteness that is familiar to that generation. 'Young people see themselves in Obama because he's young, and he's bi-racial,' says Acker. 'And this is the most bi-racial generation this country has ever seen.'</p> <p>And younger voters tend to be less xenophobic than their older counterparts: when conservative pundits attempted to draw attention to Obama's middle name - Hussein - in a racist and derogatory way, there was a small movement launched on Facebook in which younger voters changed their pages to suggest their own middle names were Hussein, too, in some sort of virtual 'I am Spartacus' way. </p> <p>Facebook was a perfect medium for the Hussein message because Obama has understood, from the very beginning, how best to use it. A huge percentage of the $25 million he raised in his first quarter of fundraising came from $50 and $100 donations sent from home computers. </p> <p>'In the past it was always very expensive to reach young voters,' says Della Volpe, 'but with the rise of Web 2.0, the cost of the acquisition of a young voter today is significantly less than it was a generation ago.'</p> <p>Many millennial voters are on college campuses and have to deal with the paperwork bureaucracy of absentee ballots. And they're moving all the time. The web sort of obliterates these obstacles. If you can 'friend' Obama on Facebook, you can certainly find your polling place. </p> <p>It's all working so well, in part because of one of Obama's key campaign hires: Chris Hughes, a 24-year-old Harvard graduate who worked with Mark Zuckerberg on the original design of Facebook. Obama's homepage (my.barackobama.com, MyBo for short) contains links to accounts on Facebook, MySpace, Flickr, Twitter, YouTube, and other platforms that no one over 40 has much to do with. There are rumours of Obama emailing with Scarlett Johansson (who sang about him on YouTube). John McCain, meanwhile, gives an interview to the New York Times in which he says he's 'learning to use the internet', and that he 'doesn't expect to be a great communicator'. </p> <p>Obama-love is not embarrassing, even in New York's most jaded circles: I got an invitation to a downtown book party last week with two URL's at the bottom: one for the author, the other for www.barackobama.com. On the bulletin board of the Lower East Side building where my boyfriend - along with half of the other self-employed artists downtown - keeps a studio, a postcard shows a picture of a grinning Obama surrounded by thumbtacks arranged in a heart. There are all sorts of groovy Obama T-shirts, and celebrities have taken to wearing them down paparazzi-dense Robertson Boulevard in LA: one a silk screen of his face above the word PROGRESS. Another declares: OBAMA IS MY HOMEBOY. </p> <p>I don't know what song Obama will choose for the Democratic National Convention in Denver next week, when he speaks not within the auditorium but outside, to a far bigger and more diverse crowd. It probably won't be '99 Problems' (it goes: 'I got 99 problems but a bitch ain't one)', which one overzealous fan blared out during one of his primary fundraisers. In fact, it probably won't be Jay-Z at all (reports last week suggested British soul singer Joss Stone has been asked to write Obama's campaign song). But whatever he chooses, one can be sure the stadium bleachers will be filled with a crowd far younger and more psyched up than in conventions past, and that the Obama family will look far less awkward bopping along to it than will the McCains. </p> <p>And if all else fails, 'Barack the Vote' is just a really good T-shirt. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Amy Larocca is a contributing editor of New York magazine</p> <h2>Photographer Gaia Cambiaggi takes to New York's streets where Obama's supporters are making a fashion statement.

If this means the people wearing the shirt are engaged with the political process then that's fine, but there is a problem with the cool factor. My friend bought this T-shirt for me, and I have steered clear of buying merchandise that doesn't directly contribute to the campaign.</p> <p>I live in a mixed neighbourhood, and when I wear the T-shirt I feel a greater connection with the community here. People from all racial and financial backgrounds have initiated conversations with me who normally wouldn't. Obama represents this uniting force. He is willing to address the fact that America is far from perfect, in fact wildly flawed, in the way that recent politicians haven't done. For America to be this beacon of democracy it always says it is, it needs to acknowledge its flaws, look to other countries as models and build up from there. In terms of his biological and cultural make-up, he represents what America is - this racially mixed melting pot. It speaks to a lot of people who have moved to America or come from mixed families.</p> <p><strong>Kellam Clark, 30, furniture maker and artist</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-336663764\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2008/08/16/kellam2.jpg\" alt=\"Kellam Clark\" width=\"140\" height=\"130\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>I was sceptical about Obama initially. I'd heard him speak a lot, and though I thought he was a good orator and said moving things in general, in terms of actual policy, I never saw it. </p> <p>But then during the period in which he was debating against Hillary and the Republicans, he came out on top. I thought, I'll support him - he felt like the only one available to me. I'm now supporting [independent presidential candidate] Ralph Nader since he jumped back into the race. But I don't see it as a contradiction to wear the T-shirt. I still see it as important to endorse Obama, as one of the politicians we have available to us as progressive Americans. I don't go for the dream stuff, but he represents a changing of the guard. </p> <p>I live in a black neighbourhood in Brooklyn, and I work with a lot of young African-American people who have no hope, and it's interesting to hear them finally engaged a bit in politics. I want to support those conversations that are occurring in my neighbourhood by wearing a T-shirt with a black candidate.</p> <p><strong>Ed Ballard, 31, architect</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-336663765\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2008/08/16/edb2.jpg\" alt=\"Ed Ballard\" width=\"140\" height=\"130\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>My friends and I think we are going to vote for Obama, and that's because of his politics. But his personality and race are so important as well. There's supposed to be an American ideal that if you are from a racial minority and a one-parent family, you can still achieve. It's like, with Obama, America is putting it's money where its mouth is. </p> <p>This could have an effect on young black people. When I was a kid, of American-Indian and African-American parentage, I never really believed that this was possible. It didn't feel like the rules applied to you. But if this is a possibility, it makes people realise it is viable.</p> <p>Even now kids walking around my neighbourhood carry themselves with a lot of self-respect. There's a part of him which is counter-cultural. He's not the establishment. People will vote for him for political reasons but his race and where he comes from means that people can identify with him. That is why people are happy to wear his name on a T-shirt.</p> <p><strong>Viola Afrifa, 23, student</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-336663766\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2008/08/16/viola2.jpg\" alt=\"Viola Afrifa\" width=\"140\" height=\"130\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Wearing a Barack Obama T-Shirt means that I support his political programme. This is the way that I can express my politics. If I completely share the beliefs of a politician then I can wear his face on my T-shirt, and I do with Obama.</p> <p>I'm fascinated by Obama's eloquence, the way that he speaks, both in terms of rhythm and words. I'm studying political communications, the way people project themselves, and he uses all of the techniques. The academic interest alerted me to Obama at first, and then it became political.</p> <p>Obama is happy to negotiate without conditions, or so he says. He has a new way of dealing with other countries without looking only at American self-interest. This is something quite revolutionary.</p> <p><strong>Ki and Sei Smith, 16 and 18, students</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-336663767\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2008/08/16/smith2.jpg\" alt=\"Ki and Sei Smith\" width=\"140\" height=\"130\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>Sei: </strong>I'm wearing it partly because I like how it looks and partly because I support Obama. I'm not a political person but the other candidates didn't speak to me. I saw Obama on television saying that you don't necessarily need experience if you have belief, and that sometimes experience can cloud your vision. I thought that was interesting and cool.Obama is similar to Lincoln in that he is a visionary. He's not as extreme as most young people, but he is a bridge to more radical views. To be a politician in America you can't be extreme, but he is pretty radical as politicians go.</p> <p><strong>Ki: </strong>Wearing this T-shirt is of course about supporting Obama but it's also a fashion statement. Obama represents change, more than any other candidate in the past 20 years. He speaks to a younger generation. He's well grounded. I haven't really followed previous elections but I've found the Democratic race really interesting. I think it's drawn in people who wouldn't normally care about politics and elections. If Obama won it would be a great step forward. He is the polar opposite of Bush.</p> <p><strong>Tony Gabaton, 30, community organiser</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-336663768\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2008/08/16/gabaton3.jpg\" alt=\"Tony Gabaton\" width=\"140\" height=\"130\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>I wear the T-shirt because I admire Obama's forthright and genuine rhetoric; he is just cut from a different cloth from most politicians. After everything that went down in Florida in 2001 I was very cynical about the whole political process. He has revived hope in me as well as others.</p> <p>He is an icon just because of what he has been able to achieve through his historical campaign mustering grass-roots support and donations. It has awakened something in the American people. It kind of frightens me because when people bring change, it always comes with the threat from people who want to keep things systemically the same.</p> <p>\u00b7 Interviews by Katie Toms, Ally Carnwath and Rafi Cooper</p>",
  "<p>Barack Obama's fundraising machine kept printing money last month, with his campaign <a href=\"http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5iU_P23eyGmxqE8EEa7ba6r86BpIwD92JGBPO0\">reporting today</a> that it raised $51m during the month, well ahead of John McCain's $27m.</p> <p>At the start of August Obama's campaign had more than $68m in the bank, while McCain's had just $21m.</p> <p>The July figure of $51m was below Obama's record-breaking total of $55m in February, and slightly less than the $52m the campaign raised in June. But by again breaking the $50m mark it suggests that Obama's fundraising operation has yet to run out of steam, and justifies his decision to forgo federal election funding.</p> <p>There was more good news for Democrats, with the Democratic National Committee reporting that it raised a further $27m during the month. (Its Republican counterpart raised $26m - but says it has $65m on hand.)</p> <p>The \"enthusiasm gap\" can also be seen in the total numbers of donors: Obama's committee <a href=\"http://my.barackobama.com/page/community/post/samgrahamfelsen/gG5Hzr\">reports</a> having passed the two million mark in individual donors, while McCain's has just 600,000. But the RNC total, combined with McCain's surplus, still <a href=\"http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/politics/2008117759_campdig16.html\">comes to $96m</a> - meaning that both sides will have plenty of cash to play with in the months leading up the presidential election on November 4.</p>"

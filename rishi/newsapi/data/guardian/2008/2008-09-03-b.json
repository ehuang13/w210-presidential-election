  "<p>The Republicans last night went to war against what the campaign manager, Rick Davis, yesterday described as \"frenzied scrutiny\" of Sarah Palin by the media as Palin spent a third successive day shuttered in her hotel suite in Minneapolis. She has given only one interview - to People magazine - since being named as John McCain's running mate.</p> <p>During her sequestration, Palin has been coached by senior campaign aides on McCain's policy positions, and has been honing the delivery of her address.</p> <p>Davis told the Washington Post yesterday that the speech prepared for the vice-presidential nominee - evidently before McCain had made his choice - was \"very masculine\". Once Palin got the nod, he said, \"we had to start from scratch\".</p> <p>Other aides said that last night's advice would depart from Palin's introductory speech last week - when she called herself a \"hockey mom\" - and would focus instead on her record as a reform-minded governor of Alaska and as an authority on energy. Until then, it was left to the campaign to beat back critics, and blunt the potential fallout from further revelations about Palin's background and family life.</p> <p>Rudy Giuliani, the former mayor of New York, led the charge yesterday, trying to link his record of governing a city of 8 million with Palin's experience as steward of a town of 8,000. In an interview with CBS, Giuliani argued Palin was more qualified to be president because she had been a governor and run a budget.</p> <p>He added: \"Has anybody ever asked Barack Obama, can you bring up your two kids and be president of the United States? They are asking, 'Can she be vice-president and be a mother?' Come on.\"</p> <p>As scrutiny of Palin intensified, Time magazine reported that as mayor of Wasilla, she had tried to sack a local librarian for refusing to ban certain books.</p> <p>\"The greatest opening we have in this election is that there are many disaffected Democrats who are seriously considering voting for the McCain-Palin ticket,\" Davis said in a conference call yesterday.</p> <p>The campaign is also confident of support from rightwing Republicans, who have abandoned their usual opposition to pre-marital sex to embrace Palin's pregnant daughter Bristol as a heroine to the anti-abortion cause.</p> <p>There was also sensitivity that continued discussion of Palin could damage her image outside the convention hall - even though the Democrats say the controversy was an asset to McCain because it distracted from the ailing economy.</p> <p>\"I guess I don't blame them. Because if you don't have any issues to run on I guess you want it all to be on personality. And if you've got George Bush's track record and John McCain voting 90% of the time in agreement with George Bush then you probably don't want to talk about the issues,\" Obama said during a campaign stop at Kent State University in Ohio.</p> <p>In a brief exchange with the Guardian yesterday, McCain's spokesman, Tucker Bounds, said he would not address any questions about Palin's travel within the US without reference to Obama. \"Before I begin to process your question, will you please let me know how many states Barack Obama had travelled to before he started running for president - and which ones they were,\" he wrote.</p> <p>The testiness even extended to Karl Rove, the mastermind of George Bush's election victories, who had suggested McCain's rationale for choosing Palin was winning the election, and not governing. \"Karl's wrong,\" snapped Steve Schmidt, a senior campaign adviser, on CBS yesterday. \"She's been under vicious assault and attack from the angry left.\"</p>",
  "<p>The Republican vice-presidential candidate, Sarah Palin, used her primetime national TV debut last night to cement her teenage reputation as Sarah \"Barracuda\" and drive home a concerted campaign strategy aimed at ending questions about her qualifications and experience.</p> <p>The first female Alaskan governor was scathing of any suggestion that her brief tenure - she has served just 21 months - was inadequate preparation to serve as John McCain's running mate.</p> <p>\"Before I became governor of the great state of Alaska, I was mayor of my hometown. And since our opponents in this presidential election seem to look down on that experience, let me explain to them what the job involves: I guess a small-town mayor is sort of like a 'community organiser', except that you have actual responsibilities,\" an advance excerpt of her speech said, drawing a comparison with the Democratic candidate Barack Obama's early political career in a Chicago public housing project in the mid-1980s.</p> <p>Palin went on to attack the media and Obama in a bid to fire up the party's social conservative wing who so far have been unenthusiastic in support of McCain. In her opening remarks, she described herself as a hockey mom with small-town roots. She went on to argue that the relatively thin CV, and limited knowledge of foreign policy, actually enhanced her status as a maverick reformer who could bring true change to Washington.</p> <p>\"I'm not a member of the permanent political establishment. And I've learned quickly, these past few days, that if you're not a member in good standing of the Washington elite, then some in the media consider a candidate unqualified for that reason alone.</p> <p>\"But here's a little news flash for all those reporters and commentators: I'm not going to Washington to seek their good opinion - I'm going to Washington to serve the people of this country,\" an excerpt said.</p> <p>Palin, like a number of Republican operatives earlier in the day, also set herself up as a more authentic change agent than Obama.</p> <p>The combative tone was in line with Palin's reputation in her teenage years as a fiercely competitive basketball player.</p> <p>Her speech came on a day when Republicans launched an aggressive new defence of Palin with television ads. But the brave front belied signs of Republican nerves about McCain's choice. Before last night's address, she was practically invisible at the convention.</p>",
  "<p>Ukraine's coalition government collapsed yesterday after its two ruling parties fell out over Russia's invasion of Georgia. President Viktor Yushchenko accused the prime minister, Yulia Tymoshenko, of attempting a coup and then threatened to dissolve parliament and call early elections.</p> <p>The pro-democratic coalition of the pair has only a two-seat majority. On Tuesday Tymoshenko's bloc voted with the opposition to strip the president of some powers and boost her own. Yesterday Yushchenko's bloc quit the coalition in protest, with the president denouncing the vote in Ukraine's lower house and urging the formation of a new coalition. </p> <p>The ostensible trigger for the government's collapse after less than a year is the conflict in Georgia. Speculation has grown that Ukraine and its Russian-speaking Crimea region could be the Kremlin's next \"target\". </p> <p>Yushchenko has outspokenly condemned the invasion of Georgia but Tymoshenko has not criticised Russia directly. On Tuesday her party failed to support a toughly worded statement blaming Moscow.</p> <p>Underlying this are political calculations before Ukraine's presidential election in 2010. Tymoshenko is expected to challenge Yushchenko for the presidency. Yesterday Tymoshenko bitterly criticised her former Orange ally of the 2004 revolution. \"The president and his office have used every means to ruin the coalition,\" she told a cabinet meeting. \"It's a pity that the president behaves with no responsibility. The coalition split yesterday, by his own decision.\"</p> <p>Under Ukraine's constitution the two parties have 10 days to sort out their differences and revive any coalition. If they do not do so, parliament is allowed 30 days to form a new coalition. After that the president has the right to call an election.</p> <p>One possibility is that Tymoshenko could form a new government with the opposition Party of Regions, her former adversaries. Polls show that if an election were held now Yushchenko's Our Ukraine party would lose seats while both Tymoshenko's bloc and the Regions party would make gains.</p>",
  "<p>Two senior Republicans, unaware that microphones were still running after a TV interview, let loose today with harsh criticism of Sarah Palin as their party worked to defend its vice-presidential nominee.</p> <p>A tape of the exchange between Republican strategist Mike Murphy - who worked for John McCain during the 2000 election - and conservative columnist Peggy Noonan quickly made the rounds on the internet, creating the latest in a series of Palin-related distractions.</p> <p>When NBC news political director Chuck Todd asked rhetorically whether Palin is \"the most qualified woman they could have turned to\", the tape shows Noonan replying: \"The most qualified? No! I think they went for this, excuse me, political bullshit about narratives.\"</p> <p>She later added, \"Every time the Republicans do that, because it's not where they live and it's not what they're good at, they blow it.\"</p> <p>Noonan published a Wall Street Journal column earlier today that praised Palin as \"powerful\" and \"a clear and present danger to the American left, and to the [Barack] Obama candidacy\".</p> <p>Murphy echoed Noonan's candid assessment, asking Todd on the live microphone, \"You know what's really the worst thing about it? The greatness of McCain is no cynicism, and this is cynical.\"</p> <p>The McCain campaign has stopped discussing the decision-making process that led to Palin's presence on the Republican ticket. </p> <p>McCain advisers have accused the media of mounting a sexist campaign to discredit Palin, who served as a small-town mayor before her current 18-month service as Alaska governor.</p> <p>But Murphy and Noonan were not the only Republicans to clash with McCain's message on Palin. </p> <p>Meg Whitman, the national McCain campaign co-chairman, said today that she does not think media coverage of Palin has been sexist.</p> <p>\"I actually think it's completely fair for the media to vet Sarah Palin,\" Whitman told Fox news.</p>",
  "<p>John McCain finally arrived in St Paul for the Republican convention today on the eve of the most important speech he has ever delivered and under pressure to at least match Barack Obama's inspirational delivery to the Democrats in Denver last week.</p> <p>He has to try to lift the 20,000 Republicans attending a convention that so far has lacked the energy of the Democratic meeting and win over millions watching at home.</p> <p>Campaigning had been virtually suspended while the politicians watched events on America's Gulf Coast. But with relatively little damage from Hurricane Gustav, both the Republicans and Obama resumed normal political exchanges today.</p> <p>McCain, who spent the early part of the week in the Gulf region, is hoping for a poll bounce from his speech that will put him in the lead nationally for the first time.</p> <p>The latest poll, for Gallup, has Obama on 50% for the first time against McCain on 42%, suggesting that Obama may have received some bounce from the convention last week. Reaching the 50% mark is symbolically important and comes after a month in which the two have been deadlocked in the polls.</p> <p>The proportion of undecided voters has shrunk to about 8%, according to the poll. This is a crucial time, with swing voters only now beginning to make up their minds, based on the conventions and the three presidential debates still to come.</p> <p>Republican campaign organisers said that today will mark a change in tone at the convention, becoming more overtly political after two days that were relatively soft focus.</p> <p>The change in tone, with attacks on Obama being stepped up, will be reflected in the line up at the convention tonight, three of the men that McCain beat for the Republican nomination: Rudy Giuliani, the former New York mayor, Mitt Romney, the former governor of Massachusetts, and Mike Huckabee, the former governor of Arkansas.</p> <p>Speaking earlier today, Giuliani resumed the Republican attack on Obama for lacking experience. \"I would say Barack Obama has never governed a city, never governed a state, never governed an agency, never run a military unit, never run anything,\" Giuliani told CBS.</p> <p>Obama, speaking at a rally in New Philadelphia, Ohio, today criticised the lack of any substance in the opening days of the Republican convention. He said that at the convention on Tuesday he had not \"heard a single thing about the economy\", the issue that Americans care most about.</p> <p>The day had focused on building up McCain's narrative, just as Obama's campaign had with him on the opening days of the Democratic convention.</p> <p>But Obama offered as evidence that McCain will fight on personality rather than issues a comment by McCain's campaign manager, Rick Davis, who told the Washington Post: \"This election is not about issues. This election is about a composite view of what people take away from these candidates.\"</p> <p>McCain, who earlier this week considered making his presidential nomination speech in a video link from the Gulf coast, was greeted at the airport today by his wife Cindy and his family as well as his vice-presidential running mate, Sarah Palin, and her family.</p> <p>McCain is to use the prime-time coverage of his speech to draw a contrast between himself and Obama, such as his plan to reduce dependency on Middle East oil. He is proposing to do this by increasing drilling for oil off the US coast and building 45 new nuclear plants.</p> <p>Previewing McCain's speech, Tim Pawlenty, the governor of Minnesota who was on the short list to be McCain's running mate, said that high petrol costs was the issue on the minds of most Americans.</p>",
  "<p>Dick Cheney's whirlwind Caucasus tour, which <a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/europe/09/03/cheney.azerbaijan.tour/?iref=mpstoryview\">began today</a>, will be interpreted by conspiracy theorists, Kremlin apologists, and by the Russian government, as further \"proof\" of their contention that the hawkish US vice-president and his neocon buddies deliberately provoked last month's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/georgia\">Georgia</a> crisis for American presidential election campaign purposes.</p> <p>The White House says Cheney will assess Georgia's future needs and study the broader implications of Russia's partitioning of the country when he meets President Mikhail Saakashvili in Tbilisi. The Bush administration was meanwhile due to announce a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/sep/03/usa.georgia\">$1bn bilateral economic aid</a> package to rebuild Georgia, in addition to an emergency $750m stand-by loan arranged via the IMF.</p> <p>A senior administration official said Cheney and Saakashvili would study the implications of the crisis and discuss \"a comprehensive long-term strategy by the international community to help Georgia recover, including the critical task of supporting the democratic choice of the Georgian people to integrate further with Euro-Atlantic institutions, including Nato\". That means, among other things, continuing and possibly increased US military aid.</p> <p>This statement should give pause to the architect of Russia's invasion, prime minister Vladimir Putin. Having been rebuffed earlier this year by France and Germany in its attempts to gather Georgia into Nato's fold, the Bush-Cheney team is now redoubling its efforts to bind the former Soviet republic to the west. If Europe won't help, the US will go it alone. Its powerful naval presence in the Black Sea is a token of this renewed and deepening commitment.</p> <p>Putin's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/sep/01/russia.georgia1\">bullyboy behaviour</a> has thus backfired. And it is likely to have a similar effect in terms of closer US relations with oil-rich Azerbaijan and a rattled Ukraine, where Cheney will also visit. Thanks to the Russian leader, Christmas has come early for the ageing cold warrior who is rapidly approaching enforced retirement. Cheney now looks less like a visiting dignitary and more like a general inspecting frontline positions.</p> <p>Cheney's contention that Russia represents a threat that must be confronted and contained has been given a new lease on life by Putin's putsch. Those in Moscow and in Europe who hope to increase a modernising, reforming Russia's engagement with international institutions and international crisis management have suffered a blow.</p> <p>Cheney and Putin deserve each other. At bottom, both men are backward-looking holdovers from the past. Describing Putin, Paul Quinn-Judge <a href=\"http://news.yahoo.com/s/csm/20080903/cm_csm/yquinnjudge\">writes</a> in Christian Science Monitor, \"he can best be characterised by the term 'sovok' \u2026 In this case, it can be summarised as someone who embodies the dark and circumscribed world view of the Soviet man in the street, suspicious of the outside world, resentful, who holds a grudge and remembers a slight. Putin speaks passionately about the 'tragedy' of the Soviet Union's collapse, a personally scarring time when he found himself unemployed.\"</p> <p>Cheney doubtless feels the same about the way the protracted Iraq disaster (not South Ossetia) has blown an irreparable hole in his dream of an omnipotent, all-dominating unipolar American empire championing a one-size-fits-all global values system and underpinned by unmatched military might.</p> <p>All the same, the suggestion that Cheney, making one last throw of the geo-strategic dice, actually engineered the South Ossetia crisis by effectively luring innocent, unwary Russian armed forces into a Georgian bear-trap does not bear close examination. The fact that Putin, and his front man, President Dmitri Medvedev, continue to claim that the whole plot was hatched in Washington to boost John McCain's campaign does not make it true.</p> <p>The sobering truth is, the bumbling, blinkered Cheney is not that clever.</p> <p>It is certainly the case that the US provided military trainers and instructors to the Georgian military and has done so since the <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/4532539.stm\">2003 Rose revolution</a>. It also provided military equipment and logistical assistance to help Georgia build up its defences and prepare for a Nato membership bid. Although Moscow may not have liked it, there was little that was clandestine about this US policy.</p> <p>And in any case, Russia continued to keep its troops on Georgian territory under a spurious peacekeeping banner, tolerating and in all probability abetting all manner of provocations launched by South Ossetian separatist militia.</p> <p>It is also the case that a McCain adviser, Randy Scheunemann, acted as a Washington lobbyist for the Georgian government, although he apparently severed those ties in May. Scheunemann undoubtedly sympathised with Georgia's position vis a vis Russia. But lending a sympathetic ear or even urging a tough line is very different from persuading or inveigling Georgia's leadership into an unwinnable, costly and ultimately deeply humiliating military confrontation.</p> <p>Even if you insist on believing Georgia was egged on into war by scheming Republican neocons, who may after all conveniently be blamed for most worldly ills, pause a moment to look at the resulting campaign fallout in the US. Has the Caucasus confrontation given a boost to McCain as the putative plotters hoped? It has not. So-called \"cold war II\" has been almost completely overshadowed by his nomination of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/commentisfree+world/sarahpalin\">Sarah Palin</a> as his running mate.</p> <p>In short, cheerleader trumped war-maker. Faced by Miss Congeniality, \"Commie dude Putin\", as columnist Maureen Dowd calls him, had no chance. Palin is probably a better shot, too \u2013 certainly better than Cheney. </p> <p>Saakashvili may be a hot-head. But he has not survived as long as he has in a tough neighbourhood by acting stupid at the behest of people like Cheney. \"Some months ago I was warned by western leaders to expect an attack this summer,\" <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/article/SB121988657412478425.html?mod=googlenews_wsj\">he told Melik Kaylan</a> in a Wall Street Journal interview last month.</p> <p>As related by James Traub in the New York Times, the months leading up to the August conflagration saw escalating provocations by South Ossetian forces and the Russian air force to which the Georgians responded, usually proportionately. During this period the US state department, anxious to avoid an escalation, repeatedly told Saakashvili to keep his cool.</p> <p>But in hindsight, it seems Putin was just biding his time until the moment came when Georgia overreacted. When it eventually did, in early August, his military plan of campaign was ready, the troops, marines, planes and ships were on alert and within easy call, and he immediately flew back from the Olympics to take charge.</p> <p>Saakashvili went on: \"I ask everyone to consider, what does it mean when hundreds of tanks can mobilise and occupy a country within two days? Just the fuelling takes that long. They were on their way. Would we provoke a war while all our western friends are away on vacation? Be sensible.\"</p>",
  "<p>The announcement of Alaska governor <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/sep/01/johnmccain.palin\">Sarah Palin as the vice-presidential nominee</a> for the Republican party has been spun in several different ways: as a \"bold\", \"game-changing\" pick, as a blatant pander to \"disaffected Hillary Clinton supporters\" and other women, or even as a last-minute \"Hail Mary\" choice, executed in desperation and meant to shake up the race that John McCain was all but bracing to lose. These are all valid considerations. More fundamentally, however, Palin's selection should be seen as an aggressive move from the GOP to reassert an advantage that by some accounts had been eroding, among one of the most reliably Republican voting blocs in modern memory: Christians. </p> <p>The Democrats, fresh off a well-received gathering in Denver, certainly had reason to think they had pulled a stealth move of their own. Barack Obama's campaign organisation, which brought the Democratic National Committee's operations to Chicago in June, had, as early as March of 2007, put a premium on getting the electoral support of churchgoing Christians, from Evangelicals to Baptists to Catholics.</p> <p>Obama already boasts endorsements from prominent religious voices like Douglas Kmiec, author Brian McLaren and the Rev KirbyJohn Caldwell, who presided over Jenna Bush's marriage. Among white evangelicals, he is running even with the last five democratic nominees, save Bill Clinton (a natural). One religious scholar recently marked the presence of \"'Obama-Curious' Evangelicals and Catholics\". And in August, he made his commitment to a robust voice for faith in politics even more obvious, calling for expanded faith-based initiatives.</p> <p>So more than she is a pick designed to reach out to Pumas and their ilk, Palin - a strongly anti-choice western evangelical traditionalist - is a pick for the people of faith in this country, the same four million \"values voters\" who, if exit polling is to be believed, handed the election to George Bush in 2004. In light of the Democrats' open pitch to these voters in 2008, McCain's selection joins a battle for believers like few ever witnessed in US electoral history.</p> <p>Despite his well-received August performance at Rick Warren's Saddleback Church in California, a proving ground for both candidates on moral issues (which Obama has visited twice), McCain is not a candidate that has endeared himself to the religious right. Astonishingly, some voters, Pumas included, still believe McCain to be a pro-choice candidate. Some conservatives have yet to discount his year 2000 <a href=\"http://www.iht.com/articles/2000/02/29/bush.2.t_9.php\">\"agents of intolerance\"</a> remark. His outreach to now-repudiated pastor John Hagee and <a href=\"http://voices.washingtonpost.com/the-trail/2008/07/16/catholic_activists_ask_mccain.html\">staffing of a catholic adviser</a> who had been suspected of sexual harassment can be seen as evidence of his unfamiliarity with movement conservatives and their religious leaders. And a summer survey by the Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life suggests that Republican identification among evangelicals is down 12% from 2004. This enthusiasm gap is something that has to trouble McCain's internal pollsters seeking to match and exceed Bush's turnout with this group.</p> <p>Obama, on the other hand, has long had an interest in reaching out to voters of faith. As he said <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfodbmS8ttg\">in a debate</a> this January in South Carolina: \"When you're not going to church, you're not talking to church folk. \u2026 I think that we can go after those folks and we can get them.\" In the months before the Iowa caucuses, Obama began a series of casual \"faith forums\" that would bring the state's heavily evangelical voting public together to discuss faith in politics - and hopefully to sign up for a more overtly political Obama town hall or rally. A campaign insider familiar with the organising effort told me that this strategy \"has been a huge break from the past in terms of religious outreach. We've elevated it to a central part of campaign and campaign message.\" </p> <p>This is a big improvement over the 2004 Democratic effort. \"Everything is different,\" says Mara Vanderslice, a religious organiser who headed John Kerry's efforts in that election. Vanderslice, who in 2004 had one intern and a cell phone between them, now heads a multi-state Political Action Committee devoted to <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpNQRp2R9Oo\">supporting Obama's efforts</a> to win the White House for the Democratic party. The group, called <a href=\"http://www.matthew25.org/index.htm\">Matthew 25</a>, takes its name from the very scripture Obama quoted in South Carolina - the call to \"[treat] the least of these as he would\" - and which has been an underpinning of the social gospel that animated preachers during the civil rights movement, and at Trinity United Church in Chicago, Obama's former faith home.</p> <p>The fruits of this new energy were on display in Denver, as the convention kicked off with a Faith in Action gathering that boasted figures from diverse religious traditions making the case for why Democrats should win over the \"values voters\" this year. Later that week, the Democrats' faith caucus - the first ever of its kind, held right alongside the women's caucus and the Hispanic caucus - boasted prominent religious leaders such as progressive evangelical Jim Wallis, powerful Catholic voice John Dilulio, Martin Luther King contemporary Otis Moss Jr, and former congressman and anti-choice Indianan Tim Roemer. </p> <p>Each speaker sought to promote Obama's \"common ground for common good\" rubric to the assembly, which ranged from graying, ponytailed white men and big black dudes in natty three piece suits to committed pro-choice women. Rabbi Jack Moline, who leads a diverse congregation at Agudas Achim in Virginia, addressed education and how his Judaism informs his public policy: \"It makes no sense to speak of No Child Left Behind when we ourselves don't know where we're going,\" he said, to roaring applause.</p> <p>Make no mistake: Obama has a lot of work to do with Christians - some of whom don't even count him among their number. But this rhetoric has been shown to <a href=\"http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/politics/2004406277_evangvote11m.html\">resonate with evangelicals under 40 years old</a> - those more committed to social equality and environmental justice than their parents, and less likely to abhor homosexuality. Further, Obama's team is using the best of old and new organising to get out this vote - standard block-by-block canvasses are paired with high-tech messaging brought to supporters on Obama for America DVDs, which they're encouraged to watch at house parties for neighbours and parishioners who want to know more about Obama. An Obama insider adds that they have hundreds of grassroots volunteers and paid staff on the case, and hope to hold \"10,000 of these before November\". </p> <p>In the face of this <em>sub rosa</em> offensive among the heart of the GOP coalition, and with a candidate like McCain that makes movement conservatives and evangelicals in particular a bit uneasy, it's easy to see why the Republican camp could have felt threatened into choosing Palin. </p> <p>To be sure, the God-off promises pitfalls within both party coalitions. Republican elites have expressed their share of reservations about Palin. David Frum, for one, called her \"a wild gamble\". And the recent revelation that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/sep/01/palin.republicans2008\">Palin's 17-year-old daughter is pregnant</a> could cause an uneasy accounting for the GOP's stance on abstinence only-education and traditional family values. For their part, Democrats are tetchy about the encroachment of church into state, and the difficulties of sharing a party with some fervently religious Democrats. The Rev Charles Blake, one of the keynote speakers at the Faith in Action gathering in Denver, irked pro-choice religious leader Marjorie Signer, who told me she found Blake's full-throated defence of the rights of the unborn \"inappropriate\".</p> <p>At any rate, come November, watch the exit polls to see where the churchgoing Americans land. It's unlikely that the Democrats can capture a majority, but they don't need one to take back the White House. It's drama enough that Obama, McCain and now Palin have joined a battle royale to see just which party can better be their brother's - or sister's - keeper.</p>",
  "<p>Ukraine's pro-western coalition government was today on the brink of collapse after its two ruling parties fell out over Russia's invasion of Georgia.</p> <p>The country's president, Viktor Yushchenko, accused his prime minister, Yulia Tymoshenko, of attempting to stage a parliamentary coup against him. He is threatening to dissolve parliament and call early elections.</p> <p>Tymoshenko and Yushchenko's parties have been in uneasy coalition since last autumn, with Tymoshenko becoming prime minister for the second time in December. Their pro-democratic coalition has a two-seat majority.</p> <p>Yesterday, Tymoshenko's bloc voted with the opposition Party of Regions to strip the president of several powers and boost those of the prime minister. In the early hours of this morning, Yushchenko's Our Ukraine bloc quit the coalition in protest.</p> <p>Yushchenko appeared on a live national broadcast denouncing the vote in Ukraine's Verkhovna Rada, or lower house, describing it as \"a political and constitutional coup\".

Tymoshenko, however, has refused to condemn Russia directly. Yesterday, her party failed to support a toughly worded statement blaming Moscow.</p> <p>Underlying this are political calculations ahead of Ukraine's next presidential election in early 2010. Tymoshenko is expected to challenge Yushchenko, her former Orange Revolution ally, for the presidency. Viktor Yanukovich, the former prime minister who leads the Party of the Regions, is also likely to stand.</p> <p>\"I think the ultimate reason for the political tensions is the president's post and the next election,\" said Igor Shevliakov, of the International Centre for Policy Studies in Kiev, said. \"She [Tymoshenko] wants to win. She wants to go into an election campaign completely independent.\"</p> <p>Tymoshenko today bitterly criticised Yushchenko. \"The president and his office has used every means to ruin the coalition,\" she told a cabinet meeting. \"It's a pity that the president behaves with no responsibility.

  "<p>The French president, Nicolas Sarkozy, and US secretary of state, Condoleezza Rice, are visiting former pariah Arab states this week, signifying a thawing of relations that the west hopes will yield significant results.</p> <p>Sarkozy is meeting President Bashar al-Assad today in the first official visit by a western leader to Syria for more than three years. And on Friday Rice will become the first US secretary of state to travel to Libya in more than half a century.</p> <p>While the US and other western and Arab governments still shun Assad, Sarkozy has responded to Syria's recent indirect peace talks with Israel and its support for reconciliation in Lebanon.</p> <p>\"The moment that Syria renews ties, through France, with Europe, maybe with the west, and we hope with its Arab environment, then one can imagine that evolutions will become possible,\" a French official close to Sarkozy told Reuters.</p> <p>He said Sarkozy would ask Assad to use its ties with Tehran to try to end Iran's standoff with the west over its nuclear programme, which the US and others claim is geared towards developing weapons of mass destruction.

  "<p>The first night of the Republican convention proper combined two themes in a way that the party has learned to master over the course of the last two presidential terms. On the one hand, non-partisanship, and on the other hand ... partisanship. During the first half of the evening, speeches about hurricane Gustav and the role of the US military backed up the convention's theme, \"Country First\". But as the night progressed, they intermingled more and more with critiques, implicit or explicit, of Barack Obama. There was a strikingly brief video address from George Bush - \"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/sep/03/uselections2008.republicans20086\">almost furtive</a>\", Martin Kettle calls it on theguardian.com today - in which the president praised John McCain and railed against the \"angry left\". And there were sharp attacks on Obama from the former presidential candidate Fred Thompson and the former Democrat Joe Lieberman, who became the first person to mention Obama's name at the podium, excoriating him for allegedly starving US troops of crucial resources even as he urged delegates, and the nation, to rise above partisan politics. (Lines to please the socially conservative wing of the party were much in evidence, too: a reference to McCain's pro-life position won the biggest cheer of the night.)</p> <p>The day's other dominant stories, of course, concerned Sarah Palin, including an ongoing row about her alleged membership in a fringe Alaskan secessionist party. But the party is rallying strongly behind her: Thompson used his speech to attack the media for obsessing over the story, and every mention of her name drew huge applause. Palin fans - and there are many among the delegates - speak of her as a bracingly conservative breath of fresh air. Critics might suspect that rationalisation is at play here: after all, don't loyal Republicans have a compelling interest in convincing themselves that McCain hasn't made a disastrous error? Either way, nobody should underestimate the strength of feeling in St Paul in support of the Alaska governor. She is the convention's keynote speaker today; that speech will surely prove to be a decisive moment in the election campaign.</p> <h2>Today at the convention</h2> <p>Here's a prediction: with a vastly supportive audience, as a naturally good speaker, and with expert speechwriting assistance, Sarah Palin will give a speech tonight that will be received with adulation inside the convention hall, and praise in the US media outside it. She'll be in a stronger position as a result, though admittedly that might not be saying much. The full details of the rest of today's programme have yet to be announced.</p> <h2>On theguardian.com</h2> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/sep/03/uselections2008.republicans20085\">Convention gets off the ground with addresses from Thompson, Lieberman and Bush</a></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/cartoon/2008/sep/02/sarah.palin.us.elections\">Cartoon: Steve Bell on Palin's winning mix of guns, babies and Jesus</a></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/sep/03/uselections2008.republicans20082\">My fellow Alaskans: independent views hit McCain's running mate</a></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/michaeltomasky/2008/sep/03/republicans2008.fredthompson\">Michael Tomasky: Where are the GOP's stars?</a></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/oliverburkemanblog/2008/sep/03/uselections2008.johnmccain1\">Campaign diary: Nasty liberal interviewer unfairly terrifies well-meaning McCain campaign aide</a></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/sep/03/uselections2008.republicans2008\">Low-fat Huckabee puts yoghurt and jogging on the GOP menu</a></p> <h2>Best of the rest</h2> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/tag/sarah-palin\">The Huffington Post: Sarah Palin's first five days</a></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/09/02/AR2008090203462.html?hpid=topnews\">Washington Post: Aides Say Team Interviewed Palin Late in the Process</a></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/article_email/SB122039868736392867-lMyQjAxMDI4MjAwMjMwOTI4Wj.html\">WSJ: GOP Tightens Image Control As Palin Prepares for Debut</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0908/13101.html\">Politico: Palin reignites culture wars</a></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"http://talkingpointsmemo.com/archives/212652.php\">Talking Points Memo: Why did Fred Thompson accuse Barack Obama of not opposing infanticide?</a></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/09/02/obama-to-appear-on-fox-on-thursday-night/\">NYT blog: Obama to Appear on Fox on Thursday Night</a></p> <h2>Latest polls</h2> <p>Obama emerges with a clear lead in both daily tracking polls - which are more responsive to events, but less reliable as polls - and in regular polls.

But since then each day has brought fresh details of her life and politics, supporting the view that McCain made an impulsive choice and his campaign team either failed to thoroughly vet her or did not have enough time to do so.</p> <p>The revelation that Palin appeared to support the secessionist Alaskan Independence party (AIP) - whose motto is \"Alaska First\" - sits awkwardly with McCain's campaign slogan, \"Country First\", and will be controversial in a country whose oath of allegiance includes the phrase \"one nation, indivisible\".</p> <p>It emerged Palin tried to ban certain books from a public library, an awkward disclosure in a country that enshrines free speech in the first amendment to its constitution.</p>  The AIP believes the 1958 vote that led to Alaska joining the American union was corrupt. It wants a rerun, with the aim of eventual independence. Party officials said yesterday Palin had attended at least one convention before leaving in 1996 to join the Republicans. But the party's chairwoman, Lynette Clarke, said today she had been mistaken when she claimed Palin had been an AIP member. The McCain camp yesterday insisted she had been a registered Republican since 1982. <p>A video of Palin's address this year to the independence party's convention while Alaska's Republican governor surfaced yesterday on YouTube. A smiling and gracious Palin wished the delegates a successful meeting, ending with the words \"God bless you.\"</p> <p>The first story to raise doubts about Palin was over a state probe into allegations that she abused her position as governor to try to sack her brother-in-law, a state trooper, after he divorced her sister. The same day the McCain campaign team put out a statement saying that Palin's 17-year-old daughter, Bristol, was five months pregnant. The father was later named in media reports as Levi Johnston, 18. The campaign team said it had gone public to end rumours that Palin's most recent child was in fact Bristol's.</p> <p>In a MySpace entry, which has now been blocked, Johnston describes himself a \"fuckin' redneck\" and says he is in a relationship but \"doesn't want kids\". He has left Alaska to join Palin's family at the Republican party conference in St Paul, Minnesota, where she is due to make a speech tonight.</p> <p>It emerged that Palin's husband, Todd, who is of Inuit descent and prides himself on being a champion snowmobile racer, was arrested 20 years ago for suspected drink-driving.</p> <p>Journalists descended on Alaska on Saturday and uncovered further details. According to Time magazine, as mayor of the small town of St George, Palin tried to ban certain books from a local library and threatened to sack a librarian who opposed this.</p> <p>And, contrary to Palin's claim that she had opposed the Bridge to Nowhere, the Alaskan bridge that cost millions but only links to a small community and is cited by McCain as a symbol of wastefulness, it was revealed she had initially supported it.</p> <p>Yesterday, the Washington Post reported that far from being a cost-cutter, she hired a lobbyist while mayor of her hometown, Wasilla, to secure $27m funding for a population of 9,000, the kind of spending McCain has vowed to veto.</p> <p>The paper later reported that Palin had a stake in an ailing car washing business that she failed to fully declare as governor. </p> <p>Just as McCain aides were beginning to hope the worst was over, an interview surfaced from earlier this year in which Palin was heard laughing after a talk show host referred to one of her Republican colleagues as a \"bitch\" and \"cancer\" in the state of Alaska.</p> <p>McCain, in Philadelphia yesterday, insisted \"the vetting was thorough\".<br>Republican aides were adamant that all the details that emerged had been known to them. Tucker Eskew, an adviser to Palin, gave the impression the disclosures were a deliberate strategy. \"We are going to flush the toilet,\" he said. But there was plenty of evidence to suggest it was not deliberate and instead reflected a failure on the part of McCain's campaign to interview her at length.</p> <p>A team of 10 staffers were dispatched to Alaska on Thursday, but Nicole Wallace, a spokeswoman for McCain, insisted they had been sent not to conduct a more thorough vetting but simply to help with the sudden influx of reporters.</p> <p>McCain may have chosen Palin, whom he had only met twice, because he wanted a woman on his ticket rather than two elderly men, as would have been the case if he had chosen Joe Lieberman. There are reports McCain had planned to pick Lieberman but would have had a hard time persuading the convention given Lieberman's pro-choice stance on abortion.</p> <p>Palin, 44, is popular with convention delegates. She has the support of the convention. Christian evangelicals, the gun lobby and anti-abortionists have swung behind her.</p> <p>A member of the Texas delegation, Christopher Harvey, 28, said: \"As a Texan we believe in gun rights, the Bible, and against abortion and against gay marriage. The things we believe in, she believes in.\"</p> <p>Views such as this almost guarantee her a standing ovation when she delivers a prime-time speech at the convention in St Paul, Minnesota. Rick Davis, a senior McCain adviser, said her speech would provide her with a chance \"to tell her story\".</p>",
  "<p>As I settle in for a night with the talking heads of America's Cable News Land, on the second day of the GOP convention, <a href=\"http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/3080446/\">Keith Olbermann</a> is asking Tom Brokaw why Fred Thompson has replaced Rudy Giuliani as tonight's keynote speaker. Brokaw says that John McCain struggles in the South more than a typical Republican candidate, and, particularly in states with big African-American populations, the Democratic party is having massive voter drives.</p> <p>It is an evocative reminder that election day will be ugly, that the GOP will engage in voter suppression in hotly contested states, that we will see, as we have during the last two presidential elections, footage of black voters in prohibitively long voting lines in Cleveland, St Louis, Jacksonville\u2026 </p> <p>What a way to start the night. Five minutes in, and I need a drink.</p> <p>The convention centre is very small and populated by very white people. It looks like a glorified high school gymnasium decorated for a high school reunion, the theme of which is \"Service: The Courage and Service of John McCain.\" Hey, did you say something about service? If anyone had asked me, I would have suggested \"Service: The Servicy Courage and Servlicious Service of Servicemeister John 'Service' McCain.\"</p> <p>But enough about John McCain. The talking heads are chatting about his <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/sep/03/uselections2008.palin\">veep nominee Sarah Palin</a>. Pat Buchanan is practically drooling as he enthuses that Palin \"embodies the entire Republican platform.\" Chris Matthews, in his ongoing quest to make me celibate, says: \"I think we just hit Pat Buchanan's erogenous zone.\" Ugh. Correspondents wander the floor of the convention center, conducting interviews with a series of Republican hacks who show various levels of enthusiasm for Palin and a consistently tepid confidence in the vetting process by which she was selected.</p> <p>The convention is called to order. Flags. Anthem. Matthews calls the singing of the national anthem a \"heroic moment,\" and all I can think is that the standards for heroism really aren't what they used to be.</p> <p>And then, suddenly, I'm having a <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r90z0PMnKwI\">macaca</a> moment, as <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/08/14/AR2006081400589.html\">George Allen</a> appears on my screen. What does it take to be exiled from this party?! Allen is the twenty-seventh person (or so) in the last hour to compulsively use the word \"maverick\" like it's a magical incantation that will turn a dude who voted with Bush 90% of the time into an actual maverick. He regurgitates the talking point about what a great \"Washington reformer\" John McCain is \u2013 and I am left wondering, again, how the combination of \"oodles of experience\" and \"Washington reformer\" don't leave the Beltway-loathing Republicans wondering why the hell Washington still sucks so hard if McCain's such an awesome long-term reformer. Eh, details.</p> <p>I'm about to fall into a coma from boredom, so I flip over to Fox where they are \u2013 I kid you not \u2013 talking about how today is the anniversary of George HW Bush bailing out over the Pacific. Then it segues into the O'Reilly Factor, which I am able to stand for three minutes before I scream and change the channel.</p> <p>Over at CNN, Donna Brazile is wearing a blinking flag lapel pin and just called Anderson Cooper her \"boo\". I begin to suspect that I've been slipped some acid.</p> <p>Now George HW Bush is being honored. Once a conservative pariah after reneging on his promise that there would be \"no new taxes,\" now he's a quaint reminder of when Republican presidents were at least minimally competent. The little video package on 41 asserts his leadership during the first Gulf War \"buried the ghosts of Vietnam.\" It does not add \"\u2026until his idiot son resurrected them.\"</p> <p>Speaking of which \u2026 Laura Bush introduces George W. His lukewarm reception is an embarrassment, for him and his party. Bush phones it in. Blah blah security. Blah blah angry left. Blah blah America's character. Blah blah whatever.</p> <p>Thompson isn't even ridiculous enough to be compelling. Lieberman is a smug snoozefest. This convention blows.</p> <p>I've been watching this thing all night, and I've literally seen only about half a dozen people under 40 when the cameras pan around the convention floor for reaction shots. What's the opposite of youthful exuberance? Grim resignation? Whatever it is, it describes the GOP convention \u2013 the yin to the energetic Democrats' yang. </p> <p>The Democrats' enthusiasm was so infectious, and the Republicans' lethargy so depressing, that I almost can't imagine anyone who has even the most minimal lust for life not voting for the Democrats, irrespective of the issues. The GOP convention seems tailor-made to appeal to belligerent old curmudgeons. If Rick Davis is right, and this election really isn't about issues, it may well be won based on whether the American electorate contains more hopeful joie de vivrers or more grumpy contrarians.</p> <p>I've got to believe it's the former. I hope so. I can only imagine a McCain presidency would induce such unrelenting malaise as to bring the entire nation to its very knees, considering that even this bloody convention is destroying my soul.</p>",
  "<video data-media-id=\"gu-video-337239617\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/bc/281851582/281851582_1770659359_Tuesday-speeches-Brightcove-16x9-1.flv\"/> </video>   The first full, hurricane-delayed evening of the Republican national convention in St Paul revealed a party still trying to face in two directions at the same time. It offered a tale of two different political themes directed at two different political audiences. The first theme, for the audience at home watching on television, centred on John McCain's military career and his much vaunted leadership qualities. The second, aimed at the Republican delegates in the hall at the Excel Centre, paraded his social conservatism to a party which in large parts remains sceptical that he is, at heart and by instinct, one of them. <p>Theme No 1 was embodied in the overarching slogan of the evening - Country First. It is a slogan with which all Republicans are deeply comfortable, whether they are social conservatives (which many are) or whether they are one-nation moderates (which a few still are - and which the closing speaker, the independent Democratic senator Joe Lieberman, certainly is). It is a classic broad tent political slogan, and on this first evening it was deployed in connection with a bewildering (and at times frankly incredible and contradictory) array of policies, anecdotes and historical figures. The purpose, though, was clear: to show that McCain's career and leadership claims - \"Put country first with John McCain\" - connect seamlessly with the party's history and can be sharply contrasted with the record of Barack Obama, whom Fred Thompson denounced as the most liberal and inexperienced presidential nominee in history.</p> <p>\"Country first\" enabled the Republicans to celebrate the \"quiet steady\" way in which the late Gerald Ford (subject of a short video tribute) \"put the country back together\" after it had been misgoverned by an unmentioned president, Richard Nixon, who just happened to be a Republican, too. But it also enabled them to celebrate the far from quiet, far from steady qualities of McCain's 2008 effort to rebuild the country for a second time after it had again been misgoverned by a fellow Republican. At times it bordered on the politically absurd. \"Some presidential nominees know more about service than others,\" simpered congresswoman Michelle Bachmann of Minnesota. The dig was intended for Obama - but it hardly squares with the military non-records of George W Bush and Dick Cheney. McCain is running against them too. </p> <p>But not in this hall. That is why theme No 2 was mostly reserved for the cable channel parts of the evening - the ones that weren't relayed on the national television networks. This consisted of two principal conservative preoccupations: first, the reiteration of the party's religious right agenda, especially on abortion; and, second, the almost furtive celebration of George W Bush's eight years in the White House, which occupied less than half an hour of the evening and were largely entrusted to the consensual figure of Laura Bush.</p> <p>Every reference to McCain's anti-abortion stance particularly hit the spot for the audience in the hall, none more so than Thompson's, which produced the biggest cheer of the night \u2013 though it may have gifted many watching undecided votes to Obama. At times the religious intensity of the party, which has always been there at the grass roots in the Bush years, threatened to get out of hand. At one point Cindy McCain was compared to an miracle-working angel. And when Bush, speaking by videolink from the White House but carefully not on prime time, endorsed McCain because he understood that \"human life must always be defended\" the audience in St Paul immediately got the message. It was a mixed-up evening for a mixed-up party - but a party that has not lost the will to win.</p>",
  "<video data-media-id=\"gu-video-337237771\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\">  </video>   <p>The Republican convention finally got off the ground tonight with criticism of the US media for getting into a frenzy over the vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin and with a fleeting appearance by George Bush.</p> <p>There were regular ovations at the mention of Palin. But the loudest came with a spirited defence by Fred Thompson, the Law and Order actor who had stood against John McCain for the Republican nomination.</p> <p>In a comment that got delegates to their feet, he said: \"Some Washington pundits and media big shots are in a frenzy over the selection of a woman who has actually governed rather than just talked a good game on the Sunday talk shows and hit the Washington cocktail circuit.\"</p> <p>Palin, though only appointed McCain's running mate on Friday, has established herself as a favourite of the convention, mainly because she shares the social conservative values held by many of the delegates.</p> <p>Thompson had one of two prime-time television slots to build up a portrait of McCain, the Republican candidate for the November presidential race. But Palin is the talk of the convention and is turning out to be a distraction from the business of selling McCain. </p> <p>Although Thompson devoted most of his speech to McCain as war hero, he also spoke spiritedly about Palin, saying she is \"from a small town, with small town values, but that's not good enough for those folks who are attacking her and her family\".</p> <p>With the opening day yesterday cancelled because of Hurricane Gustav, the Republicans managed their first full day of business today. </p> <p>The other prime-time television slot was taken by Joe Lieberman, the former Democratic senator who is now an independent and is a long-time friend of McCain. Lieberman is reported to have been his original choice as running mate but was ruled out because he was unsellable to the Republican convention.</p> <p>But he received a standing ovation. He told the delegates that they might be puzzled at the presence of a Democrat at a Republican convention but he said he wanted to put country before party and that meant a vote for McCain.</p> <p>Lieberman made one of the few political remarks of the night as the Republicans judged it would be too insensitive to be overtly political in the wake of Gustav. </p> <p>Speaking about the war in Iraq he said: </p> <p>\"When others wanted to retreat in defeat from the field of battle, when Barack Obama was voting to cut off funding for our troops on the ground, John McCain had the courage to stand against the tide of public opinion.\" </p> <p>The convention had a strong militaristic overtone, with video clips of the war in Iraq and of former Republican presidents involved in conflict. About a dozen of McCain's fellow inmates in a Vietnam prisoner of war camp were in the audience. </p> <p>Bush joined the Republican convention last night by video link from the White House, a fudge that allowed John McCain to maintain his distance himself from the president.</p> <p>The president had been due to make a prime-time television appearance in person at the convention in St Paul, Minnesota, last night but ditched that to fly to Texas to be near evacuees from Louisiana fleeing Hurricane Gustav.</p> <p>Rather than fly on to Minnesota he opted to return to the White House. Even then, a planned 15-minute video was cut down to six, and he was given a slot just before prime time.</p> <p>Bush's short tribute to McCain's helped resolve the presidential candidate's dilemma. While Bush is popular with the convention and was loudly cheered when he appeared, he has one of the lowest poll ratings of any president and McCain has largely avoided campaigning with him</p> <p>Bush, recalling McCain's time in Vietnam, said that if the Hanoi Hilton could not break McCain, \"the angry left could not\". </p> <p>Bush, who has often been at odds with McCain on policy, put aside past differences to praise him as a potential commander-in-chief.</p> <p>\"We need a president who understands the lessons of September 11, 2001: That to protect America, we must stay on the offense, stop attacks before they happen, and not wait to be hit again. The man we need is John McCain,\" Bush said.</p>",
  "<p>Thank you for that warm welcome. I am honoured to be here. </p> <p>We meet tonight in the wake of a terrible storm that has hit the gulf coast but that hurts all of us, because we are all members of our larger American family. </p> <p>At times like this, we set aside all that divides us, and we come together to help our fellow citizens in need. </p> <p>What matters is certainly not whether we are Democrats or Republicans, but that we are all Americans. </p> <p>The truth is, it shouldn't take a hurricane to bring us together like this. </p> <p>Every day, across our country, millions of our fellow citizens are facing huge problems. </p> <p>They are worried about their homes, their jobs and their businesses; they are worried about the outrageous cost of gas and of health insurance; and they are worried about the threats from our enemies abroad. </p> <p>But when they look to Washington, all too often they do not see their leaders coming together to tackle these problems. </p> <p>Instead they see Democrats and Republicans fighting each other, rather than fighting for the American people. </p> <p>Our founding fathers foresaw the danger of this kind of senseless partisanship. George Washington himself - in his farewell address to our country - warned that the \"spirit of party\" is \"the worst enemy\" of our democracy and \"enfeebles\" our government's ability to do its job. </p> <p>George Washington was absolutely right. The sad truth is - today we are living through his worst nightmare, in the capital city that bears his name. </p> <p>And that brings me directly to why I am here tonight. What, after all, is a Democrat like me doing at a Republican convention like this? </p> <p>The answer is simple. </p> <p>I'm here to support John McCain because country matters more than party. </p> <p>I'm here tonight because John McCain is the best choice to bring our country together and lead our country forward. </p> <p>I'm here because John McCain's whole life testifies to a great truth: being a Democrat or a Republican is important. </p> <p>But it is not more important than being an American. </p> <p>Both presidential candidates this year talk about changing the culture of Washington, about breaking through the partisan gridlock and special interests that are poisoning our politics. </p> <p>But only one of them has actually done it. </p> <p>Only one leader has shown the courage and the capability to rise above the smallness of our politics to get big things done for our country and our people. </p> <p>And that leader is John McCain! </p> <p>John understands that it shouldn't take a natural disaster like Hurricane Gustav to get us to take off our partisan blinders and work together to get things done. </p> <p>It shouldn't take a natural disaster to teach us that the American people don't care much if you have an \"r\" or a \"d\" after your name. </p> <p>What they care about is, are we solving the problems they are up against every day? </p> <p>What you can expect from John McCain as president is precisely what he has done this week: which is to put country first. That is the code by which he has lived his entire life, and that is the code he will carry with him into the White House. </p> <p>I have personally seen John, over and over again, bring people together from both parties to tackle our toughest problems we face - to reform our campaign finance, lobbying and ethics laws, to create the 9/11 Commission and pass its critical national security reforms, and to end the partisan paralysis over judicial confirmations. </p> <p>My Democratic friends know all about John's record of independence and accomplishment. </p> <p>Maybe that's why some of them are spending so much time and so much money trying to convince voters that John McCain is someone else. </p> <p>I'm here, as a Democrat myself, to tell you: don't be fooled. </p> <p>God only made one John McCain, and he is his own man. </p> <p>If John McCain was just another go-along partisan politician, he never would have taken on corrupt Republican lobbyists, or big corporations that were cheating the American people, or powerful colleagues in Congress who were wasting taxpayer money. </p> <p>But he did! </p> <p>If John McCain was just another go-along partisan politician, he never would have led the fight to fix our broken immigration system or to do something about global warming. </p> <p>But he did! </p> <p>As a matter of fact, if John McCain is just another partisan Republican, then I'm Michael Moore's favorite Democrat. </p> <p>And I'm not. </p> <p>Senator Obama is a gifted and eloquent young man who can do great things for our country in the years ahead. But eloquence is no substitute for a record - not in these tough times. </p> <p>In the Senate he has not reached across party lines to get anything significant done, nor has he been willing to take on powerful interest groups in the Democratic party. </p> <p>Contrast that to John McCain's record, or the record of the last Democratic president, Bill Clinton, who stood up to some of those same Democratic interest groups and worked with Republicans to get important things done like welfare reform, free trade agreements and a balanced budget. </p> <p>Governor Sarah Palin, like John McCain, is a reformer who has taken on the special interests and reached across party lines. She is a leader we can count on to help John shake up Washington. </p> <p>That's why the McCain-Palin ticket is the real ticket for change this year. </p> <p>The Washington bureaucrats and power brokers can't build a pen strong enough to hold these two mavericks. </p> <p>And together, you can count on John McCain and Sarah Palin to fight for America and to fight for you! And that's what our country needs most right now. </p> <p>What we need most is not more party unity in America but more national unity! </p> <p>Especially at a time of war, we need a president we can count on to fight for what's right for our country - not only when it is easy, but when it is hard. </p> <p>When others were silent, John McCain had the judgment to sound the alarm about the mistakes we were making in Iraq. When others wanted to retreat in defeat from the field of battle, when Barack Obama was voting to cut off funding for our troops on the ground.</p> <p>John McCain had the courage to stand against the tide of public opinion and support the surge, and because of that, today, our troops are at last beginning to come home, not in failure, but in honor! </p> <p>Before I conclude, I ask the indulgence of those in this hall tonight, as I want to speak directly to my fellow Democrats and Independents who are watching. </p> <p>I know many of you are angry and frustrated by our government and our politics and for good reason. </p> <p>You may be thinking of voting for John McCain but you're not sure. Some of you have never voted for a Republican before and in an ordinary election, you probably wouldn't. </p> <p>But this is no ordinary election, because these are not ordinary times, and John McCain is no ordinary candidate. You may not agree with John McCain on every issue. </p> <p>But you can always count on him to be straight with you about where he stands, and to stand for what he thinks is right regardless of politics. </p> <p>As president, you can count on John McCain to be a restless reformer, who will clean up Washington and get our government working again for you! </p> <p>So tonight, I ask you whether you are an Independent, a Reagan Democrat or a Clinton Democrat, or just a Democrat: This year, when you vote for president, vote for the person you believe is best for the country, not for the party you happen to belong to. </p> <p>Vote for the leader who, since the age of 17, when he raised his hand and took an oath to defend and protect our Constitution, has always put our country first. </p> <p>So, let's come together to make a great American patriot our next great president!</p>"

  "<p>After almost two years of campaigning, the US election is arriving with a rush. Although there are 52 days left until the November 4 poll, the first of the ballot booths will open next Friday in Virginia for early voting.</p> <p>Other states will follow soon after; 36 of the 50 are offering the opportunity to vote early, either in person or by post.</p> <p>The expansion of early voting is posing a dilemma for the campaign teams, with decisions having to be made about whether to time ads and rallies to coincide with them or whether to delay drives until nearer November 4.</p> <p>With 30% or more of the electorate predicted to vote early, the Barack Obama and John McCain campaigns are in overdrive.</p> <p>Early voting will have a \"tremendous\" impact on the campaign, said Professor Paul Gronke at Reed College in Portland, Oregon and director of the university's early voting information centre.</p> <p>He said that instead of one big bang on November 4, the weeks to come would be like Groundhog Day for the campaign teams, replaying election day over and over again. </p> <p>\"People tend to vote on Fridays and Mondays, so you have to time events for that. You have to get the ads out at the right time. For campaigns, it is raising the costs,\" he said.</p> <p>The concertina effect on the campaign is already forcing changes in campaign strategy, with signs that Obama is having to abandon his plan to fight all 50 states and instead concentrate on battlefield states.</p> <p>The early opening of the ballots in Virginia, a battlefield state which Obama hopes to take from the Republicans, partly explains why McCain and his running mate, Sarah Palin, held a rally in the state on Wednesday and why a \"Victory 2008\" bus tour, packed with congressmen and McCain's brother, Joe, set off yesterday on a voter registration drive. </p> <p>Early balloting after Virginia opens in Idaho on September 22, Missouri the day after and Iowa, another state that Obama hopes to take from the Republicans, on September 25. In battlefield states that have often decided the outcome of recent elections, early balloting opens in Ohio on September 30 and Florida on October 20.</p> <p>Those who vote early tend to be partisan, with their minds made up and unlikely to be swayed by the upcoming presidential debates, analysts say. </p> <p>The Obama campaign is encouraging as many of its supporters as possible to vote early, fearful that would-be Democratic voters might turn away on election day if facing long queues on November 4 because of Republican challenges to voter eligibility.</p> <p>Professor Michael McDonald, an expert on elections at Virginia's George Mason University, said: \"We know there is going to be a high turnout and this [early voting] offers a pressure relief valve.\"</p> <p>He anticipated the highest turnout in 100 years. \"We are off the charts in terms of interest in candidates,\" he said. </p> <p>The number of states offering early voting has increased from 11 in the 1990s. In the 2000 election only 15% of the electorate voted early, rising to 20% in the 2004 election and 25% in the 2006 congressional poll. </p> <p>Gronke predicted a figure of 33% for this election.</p>",
  "<p>Jessica Valenti is right (Comment, September 12) that the choice of Sarah Palin as Republican vice-presidential candidate at least means that conservatives must recognise feminism as a force in US politics. A pity the Democrats did not sufficiently recognise that when they rejected Hillary Clinton. Some of the left-liberal pique at Palin's nomination is because the Democrats have been caught on the back foot on this one. </p> <p>While I share Valenti's rejection of Palin's views, which are certainly retrograde for women, I can understand if she strikes a chord with many women who all too often see feminism as failing to validate the role of mother and home manager. We need to do more to convey that the fight is to ensure that \"what women do\" is seen as important, in whatever forum they do it, and to ensure that women (and men) have genuine choices. Otherwise the wrong impression is conveyed that feminists think women have to act like men to be valued. </p> <p>I'm sure American women voters will not vote Republican just because the VP nominee is female, but it was a smart move that recognises that many women, not just a few, are fed up with the failure to get women into the top jobs (see www.send2women.eu for the campaign to make sure at least two of the top four EU posts go to women ).<br><strong>Sarah Ludford MEP</strong><br>Lib Dem, London </p> <p>I share Steve Bell's opposition to the warmongering Republican leadership, but his cartoon of a porcine Sarah Palin descending with Bush and McCain from an American bomber (September 11) invokes an unsavoury iconography. Women are called pigs when they exhibit appetites supposed to be unwomanly - for sex and food and power. Bell's caricature of Palin's full figure and generous mouth is highly reminiscent of similar cartoons of another American woman in recent political history, Monica Lewinsky. Palin's style is rural working class, people whose association with barnyard animals has long been ridiculed in the manner of Al Capp's L'il Abner. Such stereotypes come with long histories, most of which involve attacking particular ethnic groups. </p> <p>This isn't going to play in the US, where Miss Piggy is a folk heroine because she's a bossy female. There are better ways to represent the limitations of Palin's candidacy, and male cartoonists will eventually discover them. Pigs may also fly.<br><strong>Mandy Merck</strong><br>Royal Holloway, University of London </p> <p>Your US correspondents Bill Ireland and Miguel Giles (Letters, September 12) chastise Jonathan Freedland for an opinion piece about the US election on the grounds of interference in the political process of their country. Given the long and consistent record of actual US interference in the political process of other countries, where even the Pentagon acknowledges the existence of 761 military bases, with US forces deployed in 151 out of the current 192 UN recognised nation states, it would perhaps be more useful if they could apply the same standards and criteria to the actions of their own government.<br><strong>Dave Hansell</strong><br>Sheffield </p> <p>On reading Miguel Giles's redneck rant, I was at first amazed you'd printed it. Then I realised that with its arrogance and blinkered stupidity, not to mention its homophobia, it was the perfect crystallisation of that America now becoming loathed throughout the world. <br><strong>Alan Clark</strong><br>London </p> <p>I completely agree with Miguel Giles - no one has a say in the US elections except for Americans. Many of us don't care about them either. That is why I am utterly sick of the obsession that the British media have with America, with Obama, with McCain and Palin. For months we in Britain have been subjected to the minutiae of a campaign which I have found utterly baffling and infinitely boring. My only interest is to know who finally gets elected. If journalists paid even half as much attention to the affairs of our own continent as they do to American affairs, we might begin to think of ourselves as Europeans, rather than as citizens of a 51st state.<br><strong>Susan Tabb</strong><br>Brentford, Middlesex</p>",
  "<p>The good times rolled last year for top executives in American boardrooms, pocketing solid pay rises in spite of the credit crunch, the sub-prime mortgage crisis and early signs of an economic slump.</p> <p>A veteran Silicon Valley technology entrepreneur topped the remuneration table. Larry Ellison, founder and chief executive of the business software company Oracle, took home $84.6m (\u00a348m).</p> <p>The billionaire America's Cup sailing fanatic fought off stiff competition to take the top-paid title. According to analysis by Associated Press, the 10 highest earners in the US included the bosses of three investment banks - Merrill Lynch, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley - and three energy and mining firms buoyed up by soaring commodity prices.</p> <p>Straitened economic conditions in the US only modestly dented the annual boardroom bonanza. A survey by Hay Group for the Wall Street Journal found compensation rose 3.5% to an average of $8.85m among chief executives of 200 top US corporations. There were few examples, however, of standout pay packages. Nobody made it into nine figures last year unlike, for example, Home Depot's Robert Nardelli who secured a $210m severance package in 2006, or Richard Fairbank of credit card firm Capital One, who scooped $280m in 2005.</p> <p>\"I don't think we've seen any particularly significant cases in the last 12 months,\" said Ryan Johnson, of employment consultants WorldatWork. The reason was straightforward - the stockmarket had a tough year which meant executive share options fared poorly.</p> <p>\"Most of the major indices were down 10% or 15% which meant you didn't have as much cashing in as usual,\" said Johnson. \"The amount of equity most US executives now have ties their personal compensation to the share price.\"</p> <p>The pay league runner-up was Merrill Lynch's John Thain who got a generous signing-on package when moving from the New York Stock Exchange. Thain received $83.1m despite the bank's losses of $19bn on mortgage-related securities, which have prompted it to sell assets and raise money from Asian sovereign wealth funds.</p> <p>In third place was Leslie Moonves of television network CBS - the maker of hits such as CSI and Everybody Loves Raymond - who got $67.6m. Behind him were the bosses of metals group Freeport-McMoRan and energy company XTO.</p> <p>US investors are not entitled to vote on executive pay packages in the way their counterparts in Britain are. Efforts to institute a \"say on pay\" vote by shareholders at annual meetings have largely failed, with a few exceptions - such as at computer maker Apple, telecoms firm Verizon and video rental empire Blockbuster - where resolutions have passed against the wishes of the board.</p> <p>Several vocal pressure groups continue to push for pay restraint. A report from the US Institute for Policy Studies, together with United for a Fair Economy, this week concluded taxpayers in effect subsidise boardroom pay to the tune of $20bn annually through loopholes allowing companies to pay executives offshore, to minimise capital gains tax or defer taxation.</p> <p>Sarah Anderson, co-author of the study, said the rewards enjoyed by energy bosses were attracting particular ire. \"They've really been cashing in even though executives admit they don't have any control over global oil prices.\" </p> <p>The presidential election has provided hope for campaigners. Democrat Barack Obama and Republican John McCain say they support legislation presently stalled in Congress which would require companies to hold a \"say on pay\" vote annually.</p> <p>Obama favours closing a so-called \"carried interest\" loophole which limits capital gains tax on fees and bonuses. </p> <p>McCain has railed against \"rewards for failure\", when outgoing chief executives get huge payoffs, telling a group of small business leaders in June: \"Something is seriously wrong when the American people are left to bear the consequences of reckless corporate conduct, while the offenders themselves are packed off with another $40m or $50m for the road.\"</p>",
  "<p>We are now at what we would call, in horseracing parlance, the end of the back stretch. The presidential debates - three of them, to be held on September 26, October 7 and October 15 - will constitute the clubhouse turn. Then, down the stretch they'll come for the final three weeks.</p> <p>What are the major lessons so far, the Big Questions, of this presidential election? Eleven months ago in these pages, I wrote: \"Let me offer what I think is the most important undercurrent question of next year's election: have Americans tired of conservatism, or have they merely tired of corrupt and incompetent conservatism?\"</p> <p>Unlike much of what I've written, those sentences actually hold up to time's remorseless glare. That, I think, is still the question.</p> <p>The problem is, we don't know the answer, and we won't know until probably the early hours of Wednesday, November 5. If Barack Obama wins, no matter how narrowly, we can speak of a nation that wanted a change, of course. If John McCain ekes it out, we can conclude that enough Americans were given enough reason to think twice. Conservative governance will continue.</p> <p>But for now that's all speculative, and the race right now isn't really about those things. Right now what we have is an extreme cage fight in which, on November 4, one or the other will crawl out, bloodied and beaten, but victorious. And soon thereafter the bloodied winner has to start actually being the president. Yes, it's nuts</p> <p>So which side is better equipped to win the cage fight? It's a more complex question than it seems, because the two campaigns have diametrically opposed ideas about how to achieve that victory. This is a unique situation. Usually, Republican and Democratic presidential campaigns have roughly the same theory of how to win. It's just that Republicans are better at implementing the theory. But this time, the Obama camp has a completely different theory. It's why they're not as nervous now as some of their extremely fretful supporters are.</p> <p>This is the field operation versus the news-cycle election.</p> <p>The McCain campaign is the news-cycle campaign. It is built around its television advertisements and attention-getting claims made on the stump that are all about winning that day's news cycle. </p> <p>The basic idea is, if you win enough news cycles, you've dominated the discourse, you've manipulated the news coverage, you've gotten your message out at the other fellow's expense, you've kept him on the defensive. Do all that and you're going to win. Many of these advertisements and claims are contemptible lies (see sidebar). The nature of McCain's campaign is all the more shameful considering that he's doing many of the exact things that were done to him by George Bush's campaign in 2000 -and employing some of the self-same people who did it to him to do it to Obama. </p> <p>As I write, the American political media are gently rousing themselves towards a state of backlash, and we will have to see where that leads. But as the old saying goes, a lie can get halfway around the world before the truth can even get its boots on, and so here we are. </p> <p>The McCain adverts have had a big effect. They started in earnest just as Obama was returning from his trip to Europe. These ads weren't lies, but were outlandishly wily attempts to paint Obama as a lightweight. The celebrity-Britney Spears-Paris Hilton ad was one that people liked to say turned them off, even as its message somehow sunk in. The day after he returned from what was by any objective measure a successful trip, Obama led McCain by 8 points in one major daily tracking poll. But within a few days it had tightened up considerably. The McCain team changed the story of Obama's trip.</p> <p>The news-cycle uber-stroke of the McCain campaign was to announce Sarah Palin as the vice-presidential choice the day after the Democratic convention concluded. Obama had given his well-received speech before 84,000 fans the night before. In previous elections, he would have been able to ride that momentum for a few days. But the McCain camp cut it off utterly. It helped also that no one knew the first thing about Palin. So the American cable news channels that Friday and most of that weekend were about \"Who is Sarah Palin?\" rather than being about \"Obama rides wave, McCain's turn next.\" When Palin turned out to be beloved of the rightwing electoral base and have an intriguing family life to boot, so much the better. Obama wasn't the story.</p> <p>Since the conventions, Team McCain has kept up its barrage, daily and sometimes hourly launching new attacks and continuing to promote false claims about Palin's \"record of reform\" (that she opposed federal funding for a bridge that she in fact supported until it became politically unwise to do so, that she fought federal \"pork-barrel\" spending that she had in fact sought for her state). </p> <p>The point is to press the advantage in the daily news cycle and create a narrative. Republican thinking was put on display, perhaps too candidly for the McCain campaign's tastes, by a Republican strategist, John Feehery, who is not with the campaign but who told the Washington Post: \"The more the New York Times and Washington Post go after Sarah Palin, the better off she is, because there's a bigger truth out there and the bigger truths are she's new, she's popular in Alaska and she's an insurgent. As long as those are out there, these little facts don't really matter.\" Little facts. Nice one.</p> <p>The success of the news-cycle strategy so far has a lot of liberals calling their cardiologists. And maybe with good reason. McCain is now ahead in some polls, tied in others. He has certainly won almost every news cycle since the conventions closed.</p> <p>But the questions about the strategy are these: are regular Americans paying much attention to these news cycles? And even if they are, do they believe everything they see on TV? This is where the field operation strategy comes in. </p> <p>In Denver, I attended a meeting between journalists and Obama campaign manager David Plouffe arranged by Time magazine. Plouffe laid out the theory: the Obama camp isn't that panicked about news cycles, we're looking longer term, he said. Team Obama has sunk massive amounts of money into a huge number of field offices in competitive states (some conservative states aren't worth fighting in and liberal states are in the bag already). At the last comprehensive count, the Obama campaign had 336 field offices around the country, and McCain 101. McCain has probably opened more recently, but the disparity is still striking.</p> <p>Some state-by-state comparisons are useful. In Ohio, Obama has 33 offices, and McCain nine. In Michigan, it's 22-11. Virginia, 28-6; Iowa, 23-6; New Mexico, 18-1; Missouri, 27-7. You get the picture. Florida is the only competitive state where McCain has more offices, 35-25. That 35 is deeply uncharacteristic for McCain, probably explained by the fact that much of the McCain vote in Florida will be elderly and will need to be driven to the polls on election day.</p> <p>In addition, the Obama campaign is counting on a large voter-registration effort that's been ongoing in key states since 2006. Twenty-eight of the 50 states enroll voters according to party affiliation, and in those states, Democrats have gained 2 million voters in the last two years, while the Republicans have lost 334,000. Numbers for 2008 alone look like this in some important states: Colorado, 66,516 Democrats to 13,352 Republicans; Florida, 209,422 Democrats to 77,196 Republicans; Iowa, 69,301 Democrats to 7,515 Republicans; Pennsylvania, 98,137 Democrats to just 289 Republicans. </p> <p>It takes a lot of time and money to register all those people and set up all those offices. The Obama people are betting that the investment will pay off. It is their belief, Plouffe said in Denver, that most people pay more attention to their co-workers and neighbours than they do to television talking heads. And with all those neighbours and co-workers spreading the word on election day, they say they feel good about the situation they've created. Field, they say, will trump news cycle.</p> <p>So there you have it. Are the Obama people right? The problems with their theory are that all this field-tilling is invisible to pundits, and that there's no way to measure its success until the votes start coming in. In the meantime, McCain is very much winning the visible war, which can be measured day-to-day. And, since he named Palin, enthusiasm on the right is sky high, so he'll have his army of volunteers now, too. </p> <p>One doesn't doubt that the Obama turnout will be impressive. But there are 51 daily news cycles between now and November 4. Obama certainly needs to win a few of them. So let's sort all that out first. Then we'll talk about the big picture.</p> <h2>Dirty tricks</h2> <p><strong>McCain campaign's misleading statements ...</strong></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> It said Obama supported teaching sex education at kindergartens in Illinois. In fact, Obama voted for, but did not sponsor, legislation that would have allowed local school districts to provide \"age-appropriate\" sex education as a way of teaching young children to be wary of sexual predators. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> McCain said Obama would end new weapons programmes needed to keep America safe. Yet a McCain adviser has listed \"future combat systems\" as a programme that should be cut.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Palin has made her opposition to the \"bridge to nowhere\", a $223m span linking an Alaskan island, a centrepiece of the team's portrayal of her as a fiscally responsible governor. But Palin initially supported the project and abandoned it after the Congress did so. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> During Obama's trip to Europe this summer, McCain said his rival ditched plans to visit wounded troops in Germany because journalists were forbidden from accompanying him. Obama aides said they cancelled the visit because they did not want to use injured soldiers as campaign props.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> McCain has often claimed Obama would raise taxes. But non-partisan analysis found Obama would cut taxes for low- and middle-income households, while raising payroll taxes on those earning more than $250,000.</p> <p><strong>Democrats stretch the truth too ...</strong></p> <p>Obama and other Democrats have said McCain would keep US troops in Iraq for 100 years, referring to remarks McCain made in January. McCain was clearly describing a situation in which non-combat forces could stay in Iraq, similar to US deployments in South Korea, Germany and elsewhere after wars.<br><strong>Daniel Nasaw</strong></p>",
  "<p>That sound you are hearing may be the air running out of former Republican congressman <a href=\"http://www.bobbarr2008.com/home/skip/?s=0618\">Bob Barr's presidential campaign</a>.</p> <p>This year, <a href=\"http://www.ronpaul.org/\">Congressman Ron Paul of Texas</a> mounted what was arguably the most successful small-l libertarian presidential candidacy in history. Barr, having ditched the GOP, was to follow up with the most <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/apr/07/bigtentlibertarianparty\">viable</a> big-L Libertarian presidential candidacy ever. But based on the events at a Ron Paul press conference in Washington on Wednesday, Barr may not be a child of the <a href=\"http://www.campaignforliberty.com/\">Ron Paul Revolution</a> in November.</p> <p>Paul, <a href=\"http://www.house.gov/paul/\">a ten-term Republican congressman</a>, didn't win any primaries or caucuses but he did raise millions of dollars, inspire thousands of committed volunteers and collect more than one million votes in his unlikely 2008 run for the GOP presidential nomination. Essentially barred from the Republican National Convention last week, he brought out over 12,000 supporters to his own <a href=\"http://www.spectator.org/dsp_article.asp?art_id=13819\">counter-convention</a> across the river. They heard hours of speeches extolling the virtues of limited government, free markets and a non-interventionist foreign policy that would include ending the war in Iraq.</p> <p>But ever since Paul's long-shot bid for the White House ended, his supporters have been divided about whether to bolt the Republican party or work to change it from within. Paul himself decided against a third-party bid and instead ran for re-election to Congress as a Republican, dispatching a primary opponent with more than 70% of the vote. A slew of Ron Paul Republicans began making similar runs in GOP primaries and the Paul-led <a href=\"http://www.campaignforliberty.com/\">Campaign for Liberty</a> aims to help them.</p> <p>But Paul also <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/politicsNews/idUSN1044154420080911\">refused to endorse</a> Republican nominee John McCain and many of his supporters were displeased with a presidential choice between McCain's national greatness neo-conservatism and Barack Obama's messianic liberalism. Obama became an even tougher sell to these would-be <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/jun/26/barackobama.johnmccain\">Obamacons</a> after the Democrat softened his opposition to the Iraq war and his defence of civil liberties.</p> <p>Enter <a href=\"http://www.bobbarr2008.com/splash/?s0820\">Bob Barr</a>. Barr had his own problems, including a record of supporting the drug war, the invasion of Iraq and the Patriot Act while serving in Congress. But the Republican-turned-Libertarian had seen the light on these issues and had devoted much of his post-congressional career to resisting the Bush administration's national surveillance programme. As the Libertarian Party nominee, he could have been a plausible alternative for the Paul voters, who outside the confines of the Republican Party may number greater than one million.</p> <p>In fact, Barr's Libertarian heterodoxies actually had the potential of widening his appeal to a large number of anti-McCain conservatives. Like Paul, Barr is to the right of most libertarians on immigration, same-sex marriage and abortion. He is best known for his working in trying to impeach Bill Clinton. Barr had a chance to unite Ron Paul Republicans with Rush Limbaugh Republicans.</p> <p>For a time it looked like it might even work. Barr performed better in state and national polls than any Libertarian presidential candidate in recent memory, zooming to 6% in a Zogby survey this July. While Barr had competition for the Paul vote \u2013 Constitution Party nominee Chuck Baldwin \u2013 he seemed to be blowing that competition away. Paul hinted that a vote for either Barr or Baldwin would be fine with him.</p> <p>Yet Paul gave his supporters no clear direction. At the <a href=\"http://www.rallyfortherepublic.com/\">Rally for the Republic</a>, organizers talked about taking the Republican Party back to its small government roots. Speakers, especially former Minnesota Governor Jesse Ventura, talked about smashing the GOP and the entire two-party system.</p> <p>The confusion continued at the Republican National Convention, where 15 delegates voted for Paul against McCain in the roll call. But by <a href=\"http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2008/09/04/john-mccain-2343-votes-ron-paul-15/?mod=googlenews_wsj\">some estimates</a>, his final tally could have been as high as 78 delegates. Most of his supporters at the convention, despite engaging in behind-the-scenes brawls at state conventions and initiating credentials challenges to nail down their delegate slots, ended up voting for McCain.</p> <p>That proved true for at least <a href=\"http://www.bostonherald.com/news/national/politics/2008/view.bg?articleid=1117016&amp;srvc=rss\">a dozen Paul delegates</a> from Massachusetts. The four Paul delegates from Nevada who had to stage a credentials fight to get inside the convention hall also <a href=\"http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2008/sep/07/paul-backers-give-graciously/\">supported McCain</a>.</p> <p>A week later at the National Press Club, Paul decided to resolve the conflict \u2013 sort of. He remained a Republican, but urged his followers to vote for a third party candidate willing to sign his statement of principles about foreign policy, privacy issues, monetary policy and the national debt. These candidates stretched from Baldwin on the right to Ralph Nader and Cynthia McKinney on the left.</p> <p>Barr, concerned about the futility of this \"any of the above\" quasi-endorsement, <a href=\"http://www.reason.com/blog/show/128719.html\">bailed</a> on the event. But in doing so, he <a href=\"http://www.lewrockwell.com/blog/lewrw/archives/022780.html\">outraged</a> many <a href=\"http://www.lewrockwell.com/blog/lewrw/archives/022787.html\">Paul supporters</a>.</p> <p>Now the Rush Limbaugh Republicans are heading back into the GOP fold because of Sarah Palin, and the Ron Paul Republicans are going to split their votes between three or four candidates with different platforms. Maybe Barr can overcome this and maybe Paul can take these disparate strains and forge them into a coherent movement. But that's not the way to bet.</p>",
  "<p>While plenty of people somewhere in the US support Sarah Palin, there are also plenty of us for whom she has inspired new-found depths of loathing.

A number of local Republicans have spoken out against her, emphasizing her unwillingness to engage with anyone who doesn't share her point-of-view. If she couldn't even win over the Republicans in her home state, how are we supposed to believe she can help to improve what McCain referred to as the \"bipartisan rancour\" of things on Capitol Hill? How are we supposed to believe she will be able to charm foreign leaders from countries she <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/blogs/bensmith/0808/Palins_travels.html\">probably knows nothing about</a>, whose language she literally and figuratively will not be able to speak?</p> <p>There's also the problem of her being an anti-feminist, who doesn't think women should be able to control their own bodies \u2014 or their lives.

And \u2014 again, despite scientific evidence \u2014 she thinks <a href=\"http://www.newsmax.com/headlines/sarah_palin_vp/2008/08/29/126139.html\">humankind has no impact on climate change</a>.</p> <p>For a person with so many bozo opinions, it's ironic to note that she is also opposed to free speech: As mayor of Wasilla \u2014 the town that didn't have quite 6,000 inhabitants when she presided over it \u2014 she <a href=\"http://frontiersman.com/articles/2008/09/08/breaking_news/doc48c1c8a60d6d9379155484.txt\">discussed banning books</a> with the city librarian (who told her, in no uncertain terms, that she would fight tooth and nail if it came to that).</p> <p>In movies, it's usually the villains \u2014 the overly stern headmasters, the evil stepmother, the cruel prison guards \u2014 who try to limit the reading materials of the people whose lives they unfortunately control. In real life, it's usually the genocidal dictators like Hitler and Mao Zedong. They know that people with knowledge are powerful and won't put up with their tyranny for very long. (Kind of like Sarah Palin's God, in the Garden of Eden, didn't want Adam and Eve to eat the apple and become smarter than He was.)</p> <p>Unfortunately, it seems, approximately half of the United States could care less about knowledge or basic intelligence. If they cared, they wouldn't be in favour of someone as ignorant as Palin. And yet, they seem to like her in part because she is an anti-intellectual \u2014 which they think makes her \"one of them\". (Ask how many Alaskans think she is one of them, and I'd bet you'd get a surprising answer, given how many local leaders have had <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/washingtondc/la-na-palinstyle8-2008sep08,0,1799574,full.story\">negative things to say about her</a>.)</p> <p>We've had the ignoramus George Bush in the White House for eight years because too many Americans voted for that anti-intellectual. The last thing we need now is another arrogant, self-satisfied, inexperienced puppet in the White House. Come on, my fellow Americans who are backing Palin. It's time to wise up.</p> <p>Although, of course I'm not entirely against the former beauty pageant contestant. If she wants to run for Miss Wasilla again, I'd be more than happy to support her. And in fact, I even think she'd be capable of doing a more serious job\u2014which is why I'm going to join the Facebook group \"Sarah Palin for Deputy Undersecretary of Agriculture, Wolf/Moose Affairs.\" Just don't put her in charge of polar bears.</p>",

  "<p>After almost two years of campaigning, the US election is arriving with a rush. Although there are 52 days left until the November 4 election, the first of the ballot boxes will be open next Friday in Virginia for early voting.</p> <p>Other states will follow soon after. Thirty-six of the 50 states are offering the opportunity to vote early, either in person or by post.</p> <p>The expansion of early voting is posing a dilemma for the campaign teams, with decisions having to be made about whether to time adverts and rallies to coincide with the opening of early ballots or whether to delay drives until closer to November 4.</p> <p>With 30% or more of the electorate predicted to vote early, the Barack Obama and John McCain campaigns are already in overdrive to try to mobilise supporters.</p> <p>Early voting will have a \"tremendous\" impact on the campaign, said Paul Gronke, professor of Reed university and director of the university's Early Voting Information Centre. </p> <p>He said that, instead of one big bang on November 4, the weeks to come would be like Groundhog Day for the campaign teams, replaying election day over and over again.</p> <p>\"People tend to vote on Fridays and Mondays, so you have to time events for that. You have to get the ads out at the right time. For campaigns, it is raising the costs,\" he said.</p> <p>The concertina effect on the campaign is already forcing radical changes in campaign strategy, with signs that Obama is having to abandon his ambitious plan for fight all 50 states and instead concentrate ads and energy in the battlefield states.</p> <p>The early opening of the ballots in Virginia, a battlefield state that Obama hopes to take from the Republicans, partly explains why the Republican candidate John McCain and his running-mate Sarah Palin held a rally in the state on Wednesday and why a Victory 2008 bus tour, packed with congressmen and McCain's brother Joe, set off today on a voter registration drive.</p> <p>Early balloting after Virginia opens in Idaho on September 22, Missouri on September 23 and Iowa, another state that Obama hopes to take from the Republicans, on September 25. </p> <p>In battlefield states that have so often decided the outcome of recent elections, early balloting opens in Ohio on September 30 and Florida on October 20.</p> <p>Those who vote early tend to be partisan, with their minds made up and unlikely to be swayed by the upcoming presidential debates, analysts say.</p> <p>The Obama campaign is encouraging as many of its supporters as possible to vote early, fearful that would-be Democratic voters might turn away on election day if facing long queues on November 4 because of Republican challenges to voter eligibility.</p> <p>Professor Michael McDonald, a specialist on elections at Virginia's George Mason university, said: \"We know there is going to be a high turn-out and this offers a pressure relief valve.\" He anticipated the highest turn-out in 100 years. </p> <p>\"We are off the charts in terms of interest in candidates,\" McDonald said.</p> <p>The number of states offering early voting has jumped from only 11 in the 1990s. </p> <p>In the 2000 election only 15% of the electorate voted early, jumping to 20% in the 2004 election and 25% in the congressional race in 2006. Gronke predicted 33% in this election.</p>",
  "<p>The good times rolled last year for top executives in American boardrooms, pocketing solid pay rises in spite of the credit crunch, the sub-prime mortgage crisis and early signs of an economic slump.</p> <p>A veteran Silicon Valley technology entrepreneur topped the remuneration table. Larry Ellison, founder and chief executive of the business software company Oracle, took home $84.6m (\u00a348m).</p> <p>The billionaire America's Cup sailing fanatic fought off stiff competition to take the top-paid title. According to analysis by Associated Press, the 10 highest earners in the US included the bosses of three investment banks \u2014 Merrill Lynch, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley \u2014 and three energy and mining firms buoyed up by soaring commodity prices.</p> <p>Straitened economic conditions in the US only modestly dented the annual boardroom bonanza. A survey by Hay Group for the Wall Street Journal found compensation rose 3.5% to an average of $8.85m among chief executives of 200 top US corporations. There were few examples, however, of standout pay packages. Nobody made it into nine figures last year unlike, for example, Home Depot's Robert Nardelli who secured a $210m severance package in 2006, or Richard Fairbank of credit card firm Capital One, who scooped $280m in 2005.</p> <p>\"I don't think we've seen any particularly significant cases in the last 12 months,\" said Ryan Johnson of employment consultants WorldatWork. The reason was straightforward \u2014 the stock market had a tough year which meant executive share options fared poorly.</p> <p>\"Most of the major indices were down 10% or 15% which meant you didn't have as much cashing in as usual,\" said Johnson. \"The amount of equity most US executives now have ties their personal compensation to the share price.\"</p> <p>The pay league runner-up was Merrill Lynch's John Thain who got a generous signing-on package when moving from the New York Stock Exchange. Thain received $83.1m despite the bank's losses of $19bn on mortgage-related securities, which have prompted it to sell assets and raise money from Asian sovereign wealth funds.</p> <p>In third place was Leslie Moonves of television network CBS \u2014 the maker of hits such as CSI and Everybody Loves Raymond \u2014 who got $67.6m. Behind him were the bosses of metals group Freeport-McMoRan and energy company XTO.</p> <p>US investors are not entitled to vote on executive pay packages in the way they are in Britain. Efforts to institute a \"say on pay\" vote by shareholders at annual meetings have largely failed, with a few exceptions \u2014 such as at computer maker Apple, telecoms firm Verizon and video rental empire Blockbuster \u2014 where resolutions have passed against the wishes of the board.</p> <p>Several vocal pressure groups continue to push for pay restraint. A report from the US Institute for Policy Studies, together with United for a Fair Economy, this week concluded taxpayers in effect subsidise boardroom pay to the tune of $20bn annually through loopholes allowing companies to pay executives offshore, to minimise capital gains tax or defer taxation.</p> <p>Sarah Anderson, co-author of the study, said the rewards enjoyed by energy bosses were attracting particular ire. \"They've really been cashing in even though executives admit they don't have any control over global oil prices.\" </p> <p>The presidential election has provided hope for campaigners. Democrat Barack Obama and Republican John McCain say they support legislation presently stalled in Congress which would require companies to hold a \"say on pay\" vote annually.</p> <p>Obama favours closing a so-called \"carried interest\" loophole which limits capital gains tax on fees and bonuses. </p> <p>McCain has railed against \"rewards for failure\" when outgoing chief executives get huge payoffs, telling a group of small business leaders in June: \"Something is seriously wrong when the American people are left to bear the consequences of reckless corporate conduct, while the offenders themselves are packed off with another $40m or $50m for the road.\"</p>",
  "<p>On the 35th anniversary of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1973_Chilean_coup_d'\u00e9tat\">military overthrow</a> of Salvador Allende in Chile on September 11, 1973, which had the overt support of the United States, the presidents of <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/marketsNews/idUSN1048211320080911\">Bolivia</a> and <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idUSN1134158720080911\">Venezuela</a> have asked the US ambassadors accredited to their countries to leave. </p> <p>They both believe they are facing the possibility of an imminent coup d'etat in which they accuse the Americans of being involved. A third country, Paraguay, announced 10 days ago that it had detected a conspiracy involving military officers and opposition politicians. Latin America now faces its most serious crisis since the re-introduction of democratic practice at the end of the last century.</p> <p>Brazil and Argentina have both denounced the violent activities of opposition groups in Bolivia that have led to the closure of the natural gas pipelines to their countries, while President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez of Venezuela has warned that a coup against Evo Morales of Bolivia would be seen as a \"green light\" for an armed insurgency in that country.</p> <p>Giving details of a planned coup in his own country, in which retired military officers and opposition figures were involved, Ch\u00e1vez announced the expulsion of the US ambassador, Patrick Duddy, and the withdrawal of his own ambassador from Washington. Any aggression against Venezuela, Ch\u00e1vez said, would involve a halt in the supply of <a href=\"http://www.eia.doe.gov/cabs/Venezuela/Background.html\">Venezuelan oil</a> to the United States.</p> <p>Ch\u00e1vez's decision came one day after President Morales had thrown out the US ambassador in La Paz, Philip Goldberg, who has been frequently accused by the Bolivian government of plotting with the separatist politicians in the eastern province of Santa Cruz. </p> <p>The situation in Bolivia is immediately more dramatic than in Venezuela, although both countries are facing important electoral battles at the end of the year. </p> <p>Evo Morales, an indigenous politician from the Andes in the west of the country, has organised a referendum on a new constitution to which the rightwing (and white racist) politicians in the eastern lowlands are bitterly opposed. The atmosphere of violence has now <a href=\"http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2008/09/12/america/LA-Bolivia-Protests.php\">broken into the open</a>, with endless political demonstrations and several deaths, the seizure of provincial airports, and sabotage of the oil and gas installations on which the country's economy depends. Morales has accused the regional governors of the five eastern regions of creating the conditions for a coup.</p> <p>Ch\u00e1vez originally announced his decision to expel the US ambassador from Caracas as an act of solidarity with Morales \u2013 \"so that Bolivia is not alone\". But it was soon clear that he had his own possible coup d'etat to deal with. A tape recording of phone conversations between retired military officers, some of whom were involved in the failed coup of April 2002, was broadcast on Venezuelan television on Wednesday night, revealing plans to seize the Miraflores presidential palace and to capture or shoot down the presidential plane. </p> <p>The suggestion that there were plans to assassinate the president brought large crowds down from the shanty towns on Thursday night to demonstrate their solidarity with Ch\u00e1vez. Several of the alleged conspirators have been detained. Venezuela, like Bolivia, has an uncertain pre-election climate, since there will be regional and municipal elections in November that will be viewed as a judgment on the popularity of the president. </p> <p>The possible coup in Paraguay appears less serious, since it only appeared to involve preliminary discussions between retired General Lino Oviedo, an old hand at failed coups, and a serving officer. Yet since the government of the left-wing former bishop, Fernando Lugo, has only been in power since August, tales of a possible coup have reverberated through the continent. Brazil declared pointedly that it would not tolerate a coup in Bolivia \"or in any other Latin American country\". </p> <p>The US is, of course, preoccupied with Iraq, Afghanistan and Pakistan, but whichever presidential candidate takes over in January will also find Latin America at the top of his in-tray.</p>",
  "<p>After years of questioning the scientific consensus, Sarah Palin switched her position yesterday on the origins of climate change, agreeing that human activity contributes to rising global temperatures.</p> <p>\"I believe that man's activities certainly can be contributing to the issue of global warming, climate change,\" Palin told ABC news, in her first mainstream interview since John McCain chose her as his vice-presidential nominee.</p> <p>Palin had previously cast doubt on the cause of rapid Arctic sea ice melting in her home state of Alaska. One day before she joined the Republican ticket in August, she told conservative website NewsMax: \"I'm not one \u2026 who would attribute [climate change] to being man-made.\"</p> <p>Palin's shift brings her more in line with McCain, who has acknowledged that warming comes from the burning of fossil fuels and vowed to regulate US carbon emissions as president. </p> <p>But the Alaska governor also expressed sympathy with fellow conservatives who continue to believe \u2013 in the face of broad scientific consensus \u2013 that observed climate change is a natural variation unrelated to human activity. </p> <p>\"Whether it's entirely, wholly caused by man's activities or is part of the cyclical nature of our planet, the warming and the cooling trends \u2013 regardless of that, John McCain and I agree that we've got to do something about it,\" Palin said.</p> <p>She also challenged ABC anchor Charles Gibson to produce proof of her prior denial of the origins of climate change: \"Show me where I have ever said that there's absolute proof that nothing that man has ever conducted or engaged in has had any effect or no effect on climate change.\"</p> <p>Eight months before Palin's NewsMax interview, she told a local Alaska newspaper: \"I'm not an Al Gore, doom-and-gloom environmentalist blaming the changes in our climate on human activity\". And before her 2006 election as governor, her spokesman said Palin believed \"the jury is still out\" on the origins of climate change.</p> <p>While Palin's shift towards the McCain position on climate change may comfort US environmentalists seeking a carbon cap next year, her confident support for oil drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) is sure to agitate the green movement.</p> <p>McCain, who opposed most new drilling before this year, now strongly backs adding oil rigs to the American coastlines. He hinted that he may soon assent to opening the protected ANWR area in Alaska to oil companies.</p> <p>Palin, a vocal proponent of ANWR drilling, told ABC that she felt McCain would come to see the issue from her point of view.</p> <p>\"We'll agree to disagree, but I'm gonna keep pushing that [with McCain] and I think eventually we're all going to come together on that one,\" she said.</p>",
  "<p>I can't speak for anyone else, but for me the Liberal Democrat conference next week is the most important one in years. The struggle within the party is much more nuanced than the media's left/right caricature would suggest \u2013 nonetheless I suspect that the strategic direction of the party will be set in motion one way or another this month.</p> <p>First of all there is the question of tax cuts, and related to that Nick Clegg's leadership style. I have to admit to still being <a href=\"http://www.theliberati.net/quaequamblog/2008/09/08/nick-clegg-dismisses-u-turn-on-tax-as-mere-details/\">absolutely livid</a> over the debacle this weekend which saw Clegg claiming that the \"<a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/politics/liberaldemocrats/2697033/Nick-Clegg-promises-larger-Lib-Dem-tax-cuts.html\">vast bulk</a>\" of any savings in government expenditure that the party ends up identifying will be ploughed into tax cuts to \"middle income earners\" only to go back to the more usual formula of <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/the_westminster_hour/7603270.stm\">prioritising the party's alternative spending plans first</a> before looking to cut taxes for people on \"low and middle income earners\". Clegg's insistence that the difference between the two position is \"mere detail\" is simply unsustainable.</p> <p>As a party which is continually accused of promising the Earth on the basis that we won't ever have to deliver on our promises, the Lib Dems have had to be extraordinarily careful when discussing tax policy. We take great pains to ensure that our manifestos and tax policy papers are fully costed. All that is in danger of being undone. If things seemed <a href=\"http://www.libdemvoice.org/clegg-launches-make-it-happen-with-call-to-cut-taxes-3028.html#comment-56169\">vague</a> back in July when the party launched its pre-manifesto document, they are even worse now. Having created so much confusion, it is absolutely crucial that next week Clegg comes down firmly on one side or the other. And in doing so he mustn't be tempted to leave himself enough wriggle room to start his infamous habit of \"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/nov/21/ichbineinclegghead\">thinking aloud</a>\" in public again. Enough is enough.</p> <p>Another crucial test will be how conference responds to the proposals for a <a href=\"http://www.libdems.org.uk/policies/fast-track-britain-building-a-transport-system-for-the-21st-century-393842;show\">national road user charging scheme</a>. Even Labour has now gone cold on this idea, yet the Lib Dem parliamentary party appears dominated with people still enamoured of it. The scheme will be expensive to administer, force every motorist in the country to install a GPS transponder and crucially, will take 10 years to introduce. Yet it will not achieve a single environmental objective that petrol duty does more efficiently. Indeed, given that it will be as concerned with alleviating congestion as reducing carbon it could very likely lead to an increase in emissions.</p> <p>The Lib Dem conference is set to coincide with the start of former millionaire donor Michael Brown's fraud trial. While <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/sep/07/liberaldemocrats.partyfunding\">Robert Mann's tear jerking account</a> of why Brown's ability to con him as well as the Charles Kennedy means that the party should give him \u00a3600k does not convince (caveat emptor?), the fact is this debacle has done the party incalculable harm in the eyes of the public.</p> <p>In the US, both presidential candidates are competing with each other on the basis of who is running the cleaner campaign. In the UK, parties have thus far played a game of blaming each other for not cleaning up their own acts. Clegg should use his speech next Wednesday to break this deadlock by unilaterally imposing <a href=\"http://news.sky.com/skynews/Home/Sky-News-Archive/Article/20082851308583\">his own policy</a> of an annual \u00a325,000 cap on donations from individuals and companies on the party's own coffers.</p> <p>Finally, along with my colleague <a href=\"http://www.libdemvoice.org/conference-policy-motion-giving-citizens-a-voice-in-parliament-3298.html\">David Boyle</a> I have a policy motion of my own at this conference. This motion seeks to commit the party to a package of measures to give the public a greater say in policy making. Significantly, the final say would remain with Parliament, but it does propose greater petitioning powers, the establishment of citizen-initiated bills and the right to \"call-in\" legislation and hold a referendum on it if a million people petition against it.</p> <p>In many ways the debate over this motion gets to the very soul of the party. We consistently call for more power to the people but have a disappointing track record of only saying this sotto voce, notably during the 2005 general election. This leads commentators such as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/sep/05/scotland.snp\">Simon Jenkins</a> to be very cynical about whether we genuinely believe in it.</p> <p>This motion is quite a modest measure (it doesn't come close to proposing the sort of full <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initiative\">initiative and referendum system</a> that they have in places such as Switzerland and California), yet it appears to be causing people consternation. The <a href=\"http://www.libdemvoice.org/diana-wallis-mep-writes-time-for-the-liberal-democrats-to-let-the-people-in-3615.html\">refrain</a> is that if you give citizens too much power, they will only use it to impose regressive measures and block progressive ones. The experience of such systems worldwide simply doesn't support that hypothesis, yet it remains a persistent concern.</p> <p>Are the Liberal Democrats <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radicals_(UK)\">Radicals</a> or <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whig_(British_political_faction)\">Whigs</a>? Are we about empowering people or providing for them? These are the fundamental questions that go to the heart of the party. Over the next seven days, to at least some extent, these questions will be answered one way or another.</p>",

  "<video data-media-id=\"gu-video-337537175\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\">  </video>   <p>The historic power-sharing deal agreed in Zimbabwe gives the Movement for Democratic Change control over the cabinet and the police force that has terrorised its supporters and activists for years, opposition officials said today.</p> <p>But the president, Robert Mugabe, is to retain control of the military under the deal, which is due to be signed on Monday when full details will be revealed, according to the officials.</p> <p>The deal is expected to result in a de facto amnesty for the military and Zanu-PF party leaders responsible for their bloody campaign against opposition supporters and activists. Their attempt to overturn the opposition's election victory in March left hundreds dead and thousands badly injured.</p> <p>The deadlock in talks mediated by the South African president, Thabo Mbeki, was broken when the MDC leader, Morgan Tsvangirai, proposed a new council of state made up of Mugabe, two of his Zanu-PF deputies, Tsvangirai and two of his deputies, according to two opposition officials.</p> <p>Tsvangirai, 56, will be in charge of the cabinet and the 84-year-old Mugabe will be in charge of the council, which will act as an overseer of the cabinet's activities. But Mugabe will have no veto powers on the council.</p> <p>The MDC officials told the Associated Press that some members of their party were unhappy with the compromises. Tsvangirai had been demanding that Mugabe, Zimbabwe's leader since independence 28 years ago, become solely a ceremonial president after losing the last credible election six months ago.</p> <p>Mugabe has made no statement on the deal, but addressing traditional chiefs before talks resumed on Thursday, he had insisted: \"We will never allow the MDC to govern this country.\"</p> <p>Opposition officials said the deal gives the MDC 16 seats in the cabinet to Zanu-PF's 15. Tsvangirai's party will get eight deputy ministries, Mugabe's six, and one will go to a breakaway opposition faction led by Arthur Mutambara.</p> <p>One official said the deal included disbanding Zimbabwe's feared central intelligence organisation, which like the police falls within the remit of the ministry of home affairs, and replacing it with a smaller national security authority.</p> <p>Mbeki, who has staked his dwindling political reputation on brokering a deal, said: \"I am absolutely certain that the leadership of Zimbabwe is committed to implementing these agreements.\"</p> <p>British reaction was muted last night, with the government waiting to see the detail. \"We are following the situation closely,\" said a Foreign Office spokesman. \"We look forward to seeing the detail of the agreement announced by President Mbeki this evening. Our overriding concern is the welfare of the Zimbabwean people.\"</p> <p>If the agreement results in a real shift in power, it is likely to unlock the hundreds of millions of pounds in foreign aid desperately needed to shore up Zimbabwe's economy, which is collapsing under the weight of hyperinflation that has been a key factor in Mugabe conceding authority.</p> <p>Tsvangirai's party won the most votes in legislative and presidential elections in March, but according to election officials he did not win enough to avoid a run-off against Mugabe. Tsvangirai dropped out of the June ballot after his supporters were subjected to a state-sponsored campaign of intimidation and violence. Mugabe refused to remove the MDC leader's name from the election papers and claimed a crushing victory.</p>"

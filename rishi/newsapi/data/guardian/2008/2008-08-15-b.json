  "<p>Haji Juma Khan leads something of a charmed existence. A towering tribesman from Afghanistan's border badlands, Khan uses the title \"Haji\" because he has completed the Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca, Islam's holiest shrine. But piety is not his sole concern: he is also one of about 20 men who run Afghanistan's \u00a32bn heroin trade. Business is good. Last year the country's fields of pretty pink poppies produced a record harvest, sending drug production soaring to new heights, funding the Taliban and thrusting Afghanistan into ever greater chaos. And despite the best efforts of western counter-narcotics specialists - who have spent six years and more than \u00a31.7bn in fighting the heroin trade - Khan is free as a bird. </p> <p>His empire is centred on Baramcha, a scruffy town in the Chagai Hills on the Pakistani border. Khan, an ethnic Baluch, seized control of this parched area in the dying days of Taliban rule in late 2001 and turned it into a bustling hub of smuggling and gun running. It is dotted with heroin labs: rough shacks where turbaned men, tutored by imported chemists from Iran and elsewhere, use chemicals and vats of boiling water to refine bars of sticky brown opium into bags of powdery white or brown heroin. The drug departs on convoys of high-speed jeeps, bristling with weaponry, that dash across the desert towards the Iranian border. It is then sold to criminal gangs who push the heroin to its end customers: addicts in Europe and Russia. </p> <p>The town is also a springboard for Taliban attacks. Insurgents pass through training camps and madrasas in the town on their way north into Helmand, where 8,000 British troops are based. Opium flows in the opposite direction. The vast, unruly province provides Khan with a bountiful supply of raw drugs. Last year Helmand produced 53% of the Afghan poppy crop, making it the world's single greatest source of illicit drugs, producing more than Colombia, Mexico and Burma combined. Impressive for a province with just 2.5 million people. </p> <p>Khan makes the law in Baramcha and brooks no dissent. The last time the provincial government dispatched a team of border police to the town, three years ago, 11 officers were captured and reportedly beheaded. More recently, Khan's operations have been raided by Commando Force 333, an Afghan paramilitary unit trained by the (British) Special Boat Service. Afghan soldiers swoop in armoured helicopters, forcing their way into the drug labs and arresting whomever they find. Their British mentors usually come, too. The latest raid on Baramcha, in June, netted five tonnes of opium; 13 smugglers, including four Iranians, were arrested. </p> <p>Commando Force 333, operating under great secrecy from a fort south of Kabul, is considered a success in the war on drugs. But it has never come close to Khan. He is more likely to be found in the port cities of the United Arab Emirates - Dubai, Abu Dhabi and Sharjah - where, money-laundering experts say, much of Afghanistan's dirty cash ultimately ends up. Khan has snapped up property and a small fleet of cargo ships, based in Sharjah, which according to reports he has used for smuggling heroin out of Pakistan. His wealth is conservatively estimated in the tens of millions of pounds - money that may also be funding bloodshed: counter-narcotics officials have evidence of a meeting between Khan and insurgents including senior Taliban figures and lieutenants of Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, an al-Qaida sympathiser fighting US forces in Afghanistan's mountainous east. </p> <p>The Taliban appears to have lost its aversion to drugs since 2001, when the black-turbaned fighters banned the poppy crop at gunpoint. Now they tax farmers who grow poppies at a rate of 10% and, in some places, protect drug-smuggling convoys, also for a slice of the profits. This lucrative sideline earns the fighters at least \u00a350m a year, according to the UN; others put the figure higher. Men such as Khan are key to their success. </p> <p>The world's leading counter-narcotics agencies - America's Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and Britain's Serious Organised Crime Agency (Soca) - are trying to keep tabs on him from their Kabul embassies. Yet they cannot lay a glove on him. Instead Khan flits with ease between the UAE, Baramcha, Quetta in western Pakistan, and Kabul. \"He's everywhere, just doing his thing,\" one official admits. </p> <p>Ironically, the authorities once had him in their grasp. In late 2001 US soldiers picked up an elderly, pious-looking Baluch tribesman near the southern city of Kandahar. They identified him as Khan, Time magazine later reported, but their objective was Osama bin Laden and the Taliban leader Mullah Omar. Border rogues were low on their list of priorities. And so the soldiers let him go. </p> <p>It was a costly error. In the years since, it has become clear that the fight to save Afghanistan - from the Taliban and from debilitating corruption - is unlikely to be won without getting the better of men such as Khan. </p> <p>The project of rebuilding Afghanistan, so heartily promised by President Bush after his troops invaded in 2001, is in grave peril. The country is in terrible shape. A resurgent Taliban has swept the southern and eastern provinces, destabilising the countryside and knocking at the gates of Kabul. Britain has so far lost 114 soldiers; the past two months were the deadliest ever for American troops there. The other, less visible, threat is equally ominous. Drug-related corruption has infected every level of government, crippling governance programmes and dangerously undermining Afghan leaders in the eyes of their own people. Policemen, parliamentarians, governors and probably several ministers are on the drug networks' payroll. President Hamid Karzai has been forced repeatedly to deny allegations that members of his own family are involved. Among western allies, patience is fraying. Thomas Schweich, a former senior US official, launched a scathing attack on Karzai last month, accusing him of sheltering the drug lords. \"He was playing us like a fiddle,\" he wrote in the New York Times. </p> <p>The war on drugs is about much more than money. In other countries drugs are a criminal activity driven by greed. In Afghanistan, battered by three decades of conflict, they are a tool of political power. \"Afghanistan isn't like anything anyone has worked on before from a drug perspective,\" says Doug Wankel, a veteran counter-narcotics officer. \"This is not Burma or Thailand or Mexico or Colombia. This is a fledgling nation that is just starting to stand up again after 30 years of disarray and destruction. It's so fragile, and corruption is such an issue, that this whole drug thing can play into the other ills of the country, destroying this government and pushing the nation into big-time civil disorder. Why? Because you have so many people who can get so many weapons. It's entirely different, I'm telling you.\"</p> <p>Wankel, a 62-year-old American, has long experience of Afghanistan's drug wars. His career began in 1970 when, as a Missouri law student, he saw a TV ad for the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs, predecessor of the DEA. \"I'm sitting there thinking James Bond and women and adventure. So I called the toll-free number,\" he recalls. They sent him to Detroit, then the murder capital of America, where his job was to buy drugs: cocaine and PCP (phencyclidine) in well-to-do white neighbourhoods and heroin in the run-down black areas. Wankel, skinny as a rake, passed for a junkie. The experience blew his mind. \"You remember Shaft?\" he says. \"You actually had these guys on the streets, wearing their big-brimmed hats and fancy long coats, and driving those pimpmobiles with the white walls. It was amazing, just like you see on TV.\"</p> <p>Eight years later, seeking a fresh adventure, the young DEA officer had himself transferred to Kabul. It was a pivotal moment. Three months on, the dictator Muhammad Daud was overthrown in a communist coup. At the end of the following year, in December 1979, 100,000 Soviet troops rolled in. The Red Army occupation triggered a bloody 10-year war between the Soviets and CIA-funded fighters known as the mujahideen. The jihad, as they called it, also marked the start of the heroin era. For 150 years Afghan farmers had grown small amounts of poppy, mostly in Badakhshan province in the north. After jihad erupted, the business got serious. Shinwari tribesmen in eastern Nangarhar and their tribal cousins, the Afridis in Pakistan's Khyber Agency, started to process opium into heroin (10kg of opium makes about 1kg of heroin). Profits multiplied, and by the mid 1980s Afghanistan was supplying one third of the world's heroin. </p> <p>By then Wankel had left - the Soviets had accused him of spying - and moved on to operations in Pakistan, Colombia and Peru, rising to the number three position in the DEA. In 2004 he was called back to Afghanistan to coordinate counter-narcotics policy, and now works as a private consultant. He is frustrated at how the west has mishandled the drugs war. \"From the beginning the military thought they could do security and leave narcotics and corruption for later. They were wrong,\" he says. \"There's got to be a comprehensive strategy that also involves rule of law, corruption and drugs. Otherwise you can forget it.\"</p> <p>The more the west has poured money into fighting drugs in Afghanistan, the more heroin has poured out of the country. Since 2002 the UK, which coordinates the international effort, has spent \u00a3262m on training soldiers, police, investigators and judges, and building a new drugs court. The US has given \u00a31bn. In addition the two countries have blown a total of \u00a3420m on \"alternative livelihoods\" - rural development projects to persuade poppy farmers to switch crops. Over the same period the poppy crop has exploded, hitting a record high of 193,000 hectares last year - enough to carpet Greater London and the Isle of Wight. (This year's crop figures are due later this month.) Nor is all of this produce exported: driven by much misery and an abundance of cheap heroin, Afghanistan's own addict population is rising fast. The last survey, three years ago, recorded 920,000 users; the number is almost certainly higher now, a flood of drug-using refugees having since returned from Pakistan and Iran. </p> <p>These failures have caused bewilderment and a bad-tempered debate about how to combat drug production in Afghanistan. None of those involved - Karzai, western diplomats, Nato generals, many self-styled counter-narcotics experts - seems able to agree on the answer. The Senlis Council, a pugnacious NGO, favours legalising the poppy crop. Others, chiefly in America, press for wholesale destruction. Last year the US spent \u00a388m on an eradication programme run by DynCorp, a company that employs many retired American special forces soldiers. Over the harvesting season, DynCorp led hundreds of Afghan workers through the fields of Helmand and Uruzgan, thrashing down poppies with tractors and sticks. Fired at by angry farmers and opportunistic insurgents, and obstructed by bent local officials, the eradicators managed to destroy just 3,000 hectares. This seemed a bad deal. It would have been 10 times cheaper - and less bloody, since three eradicators were shot - to have simply bought the farmers' opium. But that solution doesn't work, either, as the British discovered five years ago when a buy-back scheme collapsed after officials realised it simply encouraged farmers to grow more poppies the next year. They turned up at the Kabul embassy demanding payment from embarrassed British officials. In diplomatic circles, the episode has been politely forgotten.</p> <p>The other big idea is aerial spraying. The US favours dispatching armoured crop-duster planes loaded with the weedkiller Roundup to spray the poppy fields; British and Afghan officials are opposed to the idea, saying it would enrage already hostile farmers. The US ambassador William Wood, who was formerly posted to Colombia, has tried to convince Afghan officials worried about the safety implications of the herbicide, saying he would even take a shower in it. A British official retorted: \"It's Roundup. My dad puts it on his weeds. It doesn't mean he uses it for his tea or to bathe in.\" </p> <p>But the focus on farmers, who are often poor and indebted, seems unfair. According to the UN, the average southern poppy farmer made \u00a31,658 from last year's harvest. That's about one third more than he would have earned growing wheat, enough to clothe his children and send them to the local school - assuming the Taliban hadn't torched it. By contrast, the 20 top traffickers pulled in profits of \u00a31.5bn. It's time to switch focus, says Christina Oguz, head of the UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) in Kabul. \"We are looking too much at cultivation and not enough at the top of the drug networks,\" she says.</p> <p>A 96-cell high security jail for high-level drug traffickers has been built, with \u00a31.1m of British money; it was handed over to the Afghan justice ministry last June. As no drug lords have been captured, however, it is likely to be filled with Taliban commanders. The heads of the drug networks, meanwhile, live freely, openly flaunting their great wealth. A raid by DEA agents on the home of a major trafficker in Nangarhar last November gives a sense of the sums involved: meticulously kept account books detailed heroin shipments worth \u00a381m over a nine-month period. In a broken, poverty-stricken country such as Afghanistan, these gangsters' main difficulty is spending the money. Status demands a few essentials. A fleet of Lexus Land Cruisers - hulking 4x4s with tinted windows, video entertainment systems and usually no licence plate - is de rigueur, as are gangly mansions in Sherpur, a new Kabul neighbourhood known for \"narcotecture\" - a gaudy style with sweeping balustrades, wedding-cake plasterwork and blue mirrored windows. The label may be unfair - some Sherpur residents surely earn their money honestly - but in a country in which drugs account for one third of gross domestic product, and the competing exports are carpets, fruit and nuts, many Afghans have a different idea. \"The owners are the ones who killed our people and drank our blood,\" construction worker Hussain told me three years ago outside a mansion he was building. \"But at least it is providing us with work.\"</p> <p>Most of the drug loot goes abroad. \"There are a lot of wealthy people in Afghanistan but the money is not here,\" says Nick Lockwood, a former drugs adviser at the British embassy. \"It's in Dubai.\" Traffickers wire their profits to the UAE using hawala, the age-old informal money transfer system that is cheap, fast and, best of all, leaves no paper trail. When it lands there are few questions asked: along with the Russian mob and Colombian cartels, Afghan drug lords are among Dubai's big investors.</p> <p>One \"big fish\", as Afghans call them, has been netted - in rare circumstances. In 2005, American agents lured Haji Bashir Noorzai, leader of a major smuggling clan in Kandahar, to New York. Noorzai thought he was there to curry favour with the Americans by providing intelligence on the Taliban. He was put up in a smart Manhattan hotel not far from the site of the destroyed Twin Towers, and interrogated, in a friendly way, for more than a week. But on the 13th day, the agents clapped him in handcuffs and brought him before a judge. The DEA later described him as the \"Pablo Escobar of Afghanistan\"; Noorzai's lawyer says he was a victim of entrapment. His trial is due to start shortly. </p> <p>That ruse is unlikely to work a second time. So the latest western scheme is to improve - in fact, build from scratch - Afghanistan's own justice system. It is a gargantuan task. The necessary institutions are rotten: the police are poorly trained and corrupt; so are the judges. Most honest, educated officials have fled the country. In the rare instances when Afghan courts have sent major drug traffickers to jail, they have almost invariably been released within weeks - on the orders of senior government officials. Oguz of the UNODC calls this \"telephone justice\".</p> <p>Undaunted, Britain and America are training the police. A dedicated counter-narcotics force has been set up; Soca and DEA agents are currently teaching a new \"special investigations unit\" the arts of phone-tapping, running informers and gathering evidence. Recruits to this force must pass lie detector and urine analysis tests, and not all make it: drug addiction levels among police are said to be extremely high.</p> <p>In an effort to evade Afghanistan's flawed courts, these donors have set up a special drugs court on the edge of Kabul. Western lawyers train its prosecutors. Judges are paid 10 times more than the going rate in the hope of keeping them honest. This appears to be working: last year the court scored 278 convictions, up from 182 in 2006. Sentences are stiff, with a minimum jail term of 10 years. Yet this system is not perfect: prosecutors are markedly better funded and prepared than defence briefs. \"It's very questionable,\" Oguz says. \"Getting evidence is not just about putting the big guys in, it's about making sure innocent people are not in prison.\" And none of those big guys has appeared before this court. </p> <p>The big problem, in almost every counter-narcotics scheme, is corruption. Allegations of covert drug trafficking swirl around many of the leading Afghan officials in the key ministries. Some may be explained as malicious gossip; others are based on hard evidence. One afternoon I visited General Kamal Sadat, who until last year headed the counter-narcotics police. Now, after failing a Soca lie detector test, he is unemployed. British officials asked if he had ever taken a bribe and, he told me angrily, \"I told them the truth.\" But instead of blaming the British, Sadat attributed his downfall to the machinations of his rival - and former colleague - General Muhammad Daud, the deputy interior minister for counter-narcotics. \"It was just a way for him to get me out,\" he spat. </p> <p>Daud is certainly a controversial figure. A former militia leader under the warlord Ahmed Shah Masood, he is a personable man with a taste for dapper suits. Investigations by the Los Angeles Times and other papers have linked the minister and his family to narcotics. Last year one of his senior aides was sentenced to 12 years for trying to sell drugs confiscated by the police. Daud, who harbours ambitions for higher political office, brushes the charges off with a laugh. But two years ago the British took them so seriously, they tried to have him fired; he survived thanks to support from Karzai and the US embassy. Now the British have learned to live with him: in June, Daud visited London on a police training course. </p> <p>Counter-narcotics officials acknowledge that they must work with people who are modestly - or \"acceptably\" - corrupt. After 30 years of war, few Afghan politicians have a clean slate, Wankel says. \"None of us would be able to survive under the circumstances these people have been through in the past 30 years. They obviously did what they had to do. Americans want to think black and white. But you gotta throw that out the window when you come to Afghanistan. Everything here is a shade of grey.\" </p> <p>There's less moral wiggle room for President Karzai. With an election looming next year, he stands accused of going slow on the drugs war to avoid annoying powerful supporters. How things change: in 2004 I attended a conference in the heavily-guarded presidential palace where Karzai declared a \"jihad\" on drugs. Foreign counter-narcotics officials now deride this as a bad joke. The president has not even made symbolic sacrifices: many point to the fact that his anti-corruption tsar, Izzatullah Wasifi, is a convicted drug dealer who served nearly four years in a US jail after being caught selling heroin in a Las Vegas hotel. \"I was a youngster,\" Wasifi told me with a shrug. More troubling allegations centre on Karzai's younger half-brother, Ahmed Wali Karzai, head of the Kandahar provincial council and reputed to be involved in the drugs trade. \"This is really a lot of rubbish,\" Karzai told Der Spiegel in June. \"I have thoroughly investigated all these accusations, and of course none of them are true.\" But the rumours persist.</p> <p>Karzai's relations with the British are strained. In early 2006, under pressure from Britain, Karzai dismissed Sher Muhammad Akhunzada, the long-standing governor of Helmand province and an alleged drug smuggler. The evidence was persuasive: in a raid on the governor's office a few months earlier, DEA officials had found nine tonnes of opium in the basement. (Akhunzada claimed he'd seized the consignment from a smuggler and was about to turn it over to the police.) The head of the DEA, Karen Tandy, later testified to America's Congress that this was the largest stash her agents had seized in Afghanistan. But Karzai, who has family ties with Akhunzada stretching back to the mujahideen war, did not punish him. Instead he rewarded the ex-governor with a seat in the upper house of Afghanistan's parliament. </p> <p>In April I went to see Senator Akhunzada at his Kabul house. For an alleged druglord, it was disappointingly sparse. Sure, a black Land Cruiser was parked in the driveway, but the carpets were mangy and soiled, the ceiling was blotched with damp and the television was an old-fashioned cathode ray tube model - not even a plasma screen. Gently stroking his beard and puffing on a Marlboro Light, Akhunzada lamented the worsening insurgency in his home province. \"Every day more killing and injuries,\" he said, shaking his head. \"Another attack on a police station today. Seven dead.\" In his view, he alone could end the violence. \"If only the British would listen, I could help,\" he sighed, \"but we do not have good relations. If I was governor, the Taliban would not have captured even five inches of land. Now they have five districts.\" He may be right that he could bring change - British officials believe his powerful militia is still running drugs. </p> <p>In a farewell act of chutzpah, Akhunzada handed me a sheaf of paper with his own prescriptions for the drug crisis. It was titled \"Preventation [sic] of poppy cultivation\". The fourth point read: \"The government should make one exact list of smugglers.\" </p> <p>For one such smuggler, Haji Juma Khan, these are interesting times. The Baluch from Baramcha is trying to go legit. According to several officials, Khan has made the government an offer: in return for an amnesty, he will quit the drugs business and invest his money in Afghanistan. \"Think of The Godfather Part III,\" says one source, referring to the movie in which Al Pacino's Michael Corleone tries to go straight. In the film it all goes wrong for Corleone. He ends up a lonely and broken man, slouched on the balcony of a Sicilian villa. The final act of Khan's career, however, has yet to be written.</p>",
  "<p>For many American commentators, plucky little Georgia has been the victim of Russian imperialism. The Guardian's Seumas Milne takes an <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/14/russia.georgia\"> equally simplistic view</a>: Russia is blameless for a war caused by US \"expansion\". Both schools of thought agree that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/russia\">Russia</a> has been the conflict's big winner. In the long run, I am not so sure. Russia has much more to lose from a period of frosty relations with the west than either the Americans or the Europeans.</p> <p>Russia's Achilles heel is its economy. This has been growing fast, at over 7% a year. Wealth has spread out from the energy companies and the government, helping to create a prosperous middle class. But the economy remains dangerously dependent on energy and raw materials. Russia has very few high-tech industries, its record on innovation is appalling, it has too few small and medium-sized companies and its service industries are backward.</p> <p>President Dmitry Medvedev and his advisers, who have close links with many business leaders, understand that Russia needs to diversify, and that autarkic policies will make that harder. More foreign investment in Russia would help to produce the kind of broad-based economy that China enjoys. The leading Russian companies want to emulate western multinationals by taking over foreign firms, raising money on international capital markets and hiring the best talent. But if Russia makes life difficult for foreign investors, its own companies will find doors closing against them.</p> <p>Even Russia's oil and gas companies, whose output is beginning to decline, cannot thrive without foreign technology, expertise and capital. Although profitable, they lack the financial muscle that would enable them to invest in major exploration projects or overseas acquisitions without the help of foreign bank loans. </p> <p>On a recent visit to Moscow I was struck by widening divisions within the Russian elite. Business leaders have become much more critical of Vladimir Putin - occasionally in public - than they were six months ago. That is hardly surprising, given the impact of Putin's policies and comments on business confidence and the stockmarket. His personal attack on the leadership of Mechel, a leading steelmaker, hit share prices badly, as did the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/georgia\">assault on Georgia</a>. The market had already been unsettled by the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/aug/05/bp.oilandgascompanies\">fight</a> between BP and AAR for control of TNK-BP. The fact that several state agencies have intervened on AAR's side may - Russian businessmen are well aware - deter some potential foreign investors.</p> <p>Many Russian business leaders worry that Putinism - and especially its anti-western foreign policy - will in the long run damage the economy. Some senior figures in the security establishment seem oblivious to the economic consequences of their actions. Putin's and Medvedev's advisers have started to spar in public. Putin, of course, is still in charge for now, but Medvedev's clan and its allies in the business world are not without influence.</p> <p>China's leadership is pursuing a long-term strategy of not alienating the US while the Chinese economy grows big and strong. Russia's leaders are making a mistake in choosing a different strategy. Although US power is in relative decline, it will remain the world's most powerful country for many years. The war in Georgia has transformed the way Americans view Russia. Until now George Bush's genuinely warm relationship with Putin has prevented a tougher US policy from emerging. But whoever wins the presidential election, US policy on Russia will harden. For many years Russia's leaders have assumed that the US intends to encircle, weaken and dismember their country. That paranoia, largely built on fantasy, will now become more real.</p> <p>The US will step up efforts to thwart Russia in its near abroad, prevent sensitive technologies from reaching the country and curb the international aspirations of Russian companies. Although John McCain's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/aug/11/johnmccain.barackobama\">scheme</a> to exclude Russia from the G8 is impractical, the G7 - which still exists for economic policy, and excludes Russia - will take on a larger and a more political role. </p> <p>Since the US trades very little with Russia, it can afford to take act tough. The Europeans, some of whom depend on Russian energy, cannot. The EU will remain divided between those who want to confront Russia and those who prefer a soft touch. But events in Georgia have shifted the centre of gravity of the European debate in a more critical direction. German public opinion, with its pacifist tendencies, has been shocked to see Russian tanks and warplanes in action. A few days before the fighting broke out, I met a German banker who works a lot in Russia and sits on the boards of several Russian companies. He normally defends Putin from all criticism. But on this occasion he told me that Russia's leaders had become so arrogant and greedy that he feared they would make serious mistakes. If Putinism continues on its current course, Russia risks alienating Germany, its best friend in Europe.</p> <p>The EU cannot do much to 'punish' Russia. If it blocked Russia from WTO membership, or stopped the talks on a new partnership and co-operation agreement, it would damage the moderates within the Russian system. But the EU could - and in the long run probably will - do two things. The first, as my colleague Tomas Valasek argues in <a href=\"http://www.cer.org.uk/pdf/briefing_georgia_15aug08_tv.pdf \">a recent CER policy brief</a>, is to strengthen ties with countries in the common neighbourhood. The EU should offer more trade and aid, encourage them to take part in many of its policies, and hold out the long-term prospect of membership, when they are ready. The second is to make clear to Moscow that the EU has a red line: if Russia tried to take over sovereign and independent states in the common neighbourhood, it would pay a price. The EU cannot and would not stop trading with Russia. But it could cut off political contacts, make it harder for some kinds of Russian to get visas, and discourage Russian businesses from entering the EU.</p> <p>Plenty of senior Russians are concerned at the prospect of a new Cold War, partly because of growing worries about China. Superficially, Russia's and China's leaders get on well, often teaming up against the west at the UN. But the Chinese, focused on the US, do not take Russia and its economy very seriously. The Russians are aware of relative strengths of their economies (in 2030, according to the <a href=\"http://http://www.cer.org.uk/pdf/p_837.pdf\">Economist Intelligence Unit</a>, China will make up 22.7% of world GDP, against Russia's 2.7%. They also fear Chinese encroachment into Russia's under-populated Asian territories.</p> <p>Throughout its history, Russia has had a poor record of making friends with its neighbours. In the multipolar world that is emerging, the country will be too weak - diplomatically and economically - to flourish on its own. It will need allies. Medvedev's people understand that splendid isolation offers no future for Russia.</p>",

I'm in a shocking state of equanimity\"), it's still hard to think of anyone in the history of cinema who has made a more obvious, glaring error.</p> <p>Come on, Worldwide Entertainment Group - you know the rules as well as the rest of us. You cast the notoriously reclusive Paris Hilton solely for her acting, for the critical kudos you know her name will bring to your film, for the standing ovation at the Venice Biennale, the breathless essay in Cahiers du Cinema that delicately unpicks the nuances of her performance, the inevitable profile in Sight And Sound that fawns despite its subject's unbending refusal to court the press. You hire Paris Hilton because you want your film fast-tracked into the pantheon, the list of cinematic greats bearing her name: The Hillz, Bottoms Up, Playboy: Hef's Halloween Spooktacular, Celebrity Sex Tapes Unwound.</p> <p>Look at that list again, and ask yourself this: what kind of idiot expects the woman who starred in those films to caper around like some half-witted performing monkey, engaging in one vulgar little publicity stunt after another as if to cover up their apparent lack of any discernible talent whatsoever?</p> <p>There aren't many extant paparazzi shots of her, but Lost in Showbiz suggests you peruse the most recent, in which she's shown protecting her privacy with trademark zealousness by visiting the Playboy mansion wearing only a see-through babydoll negligee and a shocking pink thong. One word goes through the mind: dignity.</p> <p>Does the woman in that photograph look like someone prepared to compromise that dignity and their standing as an artist in order to sully her hands with the tawdry business of self-promotion? She does not.</p>",

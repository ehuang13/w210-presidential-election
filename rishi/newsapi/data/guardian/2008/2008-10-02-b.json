  "<p>Britain found itself thrown into the US presidential election after the leak of a letter from its ambassador to Washington, Sir Nigel Sheinwald, offering a frank assessment of Barack Obama, commenting on his inexperience and aloofness as well as his intelligence and \"star quality\".</p> <p>The leak of the seven-page letter to Gordon Brown undermines British efforts to abide by the convention of neutrality in US elections.</p> <p>The letter is mainly complimentary about Obama but also highlights his perceived weaknesses. Sheinwald wrote that Obama \"does betray a highly educated and upper middle class mindset\". He adds that accusations of elitism \"are not entirely unfair\" and he is \"maybe aloof, insensitive\" at times.</p> <p>The ambassador, who was last night in Los Angeles, suggested in the letter that an Obama presidency could present problems for the UK over his plan to negotiate directly with the Iranian leadership.</p> <p>Although Brown is ideologically closer to the Democrats, he has tried to remain neutral between Obama and his Republican rival John McCain, though an article written in his name last month which praised Obama caused embarrassment. </p> <p>The British embassy in Washington said last night: \"We do not comment on leaked documents. We are totally neutral as far as the US elections are concerned and we look forward to working closely with whoever is elected.\"</p> <p>The letter, leaked to the Daily Telegraph is classified, marked \"sensitive judgements\" and requests officials to \"protect the contents carefully\". It was prepared before Obama's visit to Downing Street in the summer as part of a tour to the Middle East and Europe.</p> <p>A leak inquiry has been launched.</p> <p>The letter will play into the election campaign as it was picked up almost immediately last night on publication by US websites such as Drudge.</p> <p>It is part of the job of the ambassador to offer such assessments of an incoming president and Sheinwald has been out on the campaign trail, including attending the Democratic convention in Denver, Colorado, and the Republican one in St Paul, Minnesota, building up portraits of the two candidates. He described Obama's voting record as \"decidedly liberal\" and pointed up his lack of experience. \"Although he has been a member of the Senate foreign relations committee for four years, and a regular attender of meetings in his first two, there is little Obama track record to refer back to,\" he says.</p> <p>He attributed Obama's rise in part to luck, including that \"Hillary Clinton had such a bad organisation in the primary campaign, and took so long to respond to Obama's threat\".</p> <p>Describing Obama's approach to politics, he noted the senator has emerged from the tough Chicago political background but that he \"can seem to sit on the fence, assiduously balancing pros and cons\".</p> <p>He added: \"He can talk too dispassionately for a national campaign about issues which touch people personally, eg his notorious San Francisco comments [in April] about small-town Pennsylvanians 'clinging' to guns and religion.\"</p> <p>Sheinwald, appointed by Tony Blair, has been a relatively low-key presence in Washington compared with some of his predecessors. </p> <p>In the letter, the ambassador also described Obama as \"elegant\", \"mesmerising\", \"highly intelligent\" and having \"star quality\".</p> <p>He anticipated a potential problem over Iran, given Obama's comment that he was prepared to sit down for talks with the Iranian president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.</p> <p>\"If Obama wins, we will need to consider with him the articulation between (a) his desire for 'unconditional' dialogue with Iran and (b) our and the [United Nations Security Council]'s requirement of prior suspension of enrichment before the nuclear negotiations proper can begin.\"</p> <p>But Obama's Iraq policy of withdrawal fitted in with Britain's.</p> <p>\"Whatever the detail, our own proposed transition in south-east Iraq would be consistent with Obama's likely approach. Obama's ideas on a more expansive regional framework for Iraq would also fit well with our thinking.\"</p> <p>He wrote approvingly of Mr Obama's \"mainstream team of youthful economic advisers, with strong credentials [who] approach policy with refreshingly few prescriptions\", his \"progressive position on climate change\" and his \"pragmatic realism\" and \"balanced approach to the big security issues\".</p> <p>Sir Nigel concludes that searching for a deal between Israel and the Palestinians is \"unlikely to be a top priority for Obama\" and he expresses concern about his protectionist trade policy, while noting that he has \"repositioned himself somewhat towards free trade\".</p>",
  "<p>'They have waited until something has cracked and then at the last moment have sought to prevent total collapse.\" Those words, which could so easily have come from one of the congressional representatives who this week voted down the proposed federal bail-out of the American banking industry, were spoken by Franklin D Roosevelt in 1932.</p> <p>A precipitous collapse in stock market prices, millions defaulting on mortgage repayments, an unpopular president blamed for neglecting the plight of ordinary Americans. As the current economic crisis in the US unfolds, many people are asking whether this is history repeating itself. Are we witnessing a rerun of the stock market crash and subsequent Great Depression? What lessons can be, or should have been, learned from that earlier national emergency?</p> <p>\"The past,\" once observed Pulitzer prizewinning author Robert Penn Warren, \"is always a rebuke to the present.\" And there are certainly clear parallels between the present crisis and events of eight decades ago. In both cases, the economic collapse came after a period of political dominance by the Republican party. The 1920s saw three successive Republican politicians elected to the White House: Warren G Harding, Calvin Coolidge and Herbert Hoover. These administrations shared a fervent commitment to laissez faire capitalism, encouraging growth through tax cuts, low interest rates and minimum business regulation. Coolidge encapsulated Republican faith in the free market economy in the aphoristic observation: \"The business of America is business.\"</p> <p>Similarly, the last three decades have been a period of renewed Republican party hegemony, interrupted only by the two terms that Bill Clinton served as president. Successive administrations have championed the growth of commerce unfettered by government regulation. Even Clinton, a political centrist who abandoned many of the progressive legacies of Democratic presidents such as Roosevelt and Lyndon B Johnson, did little to control the excesses of Wall Street.</p> <p>In the 1920s, as now, political leaders created the conditions that precipitated economic crisis. In both instances, a lack of effective regulatory oversight fostered a climate of reckless speculation on the stock market. And just like the federal government in 1929, the current administration failed to see the emergency coming.</p> <p>\"I have no fears for the future of our country,\" boasted Hoover at his inaugural address in March 1929. \"It is bright with hope. We shall soon be in sight of the day when, God willing, poverty will be banished from this nation.\" Seven months later, the stock market crash precipitated an economic crisis unprecedented in the nation's history.</p> <p>In a speech last November, George Bush emphasised the continuing growth of the American economy. \"Sure, there's some challenges facing us,\" he complacently suggested, \"but the underpinnings of our economy are strong.\" Even as warnings that the country was heading towards disaster became louder, the president emphasised his administration was \"on top of the situation\". Given his earlier optimism, the recent televised address in which Bush predicted that the US faces a \"long and painful recession\" was a painful admission of his lack of foresight.</p> <p>The American economy still has a long way to fall before it reaches the depths of the Great Depression, of course. The US is technically still not even in a recession, and only just over 6% of American workers are out of a job. The economic situation is nonetheless hurting many ordinary Americans who are losing their jobs, finding themselves with little disposable income and defaulting on mortgage loans. It is also important to recall that Americans did not experience the worst excesses of the Great Depression until some years after the stock market crash. We may not yet have felt the full force of the current crisis.</p> <p>The suffering that followed the crash of 1929 was appalling. From 1929 to 1933, farm income halved, industrial production stood at 40% of capacity and unemployment rose to one in four Americans. Hungry men and women lined the streets for their next meal from the local soup kitchen, homeless people huddled in hastily erected shantytowns on the outskirts of many cities, and thousands hitched rides on railroad cars in search of a job. </p> <p>The collapse of the agricultural economy drove farmers from the land. Dust storms and evictions displaced more than a million rural labourers, whose plight John Steinbeck portrayed in The Grapes of Wrath. Industrial and manufacturing workers fared no better. The coal and textile industries were first to suffer, but were soon followed by other sectors of the economy. Homeless families in Arkansas huddled in caves; others in California found refuge in sewers. \"We saw want and despair walking the streets,\" observed a Chicago social worker, \"and our friends, sensible, thrifty families, reduced to poverty.\" The American birth rate fell to its lowest level while the suicide rate reached its highest.</p> <p>The anguish of the American people is captured in the thousands of letters they wrote to the White House in search of help. One woman from New York State sent a letter to Eleanor Roosevelt in which she asked for a loan to buy clothes for her new baby. \"Please, Mrs Roosevelt,\" she begged, \"I do not want charity, only a chance from someone who will trust me until we can get enough money to repay the amount spent for the things we need.\" As proof of her sincerity, she enclosed in the envelope two of her dearest possessions, a ring worn by her mother and another given to her as a gift by her husband.</p> <p>For African Americans things were even bleaker. The collapse of the cotton market led to the displacement of thousands of black sharecroppers in the southern states. Many migrated to urban areas but racial discrimination restricted their access to jobs and government relief programmes.</p> <p>Once again, minorities, still overrepresented among America's poor, have borne the brunt of the economic burden that now afflicts Americans. Sub-prime mortgage lenders aggressively targeted minorities who otherwise were unable to afford their own homes. According to the Harvard University's Joint Centre for Housing Studies, 55% of African Americans and 45% of Latinos who became homeowners in 2005 did so through sub-prime mortgages, compared with only 17% of whites. </p> <p>The sub-prime mortgage crisis has hit minorities hard, with many suffering foreclosures. Last year, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People filed a lawsuit against sub-prime mortgage lenders it accuses of \"institutionalised racism\" because of their predatory behaviour. Janet Murguia, president of the National Council of La Raza, a Latino civil rights organisation, similarly affirms that high-interest loans to poorer minorities are \"eroding the hard-earned wealth our communities spent decades fighting for\".</p> <p>In 1929, there were few safety nets to catch people whose livelihoods collapsed. With his New Deal, Roosevelt revolutionised the role of government as a provider for the dispossessed through the introduction of such measures as the minimum wage, unemployment relief and aid to dependent children. Despite swingeing cuts to the provision of welfare in recent times, there are now far greater protections in place for ordinary people than in the 1930s.</p> <p>Perhaps as a result, there are also no indications that the current economic crisis is tearing at the social fabric of the US in the same way as the Great Depression. Demonstrations by unemployed and homeless people shook many cities during the 1930s. Fears grew that a fascist demagogue could use grassroots unrest as a means to seize power in Washington, a scenario enacted in Sinclair Lewis' satirical novel It Can't Happen Here. While the US is not about to become a fascist dictatorship, there is a possibility of more serious social unrest should the crisis deepen further.</p> <p>The stakes are high. Bush's handling of the economy may prove decisive to this year's presidential election, as was true in 1932. The dour President Hoover appeared to many Americans uncaring and unable to appreciate the scale of the problem that beset the country. </p> <p>In 1930, Hoover introduced higher trade tariffs to protect American manufacturers from foreign competition. The Smoot-Hawley Act led to a protectionist war between the US and other countries. American exports and imports fell sharply, crippling businesses, which laid off workers in ever higher numbers. The president became so unpopular that the shantytowns erected by homeless people became known as \"Hoovervilles\" and an empty pocket turned inside out a \"Hoover flag\".</p> <p>The public perception that Hoover had failed either to avert or remedy the economic crisis led to his resounding defeat to Democratic challenger Franklin Roosevelt in the presidential election of 1932. Roosevelt won a landslide victory with 22.8m votes to Hoover's 15.7m. How the US government acts now is very important, but while Bush is unlikely to repeat Hoover's mistakes, so far he has lacked the vision of Roosevelt.</p> <p>One of the most striking contrasts between the past and present economic crises concerns presidential rhetoric. \"The only thing we have to fear,\" proclaimed Roosevelt in his inaugural address of March 1933, \"is fear itself.\" The Great Depression had a profound psychological as well as material impact on Americans, shattering their individual and collective self-confidence. In times of unprecedented trouble, Roosevelt sought to restore public optimism through his regular radio broadcasts, the \"fireside chats\" in which he presented himself as not only a politician but a personal friend to ordinary Americans.</p> <p>In sharp contrast, the address that Bush delivered to rally support for the bail-out plan exploited public fears. \"Our entire economy is in danger,\" the president warned. \"Without immediate action by Congress, America could slip into a financial panic and a distressing scenario would unfold.\" If the strategy was to scare Congress into endorsing the plan with little or no amendments, it clearly failed. Although the Senate approval of an amended plan places members of the House of Representatives under increasing pressure to support the administration, the outcome of a further vote is still not certain. </p> <p>With his poll rating already disastrously low because of his mishandling of the Iraq war, Bush has suffered a further blow to his credibility as a result of the economic collapse. According to a poll conducted by the American Research Group last month, only 19% of Americans approve of how the president is handling the economy, while 76% disapprove. </p> <p>Unlike Hoover, Bush is not seeking re-election. The crisis in the financial market has nonetheless similarly undermined popular trust in the Republicans while providing political capital for the Democrats. John McCain, who concedes his limited expertise in economic matters, has attempted to reinvent himself as a populist champion against Wall Street. His efforts to dissociate himself from the pro-business policies of the Bush administration appear, however, to be in vain.</p> <p>With the economy now the central issue in the election, Americans are increasingly placing their faith in Barack Obama to deliver the country from its current crisis. In what has been a tightly contested race, that advantage could prove decisive when Americans go to the polls on November 4.</p> <p>A fundamental weakness of the American economy in the 1920s was the unequal distribution of wealth. Although the average wage of workers increased during that decade, the economic elite benefited far more from cuts in personal and corporate income taxes. Rather than borrow more, ordinary Americans cut back on consumer purchases, creating chronic deflation. The situation is strikingly similar today. Millions of debt-ridden Americans cannot afford to repay mortgages, triggering a collapse in the housing market.</p> <p>During the presidential campaign of 1932, Roosevelt gave a speech in which he spoke of the failure of the federal government to address the needs of the Forgotten Man. Washington, he asserted, had \"sought temporary relief from the top down rather than permanent relief from the bottom up\". This is precisely the criticism that many Americans are now making about the plan to bail out the banking industry.</p> <p>There is one further lesson from history that the federal government will need to consider should economic conditions deteriorate further. Although much of the blame for the current crisis is attributable to the recklessness of Wall Street, bailing out the economic elites will not address the problems that afflict Main Street. The New Deal programmes of the Roosevelt administration represented an unprecedented expansion of government intervention in the economy. Yet they failed to work. Although Washington provided relief and opportunities to millions of Americans, the country remained in a perilous state. On the eve of US intervention in the second world war, nine million Americans were still out of work. </p> <p>Perhaps the most frightening lesson of history is that the mobilisation for war and the factory-employment opportunities it created accomplished what government economic reform programmes could not. By contrast, the current military conflict in which the US is embroiled only compounds its economic problems. The expenditure of billions of dollars on the war on terror drains resources that could be spent on the domestic economy, imposing a tax burden on ordinary people that restricts their disposable income. Nothing less than a radical restructuring of the economy, from the grassroots up, will fix today's mess.</p> <p><strong> \u00b7 </strong>Clive Webb is reader in American history at the University of Sussex</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> This article was amended on Thursday October 9 2008.

  "<p>Barack Obama, building on a shift in the public mood on the economy, today went on the offensive against John McCain, with a rally in a firmly Republican enclave in the battleground state of Michigan.</p> <p>Obama's four-hour visit to Grand Rapids, the hometown of the late Republican president, Gerald Ford, marked an aggressive new attempt to win over working- and middle-class white voters worried about the economic crisis.</p> <p>The Wall Street meltdown and the chaotic attempts in Congress to pass a $700bn bail-out package have hurt McCain, opening up a perceptible lead for Obama in Michigan and other battleground states.</p> <p>A poll for Associated Press today showed Obama pulling away from McCain in Michigan and Pennylvania, which the Democrats need to hold to win the White House.</p> <p>Obama was beating McCain in Ohio and Florida which voted for George Bush in 2004, and was in a strong position in longtime Republican states like Indiana, Virginia, and North Carolina.</p> <p>That could see the Democrats once again expanding the map of battleground states.</p> <p>The Democrat plans to hunker down in North Carolina next week to prepare for his second presidential debate against McCain. But the debate camp would also give him a chance to gauge his prospects for picking a real fight with the Republican for North Carolina.</p> <p>Obama's visit to Grand Rapids appeared in line with that more aggressive strategy which saw him venturing outside traditional Democratic areas of the state, like the heavily African-American city of Detroit.</p> <p>The area around Grand Rapids votes heavily Republican in presidential elections, and the city is a centre of Christian publishing.</p> <p>In his speech today, Obama attacked McCain as out-of-touch with people in Michigan, the state with the highest unemployment rate in the country.</p> <p>\"Nine straight months of job loss! Yet, just two weeks ago, John McCain said the 'fundamentals of the economy are strong'. Well, I don't know what yardstick Senator McCain uses, but where I come from, there's nothing more fundamental than a job,\" he said. \"It's time we had a president who understands that.\"</p> <p>Obama went on to blame the Wall Street crisis on the Republican philosophy of deregulation, which he linked to McCain.</p> <p>\"Despite my opponent's best efforts to make you think otherwise, this is the philosophy he's embraced during his 26 years in Washington,\" he said. \"He's talked a lot about getting tough on Wall Street, but over the past few decades, he's fought against the very rules of the road that could've stopped this mess.\"</p> <p>The foray by Obama into Republican terrain brought an immediate push back from the McCain camp, which accused him of seeking to raise taxes and organised a conference call for reporters with campaign advisers. \"No amount of rhetorical eloquence can explain away his 94 votes in favor of higher taxes or his call to raise taxes on the those who make only $42,000 a year,\" the statement said.</p>",
  "<p>The dramatic criminal trial of Ted Stevens, the longest-serving Republican senator in Congress, is headed for a new twist today as an error by government prosecutors raised the prospect of a mistrial.</p> <p>The presiding judge in the Stevens case has scheduled a hearing this evening to determine whether the US justice department's withholding of evidence from defence lawyers has compromised the trial.</p> <p>\"It strikes me that this was probably intentional,\" judge Emmit Sullivan told chastened prosecutors today as he suspended testimony for the day. \"I find it unbelievable that this was just an error.\"</p> <p>The evidence in dispute lies at the heart of the government's case against Stevens, who is accused of knowingly concealing more than $250,000 in gifts and home renovations he received from a wealthy oil executive in his home state of Alaska.</p> <p>Defence lawyers argue that Stevens unintentionally failed to disclose the gifts because he was unaware that the executive, Bill Allen, was paying for the home renovations.</p> <p>Prosecutors admitted today that they had not turned over an interview with Allen - the government's star witness \u2013 in which he said Stevens would have paid for the renovations if Allen's company had sent the senator bills for the work.</p> <p>The US legal system requires prosecutors to share evidence with the defence during a pre-trial period known as discovery. </p> <p>Lawyers for Stevens, who faces a difficult re-election battle next month, are pressing for an outright dismissal of the charges against him.</p> <p>\"Enough is enough,\" defence lawyer Brendan Sullivan, who is not related to the judge, wrote in a court filing today. </p> <p>\"The court should dismiss the indictment. In the alternative, the court should immediately declare a mistrial.\"</p> <p>A mistrial in the Stevens case would likely give him a boost in his race against Democratic challenger Mark Begich, the mayor of the Alaska city of Anchorage. Stevens, who has been a formidable force in Washington for 40 years, was already limping into his re-election campaign after his embrace of Alaska's so-called \"Bridge to Nowhere\" made national headlines.</p> <p>The bridge, which would have cost nearly $400m to serve a town with only 50 residents, became a symbol of congressional excess before the state officially cancelled it last year. </p> <p>Its infamy has also plagued Alaska governor Sarah Palin, the Republican vice-presidential nominee, who has portrayed herself as an opponent of the bridge despite her initial support for the project.</p> <p>A decision from Judge Sullivan on the Stevens trial could arrive tonight or as late as next week, depending on his decision-making process.</p>",
  "<p>Whoever wins the American presidential election next month, there will be a dope smoker in the White House next year. Both <a href=\"http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=cpBzQI_7ez8\">Barack Obama</a> and <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2008/08/29/politics/politico/thecrypt/main4397109.shtml\">Sarah Palin</a> have admitted that, in their youth, they smoked marijuana. British politicians are also becoming marginally franker about their own use of the drug, although the standard term is to \"experiment\" with cannabis; strangely, no-one talks about their student days \"experimenting\" with beer and wine.</p> <p>One might have thought that with so many politicians on both sides of the Atlantic having \"experimented\" and lived to tell the tale, that there would be a more receptive response to attempts to address the place of cannabis in the law. This week, the respected Beckley Foundation has published the report of its <a href=\"http://www.beckleyfoundation.org/policy/cannabis_commission.html\">global cannabis commission</a>, compiled by an international team of acknowledged experts on the issue, and its findings make intriguing reading.</p> <p>The thrust of the report, presented in the House of Lords yesterday, is that there is urgent need for a debate to move beyond the stalemate we have now reached. As the report suggests, although cannabis can have a negative impact on health, including mental health, in terms of relative harm, it is considerably less damaging than alcohol or tobacco. While there have only been two deaths worldwide attributed to cannabis, alcohol and tobacco together are responsible for an estimated 150,000 deaths per annum in the UK alone.</p> <p>Yet more than half the arrests for drugs worldwide are for minor cannabis offences and, suggests the commission, the damage done by the criminalising these minor offenders, drawing them into the criminal world and using the time and resources of the justice system to do so, appears to far outweigh the medical and societal damage.</p> <p>The lead author of the report, Professor Robin Room, spelled out the potential areas for discussion and the options for regulation of the drug. He was not advocating legalisation but merely asking for politicians to engage with the actual research that exists. For instance, the lowering of cannabis from a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2001/oct/24/drugsandalcohol\">class B to a class C drug</a> in the UK did not have the effect of increasing its use, despite the parroted claims that it would \"send the wrong message\". In fact, the opposite happened, which makes the government's current plans to reverse the reclassification even more baffling.</p> <p>There is ample evidence that regulation and education work for drugs: in 1950, 80% of men smoked tobacco, now the figure is around 30%, thanks to a mixture of information, taxation and restriction. But neither the government nor the Conservative party dare to discuss the issue and only the Liberal Democrats and the Greens will address what is one of the most important issues facing us. Instead, we follow the bellicose call from across the Atlantic for a \"war on drugs\" as misdirected and misinformed as the \"war on terror\".</p> <p>The global cannabis commission report contains much that would aid the debate. Let's hope that at least some of our politicians \"experiment\" with it.</p>",
  "<p>There are two Roanokes: Roanoke City and Roanoke County. The city has a small market area which is just the right side of twee. Art galleries and a coffee shop, some bars, restaurants, museums a diner, stores selling knick knacks and stalls selling local produce. Only the mouse infestation in the city market building casts an unfortunate blight on an otherwise dainty, village feel. Beyond this small space the city (which is actually a county unto itself) spreads out in all directions, divided by route 581 from north to south, the railroad tracks from east to west and by race and class throughout. </p> <p>Crudely speaking, the south-east is poor and white, the south-west, affluent and white, the north-west is black, the north-east more of a mix. If there are no-go areas nobody has told me not to go there. There have been 11 murders in town this year - far more than last year but with the average range. The police have a saying here. \"If you're going to get killed in Roanoke you're going to have to work at it for a while.\"</p> <p>The county climbs up to the Catawba mountains to its north-west and the Blue Ridge Mountains as its border to the south or heads south through the valley past Valhalla vineyards. In either direction you have a staggering drive with trees pregnant with leaves, ready to give birth to a staggering autumn. Small roads that snake up mountains, spawning even smaller roads that often lead to dead ends. Houses are set back into woodland; street names like Harbor wood, Wildwood and Timberview leave little doubt about the historical preoccupations of the area. There is nothing to see here but the view.</p> <p>Topographically the difference between city and county is not stark. As you drive away from the market things get sparse, start to incline and then, 15 minutes later, you are in a different place. </p> <p>But politically and demographically it could not be more clear. The city is Democrat with a black population twice the national average. In last year's city council elections the Republicans didn't even bother putting up a candidate. In the <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2004/pages/results/states/VA/P/00/county.004.html#51770\">last presidential election </a>it went narrowly for Kerry 52-46. The county is Republican with a black population half the national average. In 2004 it went heavily for George Bush, 65-35. That makes the city a tiny island in <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2004/pages/results/states/VA/P/00/index.html\">a sea of rural Republicanism</a>. To get to the next nearest county to vote Democrat you would have to travel three hours 45 minutes to the west and two hours to the south or north. </p> <p>Culturally and economically the city may dominate the county; geographically the county completely surrounds the city.</p> <p>In this regard, Roanoke is <a href=\"http://www.thenation.com/doc/20050620/nichols\">fairly typical</a>. The picture red states and blue states reasonably describes the nation's electoral map in terms of presidential politics. But for politics in general the most blatant division is not between states and regions but between the cities and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/oct/03/usa.comment\">rural areas within them</a>. All of the 32 cities in the US with populations over 500,000 voted Democrat in 2004, even though more than half are in Republican states. On the night when anti-gay amendments were passed all over the country, Dallas in Texas elected an openly lesbian, Hispanic, Democrat as sheriff. Click on any state on <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2004/pages/results/\">this map</a> and you need only go to the deepest blue to find the biggest city.</p> <p>If you're in a liberal in a city like Portland, Atlanta or St Louis this may not play too much with your mind. Surrounded by so many like-minded people you can afford to believe that the rest of the world has gone crazy. But in a city as small as Ronoake the fear is that those around you might not share your assumptions, rather than the other way around. </p> <p>When Terry McAuliffe came to talk on Tuesday many of the questions expressed a genuine fear that Republicans had better talking points. They kept asking how to counter Republican friends who said this or that until at one stage McAuliffe asked one of the questioners, if she had any Democratic friends. Anna Robertson, who runs the Pop's Ice Cream and Soda Bar in town, says she overheard some patrons whispering about their support for Obama at the counter until they spotted they Obama poster and then said out loud. \"Oh, it's okay. They have an Obama poster.\" What did they think was going to happen? She wasn't really sure. When you ask black voters whether whites will vote for Obama they say \"they should\". When you ask white Democrats many confess they don't know.</p> <p>This timidity, which others have also pointed out, seems strange for two reasons. First, there is far more enthusiasm for Obama than McCain in this area. In the city there are Obama yard signs all everywhere. Two weeks ago Katherine Devin held a Barack Obama Bake-a-rama sale and raised $16,000. Tonight she is holding an <a href=\"http://www.finearttoelectafineman.com/\">art sale</a> with local artists donating work. During an hour-long drive around the county I saw one yard sign and three bumper stickers. Though they love Palin, events for McCain here are few and far between. Neither the city nor the county voted for him during the primaries.</p> <p>Secondly, even if being a Democrat in Roanoke City feels rather isolating, this is nonetheless a good time to be a Democrat in Virginia. In the last three years the Republicans have lost the governorship, a Senate seat and the state senate. They are about to lose another <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/news/stories/1008/14169.html\">Senate seat</a>. Most pertinently they are not only having to contest Virginia for the first time in more than 40 decades - they are now considered to be losing here for the first time <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/10/01/battleground.polls/?iref=mpstoryview\">since the election started </a>and and are sinking pretty much <a href=\"http://www.pollster.com/\">everywhere else</a> in the country. </p> <p>The Republicans here feel anything but bullish. At a gathering of volunteers in a swanky downtown loft apartment earlier this week they were concerned about the imminent advent of socialism through Obama and the redistribution of wealth (the bail-out should take care of that by redistributing more from the poor to the rich). \"[Obama's] message of change is going to be received very well whether it should or not,\" said Josh Johnson, who was worried that voters will \"throw the baby out with the bath water\".</p> <p>But there is something in the Democratic psyche that dares not believe. It's not just about this time. And it's not just about race (although it is a large unknown factor). On some level it's about being a Democrat and feeling, mistakenly or not, that you have won the argument and lost the election. That the Republicans have some hidden weapon, dirty trick, underhand scheme to steal the show just before the curtains go up. The are haunted by the ghosts of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katherine_Harris\">Katherine Harris</a>, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bradley_effect\">Wilder</a> and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willie_Horton\">Willie Horton</a> all coming down the pike in Swift boats. They keep chanting \"Yes we can\" but deep down many feel: \"I wonder if we might.\"</p> <p>Additional reporting by Daniel Nasaw</p>",
  "<p>As we await tonight's doubtless historic clash between Sarah Palin and Joe Biden, why not don your sepia-tinted spectacles and skip with me down Memory Lane as we review great moments from the vice-presidential debates of yesteryear? It's entirely possible that this evening's shenanigans will rewrite the history of these curious events forever.

You already know the exchange, but the clip is worth watching again for the sheer iciness of the moment, and the strange combination of vacancy and rage that grips Quayle's features. And the Dukakis/Bentsen ticket lost to Bush/Quayle, of course, which just goes to show how little these head-to-heads between the running-mates can end up counting for.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/lWGg2JphrQM?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <object width=\"460\" height=\"385\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/lWGg2JphrQM&hl=en&fs=1\"></param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"></param><embed src=\"https://www.youtube.com/v/lWGg2JphrQM&hl=en&fs=1\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"460\" height=\"385\"></embed></object> </figure>   <p><strong>You know, I didn't have my hearing aid turned on</strong><br>James Stockdale, a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Stockdale\">much-decorated naval officer</a> but a pretty disastrous vice-presidential candidate on Ross Perot's independent ticket in 1992, draws slightly cruel audience laughter, in a debate incident that demonstrates the perils of being a seventysomething candidate for office.

Cheney had no problem brazenly denying he'd ever made a link between Iraq and 9/11, and also accused Edwards of being a lazy senator, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aUxphDg2HtQ\">claiming never to have met him</a> prior to the debate \u2014 which turned out to be <a href=\"http://www.nbc10.com/politics/3787241/detail.html\">not exactly true</a>.</p>",
  "<p>Joe Biden and Sarah Palin tonight face off in one of the most highly anticipated vice-presidential debates in history, giving voters a chance to directly compare the hugely experienced Democratic candidate and his charismatic but untested opponent.</p> <p>The event tonight at Washington University in St Louis, Missouri, is the only head-to-head debate for the vice-presidential hopefuls in the campaign.</p> <p>While Biden, who has been in the US senate since 1972, has to beware of his tendency to lapse into confusing verbosity, the event is being seen as particularly critical for Palin, the Alaska governor, whose knowledge of national and global issues has come under question in recent days.</p> <p>Biden, of Delaware, honed his craft in more than a dozen presidential debates during the Democratic primary campaign, from which he dropped out in January. Palin, meanwhile, only took office in Alaska in 2006 but proved her mettle in debates while running for that position.</p> <p>But since being selected as John McCain's running mate in late August, Palin has failed to show a full command of a number of issues during the few television interviews she has given. Biden, Barack Obama's running mate, while skilled and knowledgeable, is also prone to occasional embarrassing gaffes.</p> <p>In recent weeks the two campaigns have sought to manage expectations ahead of the debate, with both vice-presidential hopefuls praising their opponent as formidable. One liberal television commentator remarked recently that the Republican team has set expectations for Palin's performance so low that she cannot lose.</p> <p>Palin is nonetheless widely understood to have more at stake tonight. If she appears unprepared and ill-equipped to discuss major issues it could even add to the murmur of calls for her to be dumped from the Republican ticket, as well as casting doubt on McCain's judgment in selecting her. </p> <p>But if she is able successfully to parry tough questions, or wow the audience with detailed knowledge of economic and foreign policy matters, she will reignite the Republican base and could win over the small but crucial class of undecided voters. </p> <p>She has spent the last several days in \"debate camp\" on McCain's Arizona ranch, preparing and rehearsing with top McCain aides. Palin has the inbuilt advantage of being telegenic, with a natural speaking style that many voters find appealing.</p> <p>Biden, for his part, must carefully walk the thin line between showcasing his knowledge and abilities and appearing overbearing and condescending to a woman candidate. </p> <p>Tonight's forum will be moderated by Gwen Ifill, a correspondent and moderator on nationally televised public television news programmes. She is seen as a tough questioner unlikely to be caught up in trivialities. Ifill has written an upcoming book about African American politicians entitled, \"The Breakthrough: Politics and Race in the Age of Obama\" that has some Republicans questioning her neutrality.</p> <p>The format is not as free-flowing as last week's presidential debate between McCain and Democrat Barack Obama, and is seen as favourable to Palin. It consists of 90-second answers, followed by a two-minute discussion of each question.</p> <p>Historically, vice-presidential debates have little impact on the course of the election. In 1988, for instance, the Democrat, Texas senator Lloyd Bentsen, was seen as having trounced his Republican opponent, Indiana Senator Dan Quayle. In a memorable moment still discussed today, Bentsen mocked Quayle's effort to compare himself to President John Kennedy. </p> <p>The Republican ticket, led by George Bush Sr, still won the election, although Quayle's own political individual career was effectively ended.</p>",

Given any question, she reaches into her bag for the readymade sentence that sounds most nearly proximate to an answer, and, rather than speaking it, recites it, in the upsy-downsy voice of a middle-schooler pronouncing the letters of a word in a spelling bee.

  "<p>Almost half the population of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/zimbabwe\">Zimbabwe</a> could soon be dependent on food and medical aid, the UN's humanitarian chief said today.</p> <p>John Holmes, the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/unitednations\">UN</a>'s under-secretary general for humanitarian affairs, said that around 3 million people were already reliant on aid, and that figure could rise to more than 5 million.</p> <p>He said it was a critical time because preparations needed to be made now for next year's harvest to avoid millions more people becoming reliant on aid. The main growing season in Zimbabwe lasts from now until March.</p> <p>\"Planting season for the next harvest starts in five or six weeks' time, at least for maize, and there is massive shortage of seeds and fertilisers in the country because of the economic situation,\" he told the BBC's World Today programme.</p> <p>\"We're looking to see whether we can accelerate even at this late stage and get some of those seeds and fertilisers and other imports into the hands of small farmers,\" said Holmes. </p> <p>He said he hoped the farmers would plant more seeds \"so they can harvest more, so we have less of a food assistance problem next year\".</p> <p>Holmes also said that access for aid agencies had improved since last month's power-sharing deal was agreed between the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) and Robert Mugabe's Zanu-PF party.</p> <p>Mugabe ordered aid groups to suspend work in June ahead of the presidential run-off election, leaving millions at the mercy of state food distribution. Aid groups also complained that the government had given food primarily to Mugabe supporters.</p> <p>The UN estimated Zimbabwe's population at 13.3 million in 2007, with an average life expectancy of 44 for men and 43 for women.</p>",
  "<p>\"Step up to the plate and let's do what's right,\" Barack Obama told his fellow lawmakers yesterday, ahead of last night's Senate vote on the revised version of the government's bailout plan, which passed by 74 votes to 25. John McCain, who like Obama, altered his campaigning schedule to return to Washington, expressed the same sentiments, calling on Congress to act with \"the unity that crisis demands\". The House of Representatives is expected to vote on the bill tomorrow. But campaigning didn't really stop at all: although McCain spoke directly to the camera in a new TV ad, bemoaning the way that Democrats and Republicans were blaming each other for the crisis, his surrogate Rudy Giuliani did exactly that in a conference call with reporters.</p> <p>The focus now moves to St Louis, Missouri, where Sarah Palin goes head-to-head with Joe Biden tonight in what is surely the most closely watched vice-presidential debate in recent memory. Expectations for Palin's performance couldn't be much lower, after a sequence of embarrassing responses to questions from Katie Couric on CBS - but traditionally, of course, low expectations are a boon for a candidate heading into an event such as this. The Democrats, meanwhile, have been seeking to heighten expectations of the Alaska governor, aided by a flurry of news stories over the last couple of days suggesting Palin is a better debater than many might imagine. The gaffe-prone Biden is a source of nervousness to Democrats, too: the tiniest sign of condescension towards Palin could prove disastrous. But there's no question of which campaign goes into tonight's face-off with the most to prove. </p> <h2>What to watch for</h2> <p>There's only one thing to watch, of course: the showdown between Mr Amtrak and the moosehunter.

Meanwhile, Obama showed significant improvements in a raft of battleground state polls, leading 51% to 43% in Florida, according to a Quinnipiac state poll which put him seven points behind three weeks ago. A CNN poll found gains for Obama in five crucial battleground states - Florida, Minnesota, Missouri, Nevada and Virginia.</p> <h2>Quote of the day</h2> <p>\"People need to see a gladiator who's willing to defend what exactly he stands for.\" Tennessee Republican chairman Robin Smith, one of several party figures sounding panicked at what former McCain aide Mike Murphy called a \"stunning lack of competence\" in the campaign. </p> <h2>On theguardian.com now</h2> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2008/oct/02/uselections.new.mexico\">Video: 'The Hispanic voter is an emotional voter'</a></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/02/uselections2008.johnmccain\">Anxious party tells McCain to fight harder</a></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/01/uselections2008.virginia\">Former DNC chairman says attack ads against Obama will get nastier</a></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2008/oct/02/uselections2008.sarahpalin\">Tomasky Talk: Palin v Biden</a></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/oliverburkemanblog/2008/oct/01/johnmccain.sarahpalin\">Oliver Burkeman: And now for some relaxing music</a></p> <h2>Best of the rest</h2> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"http://www.csmonitor.com/2008/1002/p04s01-wosc.html\">Christian Science Monitor: Flirting with Palin earns Pakistani president a fatwa</a></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/02/us/politics/02issues.html?_r=1&amp;partner=rssuserland&amp;emc=rss&amp;pagewanted=all&amp;oref=slogin\">NYT: As Governor, Palin Has Focused on Developing State's Resources</a></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2008/10/01/palins-interview-with-couric-grabs-more-headlines/\">WSJ: Palin's Interview With Couric Grabs More Headlines</a></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"http://talkingpointsmemo.com/archives/221299.php\">Talking Points Memo: Sarah's Greatest Hits!</a></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/hendrikhertzberg/2008/10/interoffice-mem-1.html\">New Yorker: Interoffice Memo</a></p> <h2>Property of the day</h2> <p>Buy John and Cindy McCain's <a href=\"http://blogs.phoenixnewtimes.com/valleyfever/2008/09/ok_so_after_todays_financial.php\">old mansion</a> in Phoenix, Arizona! \"This gracious, private residence is gated and secure on a sprawling 2.7 acre estate lot.

  "<p>Gordon Brown bowed to the inevitable and admitted yesterday that Britain was about to go into recession for the first time in 16 years. He did so as he highlighted new plans to persuade <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/mortgages\">mortgage</a> lenders not seek to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/repossessions\">repossess</a> the homes of borrowers unable to pay their arrears. </p> <p>In the Commons Brown followed the example of the chairman of the Bank of England, Mervyn King, and said the country had to prepare for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/recession\">recession</a>. </p> <p>Brown told MPs: \"Having taken action on the banking system, we must now take action on the global financial recession.\"</p> <p>He said this was likely to cause \"recession in America, France, Italy, Germany, Japan and - because no country can insulate itself from it - Britain too\".</p> <p>The Conservative party leader, David Cameron, tried to make Brown shoulder some of the blame for Britain's economic malaise, and pointed out that half of the OECD countries were going into the downturn with budget surpluses, making it possible for them to cut taxes for families. </p> <p>\"He claimed the credit in the boom, why won't he take responsibility in the bust?\" Cameron said.</p> <p>Britain will not formally go into recession when the latest growth figures are published tomorrow because there was zero growth as opposed to negative growth in the previous quarter. A recession is technically defined as two successive quarters of negative growth. </p> <p>Brown announced that in the wake of the downturn fresh guidance was being issued to judges to try to reduce the 40,000 repossessions forecast for this year. The Treasury announced new court protocols from the Civil Justice Council designed to make repossessions a last resort.</p> <p>Lenders will now be expected to demonstrate to courts that they have tried to discuss and agree alternatives to repossession when borrowers get into trouble with their mortgage repayments. If a case reaches court, lenders will be required to tell the court precisely what they have done to comply with the protocol. </p> <p>Lenders, under the new guidance, coming into force on November 19, must explore options to help people stay in their home, such as extending their mortgage term, changing the type of mortgage they have, such as switching people to an interest only one, deferring the payment of interest and adding arrears to the overall loan. One of the toughest lenders in terms of repossession has been Northern Rock, owned by the government. </p> <p>In addition the government is proposing that companies engaged in sale and rent back schemes, which may target vulnerable homeowners, should be brought under FSA regulation for the first time. The government is following a recommendation from the Office of Fair Trading.</p> <p>Buoyed by two new opinion polls showing his personal standing is rising, Brown was also complimented by the French president, Nicholas Sarkozy, who proposed that the prime minister be asked to regularly attend meetings of the euro-group of countries over the next year. </p> <p>Brown will also attend a meeting of world leaders on the economy announced yesterday by President Bush for Washington on November 15, 11 days after the US presidential election.</p> <p>A fresh poll by Ipsos MORI shows Labour up six points to 30 points and the Conservatives down seven points to 45 points, with the Liberal Democrats on 14 points up two. A separate poll by YouGov for Channel 4 News showed Labour greatly narrowing its deficit in the must-win marginal seats from 13 points to five.</p>",
  "<p>Where were you when Obama was shot? The line we pray we will never have to say. A line that I have hesitated even to write, as if the mere inscribing of the words could invite calamity. Yet the fear preys on the back of our minds, as we see Barack Obama plunging into those crowds. I have now watched weeks of election coverage on the 24/7 television news channels in the United States, in the course of which every tiniest feature of the campaign has been examined to exhaustion, but not once have I heard this mentioned. Yet almost every day I have a private conversation in which the subject comes up, especially when talking to journalists.</p> <p>Is this self-censorship of the media right? Should I not even be writing this? There are unstable, suggestible people out there. Experts may argue about the psychological impact of media coverage of such subjects, but it clearly has some. Earlier this year, a blogger pointed out that \"assassinate Obama\" had that day appeared on a list of Google's top 100 search items.</p> <p>She suggested that newspaper stories about the danger had increased the number of such Google searches - and that her own blog might do the same. As may this column.</p> <p>Yet to ignore this subject completely, never to mention in print what so many are thinking, is to miss something important. Only against this dark background of dread can you appreciate the full irresponsibility of the turn the McCain-Palin campaign has taken towards attacking Obama's character, biography and patriotism - attacks which, in other contexts, we would not hesitate to describe as \"character assassination\". The charge made by Sarah Palin that he has been \"palling around with terrorists\"; the automated calls associating him with \"domestic terrorist\" William Ayers; the underhand insinuation that he is alien, un-, or even anti-American; rhyming Obama with Osama; the absence of instant rebuke when some idiot at a Palin rally cries out \"terrorist!\" or even \"kill him!\".</p> <p>Palin supporters might retort: this is America, not namby-pamby Europe. We fight tough, and we fight to win. A little gouging of the eyes as you roll in the dirt is just fine, in this land of real men. But more responsible Republicans disagree. They argue that, if you really put \"Country First\" - John McCain's campaign motto - you should not travel along this road and risk stirring those demons. It's no accident that Obama was given secret police protection unusually early in the primaries. Watching Colin Powell's measured and eloquent endorsement of Obama, many will have recalled that one widely reported reason Powell himself did not run for president was his wife's fear that he would be assassinated. No serious analyst would dispute that the threat to Obama, however effective his secret police protection, is greater than it would be to a white candidate.</p> <p>Of course the nutters, xenophobes and racists are out there anyway. The point is that nobody should ever be able to claim, with even a shadow of plausibility, that the Republican campaign has given them even a hint of encouragement. I feel it important to record that I have heard several white Republicans say, with real feeling, what a great thing it would be for the US to have a black president.</p> <p>This criticism of the nasty turn taken by the McCain-Palin campaign would lose some of its force if the Obama campaign had been launching comparable attacks on the character and biography of the Republican candidates. Now the Obama camp has done its share of negative campaigning, and the excellent factcheck.org finds that the candidate himself has sometimes misrepresented McCain's policy positions. But he has never resorted to such lowdown personal attacks. In the last presidential debate, he even heroically refrained from questioning Palin's qualifications to be president.</p> <p>His quiet message was: let the American people judge. So the McCain-Palin campaign has been unilaterally playing with fire.</p> <p>The stakes in this election grow higher by the day. It feels like watching a poker game with huge piles of chips accumulating on the table. Both the potential loss and the potential gain are enormous. On the upside is not just the symbolic breakthrough of electing the first African-American president - and a child of the world carrying with him the hopes of the world. It's also the arrival in the world's most important job of someone who has the potential to do it very well.</p> <p>I did not always think this. Last year he still looked inexperienced. But Obama has gained stature through every challenge. For a start, he has shown amazing stamina and strength. Due to the long drawn-out primary contest with Hillary Clinton, he has been campaigning for nearly two years, non-stop. Through all the ups and downs of the campaign, and the financial crisis of recent weeks, he has been cool as a cucumber and steady as a rock. These are qualities we'd like to see in a president.</p> <p>In the debates, he was dignified, well-informed and grownup, making a grimacing McCain look like the temperamental youngster. He greeted the old fighter pilot's attacks with an ironical smile that visibly drove McCain nuts. He has the kind of cryptic detachment that is an asset to any chairman. Personally, he seems centred and rooted. You feel this a man who knows who he is. Not because he has always known who he is, like the heir to \"a long line of McCains\", but because for a long time he didn't - and then worked it out for himself the hard way, through the search recorded in the autobiographical Dreams From My Father. He has, so to speak, the rootedness of the uprooted.</p> <p>He has also cut some of the waffle that we heard earlier in the campaign. On policy, he has demonstrated a clear intellectual grasp of the issues, an ability to absorb and synthesise expert advice, and a consistent focus on a few strategic priorities: the economic condition of the middle class, healthcare, education, energy.</p> <p>Following the last debate, some of the instant reaction pundits on CNN complained that he had been \"professorial\" (what have they got against professors?). Then the polling came in, and it turned out that undecided voters rather liked professorial. After eight years of \"the kind of guy you'd want to drink a beer with\" (W), maybe someone who showed a clear understanding of complex issues would not be so bad. Without counting his chickens before they hatch, Obama is already preparing his personnel lists and policy options for government - determined to make a better start to his first term than Bill Clinton did. With every week, my respect for him has grown.</p> <p>Of course you never know until you know. Will he be bold enough? Can he make the unwieldy machinery of Washington, including his own party's representatives in Congress, work effectively to realise his strategic goals? But everything he has shown us this autumn suggests that he has the potential to be a very good president, perhaps even a great one.</p> <p>These are just some of the reasons why no American election since 1932 has had such a deep downside of fear and such a high upside of hope.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.timothygartonash.com\">www.timothygartonash.com</a></p>",
  "<p>President George Bush and fellow world leaders will attempt to thrash out a united response to the global financial crisis next month when Washington hosts an emergency summit.</p> <p>The meeting on November 15 will discuss the underlying causes of the downturn, the global response and the principles that will underpin any reforms, the White House said. Leaders from the group of leading economies - including Brazil, China and India as well as the G7 nations will attend the meeting, which will also seek input from the winner of the US presidential election.</p> <p>However, the White House acknowledged that the first meeting was unlikely to produce concrete proposals for tackling the consequences of the credit crunch. Although the world's biggest economies have followed Gordon Brown's lead in recapitalising their major banks, leaders have expressed divergent views on what future shape global finance should take.</p> <p>Bush has warned that any coordinated international action should preserve free markets but his French counterpart, Nicolas Sarkozy, declared last month that the \"all-powerful market that always knows best is dead\".</p> <p>Dana Perino, a White House spokesman, said she did not expect the summit to present firm decisions on new policy or regulation. The task of putting \"meat on the bones\" after the meeting will be up to financial experts in the world leaders' respective countries, Perino added. \"A lot of work will have to be done at the taskforce level, the working group level,\" she said. Those working groups will then draft recommendations for consideration at further summits.</p> <p>Barack Obama, favourite to win the election that takes place 11 days before the summit, welcomed the announcement by a Bush administration that is making one last push to stabilise the global economy before the new president takes office on January 20.</p>",
  "<p>There is, it turns out, another difference between a pit bull and a hockey mom, when the hockey mom in question is Sarah Palin: more than $150,000 (\u00a392,000) in clothing and accessories from some of America's most upmarket department stores, including $4,716 on hair and makeup, all in the space of a couple of months.</p> <p>While others merely speak of the need to stimulate the US economy, the Republican party seems to have been trying singlehandedly to revive the designer couture sector, it emerged yesterday. </p> <p>Since late August, it has spent more than $125,000 in shopping sprees on behalf of John McCain's running-mate and her family at Saks Fifth Avenue and Nieman Marcus, along with smaller sums at Bloomingdale's, Barney's and Macy's.</p> <p>Details of Palin's shopping trips - including a single outing costing $75,000 - emerged as a new report into campaign finances revealed the cost of the presidential election would easily exceed $1bn, shattering records for fundraising and spending. </p> <p>According to the Centre for Responsive Politics, which monitors political fundraising, the overall cost of the 2008 presidential and congressional elections combined will total $5.3bn, which would buy a lot of tailored suits and wrap shirts from Nieman Marcus. </p> <p>A McCain campaign spokeswoman said it had always been the plan to donate Palin's clothes to charity after the election. </p> <p>\"With all of the important issues facing the country right now,\" said Tracey Schmitt, \"it's remarkable that we're spending time talking about pantsuits and blouses.\"</p> <p>But since the average US household spends around $1,800 on clothes in the course of a whole year, the news did little for Palin's self-promoted image as an anti-elitist American.</p>",
  "<p>The US election campaign, already breaking all records for fundraising and spending, is set to breach the $1bn (\u00a3614m) mark this month, making it the costliest by far in American history. </p> <p>The two candidates had raised a combined total of $961m by the end of September, according to figures released this week. But Barack Obama alone will almost certainly push that over the $1bn mark before the November 4 election. </p> <p>The total cost of the presidential race could be as much as $2.4bn, according to the Centre for Responsive Politics, a Washington-based organisation that tracks political fundraising.</p> <p>The group has calculated that the US elections as a whole could cost $5.3bn when combining the candidates' fundraising with the cost of the congressional election campaign and contributions from unions and other outside organisations and groups. </p> <p>\"The election will blow through historic records on a number of counts,\" said Sheila Krumholz, executive director of the centre.</p> <p>In 2004 John Kerry and George Bush raised $880.5m in what was the most expensive election to date.</p> <p>Obama has so much money available that he is easily outspending John McCain in advertising, which is the biggest expenditure.</p> <p>Evan Tracey, president of the Campaign Media Analysis Group, which monitors spending on advertising, said Obama was close to saturation point. \"There is in essence no limit to what Obama can do. He has the lion's share of spending ... he has more money than TV space to buy,\" Tracey said.</p> <p>Since September Obama has bought 330,000 adverts in all the battleground states compared with 100,000 by McCain, Tracey said. </p> <p>During his political career Obama has seen spending power as a key to victory. He raised a staggering $153m in September, bringing his fundraising total to $603m so far. Of this he has spent $470m. In September alone he spent $96.9m, of which $65m went on advertising, $5m on travel, $1.1m on polling, $1.8m on postage, $1m on setting up stages and $1.2m on credit card fees.</p> <p>He spent $3m on staff wages but this does not begin to reflect the size of his campaign, which has attracted a huge volunteer base. McCain, by contrast, is struggling to attract Republican volunteers and is offering $12 an hour for canvassers in Florida.</p> <p>While Obama is free to continue with fundraising efforts this month, McCain has been hobbled by having accepted public finance of $84m that prevents him from raising funds separately. </p> <p>Having spent $37m of that in September, he had only $47m - which in normal times would have been seen as a substantial sum - for the remainder of the campaign.</p> <p>Outside Obama's campaign team, his biggest backers are the trade unions, who are spending tens of millions on advertising and campaign staff. </p> <p>The United Steelworkers union, for instance, has 120 full-time staff working on campaigning for Obama, in addition to volunteers. </p> <p>Gary Hubbard, a spokesman for the union, was yesterday unable to put an immediate figure on union spending but added: \"Democracy ain't cheap.\"</p> <p>The Obama team likes to portray its fundraising as a populist movement driven mainly by small donors, contributing $200 or less. </p> <p>But in an analysis of the 800-page file on fundraising and spending submitted by Obama under election law, the Washington Post found that only a quarter of the $600m raised so far had come from small donors.</p> <p>McCain potentially has access to the $80m-plus the Republican party has in the bank but some state party officials - either because of coolness towards McCain on ideological grounds or because they do not want to waste cash on what they see as a losing campaign - have withheld funds.</p> <h2>Election inflation</h2> <p>Amount raised by all candidates in previous elections</p> <p><strong>1976 </strong>(winner Jimmy Carter)$171m</p> <p><strong>1980 </strong>(Ronald Reagan)$161.9m</p> <p><strong>1984</strong> (Reagan)$202m</p> <p><strong>1988 (</strong>George Bush)$324.4m</p> <p><strong>1992</strong> (Bill Clinton)$331.1m</p> <p><strong>1996</strong> (Clinton)$425.7m</p> <p><strong>2000</strong> (George W Bush)$528.9m</p> <p><strong>2004</strong> (Bush)$880.5m</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/barackobama\">Barack Obama</a> began to speak openly and in detail about the post-election transition period from George Bush's presidency for the first time yesterday, opening himself up to charges of complacency.</p> <p>As most polls showed the Democratic candidate's lead over his Republican rival <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/johnmccain\">John McCain</a> still growing, Obama held a meeting in Richmond, Virginia, to discuss with senior national security advisers the foreign policy challenges he would face as president. Bucking the trend, one poll, conducted by Associated Press, showed McCain cutting back Obama's 7% lead three weeks ago to 1%, on 44% to 43%. </p> <p>Obama's comments mark a significant change in the campaign, switching from rhetoric to a more presidential tone. </p> <p>Although Obama added the caveat that \"I don't want to get too far ahead of myself,\" his comments reflected a sense of confidence that his campaign team is finding it hard to hide. At a press conference after the national security meeting, he said that although he had been almost single-mindedly focused on the economy, he had plans ready for Iraq, Afghanistan and other foreign policy problems. </p> <p>He spoke about having teams in place to deal with foreign and economic policy during the awkward transitional period between November 4 and the inauguration on January 20.</p> <p>Interviewed yesterday, Obama said a smooth transition was essential to make sure America's enemies did not take advantage of a shift in administrations. </p> <p>In another sign of looking beyond the November 4 election, he welcomed a White House-organised international summit on the economic crisis planned for November 15. With Bush as a lame-duck president and Obama as possibly the president-in-waiting, the Democratic candidate would be a key figure. \"I am happy today that the White House announced a summit that provides an opportunity to advance the kind of cooperation I called for last month,\" he said. \"America must lead and other nations must be part of the solution too.\" He refused to be drawn into what role he would play at the summit if he was elected president. He said his economic team was already in constant touch with the treasury secretary, Henry Paulson.</p> <p>To avoid sounding too presumptuous, he said: \"Even though the election will have taken place and there will be a new president-elect, we are still going to have one president at a time until January 20, until the new president is sworn in.\"</p> <p>It is risky for Obama to speak so openly about the post-election period with 13 days still to go of the campaign. While his appearance surrounded by national security experts from the Clinton administration and Washington-based thinktanks can make him appear more presidential, it also opens him up to accusations by McCain that he has become too cocky.</p> <p>McCain told a rally yesterday before Obama's meeting that his rival was behaving as if he was already president to the extent that he would be making an address to the nation next.</p> <p>The meeting with his national security advisers and a rally planned for Leesburg, Virginia, last night will be among Obama's last events before heading for Hawaii for two days to visit the grandmother who helped raise him and who is seriously ill.</p> <p>The meeting in Richmond and the subsequent press conference were designed partly to try to deflect comments made by his vice-presidential running-mate, Joe Biden, on Sunday. Biden, who is famously gaffe-prone, said that Obama as president could expect to face international crises as America's opponents sought to test him.</p> <p>Both McCain and his running-mate, Sarah Palin, jumped on this, saying America's enemies perceived Obama as weak and would seek to test him.</p> <p>Obama responded: \"His core point was the next president is going to be tested regardless of who it is.\"</p> <p>Palin too found herself on the defensive yesterday when an Associated Press investigation found what appeared to be a cover-up in relation to expenses claimed as governor of Alaska. As was reported last month, Palin charged the state more than $21,000 to cover the cost of her children travelling with her.

  "<p>A <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/news/stories/1008/14829.html\">new study</a> shows that McCain has received highly negative media coverage since September:</p> <blockquote> <p>Just 14 percent of the stories about John McCain from the conventions through the final presidential debate were positive in tone, according to a study released today, while nearly 60 percent were negative\u2014the least favorable coverage of any of the 4 candidates on the ticket.</p> <p>The study, by The Pew Research Center's Project for Excellence in Journalism, a non-partisan journalism watchdog organization, examined 2,412 stories from 43 newspapers and cable news shows in the six-week period beginning just after the conventions and ending with the final presidential debate.</p> </blockquote> <p>Them's the facts. Then comes the expert explanation:</p> <blockquote> <p>Much of the increased attention for McCain derived from actions by the senator himself, actions that, in the end, generated mostly negative assessments,\" the study found. \"In many ways, the arc of the media narrative during this phase of the 2008 general election might best be described as a drama in which John McCain acted and Barack Obama reacted.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>In other words, McCain has received negative coverage because...he's run a negative and gimmicky and lousy campaign!

Given the truly preposterous amount of attention that has been given to Palin's <a href=\"http://cosmetic-makeovers.com/2008/09/06/sarah-palins-hair-how-to-video\">hair</a>, <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/money/industries/retail/2008-09-03-palin-glasses_N.htm\">glasses</a>, <a href=\"http://www.suntimes.com/-1,101508palinshoesg.photogallery?index=0\">shoes</a>, <a href=\"http://crooksandliars.com/logan-murphy/sarah-palin-wears-polar-bear-pin\">accessories</a> and every other little detail of her <a href=\"http://women.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/women/fashion/article4659830.ece\">clothing</a> and <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/09/30/is-sarah-palins-lipliner_n_130352.html\">makeup</a>, it's tough to argue that the campaign had no reason to invest in Palin's look. </p> <p>(Arguing that women shouldn't be subjected to such scrutiny is a whole other argument entirely.)</p> <p>The question isn't whether they should have spent any money. It's whether they should have spent what my grandmother used to describe as \"that kind of money.\"</p> <p>It certainly wasn't a necessity with regard to the availability of fashionable clothes for modest prices. As <a href=\"http://www.pamshouseblend.com/showDiary.do?diaryId=7697\">Pam Spaulding</a> aptly notes, \"Michelle Obama buys <a href=\"http://petite.about.com/b/2008/06/23/where-to-find-michelle-obamas-dress.htm\">off-the-rack</a> (eg, the dress that she wore on The View was $148), and looks damn good in it without costing the campaign a fortune.\"</p> <p>I can't imagine the campaign calculated it was a necessity with regard to their audience. The McCain-Palin campaign's governing principle is easily and succinctly pr\u00e9cised as \"What would Joe Six-pack do?\" One guesses he wouldn't spend a cool $150k at Bloomie's. Even if Joe Six-pack had that kind of money to spend these days, the small towns in \"Real America\" populated by Clans Six-pack and Plumber, about which Palin gushingly enthuses on the campaign trail, generally trend less toward Saks and more toward Marts: Wal and K to be precise.</p> <p>And so, predictably, the scheme has failed miserably with their base. <a href=\"http://marcambinder.theatlantic.com/archives/2008/10/republicans_disgusted_by_rnc_s.php\">Marc Ambinder</a> reports, \"Republicans, RNC donors and at least one RNC staff member have e-mailed me tonight to share their utter (and not-for-attribution) disgust at the expenditures.\"</p> <p>Palin spokesperson Tracey Schmitt tried valiantly to <a href=\"http://voices.washingtonpost.com/the-trail/2008/10/22/palin_outfits_cost_rnc_150k.html\">spin the complaints</a>: \"With all of the important issues facing the country right now, it's remarkable that we're spending time talking about pantsuits and blouses.\" The point, you have missed it.

  "<p>President Bush and fellow world leaders will attempt to thrash out a united response to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/creditcrunch\">the global financial crisis</a> next month when Washington hosts an emergency summit.</p> <p>The meeting on November 15 will discuss the underlying causes of the downturn, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/globaleconomy\">the global response</a> and the principles that will underpin any reforms, the White House said today. Leaders from the group of leading economies - including Brazil, China and India as well as the G7 nations such as the UK and Japan- will attend the meeting, which will also seek input from the winner of the US presidential election.</p> <p>However, the White House acknowledged that the first meeting was unlikely to produce a series of concrete proposals for tackling the consequences of the credit crunch. </p> <p>Although the world's biggest economies have followed <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/banking\">Gordon Brown's lead in recapitalising their leading banks</a>, leaders have expressed divergent views on what future shape global finance should take. Bush has warned that any coordinated international action should preserve free markets but his French counterpart, Nicolas Sarkozy, declared last month that the \"all powerful market that always knows best is dead\".</p> <p>Dana Perino, a White House spokesman, said she did not expect the summit to present firm decisions on new policy or regulation. The task of putting \"meat on the bones\" after the meeting will be up to financial experts in the world leaders' respective countries, Perino added. \"A lot of work will have to be done at the task force level, the working group level,\" she said. Those working groups will then draft recommendations for consideration at further summits.</p> <p>Barack Obama, favourite to win the presidential election that takes place 11 days before the summit, welcomed the announcement by the Bush administration that it was making one last push to stabilise the global economy before the new White House incumbent takes office on January 20. </p> <p>\"I am happy today that the White House announced a summit that provides an opportunity to advance the kind of cooperation I called for last month. America must lead and other nations must be part of the solution too,\" said Obama.</p>",
  "<p>Until recently, no one thought of John McCain as a culture warrior. Distrusted by the religious right, he seemed annoyed even to have to address issues like gay marriage. In February, a political lifetime ago, a poll commissioned by the Planned Parenthood Action Fund found sizeable support for McCain among pro-choice women, and revealed that seven in 10 of these women <a href=\"http://www.ppvw.org/pressReleases/PPAF_poll.pdf\">didn't know the candidate's actual anti-abortion views</a> (pdf). By many accounts, his first choice for a running mate was the pro-choice Independent Joe Lieberman. As recently as May, he told Glamour Magazine that he would encourage the Republican party to <a href=\"http://www.glamour.com/magazine/2008/08/mccain-interview?currentPage=4\">include exemptions to the anti-abortion plank of its platform</a> for cases of rape, incest and threats to the mother's life.</p> <p>How odd, then, that in these final weeks, McCain's rhetoric on women has reached a pitch of febrile wingnuttery not heard from a presidential candidate in decades. The first clues came with the Sarah Palin pick, as well as with his ultimate failure to even try to moderate the party platform's abortion language, which emerged as absolutist as ever. Both those things, though, could have been taken as more evidence of disinterest toward women's issues, rather than active extremism. Not so his recent fulminations. </p> <p>First there was the final presidential debate, where McCain attacked Obama for his insistence that any ban on late-term abortions have an exception when a woman's health is at risk. Using sarcastic air quotes, McCain treated such concerns as risible, saying: \"That's the extreme pro-abortion position, quote, 'health'.\" He used the phrase \"pro-abortion\", a locution favoured by the hard right, three times, and clearly stated his desire to see Roe v Wade overturned.</p> <p>Then, speaking on Fox News on Sunday, McCain celebrated Palin as <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/10/19/campaign.wrap/index.html\">\"a direct counterpoint to the liberal feminist agenda for America\"</a> who has a \"wonderful family\". (The implication, perhaps, being that feminists do not have wonderful families, which someone should tell to <a href=\"http://www.grandmagazine.com/article.asp?id=92\">grandmother-of-six</a> <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nancy_Pelosi\">Nancy Pelosi</a>, among many, many others). </p> <p>To some observers, this might all this might seem quite standard. There's nothing new, after all, about the Republican party opposing abortion or lambasting feminism. In recent elections, however, GOP presidential candidates have generally tried to soften their message for mass consumption. In 1992, after George HW Bush lost to Bill Clinton, the chastened Republican party vowed to remake their image as angry plutocratic puritans. Reporting on the 1992 meeting of the Republican Governor's Association, held just after the election, the New York Times described a party <a href=\"http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE7D91439F934A25752C1A964958260\">desperate to start promoting an image of \"diversity\" and \"tolerance\"</a>. It quoted Haley Barbour, currently the governor of Mississippi, saying: \"We need our heads examined if we let abortion be the threshold issue of Republicanism.\" </p> <p>To be sure, Republicans since then haven't changed their position on reproductive rights. They have, however, changed their language. In 1996, Bob Dole tried to reach out to pro-choice voters and infuriated the right by <a href=\"http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9402E5DB1E31F93AA25753C1A960958260\">failing to bring up late-term abortion</a> while debating Clinton. Even the resolutely anti-abortion George W Bush mostly signalled his position with <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/id/2108083/\">allusions and dog-whistles</a> heard only by the already committed. Rather than declare his desire to see Roe v Wade swept away, he spoke of <a href=\"http://articles.latimes.com/2004/oct/13/nation/na-dred13\">his opposition to the US supreme court's infamous pro-slavery Dred Scott decision</a>, baffling those who didn't know that in the anti-abortion movement, <a href=\"http://www.thenation.com/doc/20041101/pollitt\">Dred Scott is constantly invoked as a Roe analogy</a>. </p> <p>Republicans even stopped bashing the women's movement, trying instead to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/26/uselections2008.hillaryclinton\">co-opt it</a>. Hence all the recent crowing that Palin, presented as half Arctic Annie Oakley, half supermom, represents real, you-can-have-it-all feminism, the kind that might even appeal to disaffected Hillary Clinton supporters. </p> <p>But now, losing, frustrated and discombobulated, McCain has dropped the pretence. The surprise is not his contempt for feminism, but his willingness to express it so baldly. Ironically, it's precisely the fact that he hasn't spent his career in the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elmer_Gantry\">Elmer Gantry</a> wing of the party that now makes him sound so unhinged. He's not fluent in the codes and dodges more practiced Republicans use to lull moderates while signalling their faith to the true believers. As a spokesman for reaction, he's unvarnished. His blunt anti-feminism is slightly shocking, but, given the party he's now leading, at least it's honest.</p>",

With no phone and no car, he would be the first to admit he doesn't own much. </p> <p>But what little he does have, he nearly lost earlier this year after he fell of a ladder while he was painting and went to the local hospital to get a herniated disc treated. Crimmins was left with a $5,000 bill; he earns $15,000. </p> <p>When he was taken to court for the money, he didn't bother showing up. \"I didn't see the point,\" he says. \"They're going to do whatever they want anyhow.\" </p> <p>So Carilion, a nonprofit private clinic that gets tax breaks in return for a commitment to provide healthcare to the poor, garnished his wages. They are also garnishing his sister's wages for money she owes them and extracting money from his mother's pay packet for care she received. \"Carilion have been trying to take me to court since I was 18,\" says Crimmins. </p> <p>Indeed, since 2003 Carilion has accounted for 40% of all the judgments at Roanoke district court. Such is the volume of its collections that the courts set aside one day a week just to deal with healthcare. They call it Carilion day.</p> <p>\"While the numbers seem large, they represent a small fraction of the 2 million patient visits to Carilion facilities each year,\" says Eric Earnhart, a spokesman for Carilion.\"</p> <p>\"But we are working hard to reduce the number of people who qualify for charity care but do not pursue it. Last year we provided approximately $43m in free care to patients who couldn't afford to pay.\"</p> <p>A local group, the Citizens Coalition for Responsible Healthcare, has been set up to challenge Carilion and raise the issue of affordable healthcare in the town.</p> <p>Ken King, the coalition president, says that if you cannot afford health insurance, \"your doctor of choice becomes the emergency room\". </p> <p>\"At that point you are probably walking into a room that has the highest cost of operation of any medical facility, any kind of care available ... If you can't pay it, you get sued. Thirty-three thousand people in Roanoke general district court in the last five years have been sued for that bill.\"</p> <p>Once a railroad town, Roanoke is now dominated by Carilion, which merged with another local hospital in the late 1980s. At the time, the justice department tried and failed to prevent the merger, warning that it would create a monopoly. </p> <p>According to the Wall Street Journal, health insurance rates in the area have risen since then from the lowest to the highest in Virginia. </p> <p>Carilion disputes this: \"A comparison of Carilion's prices with hospitals that have comparable volume, and with the state average, shows that in many if not most cases, our prices are lower,\" it says. </p> <p>Today, a colonoscopy at Carilion costs between four and 10 times what you would pay at a local endoscopy centre, while a neck CT scan is just under three times as much. Hospital care, Carilion says, is always more expensive than that provided at outpatient facilities.</p> <p>The hospital has a charity care programme through which anyone who earns twice the federal poverty level or less should pay less, or nothing. A single person earning less than $20,800 or a family of four with an income below $42,400 should qualify. Clearly, however, many fall between the cracks.<br>So Crimmins, it turned out, was eligible for assistance, and Carilion has stopped pursuing him. </p> <p>Healthcare has emerged as a huge issue in this election. With the provision of care here often tied to jobs, the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/useconomy\">failing economy</a> means anyone worried about their job security is, almost by definition, worried about their health. </p> <p>And this isn't just a concern for the very poor. One small business owner and cancer survivor I spoke to says she has not been for her check-ups for three years because she has no health insurance. She simply makes it a priority not to get sick. </p> <p>With 16% of the country uninsured, and 50% of bankruptcies linked to non-payment of medical bills, the issue is central to the economy.</p> <p>The numbers are staggering. \"Forty-seven million [people] - which is 35% of the population - don't have healthcare insurance in the United States right now,\" says King. \"$143bn is the administrative cost of the healthcare system, and that's simply the paperwork cost; $2tn is the annual healthcare cost in the United States ... and $7,000 per person is what it costs us. </p> <p>\"One of the things that is really a problem is that employers are beginning to say: 'We can no longer do this. We can't provide healthcare for you as an employee.' And that number is going to go way up.\"</p> <p>For the most part, that is good news for the Democratic presidential nominee, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/barackobama\">Barack Obama</a>, who is regarded as better on health than his Republican rival, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/johnmccain\">John McCain</a>. </p> <p>\"Me, personally, I think I would put a poor man in, somebody who knows how to budget, knows how it feels to struggle,\" Crimmins says. \"[I've worked] pretty much since I was 12 years old. My mom, she was raising nine of us by herself, so she didn't have the money to get what we wanted - or what we needed, most of the time. So I always had to pitch in and help out.\"</p> <p>He has never voted, and he is not registered. But he is rooting for McCain because, he says, the Republican is more experienced. </p> <p>If she were registered, his partner, Melissa Hicks, would vote the same way. \"I don't know why I don't like Obama,\" she says. \"But it's not because he's black.\"</p>",

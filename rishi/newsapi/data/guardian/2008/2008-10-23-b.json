  "<p><strong>The following correction was printed in the Guardian's Corrections and clarifications column, Friday October 31 2008</strong></p> <p> Our calculation of the chances of four out of five US presidents being left-handed was slightly awry in the article below. We gave the probability as 0.00009, given that one in 10 of the population is left-handed. That is the probability of any particular sequence of one right-handed and four left-handed presidents. The odds of that occurring in any order would be 0.00045</p> <p> </p> <p>Amid the many conspiracy theories swirling around the US presidential race - Barack Hussein Obama's Islamist takeover, say, or John \"Bush\" McCain's plans to steal the election - a truly sinister confluence of events has largely gone unnoticed.</p> <p>Some see the devil's hand at play in an election that, whatever the outcome, will see America make a a fundamental shift, not from right to left, but from right-handed to left-handed.</p> <p>Both Obama and McCain are sinistral - lefties to you and me - in contrast to the present incumbent of the Oval office. One of them will be the fourth left-handed president out of the five past holders of the world's most powerful office, a fact that has intrigued neurologists and confounded probability theorists.</p> <p>Obama or McCain will become the 44th US president, and within that distinguished company will be the eighth known to be left-handed. The victor will become the sixth lefty out of 12 presidents since the end of the second world war, stretching back to Harry Truman.</p> <p>The other postwar lefties-in-chief are Gerald Ford, the ambidextrous Ronald Reagan, George Bush Sr and Bill Clinton. Since 1974 the only right-handed presidents have been Jimmy Carter and the outgoing Bush.</p> <p>Roughly one in 10 of the population is left-handed, so to have four out of five recent incumbents in the top job drawn from that group is striking: the probability is 0.00009.</p> <p>Some statisticians would say it is just a coincidence that over time will be evened out. Certainly, the prevalence has been lower among the 12 postwar British prime ministers; only two of them, Churchill and Callaghan, were left-handed. But Daniel Geschwind, a professor of human genetics at UCLA, thinks it is beyond coincidence.</p> <p>\"Six out of the past 12 presidents is statistically significant, and probably means something,\" he said.</p> <p>Membership of the rarefied group also extends across the political divide and into US public life. Apart from Obama and McCain, it includes the TV mogul Oprah Winfrey, the Nobel peace prize laureate Al Gore, New York mayor Michael Bloomberg and Homer Simpson's neighbour Ned Flanders.</p> <p>Geschwind points out that there are established differences in brain patterns. The language function lies in the left hemisphere of the brain for 98% of right-handed people, but is on the left for only about 60% of left-handers. About 10% of lefties have their language function on the right hemisphere - far more than their right-handed brethren - and about 30% straddle both sides.</p> <p>How these factors play out in practice is only thinly understood, but it may help to explain why there are a disproportionate number of left-handed maths professors at MIT, for instance, as well as artists from Michelangelo to Paul Klee, not to mention Winfrey, Gore and Bloomberg.</p> <p>Left-handed US presidents go back to James Garfield, who, legend has it, could write in Latin with one hand and simultaneously write the same sentence in Greek with the other.</p> <p>The rollcall has not always been a happy one. Garfield was assassinated in 1881 (though the assumption that left-handed people are prone to an early grave has been debunked). Herbert Hoover was the second confirmed left- handed US president, and we know all too well what happened under him.</p> <p>Fidel Castro is also a member of the club, as is Osama bin Laden.</p> <p>Over the centuries, southpaws, as they have been known since the early days of baseball - have had a rough ride. Etymology tells the story. \"Sinister\" comes from the Latin word for left, later taking on the connotation of evil or unlucky.</p> <p>According to the Left-Handers Club, a support group based in Surrey, the Devil is almost always portrayed as left-handed. The basics of life, from desks to scissors and computer mouses, are geared to the right-handed majority. Which is why Ned Flanders in the TV series The Simpsons set up a shop called the Leftorium.</p> <p>Kristy Ainslie, a biomedical engineer in San Francisco, knows all about these inconveniences from personal experience. Eight months ago she set up a Facebook group, Lefties for Obama, partly as a satire on the way Obama has been depicted as someone outside the mainstream.</p> <p>She thinks there may be something to the presidential cluster of lefties: \"When you are left-handed you have your own unique perspective and have to be willing to stand out from the crowd. That's not bad training for a president.\"</p> <p>\u2022 Ed Pilkington is right-handed</p>",
  "<p>He is renowned for his long hours and hectic schedule, but the stress of high office may be taking its toll on the health of Iran's president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, and jeopardising his political future.</p> <p>Speculation about the hyperactive leader's physical condition was prompted this week after a speech to the state statistics and planning body on Wednesday was cancelled at the last minute and a cabinet meeting took place without him. A speech to a martyr's commemoration event was also called off. A senior aide, Amir Mansour Borghei, told journalists that the president was \"indisposed\".</p> <p>That explanation has triggered rumours that Ahmadinejad, 52, is suffering from a long-term illness that may force him to abandon plans to stand for re-election next year.</p> <p>Shahab, an Iranian news website, reported that the cancellations were the latest in a series and said the president had previously cancelled engagements because of listlessness caused by low blood pressure. Last May Ahmadinejad pulled out of events in three consecutive weeks - including a rally in Golestan province where he was due to meet voters face to face - because of what aides described as an overcrowded schedule.</p> <p>Citing \"sources close to the government\", Shahab said doctors had advised him to cut his workload to reduce the possibility of illness. There is little sign that he has heeded such advice; Wednesday's cancellation came after Ahmadinejad had returned to Tehran from a visit to the Asalouyeh oil and gas project in southern Iran. </p> <p>The reports of cancellations come at a time when Ahmadinejad is wrestling with acute political problems, including near 30% inflation, rising unemployment, plummeting oil prices, a market traders' strike over a plan to impose VAT, and demands for the resignation of his interior minister, Ali Kordan, for falsely telling MPs that he had an Oxford University degree.</p> <p>But more worrying is that the rumours appear to have given his critics a new stick to beat him with. Fellow hardliners inside Iran's so-called principalist - or fundamentalist - camp are calling for the president to withdraw from the presidential election unless doubts about his health are cleared up.</p> <p>Issa Saharkhiz, an Iranian political analyst, said the reports could have been fanned by Ahmadinejad's opponents, including the Tehran mayor, Muhammad Baqer Qalibaf, who are preparing to run against him. \"I'm not sure if these health problems are permanent or just a result of tiredness,\" he said. \"But some groups, mainly moderate conservatives, may be thinking that they have found a political solution for eliminating him from the nomination for the elections.\"</p>",
  "<p>'I could never pursue a career in politics,\" croaks a figure sprawled across a sofa in the corner of a darkened room, skater's sock-cap pulled down over his sunglasses. \"I've been involved in far too many scandals.\"</p> <p>\"My mom says you have too many tattoos,\" laughs the fresh-faced, baseball-capped boy beside him.</p> <p>\"Yeah, too many scandals and too many tattoos,\" grins the skater. \"Isn't that an irony, though, now that so many of our generation have tattoos? A tattooed person will end up in office one day, mark my words. Not necessarily at a presidential level, but there will be people with tattoos in the administration.\"</p> <p>It seems Pete Wentz - the bass player, songwriter and public face of Fall Out Boy - has a dream. This morning, however, he also has a head cold, jetlag and a hangover. It is midday, and Wentz appears near-comatose, resembling the fictional rock star Hotblack Desiato from The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, who spent a year being dead for tax reasons. </p> <p>The night before, Fall Out Boy arrived in Barcelona to celebrate the opening of their latest Angels &amp; Kings nightclub, a party that stretched on into the early hours of this morning. But discussion of the group's new album, Folie \u00e0 Deux, which the band planned to release on the day of the American presidential election, has shaken him from his daze.</p> <p>\"Releasing the album on the same day as the election was an entirely conscious decision,\" explains Patrick Stump, the one in the baseball cap, who plays guitar and sings. \"Like, I went to sleep last night with BBC News 24 on, and there was a guy from India explaining that the outcome of the American election would have an effect on the whole world. If that's the case, then I don't know why we're taking it so lightly. This might be the most important election my generation get to vote in, and there's a lot of responsibility upon the American people, to really pay attention this time. But people are behaving like it was a sporting event, waving flags and yelling, 'Go team!'\"</p> <p>Accordingly, Folie \u00e0 Deux contains no partisan sloganeering, although Stump contends the songs share a common message, focusing on \"the effects of individuals' actions upon the larger world, as a result of the poor decisions they make. So maybe they should think about the consequences of their actions.\"</p> <p>Certainly, a deviation into the explicitly political territory of Rage Against the Machine would be a jarring change of direction for Fall Out Boy. While their roots lie in Chicago's underground punk scene - Wentz and drummer Andy Hurley played in Racetraitor, a late 90s hardcore troupe who espoused veganism, anti-imperialism and grisly riffage - Fall Out Boy are, inarguably, a pop band, one whose rise was aided by the support of MTV's mainstream pop show Total Request Live, which helped them find an audience that is largely teenaged and largely female.</p> <p>Wentz's disaffected, sometimes solipsistic lyrics - along with his olive-skinned good looks - have made Fall Out Boy poster boys for the emo generation of teens, their hormonal and existential angst finding a reflection in Fall Out Boy's tantrum-tossed anthems. He's become the erudite voice of a particular stratum of youth: the suburban kids who, like Wentz, have been diagnosed with emotional problems, and have struggled with both prescribed medication and illicit chemicals.</p> <p>\"I think that medication has helped me at times in my life,\" explained Wentz when I interviewed him last year, after a show in Las Vegas. \"I've needed to be on medication, it's saved my life. But it's definitely an over-medicated generation. Rather than having any kinds of conversations with anyone to solve our problems, we go and see what pill we can take to make it all go away.\"</p> <p>Wentz is bipolar, and in 2005 he attempted to kill himself with an overdose, an event that inspired the song 7 Minutes in Heaven (Atavan Halen) on Fall Out Boy's breakthrough album From Under the Cork Tree. He subsequently filmed public service announcements for American television, highlighting the issue of youth depression. But the confessional, emotional tenor of his lyrics is tempered by his witty wordplay; the best Fall Out Boy songs make for classic neurotic American teen pop culture, like the John Hughes movies Wentz worships.</p> <p>\"I feel like the last person who should be giving advice to anyone about anything,\" Wentz says of the fans who deluge Fall Out Boy's website with desperate pleas for help. \"I think part of it is we're living in the age of the internet: if it had been around back in the days of the Smiths and the Cure, I'm sure people would be writing to their website, asking, 'Oh Morrissey, I'm so depressed. too, what should I do?'\" He laughs at the idea.</p> <p>Wentz's fame isn't limited to his fans, though. He became a tabloid figure in 2006, when an ex-girlfriend leaked naked photos Wentz had taken of himself on to the internet. Latterly, he has become a staple in America because of his marriage to the actress and pop singer Ashlee Simpson. </p> <p>The couple, who are expecting their first child before the year is out, are now regulars on Perez Hilton's gossip blog, and Wentz featured in a Vanity Fair piece in summer 2007 about the boyfriends of the young Hollywood women who are the centre of LA's gossip culture. \"Everyone writes stories about Ashlee and I going out to nightclubs or whatever,\" he said, in Vegas, \"but nobody writes about how much fun we had just riding mountain bikes and hanging out in Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio. There was no one there to recognise us. It was fun, being 'normal' like everyone else. It's like a weird fantasy to have.</p> <p>\"I feel good now,\" Wentz continues, \"like I wish I could take deaging juice and go back to when I was 16 or something, and relive it all again knowing what I know now. The things that were difficult in my life have remained or become more difficult; it's like the song, Mo Money Mo Problems. But I'm 29 now, I have a wife, and a baby on the way. I see the world in an entirely different way.\"</p> <p>In downtime from Fall Out Boy, Wentz runs his own record label (Decaydence), clothing company (Clandestine Industries) and film production company (Bartskull), while also pursuing careers as an author, model, actor and host of his own show on MTV. The Barcelona branch of Angels &amp; Kings is Fall Out Boy's third; they opened their first in New York. </p> <p>All three bars share a d\u00e9cor - black painted walls hung with framed mugshots of Jimi Hendrix, Steve McQueen and Frank Sinatra - though the Barcelona venue, located on the sixth floor terrace of the newly opened ME Hotel, with its own outdoor heated swimming pool, is the most impressive. \"We saw this location and thought it was cool,\" Wentz says, of the offer to open in Barcelona. \"To be this close to Gaudi's Sagrada Familia couldn't ever be a bad thing. We've realised we have an 'aesthetic', that we are a brand,\" he adds. \"When you're a brand, you have to be careful who you partner with.\"</p> <p>Memories of Wentz's darker, more hedonistic days still offer raw material for Folie \u00e0 Deux, most explicitly on 27, with its references to \"Doing lines of dust off last night's stage/ Just to feel like you.\" Janis Joplin, Jim Morrison and Kurt Cobain all died when they were 27, and Wentz says he spent much of that year \"toxic, just completely over-medicated. I was stoked to make it past 27,\" he grins. \"Everyone was really worried. My management company were panicked, because I was I was out of the office, and 'pharmaceutically engaged'.\"</p> <p>\"There was a countdown clock and everything,\" laughs Stump. \"I remember, our manager called me up on Pete's 28th birthday and screamed, 'We made it!'\"</p> <p>As our interview draws to a close, Stump returns to the topic of the album's election day release. \"The point is,\" he concludes, \"when Folie \u00e0 Deux's released, we won't be partying at some record company album launch, we'll be out there voting. And I hope a lot of other people are, too.\"</p> <p>Several days later, however, Fall Out Boy announce via their website that Folie \u00e0 Deux won't see the shelves until early December, a decision they made themselves. \"This is not the election to be 'cute',\" they explain, adding: \"We feel that many of the interviews for the record have skewed us into a partisan band. We never intended to shove our ideas down people's throats.\"</p> <p>The decision seems less motivated by a desire to protect their \"brand\" from the sort of fan backlash the Dixie Chicks suffered after speaking out against George Bush in 2003 than by an earnest desire to not cloud the election season with what could be viewed as a promotional gimmick. They also realise that, in such a climate, even the most earnest attempt by a celebrity to enter the partisan fray could clumsy backfire on his chosen candidate. </p> <p>There can be no doubt on who that is for Fall Out Boy. In Barcelona, Stump said, \"All four of us fall more on the liberal side of things,\" while the video for their new single I Don't Care closes with a villainous character pulling back a mask to reveal he's really Sarah Palin. And earlier in the summer, they played at the Democratic convention in Denver, though Stump didn't get to meet Obama. </p> <p>\"I wish,\" he chuckles. \"But that's not important. I don't want it to taint the message of the record, which is that we're not considering the issues, or our actions, hard enough.\" </p> <p>Stump says he has friends and relatives who are Republicans, and he respects their views, and believes that \"everyone, regardless of their party affiliation, should at least consider voting for the other side, to truly get to understand their policies and positions.\" He can't resist adding, however, that \"people should be willing to understand that the vice president could possibly become president, and to think about the implications of that.</p> <p>\"People need to research the policies of the candidates closely - and that includes Obama - and not be distracted by the media misrepresentations. Like Fox News: their bias is so blatant, it's offensive. They don't report news. If there was a school shooting, they'd be finding ways to blame it on the Democrats. I think it would be a shame if somebody voted for Obama because so many celebrities support him. I think it would be tragic if someone voted for McCain because Fox News doesn't know shit.</p> <p>\"It's really easy to offend people in America right now. You have to tread lightly. My stepdad is very right wing - at the dinner table we'll have pretty frank political conversations, but I'm not going to have that same conversation at a restaurant in public, where the guy behind me might be totally offended.\"</p> <p>\"But that's where you're supposed to have those conversations,\" protests Wentz. \"And loudly. Although I try not to provoke people anymore, because I don't think the judge will let me off with any more community service.\" </p> <p>He laughs, but then turns serious, perhaps dreaming again of America's first tattooed president. \"I want to work on humanitarian causes in some capacity, and that'll involve working with both parties, I expect. So I'm trying not to upset anyone.\" </p> <p>\u2022 The single I Don't Care is out now on Mercury. Folie \u00e0 Deux is released on December 15</p>",
  "<p><strong>This is an election, so whoever gets the most votes wins, right?</strong></p> <p>No. Elections are awarded to the winner of the electoral college. Each state is allocated from three to 55 votes according to its population. The winner of the popular vote wins a state's electoral votes - with two exceptions, Maine and Nebraska, which award electoral votes by congressional district. A candidate that wins 270 electoral votes is the winner. Think of it as 51 elections (50 states plus Washington DC) instead of one national election.</p> <p><strong>What if the winner of the electoral college has won fewer popular votes?</strong></p> <p>This has happened three times in US history, most recently in 2000. Under the US Constitution the presidency nevertheless goes to the candidate who wins the electoral college.</p> <p><strong>That sounds undemocratic</strong></p> <p>It is. America's founding fathers were loth to give too much power directly to the people and so devised a system similar to the Vatican's college of cardinals. The US constitution gives to the electors of the electoral college the power to choose the president, but extends to the states authority to determine how the electors are chosen. Initially the legislatures of several states chose the electors. Now, states choose electors by a direct vote of the people. Moves to use the national popular vote have failed, in part because small states and rural areas fear losing their disproportionate influence.</p> <p><strong>What are the most important states?</strong></p> <p>California, New York and Texas offer the most electoral votes- 55, 31 and 34. But those are not up for grabs: the first two states are safely Democratic, and Texas votes Republican. The candidates spend most of their time in a handful of states that could vote either way, notably Florida, Ohio and Pennsylvania.</p>",
  "<p>What a surprise. As the credit crunch moves slightly down the headlines it is replaced as top story by a tale of shady dealings about the raising of cash for politics (Don't cross me again, warns Tory's accuser, October 23). Whatever George Osborne may or may not have done, the spectacle of our senior politicians cosying up to money men to fund party political activities should be a source of shame and embarrassment to all of us.</p> <p>Meaningful reform of political-party funding is scuppered time after time by one party or another refusing to let go of its own special funding relationships. The bill now going through parliament will do little to change the fundamental problem, which leads politicians of all persuasions to court those with money in order to fund their party. The status quo is justified by the apparent agreement across the political spectrum that people will not accept more state funding because our politicians are held in such low esteem. Well, that problem is not going to be improved by continuing this unsightly and sometimes rather seedy method of paying for our democracy.</p> <p>We need a system that is transparent and which prevents any of our political parties being beholden to particular vested interests. Crucially, we need a system which rewards those parties who seek to engage with individual voters in a way our current method of party political funding fails miserably to do.</p> <p>The Power Inquiry suggested a system which gave every voter the chance to determine who got a portion of state funding - which would be spent locally rather than consumed by party headquarters bent on expensive media campaigns. Others have different ideas. But what is certain is that if we are to have a new type of politics in this country, we need to start by reforming where the money for politics actually comes from.<br><strong>Pam Giddy</strong><br>Director, Power Inquiry </p> <p>Neat, is it not? George Osborne is alleged to be part of a Tory attempt to channel a foreign donation from a Russian billionaire to his party and the Electoral Commission immediately dismisses a request to investigate. Peter Hain goes to the commission as soon as he finds that those he trusted to run his Labour party deputy leader campaign have failed to register legal British donations within the required 30 days and the commission refers him to the police. One law for a Tory, another for Labour? No wonder many of us are so cynical.<br><strong>Karen Price</strong><br>Neath, West Glamorgan </p> <p>George Osborne's indiscreet breach of the omerta of an upper-class binge-drinking club has at least helped us all learn the difference between a superyacht and a megayacht. More importantly, their falling out has lifted a stone to uncover how our increasingly interconnected economic and political upper-class spend their money and time.</p> <p>All parties - the economic patrons and their political lapdogs - appear to have agreed a truce rather than risk damaging their collective reputation. Discretion in their discussions with each other obviously counts for more than transparency and accountability to the rest of us. Besides, now is probably not the best time for the \"have-yachts\" to rub our noses in the details of all these marvellous parties they throw for each other.</p> <p>We are used to dodgy unaccountable offshore financial arrangements, but now the politics is disappearing offshore and there seems to be nothing we can do about it. Except that the new report from the UN predicting increased social tension as global inequalities widen (Wealth gap creating a social time bomb, October 23) looks - against this shady background of unaccountable deal-making in the playgrounds of the rich - to be less a threat, and ever more a promise.<br><strong>Brian Gardner</strong><br>Glasgow </p> <p>As the kangaroo court trying George Osborne hits your front page, I am astonished that you have not taken up the far bigger and far more important task of placing the financing of US presidential election campaigns under the spotlight. Yes, you tell us how much has been raised by each candidate, but where is the questioning of the ethics by which money seems able to buy American elections?<br><strong>Stuart Raymond</strong><br>Exeter, Devon</p>",
  "<p>Political strategists and pollsters refer to them as the \"triple A\" states, the handful that will determine the outcome of this <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/uselections2008\">election</a> and where <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/barackobama\">Barack Obama</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/johnmccain\">John McCain</a> are focusing their energy, best people and cash over the final days.</p> <p>Identifying the states is easy: they are the ones that in the last few weeks have received the highest number of visits from the candidates, the biggest volume of advertising and where the campaign teams have placed their best staff.</p> <p>Huge swaths of the US, from reliably Democratic California to solidly Democratic New York are ignored, as are Republican bastions such as Texas. Instead, campaign foot soldiers are battling from dawn to midnight in a relatively small number of states and, in most cases, in a small number of counties within those states.</p> <p>Mark Mellman, a pollster for the John Kerry campaign in 2004, identified these toss-up states as Pennsylvania, Florida and Ohio, traditionally big swing states, but also new ones that until a few weeks ago would have been regarded as safely Republican, Virginia and Missouri.</p> <p>\"These are the triple A states,\" Mellman said. Also on the list is Colorado, Nevada and North Carolina, which was an even more unlikely swing state a few weeks ago than Virginia. \"Any of these could be decisive,\" said Mellman.</p> <p>McCain's hopes of taking the White House have dwindled to one state, Pennsylvania, which voted Democratic in 2004. He needs to take this and hold on to Ohio, the key to the midwest where Obama is ahead in the polls, and Florida, where the two candidates are in a dead heat.</p> <p>Obama, having made inroads into a host of Republican states, has many more options. If he does not make it in one state, there are a host of others that could still swing the election his way.</p> <p>McCain spent yesterday in Florida - as hotly contested as Pennsylvania - and Obama was there for two days earlier this week. Both men are certain to return to the Sunshine state at least once in the final week - Pennsylvania and Ohio also.</p> <p>Since the official start of the campaign on September 5, Ohio and Florida have each been visited 20 times by Obama or McCain or their running mates. Pennsylvania has been visited 16 times, Virginia 13, and Colorado and Missouri 11 times each. New Hampshire and North Carolina have both had seven, Nevada and New Mexico five, Indiana four and Maine one.</p> <p>The other indicator to which states are the most hotly contested is spending on advertising. Evan Tracey, the president of the Campaign Media Analysis Group, which tracks ad spending, said the presidential race always whittles down to a few states. \"In every one of these states advertising is very heavy. These are the states they know they have to win.\"</p> <p>The difference in the 2008 campaign is that Obama's encroachment into traditionally Republican areas means that McCain is having to spend money in states traditionally his party thought it could take for granted. </p> <p>\"Obama has McCain exactly where he wants him. McCain's team would not have planned on fighting in North Carolina in October. He would rather be spending money elsewhere,\" Tracey said.</p> <p>Republican and Democratic strategists involved in past campaigns say the pace will become even more frenetic in the final days, with planned schedules altered at the last minute based on overnight polls.</p> <p>Pennsylvania appears to be an odd choice for McCain to make what is effectively his last stand. Many analysts and pollsters, such as Mellman, no longer include Pennsylvania in their lists of battleground states because Obama is regarded as so far ahead: two polls yesterday placed him ahead by 10% and 11% respectively.</p> <p>But Mark Salter, McCain's chief strategist, told reporters in the state on Tuesday: \"When we look at our numbers, we think we're competitive here.\"</p> <p>Democrats in Pennsylvania agree. Its Democratic governor, Ed Rendell, sent a memo this week to Obama's headquarters warning that the state is traditionally volatile. Rendell, who went into election day for the governorship in 2002 with a 25% lead but won by 9%, urged Obama to make more visits to the state.</p> <p>Karlyn Bowman, an election analyst at the American Enterprise Institute, the neoconservative thinktank in Washington, said Obama would win the election but she understood why McCain was concentrating on Pennsylvania.</p> <p>\"Remember how well Hillary Clinton did there,\" Bowman said, recalling Clinton's victory over Obama in the state earlier this year, mainly with the support of white, blue-collar workers.</p> <p>In Florida campaign teams are concentrating on a relatively narrow strip, the Orlando-Tampa corridor. Registration figures there for July indicate just how tight it is, with 159,000 recorded Republicans and 157,000 Democrats.</p> <p>Another indication of the fierceness of the fight is that the ratio of negative ads by McCain and Obama is higher in that area than any other part of the country.</p> <p>Obama can lose Florida and still win by taking states such as Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico and Virginia, all of which voted Republican last time. Virginia would be a big prize; a southern state that has voted Democrat only once since 1948, and that was for Lyndon Johnson in 1964.</p> <p>Michael Dimock, an associate director of research at the Washington-based Pew Institute, said that in 2000 and 2004 the number of battleground states remained basically the same from the start of the campaign to election day. But this campaign had turned out to be more fluid as polls showed Obama becoming competitive in traditionally Republican areas. States such as Michigan, that had been competitive at the start, and which received more visits than any other, had since dropped out of the contest, with McCain giving them up as lost.</p> <p>Dimock sees the potential changes in the offing comparable to Bill Clinton's win in 1996 and Johnson's in 1964, all the more remarkable given that they were southern politicians and Obama is from the north.</p> <p>Though the intense campaigning taking place in the battleground states in 2008 mattered, it was less important than the economic meltdown and the unpopularity of George Bush, said Dimock. \"Even in the best circumstances, it would be hard for McCain to do well.\"</p>",

Every publication from the New Yorker to <a href=\"http://www.fieldandstream.com/article_gallery.jsp?ID=1000022649\">Field and Stream</a> magazine descended on <a href=\"http://www.adn.com/sarah-palin/story/514173.html\">rural Wasilla, Alaska</a> after Palin joined the Republican ticket last month, and the resulting crush of damning press created a string of ready-made attack adverts for any possible opponent in 2012.</p> <p>Imagine if John Edwards, the 2004 Democratic vice-presidential nominee, had emerged victorious as his party's nominee this year. </p> <p>Even if Edwards's infidelity had not become public, Republicans would be subjecting him to a daily re-litigation of the same battles that brought down the Kerry-Edwards ticket four years ago. His campaign would be watched hawkishly for the slightest hint of a reversal on the issues \u2013 and so would Palin's in 2012. </p> <p>Given that the Alaska governor can barely keep her positions straight over a period of weeks on topics as sensitive as military action inside Pakistan and judicial refinancing of mortgages, you'd better believe that Democrats would salivate at the chance to fact-check her four years from now. Not to mention, operatives will be watching to see whether Palin's pricey designer clothes show up at the Salvation Army after the election.</p> <p>The second drag on Palin's political future is her state. Yes, Alaska is certainly remote and offers scant opportunities for national political exposure. But most importantly, it also <a href=\"http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/washington/2008/08/a-look-at-sarah.html\">lacks a substantial fundraising base</a> from which Palin can extract the cold, hard cash necessary to run for president four years from now.</p> <p>Her best chance to build a network over the next four years as governor is courting the major oil companies. But Palin was correct in noting that her independent-minded approach to the Alaska natural gas pipeline turned off Exxon and the other energy giants.<br> Sarah Barracuda is certain to remain in the good graces of Bill Kristol, Fred Barnes and other A-list conservative pundits who are <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2008/10/27/081027fa_fact_mayer?currentPage=2\">enthralled by her stage presence</a>. (Peggy Noonan, as it happens, is far from a Palin fan these days.)</p> <p>Still, even if Kristol &amp; Co can give her entr\u00e9e to the Washington power elite \u2013 something tells me McCain won't be in the mood to share after a loss this year \u2013 Palin is bound to watch her approval ratings suffer in Alaska as she openly plans another run at the White House.</p> <p>On the subject of approval ratings, they happen to be the third factor imperilling Palin's presidential future. Polling is generally untrustworthy on the details, but Palin's numbers paint a distressing picture: the more voters get to know her, the less they like her.</p> <p>After Palin stormed onto the national stage with her combative convention speech last month, she boasted a <a href=\"http://people-press.org/report/?pageid=1375\">54% positive rating</a>. Five weeks later, her approval rating <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&amp;sid=aYI5UQWvIChI&amp;refer=home\">had fallen to 44%</a>, compared with 60% for Democratic No 2 Joe Biden.</p> <p>Voter perceptions of Palin also have suffered back in Alaska, albeit on a smaller scale. Does anyone think the bespectacled governor will be able to return home quietly for two years of fighting environmental regulations? Palin had better start getting used to the pesky media tracking her every move on the local level, particularly her clashes with Alaska critics <a href=\"http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/10/14/palin-criticized-in-alaska/?pagemode=print\" ?>Andree McLeod</a>, <a href=\"http://www.adn.com/politics/story/497064.html\">Andrew Halcro</a> and <a href=\"http://blog.blogtalkradio.com/2008/09/09/anne-kilkenny-on-blogtalkradio-this-afternoon\">Anne Kilkenny</a>. </p> <p>Four years from now, Palin is unlikely to be enjoying the 80%-plus approval that gilded her emergence this autumn, especially if she faces a difficult re-election fight in 2010. </p> <p>That brings me to the fourth and final reason that Palin 2012 is less of a sure thing than Freedland and others believe. Palin's term expires in 2010, the same month that Republican Lisa Murkowski must defend her Senate seat. </p> <p>Having spectacularly unseated Murkowski's father, Frank, in order to become governor, Palin may well decide that knocking off another Murkowski is her best path to broader power. The Senate would be the best perch for Palin to keep an eye on a potential President Obama if she wants to run in 2012 \u2013 which would surely depend on how vulnerable Obama is to a successful challenge by that point.</p> <p>But wait: Palin would first have to win that Senate seat. And although she energises the conservative base now, she does so largely through prepared talking points, depicting Obama as a \"pal\" of terrorists and McCain as \"the only man\" who can defend America. The next several years will test her ability to delve into the more substantive critiques that are required of both Senate and presidential candidates. </p> <p>Before Palin and her fans in the <a href=\"http://marcambinder.theatlantic.com/archives/2008/10/palin_1.php\">media</a>-<a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/uselection2008/sarahpalin/3242610/Republicans-considering--Sarah-Palin-2012-presidential-campaign.html\">political</a>-<a href=\"http://blogs.tnr.com/tnr/blogs/the_plank/archive/2008/10/22/prediction-palin-in-2012.aspx\">industrial</a> complex get psyched about a 2012 run, she'd do well to bone up on policy. A good place to start might be learning that the vice-president doesn't actually rule over the Senate.</p>",
  "<p>Political strategists and pollsters refer to them as the \"Triple A\" states, the handful hat wil determine the outcome of this election and where <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/barackobama\">Barack Obama</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/johnmccain\">John McCain</a> are focusing their energy, best people and cash over the final days.</p> <p>Identifying the states is easy: they are the ones that in the last few weeks have received the highest number of visits from the candidates, the biggest volume of advertising and where the campaign teams have placed their best staff.</p> <p>Huge swaths of the US, from reliably Democratic California to solidly Democratic New York are ignored, as are Republican bastions such as Texas. Instead, campaign foot soldiers are battling from dawn to midnight in a relatively small number of states and, in most cases, in a small number of counties within those states.</p> <p>Mark Mellman, a pollster for the John Kerry campaign in 2004, identified these toss-up states as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/pennsylvania\">Pennsylvania</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/florida\">Florida</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/ohio\">Ohio</a>, traditionally big swing states, but also new ones that until a few weeks ago would have been regarded as safely Republican, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/virginia\">Virginia</a> and Missouri.</p> <p>\"These are the Triple A states,\" Mellman said. Also on the list is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/colorado\">Colorado</a>, Nevada and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/northcarolina\">North Carolina</a>, which was an even more unlikely swing state a few weeks ago than Virginia. \"Any of these could be decisive,\" said Mellman.<br>McCain's hopes of taking the White House have dwindled to one state, Pennsylvania, which voted Democratic in 2004. He needs to take this and hold on to Ohio, the key to the midwest where Obama is ahead in the polls, and Florida, where the two candidates are in a dead heat.</p> <p>Obama, having made inroads into a host of Republican states, has many more options. If he does not make it in one state, there are a host of others that could still swing the election his way.</p> <p>McCain spent today in Florida \u2014 as hotly contested as Pennsylvania \u2014 and Obama was there for two days earlier this week. Both men are certain to return to the Sunshine state at least once in the final week \u2014 Pennsylvania and Ohio also.</p> <p>Since the official start of the campaign on September 5, Ohio and Florida have each been visited 20 times by Obama or McCain or their running mates. Pennsylvania has been visited 16 times, Virginia 13, and Colorado and Missouri 11 times each. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/new-hampshire\">New Hampshire</a> and North Carolina have both had seven, Nevada and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/newmexico\">New Mexico</a> five, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/indiana\">Indiana</a> four and Maine one.</p> <p>The other indicator to which states are the most hotly contested is spending on advertising. Evan Tracey, the president of the Campaign Media Analysis Group, which tracks ad spending, said the presidential race always whittles down to a few states. \"In every one of these states advertising is very heavy. These are the states they know they have to win.\"</p> <p>The difference in the 2008 campaign is that Obama's encroachment into traditionally Republican areas means that McCain is having to spend money in states traditionally his party thought it could take for granted. </p> <p>\"Obama has McCain exactly where he wants him. McCain's team would not have planned on fighting in North Carolina in October. He would rather be spending money elsewhere,\" Tracey said.</p> <p>Republican and Democratic strategists involved in past campaigns say the pace will become even more frenetic in the final days, with planned schedules altered at the last minute based on overnight polls.</p> <p>Pennsylvania appears to be an odd choice for McCain to make what is effectively his last stand. Many analysts and pollsters, such as Mellman, no longer include Pennsylvania in their lists of battleground states because Obama is regarded as so far ahead: two polls today placed him ahead by 10% and 11% respectively.</p> <p>But Mark Salter, McCain's chief strategist, told reporters in the state on Tuesday: \"When we look at our numbers, we think we're competitive here.\"<br>Democrats in Pennsylvania agree. Its Democratic governor, Ed Rendell, sent a memo this week to Obama's headquarters warning that the state is traditionally volatile. Rendell, who went into election day for the governorship in 2002 with a 25% lead but won by 9%, urged Obama to make more visits to the state.</p> <p>Karlyn Bowman, an election analyst at the American Enterprise Institute, the neoconservative thinktank in Washington, said Obama would win the election but she understood why McCain was concentrating on Pennsylvania.</p> <p>\"Remember how well Hillary Clinton did there,\" Bowman said, recalling Clinton's victory over Obama in the state earlier this year, mainly with the support of white, blue-collar workers.</p> <p>In Florida campaign teams are concentrating on a relatively narrow strip, the Orlando-Tampa corridor. Registration figures there for July indicate just how tight it is, with 159,000 recorded Republicans and 157,000 Democrats.<br>Another indication of the fierceness of the fight is that the ratio of negative ads by McCain and Obama is higher in that area than any other part of the country.</p> <p>Obama can lose Florida and still win by taking states such as Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico and Virginia, all of which voted Republican last time. Virginia would be a big prize; a southern state that has voted Democrat only once since 1948, and that was for Lyndon Johnson in 1964.</p> <p>Michael Dimock, an associate director of research at the Washington-based Pew Institute, said that in 2000 and 2004 the number of battleground states remained basically the same from the start of the campaign to election day. </p> <p>But this campaign had turned out to be more fluid as polls showed Obama becoming competitive in traditionally Republican areas. States such as Michigan, that had been competitive at the start, and which received more visits than any other, had since dropped out of the contest, with McCain giving them up as lost.</p> <p>Dimock sees the potential changes in the offing comparable to Bill Clinton's win in 1996 and Johnson's in 1964, all the more remarkable given that they were southern politicians and Obama is from the north.</p> <p>Though the intense campaigning taking place in the battleground states in 2008 mattered, it was less important than the economic meltdown and the unpopularity of George Bush, said Dimock. \"Even in the best circumstances, it would be hard for McCain to do well.\"</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/sep/12/zimbabwe3\">Morgan Tsvangirai and the MDC</a> have often been criticised for their failings in confronting Robert Mugabe and Zanu-PF's authoritarian rule. Certainly, the MDC has reproduced some of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/oct/03/zimbabwe.southafrica\">Zanu-PF's undemocratic practices</a>. \"He who fights with monsters should look to it that he himself does not become a monster. And when you gaze long into an abyss the abyss also gazes into you,\" as Nietzsche wrote. </p> <p>For a long time, the MDC did not understand what sort of political animal Zanu-PF is and the lengths it would go to in order to maintain power, particularly its manipulation of Zimbabwe's history to shore up its waning legitimacy and the party's resort to political violence. As Tsvangirai once admitted to me, the MDC was \"na\u00efve\" for thinking \"Mugabe would give up power through the ballot box\" and was unaware that Mugabe would use the \"land question to delegitimise a legitimate opposition movement\".</p> <p>At its inception in 1999, the <a href=\"http://www.mdc.co.zw/\">MDC</a> was a broad political party in terms of composition. Consequently, defining itself was made all the more difficult. It had to cater to its various constituencies and some of them, white farmers especially, left it exposed to Mugabe's charge that the MDC was a \"puppet\" of white interests. The MDC's associations with the west also harmed the party's image. It did not criticise double standards over human rights in the west and the fact that Britain failed to honour its land reform commitments in Zimbabwe adequately. </p> <p>Furthermore, the MDC had exaggerated faith in the power of the international community. The international community is not a silver bullet that can open up internal space needed for democratic reform and human rights promotion. Indeed, the international community's involvement in Zimbabwe became part of the problem and not the solution. \"We were a young and emerging party. Mistakes happen,\" Tsvangirai conceded to me in 2006. </p> <p>I could go on expounding a litany of the MDC's weaknesses: the party's disunity; the use of tribal politics by some of its members; internal violence; the party's lack of depth in leadership qualities. But doing so would be overlooking a point that many commentators continue to overlook when assessing the fortunes of Tsvangirai and the MDC, which is how difficult it is to conduct opposition politics in Zimbabwe. </p> <p>Being an opposition party in Zimbabwe is one of the toughest political challenges in Africa and the evidence for this is long. In the early 1980s, under the guise of crushing dissident activity, committed by a \"poorly armed group of less than 400 at their peak who survived mainly by avoiding confrontation\", Mugabe deployed the army to Zimbabwe's Matabeleland province where it carried out systematic violence and intimidation to crush Zapu \u2013 the main political opposition at the time. An estimated 20,000 Zimbabweans lost their lives. The sheer force and calculated methodology of the violence the MDC suffered at the hands of Zanu-PF in Zimbabwe's presidential election runoff earlier this year was reminiscent of this early 1980s violence. </p> <p>To be part of the opposition in Zimbabwe is to be a \"sell-out\", \"un-African\", \"pro-colonial\" and \"illegitimate\". It is to lose one's human rights, as exemplified by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/20/zimbabwe\">Tsvangirai's failure to attend a meeting of regional leaders</a>, aimed at breaking Zimbabwe's ongoing power sharing deadlock, in Swaziland on Monday because the state would not grant him a passport, curtailing his right to freedom of movement. Tsvangirai, MDC members and supporters have, of course, witnessed worse. Torture, beatings, detention, murder and harassment are the staple diet of those associated with the opposition.</p> <p>The MDC's continued existence \u2013 given the state's attempts to destroy it since 1999 \u2013 speaks volumes of the immense courage and willpower the opposition has shown under Tsvangirai. He is a flawed leader, and so is his party, but courage and the ability to endure are two qualities Tsvangirai and the MDC can never be faulted for. Global bodies, African organisations and reform-minded African leaders owe them greater assistance in the face of Mugabe and Zanu-PF's refusal to share power.</p>",
  "<video data-media-id=\"gu-video-338936449\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/bc/281851582/281851582_1875305338_US-Election-LT-RoanokeArtScene-To-Brightcove-16x9.flv\"/> </video>   <p><br>The introductory call of Roanoke's <a href=\"http://www.noshame.org/\">No Shame Theatre</a> is that it's a place where \"anything can happen.\" To which the crowd responds: \"And it usually does.\" </p> <p>The idea is simple. You pay $5, you get five minutes and the stage is yours. There are only a few rules, the most intriguing being that you have to keep your clothes on - apparently the state of Virginia has decreed that nudity and alcohol should not cohabit the same social space. No Shame Theatre went for the booze. Otherwise people do their own thing -poetry, stand-up, soliloquies, songs, you name it. It's like Amateur night at the Apollo in Harlem without the <a href=\"http://www.bigapplejazz.com/tree_of_hope.htm\">Tree of Hope</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.feetfirstfoundation.org/index_002.htm\">Sandman</a>.</p> <p>Some of the performances are bizarre. One woman had a puppet monkey she called George - as in George Bush - and a bag full of different hats. Her entire skit consisted of putting a different hat on the Monkey every 15 seconds and matching it with a one-liner about Bush. <br>\"George is clutching at straws,\" she'd say and on would go the straw hat. \"George has been smoking something,\" and on goes a rasta hat. Much more cringe than fringe.</p> <p>But most are good and some have a political edge. Todd Ristau, the founder of No Shame and director of the graduate programme in playwriting at Hollins University, near Roanoke, came up with the idea when he was in Iowa City and launched it on the back of a pick-up truck.</p> <p>The night I went, Ristau performed a parody of the vice-presidential debate between Joe Biden and Sarah Palin. It ended with Biden telling the audience: \"Look I'm just going to lay in on the line, if you vote those people into the White House, you deserve whatever the fuck happens to you.\"</p> <p>For a town of this size (96,000) Roanoke has an impressive cultural life. It boasts a symphony, an opera, an arthouse cinema (currently showing both Bill Maher's Religulous and Oliver Stone's W), several art galleries and museums of transport, science, transportation and history as well as one <a href=\"http://www.linkmuseum.org/ \">dedicated to the photography of Winston Link</a> and another to African-American life in the town. </p> <p>There are at least two decent independent book shops and Ristau is in the process of building another theatre. Moreover it is just about to see the opening of a huge new art museum - the Taubman http://www.artmuseumroanoke.org/ , downtown. While I have been here, the local Jefferson centre has staged a production of <a href=\"http://www.roanoke.com/extra/wb/179475 \">Falstaff</a> and played host to <a href=\"http://www.roanoke.com/extra/wb/179123\">Wynton Marsalis</a>.</p> <p>\"I'm passionately in love with this town, partially because of the way that this very admittedly blue collar community embraces a cultural life,\" Ristau says. \"And there isn't that kind of antagonism between people in the community and the so-called artist or intellectual elites. There isn't that division. Everyone takes part in the cultural life kind of equally. And I think it's a testimony to the city in some ways that they had the vision to place the centre in the square in the middle of the town and say 'no - our cultural life is going to be in the heart of this community'.\"</p> <p>And like the the No Shame Theatre , some culture has been geared towards the election. In 2004, culture was at the crux of the polarisation between Democrats and Republicans, with Michael Moore's Faranheit 9/11 and Mel Gibson's The Passion of Christ, laying out the battle lines. </p> <p>Nationally, this year it has played a far less prominent role, despite Sarah Palin's attempt to introduce hockey moms and Joe sixpack as the John and Jane Doe of American cultural life. But in Roanoke, thev ibrant cultural life has been quite politically engaged - albeit almost exclusively among liberals. Three weeks ago, Ann Trinkle, an artist who was the local delegate to the Democratic convention, put on an art auction called <a href=\"http://www.finearttoelectafineman.com/\">Fine Art To Elect A Fine </a>man which raised $4,100.</p> <p>\"When I heard [Obama] speak four years ago at the Democratic convention in Boston, I was sold right then. He has touched something in a lot of us... not since John F Kennedy, it's all about the hope, it really is. It's about the best in each of us. He's really awoken that.\"</p> <p>Meanwhile, another local artist, Katherine Devine, is dedicating herself to painting yard signs and handing them out.</p> <p>Back at the No Shame Theatre, Ben Williams gives a minute-by-minute breakdown of his viewing the vice-presidential debate.</p> <p>\"9pm - My television is tuned to CNBC. Let's do this thing!</p> <p>9.02pm - It has become clear that if I'm going to sit through another hour and 28 minutes of this horseshit, I'm going to need a drink.</p> <p>9.03pm - The only remaining alcohol I have is a half-bottle of terrible legalised absinthe. Perhaps I'll just have to abstain tonight.</p> <p>9.05pm - I pour myself a tall glass of absinthe. It clouds nicely upon the addition of sugar and cold water. It certainly looks the part, but inside it's pure poison. I have accidentally made the perfect drink for watching this debate.</p> <p>9.10pm - Sarah Palin explains her views to the American people in the same way that you'd explain the basics of mathematics to a small child. Joe Biden, on the other hand, explains his views to America in the way that you'd try to talk a suicidal retarded man down from a ledge. They are both right.\"</p>",
  "<p>Amid the many conspiracy theories swirling around the US presidential race \u2014 Barack Hussein Obama's Islamist takeover, say, or John \"Bush\" McCain's plans to steal the election \u2014 a truly-sinister confluence of events has largely gone unnoticed.</p> <p>Some see the devil's hand at play in a contest that, whatever its outcome, will see a powerful group regain control of the White House on November 4.</p> <p>Membership of the group extends across the political divide and into US public life, from the media to arts to finance. Apart from both Obama and McCain, it includes the TV mogul Oprah Winfrey, the Nobel peace prize laureate Al Gore, New York mayor Michael Bloomberg and Homer Simpson's neighbour, Ned Flanders.</p> <p>The driving force of the movement is not so much political ideology as dexterity. When President Bush quits the White House in January, America will see a fundamental shift, not from right to left, but from right-handed to left-handed.</p> <p>Both Obama and McCain are sinistral \u2014 lefties to you and me \u2014 in contrast to the present incumbent of the Oval office. One of them will be the fourth left-handed president out of the five past holders of the world's most-powerful office, a fact that has intrigued neurologists and confounded probability theorists. </p> <p>Obama or McCain will become the 44th US president, and within that distinguished company will be the eighth known to be left-handed. The victor will become the sixth leftie out of 12 presidents since the end of the second world war, stretching back to Harry Truman.</p> <p>The other postwar lefties-in-chief are Gerald Ford, the ambidextrous Ronald Reagan, George Bush Sr and Bill Clinton. Since 1974 the only right-handed presidents have been Jimmy Carter and the outgoing Bush. </p> <p>Roughly one in 10 of the population is left-handed, so to have four out of five recent incumbents in the top job drawn from that group is striking: the probability is 0.00009. </p> <p>Some statisticians would say it is just a coincidence that over time will be evened out. Certainly, the prevalence has been lower among the 12 postwar British prime ministers; only two of them, Churchill and Callaghan, were left-handed. But Daniel Geschwind, a professor of human genetics at UCLA, thinks it is beyond coincidence. \"Six out of the past 12 presidents is statistically significant, and probably means something,\" he said.</p> <p>Geschwind points out that there are established differences in brain patterns. The language function lies in the left hemisphere of the brain for 98% of right-handed people, but is on the left for only about 60% of left-handers. About 10% of lefties have their language function on the right hemisphere \u2014 far more than their right-handed brethren \u2014 and about 30% straddle both sides.</p> <p>How these factors play out in practice is only thinly understood, but it may help to explain why there are a disproportionate number of left-handed maths professors at MIT, for instance, as well as artists from Michelangelo to Paul Klee, not to mention Winfrey, Gore and Bloomberg.</p> <p>Left-handed US presidents go back to James Garfield, who, legend has it, could write in Latin with one hand and simultaneously write the same sentence in Greek with the other.</p> <p>The rollcall has not always been a happy one. Garfield was assassinated in 1881 (though the assumption that left-handed people are prone to an early grave has been debunked). Herbert Hoover was the second confirmed left-handed US president, and we know all too well what happened under him.</p> <p>Fidel Castro is also a member of the club, as is Osama bin Laden.</p> <p>Over the centuries, southpaws \u2014 as they have been known since the early days of baseball \u2014 have had a rough ride. Etymology tells the story. \"Sinister\" comes from the Latin word for left, later taking on the connotation of evil or unlucky.</p> <p>According to the Left-Handers Club, a support group based in Surrey, the devil is almost always portrayed as left-handed. The basics of life, from desks to scissors and computer mouses, are geared to the right-handed majority. Which is why Ned Flanders in the TV series The Simpsons set up a shop called the Leftorium.</p> <p>Kristy Ainslie, a biomedical engineer in San Francisco, knows all about these inconveniences from personal experience. Eight months ago she set up a Facebook group, Lefties for Obama, partly as a satire on the way Obama has been depicted as someone outside the mainstream.</p> <p>She thinks there may be something to the presidential cluster of lefties: \"When you are left-handed you have your own unique perspective and have to be -willing to stand out from the crowd. That's not bad training for a president,\" she said.<br><em>Ed Pilkington is right-handed</em></p>",
  "<p>Every day brings news of lifelong <a href=\"http://my.barackobama.com/page/content/gophome\">Republicans endorsing Barack Obama</a>. The most recent was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/19/colin-powell-endorses-barack-obama\">Colin Powell</a>, and before him <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/19/fashion/19buckley.html\">Christopher Buckley</a>, son of the founder of the modern conservative movement, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_F._Buckley_Jr.\">William Buckley</a>. Before that there were former Republican members of congress Jim Leach, Douglas Kmiec, Bruce Bartlett, Lincoln Chafee and Rita Hauser. All of them were senior members of the party who served in various previous presidential administrations or Congress. If these Republicans are willing to publicly renounce their party's candidate you can imagine how many other party leaders are unwilling to do so but privately will desert John McCain to vote for Obama.</p> <p>There has even been this <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/17/opinion/17brooks.html\">extraordinary encomium</a> from New York Times columnist David Brooks, of all people:</p> <blockquote> <p>It is easy to sketch out a scenario in which [Obama] could be a great president. He would be untroubled by self-destructive demons or indiscipline. With that cool manner, he would see reality unfiltered. He could gather - already has gathered - some of the smartest minds in public policy, and, untroubled by intellectual insecurity, he could give them free rein. Though he is young, it is easy to imagine him at the cabinet table, leading a subtle discussion of some long-term problem.</p> </blockquote> <p>When a leading Republican columnist is able to write so enthusiastically about a liberal Democratic presidential candidate, you know it's not just that the Republican candidate has failed to get his point across, but that the Democrat has stolen some serious Republican thunder.</p> <p>Just looking at the electoral map tells you that Obama is either competitive or winning states where the Democrats have historically struggled to succeed: Missouri, North Carolina, West Virginia, Wisconsin, Virginia, New Hampshire, Nevada, North Dakota. The map at <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/maps/obama_vs_mccain/#data\">Real Clear Politics</a> has Obama already winning or leaning in states that would give him 286 electoral votes - 16 more than necessary to win. Another 97 votes are in toss-up states. If Obama gets half of these votes the election will be an absolute rout.</p> <p>So the question becomes: are Republicans only renouncing their candidate and the last eight disastrous years, or has Obama really connected with moderate Republicans and independents in the same way that Ronald Reagan did with hawkish Democrats during his years in office? In addition, have events merely spiraled out of control for the Republicans and in favour of the Democrats with the economic crisis or is Obama's political platform and strategy genuinely appealing to some Republicans? The answer is, I think, a little of both.</p> <p>When I have written before urging Obama to govern from the centre, readers have objected, saying that it is necessary to eradicate all vestiges of previous harmful Republican policies, and that doing so requires a wholesale housecleaning. I'm not so sure. Certainly, the damage must be undone and there will be enough of a Democratic majority in both Houses to do so. But if Democrats govern as George Bush, Dick Cheney and Tom DeLay did, using scorched-earth policies, then they will only be setting themselves up for the same fall the Republicans took in 2006 and are likely to take again this year.</p> <p>A lasting governing majority for Democrats requires co-opting the Republican moderates and drawing in independents. The key to Bill Clinton's success was in doing precisely this. If we learned any lesson from the 2000 election and its aftermath it is that a \"my way or the highway\" approach to governing doesn't work in the long or even medium run.</p>",
  "<p>If Barack Obama wins the presidential election, at least part of the reason will be that John McCain failed to recognise a landmark cultural shift.</p> <p>The one-time bipartisan moderate cast his lot with the Republican party's hard right just as it was <a href=\"http://www.gazette.com/common/sections/?ucgid=wap_article/&amp;id=37766\">losing influence</a>. Rather than battling for independents and conservative Democrats, McCain chose instead to excite the passions of his party's narrowest constituency. In so doing, he ended up running not just against Obama, but against his own history of bipartisan outreach.</p> <p>I do not intend to write McCain's political obituary. Though Obama <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2008/president/us/general_election_mccain_vs_obama-225.html\">leads in many polls</a> by a substantial margin today, the election is still nearly two weeks away. A lot could happen between now and then.</p> <p>But assuming McCain really does go on to lose, there are three major blunders he made that arise from his attempt to connect with the right's sense of resentment and us-against-them populism: his war against the news media, with whom he had long been so friendly that he once jokingly called them \"<a href=\"http://www.marketwatch.com/news/story/look-mccains-08-media-strategy/story.aspx?guid=%7B6BAB8A05-5CFD-4E12-A6BA-0908901EDF0E%7D\">my base</a>\"; his inexplicable choice of Sarah Palin as his running mate and his deeply personal attacks against Barack Obama. </p> <p>Let me take them one at a time.</p> <p>1. McCain and the media. In 2000 McCain nearly upset George Bush's march to the nomination by inviting reporters aboard the <a href=\"http://bostonphoenix.com/archive/features/00/02/17/DON_T_QUOTE_ME.html\">Straight Talk Express</a> and charming them with anecdotes and access. In 2008 he didn't even give the press a chance, <a href=\"http://69.25.198.13/Boston/News/68093-Beating-the-press/\">trashing it</a> on the assumption that it would be in the tank for Obama - and possibly in the hopes that he might be able to tap into the anti-media anger of Hillary Clinton supporters.</p> <p>Perhaps the paradigmatic moment was McCain's <a href=\"http://www.time.com/time/politics/article/0,8599,1836909,00.html\">bizarre August interview</a> with Time magazine, in which he answered standard-issue questions with undisguised hostility and contempt. No doubt this played well with the right, which has long detested what it sees as an elite liberal media. What McCain seems to have missed is that even if reporters, on the whole, favoured Obama, they still liked him, too. By cutting them off, McCain essentially gave them permission to dump on him at will. And many have.</p> <p>2. The Palin pick. The Alaska governor is a talented political performer, and McCain's choice worked for about two weeks. But among her numerous deficits as a general-election candidate is the fact that she may be the most extreme religious candidate since <a href=\"http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/scopes/bryanonevol.html\">William Jennings Bryan</a>.</p> <p>At a time when the economy is melting down, and when McCain could have been putting, say, Mitt Romney front and centre as an experienced businessman and financial manager, we were learning that Palin had once prayed that <a href=\"http://medianation.blogspot.com/2008/09/teasing-out-palins-religious-views.html\">God would build a natural-gas pipeline</a> - and had stood by while the minister of her former church spoke of God's special plans for Alaska in a post-Apocalypse world.</p> <p>You think this is what the <a href=\"http://www.onthemedia.org/transcripts/2008/10/17/03\">folks wielding those people metres on CNN</a> are looking for? Think again.</p> <p>3. Getting personal. Attacks on an opponent's policies are fine. Even attacks that stretch the truth are hardly cause for consternation. But McCain has gone after Obama in the most vile terms imaginable.</p> <p>There are many examples from which to choose. I'll pick two.</p> <p>The first was McCain's claim, earlier in the campaign, that Obama would rather \"<a href=\"http://time-blog.com/swampland/2008/07/mccain_meltdown.html\">would rather lose a war in order to win a political campaign</a>\". By characterising Obama as deeply unpatriotic, and perhaps even treasonous, McCain played directly into unstated fears about a black candidate with a Muslim-sounding name.</p> <p>The second was a McCain ad about Obama's support as an Illinois legislator for a sex-education bill that would have taught kindergarteners how to ward off predators. Except that's not what the ad said. Instead, it claimed that the bill would have mandated \"comprehensive sex education\" for kindergarten pupils - <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2008/sep/11/kindergarten-sex-ed-hardly/\">as sleazy a lie</a> as has ever appeared in a major-party candidate's advertisements.</p> <p>Trouble is, the truism that negative campaigning works didn't seem to hold this time. It may have energised the <a href=\"http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=lPg0VCg4AEQ\">sorts of people who turn out at Palin rallies</a>, but it appeared to turn off the undecided moderates who will actually choose the next president.</p> <p>What happened to McCain would be sad if he hadn't done it to himself. You'll sometimes hear an old defender of his try to claim that McCain is better than his campaign. Nonsense. There is no such thing as a candidate who is better than his campaign.</p> <p>It could be that victory was never a realistic possibility for McCain following eight years of an unpopular Republican president and an economic crisis. But if he couldn't come out of this with the presidency, he could have at least preserved his reputation.</p> <p>Barring a truly astonishing comeback, McCain is likely to emerge with neither.</p>",
  "<p>He is renowned for his long hours, hectic schedule and workaholic habits but the stress of high office may be taking its toll on <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/iran\">Iran</a>'s president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, and jeopardising his political future.</p> <p>Speculation about the hyperactive leader's health was prompted this week after a keynote speech to the state statistics and planning body was cancelled at the last minute and a cabinet meeting took place without him. A speech to a martyr's commemoration event was also called off. A senior aide, Amir Mansour Borghei, told journalists the president was \"indisposed\".<br>It has triggered rumours that Ahmadinejad, 52, is suffering from a long-term illness that may stop him running for re-election next year.</p> <p>Shahab, the Iranian news website, reported that this week's events were the latest in a series of cancellations and said the president had previously pulled out of engagements because of listlessness caused by low blood pressure.</p> <p>In May Ahmadinejad pulled out of events in three consecutive weeks, including a high-profile rally in Golestan province where he was due to meet voters face-to-face. Aides said he had an overcrowded schedule.</p> <p>Citing \"sources close to the government\", Shahab said doctors had advised the president to cut his workload to reduce the possibility of illness. There is little sign he has heeded any such advice: yesterday's cancellation came after Ahmadinejad had returned to Tehran from a visit to the Asalouyeh oil and gas project in southern Iran.</p> <p>The reports will be a blow to the pride of a leader who revels in his energetic style and is known for micro-managing government affairs.</p> <p>They come at a time when Ahmadinejad is wrestling with acute political problems including near 30% inflation, rising unemployment, plummeting global oil prices, a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/oct/21/iran-middleeast-ahmadinejad-bazaaris\">market trader strike</a> over plans to impose VAT and demands for the resignation of his interior minister, Ali Kordan, for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2008/aug/13/ali.kordan.oxford\">falsely telling MPs he had an Oxford University degree</a>.</p> <p>More worrying is that the rumours appear to have given Ahmadinejad's critics a new stick to beat him with. Fellow hardliners in Iran's so-called principalist, or fundamentalist, camp are calling for the president to withdraw from the forthcoming presidential election unless doubts over his health are cleared up.</p> <p>Issa Saharkhiz, an Iranian political analyst, said the reports could have been fanned by opponents, including the Tehran mayor, Mohammad Baqer Qalibaf, who are preparing to run against the president. \"I'm not sure if these health problems are permanent or just a result of tiredness,\" Saharkhiz told the Guardian. \"But some groups, mainly moderate conservatives, may be thinking that they have found a political solution for eliminating him from the nomination for the elections.\"</p> <p>It is not the first time an Iranian political leader has been the subject of health speculation. Rumours have circulated for some time about the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who is believed to have been treated for prostate cancer. Unfounded reports last year suggested he had died.</p>",

  "<p>A top Iranian official has said <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/barackobama\">Barack Obama</a> is the favoured candidate of Tehran, calling him more \"rational\" than John McCain in remarks that could be used against the Democratic US presidential hopeful.</p> <p>Ali Larijani, the speaker of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/iran\">Iranian</a> parliament, told reporters yesterday his government was \"leaning more in favour of Barack Obama because he is more flexible and rational, even though we know American policy [towards Iran] will not change that much\".</p> <p>Larijani, an ally of Ayatollah Ali Khameini, the supreme Iranian leader, served until last year as his country's chief negotiator in talks to dismantle Tehran's nuclear programme. With the Iranian election looming next year, he is considered a potential opponent of the president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.</p> <p>Larijani's remarks could provide ammunition for the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/johnmccain\">McCain campaign</a> to attack Obama before Americans go to the polls on November 4. </p> <p>Republicans often condemn Obama for signalling he would conduct diplomacy with Iran without setting conditions in advance. The notion that Tehran prefers the Democrat could bolster McCain's case for tough talk against the regime.</p> <p>Before Obama claimed his party's nomination, Republicans were already playing up a positive review from a senior political adviser to Hamas.

  "<p>A Lake county, Indiana, superior court judge yesterday ordered early voting sites in heavily Democratic cities Hammond, Gary and East Chicago to remain open in a decision that could affect the presidential election in the battleground state.</p> <p>In her decision, Judge Diane Kavadias Schneider dismissed complaints from local Republican officials trying to block the sites on the grounds they violated local election rules and created a risk for voter fraud.</p> <p>Since local Republicans first sought to close the sites two weeks ago, the case has drawn attention from the presidential campaigns of both John McCain and Barack Obama because Indiana is a swing state.</p> <p>\"This is one of a dozen-plus legal actions that our campaign is paying attention to,\" said Ben Porritt, a spokesman for the McCain-Palin campaign. \"Most importantly, the goal of our campaign is to ensure that all eligible voters have an opportunity to vote, and their votes be counted. We obviously back early polling locations, as long as they are done according to state law. While we disagree with this decision, we will continue to monitor any further legal action that takes place.\"</p> <p>Yesterday's ruling was hailed by Democrats because it means more voters in a heavily Democratic region of Indiana have easier access to the polls. In the past, voters had to go to Crown Point, roughly 24 miles (38.6 kilometres) away from East Chicago, to cast early ballots.</p> <p>\"Early voting has been a great success so far in Lake county. Thanks to Judge Kavadias Schneider's ruling today, thousands of Indiana voters had their rights protected and the opportunity granted to take part in early voting,\" said Jonathan Swain, the Indiana spokesman for Obama's campaign. </p> <p>\"No matter which candidate or which party they are voting for, all Hoosiers who are eligible to vote deserve the right to have their voices heard in this critical election.\"</p> <p>Schneider was appointed by the Indiana supreme court to preside over the case brought by John B Curley, chairman of the Lake County Indiana Republican Central Committee, and Jim B Brown, a member of the Lake county board of elections, and others.</p> <p>The plaintiffs alleged that early voting sites in the three cities should not have been opened because there was no unanimous vote by the Lake county board of elections approving the locations.</p> <p>Attorneys from the other side said no unanimous vote was needed by the election board because the three locations - one in each city - are in government offices and not \"satellite\" voting sites. The election board must give unanimous approval for a satellite voting site. Closing the sites would disenfranchise poor and minority voters, the same attorneys said.</p> <p>\"The decision is a complete victory for voters,\" said Jonathan Weissglass, an attorney who represented some of the groups fighting to keep the sites open. \"People in Gary, Hammond and East Chicago: it's very difficult for them to get to Crown Point. There's not good public transportation. People don't have cars or time to make a trip to Crown Point.\"</p> <p>R Lawrence Steele, an attorney representing the plaintiffs, was not available for comment on yesterday.</p>",

  "<h2>Palin's wardrobe: All the rage</h2> <p>Getting elected president of the United States has long been an expensive undertaking, but this year's campaign has broken all records. By the end of the race, the presidential candidates <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/23/barack-obama-john-mccain-fundraising\">will have easily raised $1bn</a> between them, a new report from the Centre for Responsive Politics revealed yesterday, dwarfing the previous record of $880.5m in 2004. </p> <p>In that context, the news that the Republican party had spent more than $150,000 on clothes for Sarah Palin in spending sprees at several upmarket department stores might seem relatively unimportant. But that wasn't how it played. The story <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/22/uselections2008-sarahpalin\">threatens to do serious damage</a> to Palin's image as an anti-elitist \"Joe Six-pack American\". Making things worse, Palin's main personal shopper seems to have been Jeff Larson, a powerful Republican consultant in Minnesota whose firm has been tied to the recent round of negative robocalls purchased by the McCain campaign, Elana Schor writes in the Guardian today.</p> <p>Obama, who leaves the campaign trail today for two days to visit his grandmother in Hawaii, faced problems of his own yesterday. He spent some of it addressing ill-advised comments earlier in the week by Joe Biden, who to Republican delight warned that within six months of Obama taking office, there would be \"an international crisis, a generated crisis, to test the mettle of this guy\". He also began to speak openly and in detail <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/22/barack-obama-transition-team-john-mccain\">about the post-election transition period</a>, opening himself to charges of complacency, Ewen MacAskill writes in today's Guardian. </p> <p>In Virginia, the Democrat met senior national security advisers to discuss the foreign policy challenges ahead, and he welcomed an international summit on the financial crisis planned for November, after the election. But he was at pains not to appear cocky, a charge the Republicans are all too keen to level. \"Even though the election will have taken place and there will be a new president-elect, we are still going to have one president at a time until January 20, until the new president is sworn in,\" he said.</p> <h2>What to watch for</h2> <p>Obama flies to Honolulu today, suspending his campaign trail appearances in order to visit his grandmother, who is seriously ill. McCain is in Florida, Palin is in Ohio and Biden is in North Carolina. In the first part of a joint McCain-Palin interview last night, Palin hinted that the campaign might soon release her medical records; she's the only one of the four candidates to have released nothing at all. The second part of the interview airs today, as does a CBS interview with Obama about his grandmother.</p> <h2>Latest polls</h2> <p>A new CNN poll yesterday showed Obama with a lead in a host of formerly red or currently swing states - Nevada, North Carolina, Virginia and Ohio - though McCain leads in West Virginia. A national Fox poll gave Obama a nine-point lead among likely voters, but an incongruous Associated Press poll finds the race almost tied, with Obama at 44% and McCain at 43%.</p> <h2>On theguardian.com now</h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2008/oct/23/us-elections-colorado-sarah-palin\">Video: Road trip, day 11 - Palin power</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2008/oct/22/uselections2008-sarahpalin\">Tomasky talk: Palin's clothes budget v mine</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2008/sep/19/uselections2008.sarahpalin?picture=337803770\">In pictures: Sarah Palin's fashion sense</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/oct/23/barack-obama-us-assassination-us-elections\">Timothy Garton Ash: Obama shows his mettle</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/audio/2008/oct/23/political-philosophy\">Audio: 'I think only 30-40% of the US population is capable of voting well'</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/deadlineusa/2008/oct/23/uselections2008-colorado-democrats\">Deadline USA: The Democrats get their act together</a></p> <h2>Best of the rest</h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.salon.com/news/feature/2008/10/23/campaign_myths/\">Salon.com: The pundits' seven biggest blunders of the campaign</a><br><a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/opinions/2008/10/21/republican-moderate-swing-oped-cx_dg_1022gerstein.html\">Forbes: RIP Reagan revolution</a><br><a href=\"http://www.talkingpointsmemo.com/archives/239184.php\">Talking Points Memo: October 22 - the day in 100 seconds</a><br><a href=\"http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1853025-1,00.html\">Time: Joe Klein - Why Obama is winning</a><br><a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/23/opinion/23kristof.html\">New York Times: Rebranding the US</a><br><a href=\"http://thehill.com/leading-the-news/police-prepare-for-unrest-2008-10-21.html\">The Hill: Police prepare for election day unrest</a></p> <h2>Quotes of the day</h2> <p>\"Let's be clear who John McCain is fighting for.

  "<video data-media-id=\"gu-video-338897539\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/bc/281851582/281851582_1873816711_LOCKED-FINAL-CUT-PALIN-RALLY-CO-10-21-FLV-16x9.flv\"/> </video>   <p>Heading east on a windy Interstate 70, we've entered the Great Plains of Kansas, leaving the behind the Rocky mountains, where our visit to Colorado Springs gave us the opportunity to attend one of the now-famous Sarah Palin rallies. Colorado Springs is definitely what Palin would describe as one of the \"pro-America areas of the nation,\" home to some of its most powerful conservative evangelical institutions. When we arrived at the city's minor league baseball stadium on Monday at 6am for an 8am rally, there were already plenty of Palin's supporters lined up in the pre-dawn darkness, many of them dressed in red to demonstrate fealty to their candidate. </p> <p>Two hours later, they had filled the centre of the 8,500-seat stadium (though there were still empty seats in the stands) and were kept stamping their feet in the damp cold - first to a Christian rock group and then to Hank Williams, Jr, who sang one populist tune after another, some of them tailored to the current election. </p> <p>In the original version of his song, <a href=\"http://www.cowboylyrics.com/lyrics/williams-hank-jr/family-tradition-10115.html\">Family Tradition</a>, Williams defended his hereditary penchant for drinking Jim Beam and smoking dope. But rewritten as \"McCain-Palin Tradition,\" the song encourages voters to ignore the \"leftwing liberal media\" and support the Republican ticket \"cuz they're just like you and ol' Hank\". </p> <p>He goes on to explain the causes of the financial crisis: \"The bankers didn't want to make all those bad loans / But Bill Clinton said 'you got to!' / Now they want to bail out, what I'm talking about / Is a Democrat liberal hoodoo!\" </p> <p>Williams's tribute in song to Sarah Palin compared her to a mama bear\" who could be counted upon to \"protect your family's condition\" because \"If you mess with her cubs, shes gonna take off the gloves, / Thats an American female tradition\". It ended with a musical question to the vice-presidential candidate: \"How can you be so smart and be such a good lookin' dish?\" </p> <p>After Williams exited to the sound of Johnny Cash's Walk the Line, the mama bear herself appeared sporting a red leather jacket, producing a roar from her followers. Palin has pulled back from her riff about Barack Obama not being \"a man who sees America like you and I see America,\" after accusations of coded racism from the media, and shouted death threats againt Obama from her crowds. Now she is instead offering up another American bogeyman: The Red Menace. </p> <p>Obama's tax plan, Palin warned her audience, would drive the country into the socialist camp: \"Obama calls it spreading the wealth,\" she said. \"Now is not the time to experiment with socialism. Distributing the wealth will stifle entrepreneurial spirit.\" </p> <p>In fact, the only person who is promoting any kind of socialism these days isn't Obama but George Bush, who has basically nationalised the banking system - ensuring, at the same time, that his brand of corporate socialism will benefit the rich, while leaving the proletariat to twist in the wind. Nevertheless, Palin's use of the s-word drew a raucous response from the crowd.</p> <p>While the crowd at the rally was totally behind their lady in red, there was nonetheless a sense of something being not quite right among Palin's fans. Beneath the cheers and applause, there was a lingering mood of defeat - a sense that it was all over, and that as much as anything, this was a goodbye rally for the woman who just months ago had so energised social conservatives. </p> <p>Pressing a blue \"Country First\" placard into my hands, a middle-aged woman with intense sparkling eyes told me that she thought there still was a chance - that the polling figures were showing a slight up-tick for McCain. She didn't seem all that convinced herself, but she pointed a finger towards heaven and smiled resolutely. The decision, she said, was in the hands of God. \"But, what if you lose?'' I asked. \"We will just have to wait until he decides,\" she said, again nodding towards heaven. \"That might be a pretty long wait,\" I said. She laughed and agreed.</p>",
  "<p>Republican vice-presidential candidate <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/sarahpalin\">Sarah Palin</a>'s victory over comedian <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/video/2008/oct/07/saturday.night.live.palin.fey\">Tina Fey</a> has been painful to behold. And Tina Fey had been doing so well, too. Sometimes in the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media\">media</a>-political complex, satirists are all-important, and until recently Tina Fey must have been waking up every morning feeling like Superwoman. Her superb impression of Palin on Saturday Night Live has given <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/johnmccain\">John McCain</a>'s campaign a vicious punch in the kidneys from which it and he may still not recover. If <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/barackobama\">Senator Obama</a> wins, well, Fey deserves an ambassadorship or something.</p> <p>Katie Couric's tough <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbQwAFobQxQ\">one-on-one TV interview</a> with Sarah Palin exposed her ignorance and absurdity but it was Fey's comic turn which hammered the point home, turning Palin into a laughing stock, often by simply <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/quiz/2008/oct/21/sarah-palin-tin-fey-quotes\">repeating what she actually said</a>. It has also propelled Fey herself into the stratosphere, as my colleague <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/edpilkington\">Ed Pilkington</a> says in his <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/2008/oct/21/comedy-sarahpalin\">fascinating profile</a>.</p> <p>How incredible to think that this grotesque, reactionary chump was being hailed until recently by various neocon headbangers and cowed mainstreamers as a real contender. And how exquisite it has been to watch clips of Fox News presenters having to grit their teeth and pretend to think that Fey's act is really, really funny. </p> <p>Yet the awful truth is that Palin has successfully neutralised a lot of the damage, and will probably come out even - or actually ahead. And all because America's media liberals are too good-natured, or too pusillanimous to go for the kill. Palin's throat was exposed in front of them, and yet Fey, Alec Baldwin and the whole Saturday Night Live team coyly folded the razor and put it away.</p> <p>Fey's impressions of Palin have been really funny as well as eerily observed, especially her <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVndk47caco\">dual press-conference sketch</a> with Amy Poehler as Hillary Clinton.</p> <p>Obviously, the show doesn't want to get in trouble for political bias so close to the election, but surely that double-act - satirising the Democrat and the Republican - was enough to satisfy any critics?</p> <p>Of course, it won't satisfy Palin who has gone into overdrive to show that she is a good sport and that she doesn't mind. Her game-plan is to play along, to get into a big, smothering bear hug with Fey, and <a href=\"http://www.nbc.com/Saturday_Night_Live/video/clips/gov-palin-cold-open/773761/\">appear on the show</a> as <a href=\"http://www.nbc.com/Saturday_Night_Live/video/clips/update-palin-rap/773781/\">prominently as possible</a>.</p> <p>As Pilkington reports, Palin has affected to be totally cool about the whole thing, and has even claimed that she, Sarah Palin, used to do impressions of Tina Fey! On Halloween, no less. That's right: the proudly provincial Alaskan governor, the hockey-mom outsider, so proudly suspicious of media liberals and big-city smart-alecs, turns out to be so sophisticated, cool and self-aware that she did impressions of Tina Fey. I don't think I have ever heard a politician tell such a big, fat obvious lie in my life.</p> <p>So anyway, SNL put her on the show - an obvious mistake - and ended up going easy on her, as well as massively inflating the brand-price for Palin's own post-election political or media career.</p> <p>I was reminded of a passage in the recent <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/howardbrenton\">Howard Brenton</a> play <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/2008/mar/27/theatre3\">Never So Good</a>, which starred Jeremy Irons as Harold Macmillan. The play shows Macmillan's impotent fury at being sent up by Britain's top satirist and insolent young puppy <a href=\"http://larvatus.livejournal.com/66328.html\">Peter Cook</a>. Every night this impertinent wit, apparently unacquainted with the rules of deference, put the boot into his elders and betters in the Beyond the Fringe show in the West End. One night, to show that he was a good sport, Macmillan actually went to the show. There was a buzz as the audience realised who was in the audience, and, inevitably, excited whispers reached the ears of Cook himself in his dressing room - or perhaps Cook only saw Macmillan in his seat once he had got out on stage. He could have gone easy on Macmillan, who after all had laid himself open, but with the genius's splinter of ice in his heart, he unhesitatingly went for the jugular. The audience screamed with laughter as Cook drawled in Macmillan's voice: \"There's nothing I like better than to wander over to a theatre and sit there listening to a group of sappy, urgent, vibrant young satirists with a stupid great grin all over my silly face.\" Furious and humiliated, Macmillan intensely regretted his gamble on going to the theatre. </p> <p>If only Fey could show Cook's icy ruthlessness.</p>"

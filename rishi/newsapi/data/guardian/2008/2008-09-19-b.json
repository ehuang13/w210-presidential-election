  "<p>Union leaders yesterday buried the hatchet and rallied to Gordon Brown's side ahead of the party conference, claiming that his promise to clean up the City was a clear sign he was throwing off the shackles of \"New Labour\".</p> <p>Derek Simpson, the joint general secretary of Unite, Labour's biggest affiliate, also claimed triumphantly: \"The rump of \u00fcber Blairites that had called for a leadership election have no roots in Labour and have failed to win support for their coup - their grip on the party is slipping, and not before time.\"</p> <p>Denouncing so-called forces of conservatism within the party, Simpson claimed the existence of the rebel faction had been the main obstacle to a change in policy on housing, the NHS, and job and pension security. \"The rebels' rump had been calling for the same ideology and policies that had allowed big city bankers to gamble away our future prosperity.\"</p> <p>In an unrestrained assault, Simpson claimed: \"The spectacle of the political has-beens and never-weres queuing up to criticise the prime minister over the last few weeks has been pitiful.\"</p> <p>He hailed Brown for saying stronger regulation of the financial sector was essential and for recognising the struggle that millions of families faced with their winter household bills. \"There is a real sign now that Gordon Brown will throw off the shackles of New Labour and win back disaffected Labour voters.\" </p> <p>Simpson's outspoken attack came as Unite prepared to reveal that its outlay, to help Labour develop a more sophisticated direct mailshot service aimed at key marginal seats, had reached \u00a32m. </p> <p>Unite, looking at the close links between the unions and Democrats in the US, is also trying to invigorate its potentially key activists by regularly canvassing members by phone and email in all the marginal constituencies. </p> <p>In Glenrothes, the site of a byelection for Brown in November, Unite activists are already regularly phoning their 4,000 members. The union has also surveyed 100,000 of its members by post and phone in marginal seats to check out the disaffection with Labour and the issues likely to bring them back to the fold.</p> <p>The union survey revealed that 77% of its members had voted Labour at some point, but now only 40% backed the government as opposed to 23% who claimed to be Conservatives. Asked to rank issues in order of importance, those surveyed put immigration top (25%), hospitals second (22%) alongside crime, then the economy (19%), followed by pensions, housing and education. The high number citing immigration was regarded as an embarrassment in some parts of the union, but others saw the issue as a symbol of a wider resentment against unfairness.</p> <p>Labour leaders are expecting the conference to reveal a big swell of support for Brown, following the attacks from rebels, and in recognition of his handling of the financial crisis. But they admit that the tests for him will come in the content of his speech on Tuesday, and in his ability to keep his parliamentary party united afterwards. </p> <p>Meanwhile, Harriet Harman, the Labour deputy leader, ruffled feathers in the cabinet when she openly backed the Democrats in the US presidential election during an appearance on BBC Question Time. One cabinet source said it was not acceptable for the deputy leader to call for party discipline and then veer away from the agreed position of neutrality. </p> <p>The day after his speech the prime minister is going to New York for a meeting of the UN special general assembly where he will see several key leaders, including George Bush and the French president, Nicolas Sarkozy, to discuss the financial crisis. He is also expected to discuss the possibility of kick-starting the world trade talks, though few expect any progress until after the US elections in November.</p>",
  "<p>Alaskan senators conducting an inquiry into Sarah Palin's alleged abuse of power promised yesterday their report will be completed before the election on November 4 in spite of attempts by John McCain's campaign team to delay it.</p> <p>The promise to publish on October 10 came despite the failure of 13 people, including Palin's husband Todd, to turn up for an Alaskan senate hearing yesterday. </p> <p>Before becoming McCain's running mate, Sarah Palin had said she and her family would enthusiastically cooperate with the investigation. But yesterday Todd Palin and the other 12 ignored subpoenas calling on them to testify.</p> <p>With the hearing sabotaged, the Democratic chairman of the senate judiciary committee, Hollis French, abandoned proceedings after only a few minutes. But he delivered a short, defiant statement insisting the probe will continue and the report published as planned. </p> <p>The Troopergate investigation is potentially damaging for the McCain presidential bid. Palin, who is still governor of Alaska, is under investigation over allegations that she improperly fired the state's public safety commissioner, Walter Monegan, in July after he refused to sack a state trooper, Michael Wooten, involved in an acrimonious divorce from her sister, Molly.</p> <p>Sarah Palin argues that Monegan left because he did not share her enthusiasm for diverting resources to rural drink problems rather than because of her alleged vendetta against Wooten.</p> <p>A lawyer for Palin sent investigators a letter indicating he would not attend the hearing. Flein described the subpoena as \"unduly burdensome\" because he would be on the campaign trail with his wife until election day.</p> <p>Although some polls this week suggested the Palin phenomenon was beginning to fade as a result of Troopergate and other revelations about her record as governor of Alaska, one of the most respected polling organisations in the US, the Pew Research Centre, published a survey yesterday suggesting that the Republican party brand has regained some of its lustre for the first time in three years and that this can be attributed mainly to Palin. </p> <p>The centre found that independent voters, who will decide the election, have an equally favourable view, 50% to 49%, with the Republicans having the edge. Normally vice-presidential picks have little impact on elections. Stan Greenberg, the Democratic pollster, said that this remained the case, with people voting on the basis of the presidential candidate rather than the vice-presidential one.</p> <p>But he acknowledged that Palin, with her claims to be a reformer and not part of the Washington elite, \"makes McCain look plausible as an agent for change\".</p> <p>The Democratic party has been reluctant to openly criticise her. Joe Biden, Obama's running mate who has had a relatively low profile, is due to debate with her in St Louis on October 2 on primetime television. The Democratic vice-presidential candidate, who has extensive foreign affairs experience in contrast with Palin, told CBS last night he was having a tough time working out how to approach the debate. \"It's hard to prepare, because I don't know what she thinks,\" he said.</p> <p>Palin has been briefed extensively by McCain's team on foreign affairs over the last few weeks, and is to spend next week in New York being introduced by McCain to some world leaders attending the UN general assembly. But her plan to attend a rally against the Iranian president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, who usually attends the assembly, has had to be scrapped.</p>",
  "<p>In this presidential election, the west is supposed to be a <a href=\"http://www.newwest.net/topic/article/out_west_land_of_opportunity_for_the_democrats/C530/L37/\">battleground region in presidential politics</a>. That's not a bad assumption, given the <a href=\"http://pollster.com/\">polls</a>: New Mexico tilts towards Obama; Colorado, Montana, and Nevada are deadlocked; and Wyoming, Utah, Idaho, and Arizona tilt towards McCain.</p> <p>Barack Obama is taking the region seriously. In Montana, for example, his campaign has at least <a href=\"http://www.flatheadbeacon.com/articles/article/the_ground_game/5106/\">16 offices</a>, the candidate has visited the state five times and his vice presidential selection, Joe Biden <a href=\"http://www.abc2news.com/news/local/story.aspx?content_id=82486a57-0e9b-4b14-97f4-28c1b0a9d5a0\"> visited the state</a> shortly after the Democratic convention.</p> <p>So what did candidates say in their respective conventions to woo western voters?</p> <p>While access to, and rights to use, water is probably the biggest issue affecting westerners, both candidates steered clear of that particular issue. And probably wisely so \u2013 <a href=\"http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761589807/water_policy_in_the_american_west.html\">water rights in the west</a> is a big, tangled, bureaucratic mess and a very sensitive topic. When John McCain called to renegotiate water rights among Western states, for example, <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0808/12697.html\">all hell broke loose</a>. \"Over my cold, dead, political carcass,\" said Colorado candidate for Senate, <a href=\"http://www.bobschafferforsenate.com/\">Bob Schaffer</a>. And that was the Republican candidate.</p> <p>Energy is a close second to water as an issue in western states. Most of the west was founded on, and continues to support itself by, the extraction of coal, oil, gas and timber. Because much of the western lands are state owned, leasing state land brings revenue to the state, usually to its rural school systems. Add that to the fact that the base of the western Democratic party was forged in the unions working in western mines and lumber mills, and there's tremendous pressure on both parties to ease environmental restrictions and promote drilling and mining. </p> <p>The Republicans, who receive much of their support from the corporate entities that run these industries, are strong advocates for drilling. In her speech at the Republican convention, Sarah Palin touted her state's <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/11/us/politics/11pipeline.html?_r=1&amp;hp=&amp;adxnnl=1&amp;oref=slogin&amp;adxnnlx=1221837170-H161Vik77+NqW1k9l3otbg\">plan to construct natural gas pipeline</a> as a gain for US energy independence. She offered up her state's oil fields for drilling to aid in the cause against terrorism. When Republican presidential nominee John McCain during his <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2008/09/john_mccains_acceptance_speech.html\">nomination acceptance speech</a> promised to \"drill new wells offshore and drill them now,\" the Convention crowd interrupted him with a chant of, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhvRQyRdVEI\">\"drill, baby, drill\"</a>.</p> <p>The Democrats took a softer tone, but they still promoted the use of oil and coal in US energy independence. Montana Governor Brian Schweitzer was assigned the task of explaining the Democrats' energy policy, and did so in <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNHysr_IluI\">a speech</a> that brought the Convention to its feet. He outlined a program that promoted alternative energy sources and conservation \u2013 but also promoted domestic drilling and the use of clean coal. Likewise, Barack Obama promised to \"tap our natural gas reserves\" and use \"clean coal\" as part of a plan to complete energy independence within a decade.</p> <p>Still, the thrust of the Democrats' message was that alternative energy and conservation should play a central \u2013 not subservient \u2013 role in a future US energy policy. Schweitzer's speech laid out a vision of a diverse set of energy sources for America that included wind, solar, geothermal and hydrogen in addition to coal and oil. Also, conservation is key. As Schweitzer put it, \"Barack Obama understands the most important barrel of oil is the one you don't use\". Obama reiterated his desire to center an energy plan around alternative energy sources, along with biofuel and nuclear power and conservation in part through increased mileage standards for cars.</p> <p>That doesn't play out as poorly as you'd think in western states. Because alongside the pressures in places like Montana, Wyoming and Colorado to drill and mine, a conservation ethic has emerged \u2013 to the Democrats' benefit \u2013 that seeks to protect the states' quickly vanishing wild places. As political writer David Sirota recently pointed out in the New York Times, the recent history of Republican-backed unfettered drilling has <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/18/magazine/18wwln-phenomenon-t.html?_r=1&amp;oref=slogi\">driven westerners to the Democratic party</a>, because Democrats \"have found success recasting environmentalism as a defense of threatened water supplies, fishing spots and hunting grounds\". If drilling and mining brings revenue, then a Democratic party with a conservation ethic needs to propose use of state lands that both generates revenue and preserves the west's open spaces, lest the region fall back into the hands of pro-corporate conservatives who argue that environmentalism costs jobs. </p> <p>And that's where alternative energy sources come in.</p> <p>The high plains of the Rocky Mountains offer two resources that promise to make it the center of future of alternative energy production: <a href=\"http://thefraserdomain.typepad.com/energy/2008/05/land-for-larges.html\">wind and switchgrass</a>. Eastern Montana, for example, is one of the windiest spots in the country. If the state can build the infrastructure of high-transmission power lines to transfer the energy produced by gigantic wind farms, the state could become a major supplier of clean energy. Likewise, Montana's climate supports the kind of grasses used in the production of <a href=\"http://www.carboncommentary.com/2008/01/14/71\">cellulosic biofuels</a>, the alternative to corn-based biofuels. Harvesting switchgrass would require neither irrigation, or force our food supply to compete for corn, and it could ease the country's switch from a fuel-burning transportation infrastructure.</p> <p>The Republicans' cries of \"drill, baby, drill\" harkens back to the 1980s, when conservatives pointed to economically depressed mining and timber communities and successfully pinned the blame on environmentalists seeking to protect endangered habitat. Now the question is whether westerners will fall back into old habits and vote to bring back the oil rigs, or will they grasp the conservationist and long-term approach of the Democratic plan? </p> <p>I'm guessing the latter. Not out of any nod towards collective human intelligence, but because today's economic climate in the west is vastly different than in the 1980s, when the Republican rhetoric was so successful. In fact, during the recent economic downturn, the job rate in the west was still relatively unaffected: in this <a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/pf/features/lists/state_unemployment/\">CNN June report</a>, the Dakotas, Utah, Wyoming, and New Mexico all ranked in the top ten for unemployment rates. Montana was close behind at fifteen and Colorado finished in the top half. </p> <p>Still, while employment is up, so is the cost of living. What's likely to be at the top of westerners' minds isn't jobs, but the rising cost of housing, healthcare and food.</p>",
  "<p>The Republicans today effectively won their battle to delay the findings of the Troopergate investigation into Sarah Palin until after the White House election on November 4.</p> <p>Her husband, Todd, and other witnesses signalled late yesterday they would ignore subpoenas demanding they attend an Alaska senate judiciary hearing into the affair in Anchorage today.</p> <p>One of the Democrats on the committee, Bill Wielechowski, admitted that Todd Palin and the others could continue to refuse to testify for months without facing a penalty.</p> <p>A lawyer for Todd Palin, Thomas van Flein, told the investigators the subpoena was \"unduly burdensome\" because he would be out on the campaign trail with his wife until election day.</p> <p>\"His scheduling obligations over the next two months will make it virtually impossible for him to prepare for and present the testimony called for in the subpoena at the specified location during that time period,\" Flein said in a letter.</p> <p>The Republican vice-presidential candidate is under investigation over allegations that she improperly fired her public safety commissioner in July after he refused to sack a state trooper involved in an ugly divorce from her sister.</p> <p>Wielechowski accused the John McCain campaign of \"doing everything they can to delay\" the investigation.</p> <p>The senate had been due to complete its investigation and report by the middle of next month, potentially damaging for Palin and McCain.</p> <p>A rebuke for Palin at that stage could have had an impact on a presidential race that is extremely tight, with poll after poll this week showing McCain and Barack Obama in a deadheat, both nationally and in the battlefield states.</p> <p>Although some polls earlier this week suggested the Palin phenomenon was beginning to fade as a result of Troopergate and other revelations about her record as governor of Alaska, one of the most respected polling organisations in the US, the Pew Research Centre, published a survey today suggesting that the Republican party brand has regained some of its lustre for the first time in three years and that this can be attributed mainly to Palin.</p> <p>This is a stunning turnaround given the extremely low favourability ratings of President George Bush, the unpopularity of the Iraq war and an economy in free fall. </p> <p>The Pew Research Centre found that independent voters, who will decide the election, have an equally favourable view of both parties, 50% to 49%, with the Republicans having the 1% edge.

It accuses Barack Obama and unnamed \"allies\" of killing a 2007 immigration reform bill that would have created a guest worker programme and a \"pathway to citizenship\" for undocumented workers already in the country and included provisions to tighten border security.</p> <p>Touching on an emotional issue for many voting Latinos, who may have family and friends who are part of the 12 million undocumented immigrants living in the US, the ad accuses Obama of voting for \"poison pill\" amendments that led to the <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/06/04/AR2007060401248.html\">2007 McCain-sponsored bill</a>'s demise. Never mind that even George Bush, who had pushed for the bill's passage, <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/Story?id=3256621&amp;page=1\">blamed Republican senators</a> for dealing its deathblow. And never mind that McCain himself now says <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M34KKaczvKg\">he doesn't think it was such a great idea</a> after all.</p> <p>This is McCain's weak attempt to <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-na-immig18-2008sep18,0,215138.story?track=rss\">chip away at Obama's 2-to-1 lead </a>in Latino support. McCain is particularly going after Latinos living in battleground states. The 30-second TV ad is airing in three key southwest states where a big turnout by Latinos could help swing the election: Colorado, Nevada and New Mexico. </p> <p>Coming late in the campaign, McCain's ad constitutes the worst kind of pandering. Here's a man who went against his party's wishes to co-sponsor the bill in the first place, then, in an apparent move to pander to conservative white voters, has consistently disowned the bill on the presidential campaign trail, repeatedly saying that he wouldn't vote for it if it came up again. Now he has changed his tune again - apparently hoping that the Spanish-language ad hits home with Latinos but goes unnoticed by the mainstream. Ironic.</p> <p>Four years ago, the Republicans deep-sixed Democratic candidate John Kerry by labelling him a flip-flopper on important issues, but it is McCain who could teach a course on the subject.</p> <p>The Spanish ad may work on some Latino voters, but it won't be enough to sway most, who overwhelmingly decry the current administration's brutal enforcement policies, including <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/26/us/26raid.html\">workplace raids</a> in which thousands of illegal workers have been rounded up and summarily dumped in detention centres to await deportation. The feds have racked up a few thousand arrests via the raids, but have wreaked untold havoc on Latino families. Parents and their US-born children have been <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/03/17/AR2007031701113.html\">separated</a> due to the raids and deportations, which are covered extensively on the same Spanish-language TV networks on which McCain's ads are running. I'm betting those images are a lot more powerful.</p>",

Moreover, Alaska got those pork barrel funds anyway to finance other projects. </p> <p>It's no surprise that the McCain campaign keeps telling lies. In the movie <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0077975/\">Animal House</a>, one of the Delta fraternity pledges is entrusted to care for his big brother's Cadillac. After the fraternity boys ruin the car, one frat boy proposes hiding the wreck, reporting the car stolen, and letting his brother collect the insurance for a replacement. \"Do you think it'll work?\" the pledge asks. </p> <p>His fraternity brother replies, \"It's bound to work better than the truth.\" </p> <p>That's the McCain campaign's central thesis. McCain has supported President Bush \u2013 a president with an approval rating <a href=\"http://pollster.com/polls/us/jobapproval-bush.php\">below 30%</a> - <a href=\"http://www.factcheck.org/askfactcheck/is_it_true_john_mccain_voted_with.html\">90% of the time</a>. Do the math: that doesn't offer much hope of winning on the facts. So his campaign brews distractions to sidestep real issues. \"This campaign is not about issues,\" campaign manager Rick Davis <a href=\"http://voices.washingtonpost.com/thefix/2008/09/mccain_manager_this_election_i.html\">declared</a>.</p> <p>Many find it particularly hypocritical that McCain, who founded his reputation on straight talk, has resorted to lies, distortions and doubletalk. Some say he's sold his soul for a last grasp at the presidency. But maybe - just maybe - we've got McCain wrong. Maybe the lies are not calculated to misrepresent his record or Obama's. Maybe they're part of a larger strategy. </p> <p>Maybe McCain is really chasing a vast bloc of voters that candidates usual ignore, at least explicitly. In this tight race, the outcome could come down to America's vast hypocrite vote. </p> <p>For example, the 26% of Americans that describe themselves as evangelical Christians have strong hypocritical tendencies, politically at least. Evangelicals first became a political force in the 1980 presidential election, when they abandoned small town Sunday school teacher and born-again Christian Jimmy Carter for divorced, Hollywood actor and infrequent churchgoer Ronald Reagan.</p> <p>A <a href=\"http://pewresearch.org/pubs/743/united-states-religion\">Pew Research survey</a> released early this year found that evangelicals are nearly as likely to be living together out of wedlock as the public at large and more likely to be divorced. Perhaps more telling, the Barna Group <a href=\"http://www.barna.org/FlexPage.aspx?Page=BarnaUpdate&amp;BarnaUpdateID=263\">found that</a> only about one in five self-proclaimed evangelicals actually hold the tradition's key core beliefs. Underscoring that point, evangelicals have loudly applauded Bristol Palin, the 17-year-old pregnant daughter of the Republican vice presidential candidate, as a goddess of life rather than condemn her as a sinner. One suspects they wouldn't be quite so forgiving if it was an Obama offspring was the mother-to-be \u2013 or the shotgun groom. </p> <p>But hypocrisy cuts across religious as well as party lines. Tens of millions of Americans talk the talk but don't walk the walk or think things through. They drive their SUVs to Earth Day rallies. They watch Fox News and parrot complaints about the media's liberal bias. They believe America needs to keep good, high wage jobs at home yet shop at Wal-Mart, Chinese exporters' best customer. They don't see a contradiction or even a connection between abstinence-only sex education and pregnancy crisis centres.</p> <p>For them, McCain offers not just a hypocritical campaign, but a hypocritical agenda for the White House. After 26 years on Capitol Hill, President McCain will reform Washington and put the lobbyists who run his campaign out of business. He'll cut taxes, yet balance the budget. He'll reduce regulation yet bring order to Wall Street. He'll continue the American war in Iraq to victory, even though there's little sign of political progress among Iraqi factions despite the decrease in violence. He'll stop global warming while providing bigger fixes to satisfy America's addiction to oil.</p> <p>In short, McCain will keep doing what Bush has done, but, he says, the results will be different. That's not just hypocritical. That's insane.</p>",
  "<!-- Block 1 --> <p><strong>Preamble</strong> Good morning and welcome to what, surely, is a Brussels bureaucrat's wet dream: three days of sweet European Union harmony where, for a change, we stick one to Uncle Sam. But while Europe are justifiable favourites for the 37th Ryder Cup - they're unbeaten since 1999 and all their team is in the world's top 50- don't discount the impact of a Kentuckian crowd fuelled by moonshine and patriotic fervour. It could go down to the wire.</p> <!-- Block 2 --> <p><strong>While you're waiting for play to begin ...</strong> why not peruse our <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/interactive/2008/sep/16/rydercup2008\">interactive guide of the Valhalla course</a>, read <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2008/sep/18/rydercup.golf1\">Mike Adamson's predictions for the foursomes</a>, or take in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2008/sep/19/rydercup.golf2\">Richard Williams' verdict on Nick Faldo and Paul Azinger</a>? Or, alternatively, you could try to beat the office record of 33 in Mini Putt 2 by clicking <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/may/27/games.toys\">here</a> and scrolling down the page to the golf section of our Greatest Internet Sports Games.</p> <!-- Block 3 --> <p><strong>Dawn at Valhalla ... </strong> and the European supporters are already singing 'There's only one Nick Faldo!' Not everyone is impressed with the European team captain, mind. \"Does anyone actually like Faldo?\" splutters Darren Ford. \"He's an odd choice for captain seeing as he's completely lacking in charm and grace, has an unwarranted arrogance to rival Johnny Borrell and has all the man management skills of Graeme Souness.\" He did win six majors, Darren. Borrell has written one half-decent song.</p> <!-- Block 4 --> <p><strong>1.05pm BST</strong> There are lots of yee-haws and cheers as Phil Mickelson, Anthony Kim, Padraig Harrington and Robert Karlsson arrive on the first tee. It's already a feisty atmosphere and it's only 7.05am. God knows what it will be like come Sunday afternoon. Padraig steps up ...</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p><strong>1.06pm BST</strong> ... and hits a steady iron straight down the middle of the 448-yard par 4, first. But he's quickly outdone by Mickelson, who pulls out his one wood, snorts in the Valhalla air, and cracks a perfect drive 50 yards past Harrington. Cue loud chants of 'USA! USA!'</p> <!-- Block 6 --> <p><strong>1.10pm BST</strong> Superb approach from Karlsson at the first; his approach is within 10 feet.</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p><strong>1.11pm BST</strong> Mickelson's booming drive has put Kim just 110 yards from the hole. He steps up, wriggles his wrists and hits a shot that only <em>just</em> clears the bunker and lands about 15 feet from the flag.</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p><strong>1.13pm BST </strong> Mickelson for birdie. He spends a good 30 seconds standing over the ball before sending it a foot wide of the hole. It's conceded, which means Harrington has a putt to Europe one up ...</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p><strong>1.15pm BST</strong> ... which he does with the minimum of fuss. Harrington and Karlsson are one up after one.</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>1.18pm BST</strong> \"The Ryder Cup makes me proud to be a European,\" says David Michaels. \"Give me the Euro over the pound any day. Let's sign up for the single currency right now. Who is with me?\" Not my colleague Barry Glendenning, who claims he wants the Americans to win because of his dislike of Nick Faldo. Let's see if three days of 'USA! USA' changes his resolve ...</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>1.21pm BST</strong> The second match Paul Casey &amp; Henrik Stenson v Justin Leonard &amp; Hunter Mahan gets underway. Casey hits a corker which finds the middle of the fairway; Leonard finds the light rough but should be OK.</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>1.24pm BST</strong> Both the US and Europe find the light rough with their drives on the 505-yard par-4 second. \"When did sporting success have anything to do with popularity?\" asks Andy Moore. \"British sport is littered with popular losers, Faldo's reputation seems to be based on a steadfast refusal to not be one of them. Also along with Faldo's six majors he is also the winner of the most points of any European in Ryder Cup history. I should imagine he knows a thing or two about winning it.\"</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>1.27pm BST</strong> Stenson on fire! He's fired his approach on the first to within 12 feet.</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>1.29pm BST</strong> Mickelson and Kim have the advantage on the second: Mickelson's approach goes to within 15 feet; Harrington is at least twice as far with his.</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>1.31pm BST</strong> Europe could be about to go up in the second match too. The Americans are 25 foot away in three; the Europeans closer in two. \"There's been a disappointing lack of sarcastic commentary about the identikit wives of the American team this year,\" says Ben Mimmack. \"Have they started showing signs of individualism or has the joke worn thin I wonder?\" Give it time Ben.</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>1.33pm BST</strong> Mahan misses his par putt, Casey rolls his birdie attempt to within six inches: it's enough for Casey and Stenson to go one up after one.</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>1.35pm BST</strong> Both Kim and Stensson miss their birdie putts at the second. The Europeans make Mickelson putt out, which he does with the minimum of fuss. Harrington and Karlsson remain one up after two.</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>1.38pm BST</strong> Europe's superb early start continues in the third match - Stewart Cink &amp; Chad Campbell v Justin Rose - as Campbell thumps his drive at the first into the deep stuff, while Rose finds the edge of the fairway.</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>1.40pm BST</strong> Meanwhile to your emails, where Jim Butler wants to know if \"anyone has a link to a video of our Dear Leader Nick's speech yesterday? Since the Office is long finished, I could do with a good cringe-fest.\" Well?</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>1.42pm BST</strong> Harrington's tee shot at 206-yard par 3 third is Reanimator II disgusting: it's in the deep stuff and, despite repeated efforts, isn't able to be hacked out. Eventually the Europeans concede, which means the first match is now all square.</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>1.44pm BST</strong> Meanwhile Gary Naylor is unhappy. \"The role the wives play in the Ryder Cup appears to be predicated on the belief that the last forty years or so of cultural, social and political change never actually happened,\" he writes. \"I really hope that a gay golfer will make the team for 2010, so we can see a Ken amongst the Barbies.\" I'm pretty sure gay golfers have made previous Ryder Cup teams Gary: they're just not openly gay (and given golf's inherent conservatism can you blame them?)</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>1.46pm BST</strong> Poulter's approach to the first drifts to the left, leaving Rose a 20-footer to win the hole. He makes several practice putts, steps up ...</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>1.47pm BST</strong> ... and sends it just wide. Cink makes his two-far par putt to leave the third match all square after one.</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p><strong>1.49pm BST</strong> There's better news for Europe in the second match as Leonard and Mahan bogey the second to slip to two down. Meanwhile here's <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wv-VErBMFW0\">some video of Faldo yesterday</a>.</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p><strong>1.52pm BST</strong> The fourth match - Kenny Perry &amp; Jim Furyk v Lee Westwood &amp; Sergio Garcia - gets underway. Westwood blitzes his drive down the fairway, Furyk gets on the smooth stuff too, eventually, after a short bound in the light rough.</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p><strong>1.55pm BST</strong> This from the wires: apparently Paul Azinger attended a \"pep rally\" in downtown Louisville last night where he urged spectators to be their \"13th man\", telling them \"you can cheer when they (Europe) miss putts\". This could be a very raucous weekend indeed ...</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p><strong>1.57pm BST</strong> Shot of the day so far from Harrington, who sends his approach to the 375-yard par-four to within five feet. But immediately it's bettered by Mickelson, who flicks it to within four feet from the light rough.</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p><strong>1.59pm BST</strong> Karlsson makes his birdie putt ... although it rattles around the cup before sinking and, somewhat surprisingly, tells Anthony Kim he does have to putt out. The first match remains all square after four.</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p><strong>2.01pm BST</strong> There are boisterous chants of 'USA! USA!' as Leonard birdies the par-3, third to leave Stenson and Casey one up after three.</p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p><strong>2.03pm BST</strong> Meanwhile on the first, Westwood strolls in a 12-footer for birdie to move Europe one up after one in match four.</p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p><strong>Latest scoreboard at 2.05pm BST</strong></p> <p>Mickelson/Kim A/S Harrington/Karlsson (after four)<br>Leonard/Mahan v <strong>Stenson/Casey 1 up</strong> (after three)<br>Cink/Campbell A/S Rose/Poulter (after one)<br>Perry/Furyk v <strong>Westwood/Garcia 1 up</strong> (after one)</p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p><strong>2.07pm BST</strong> After some adventures on the second, Rose glides in a 10-footer for par which earns Europe a half.</p> <!-- Block 33 --> <p><strong>2.09pm BST</strong> Casey and Stenson are in trouble on the par-3 third, but Stenson's par putt from the edge of the green means the Americans have to putt out from four feet to win the hole. Mahan steps up ...</p> <!-- Block 34 --> <p><strong>2.10pm BST</strong> ... and makes it to leave the second match all square after four.</p> <!-- Block 35 --> <p><strong>2.12pm BST</strong> Meanwhile a question from Mike Hatcher. \"Sean, how deep is the deep stuff? US Open style, or wet Carnoustie?\" It's pretty mild, Mike. \"I also have an argument to settle re: Faldo vs Monty,\" he adds. \"If you could only have one, who would you pick in your team (in their respective pomps)? I'd have Monty, because I think he'd be more inspiring for the rest of the team - despite him being almost as much of an arse as Faldo obviously is.\" Anyone?</p> <!-- Block 36 --> <p><strong>2.15pm BST</strong> After a sensational tee shot by Rose at the par-3 third, Poulter taps in a three-foot putt to put Europe up in the third match.</p> <!-- Block 37 --> <p><strong>2.17pm BST</strong> But Westwood and Garcia miss the chance to go two-up at the second when Garcia's putt slips past the hole.</p> <!-- Block 38 --> <p><strong>2.19pm BST</strong> \"I was wavering until Faldo's speech last night before finally deciding to hope the Americans win,\" says Niall Glynn. \"The following comments were too stupid to be offensive but still highlight that he is little more than a charmless cretin. On Padraig Harrington he said that: 'he had hit more golf in practice than potatoes planted in Ireland'. He then turned to Graham McDowell and asked him whether he was from 'Ireland or Northern Ireland.' Seriously Sean, what a dick.</p> <!-- Block 39 --> <p><strong>2.21pm BST</strong> Drama at the 500-yard, par-4 sixth! The Americans have the advantage on the green, with Harrington having a birdie putt of 40 feet and Mickelson less than half that. But Harrington makes his attempt, Mickelson lips out, and Europe are now one up in the first match.</p> <!-- Block 40 --> <p><strong>Latest scoreboard at 2.25pm BST</strong></p> <p>Mickelson/Kim v <strong>Harrington/Karlsson (1 up) </strong> (after six)<br><strong>Leonard/Mahan (1 up)</strong> v Stenson/Casey (after five)<br>Cink/Campbell v <strong>Rose/Poulter 1 up</strong> after four<br>Perry/Furyk v <strong>Westwood/Garcia 1 up</strong> (after three)</p> <!-- Block 41 --> <p><strong>2.26pm BST</strong> The loudest cheer of the day comes as local Kentucky boy Kenny Perry sinks a 50-footer for birdie at the 3rd. Garcia misses his putt from 15-feet and the final match is suddenly all square.</p> <!-- Block 42 --> <p><strong>2.28pm BST</strong> An ice-cold par putt from Poulter keeps Europe 1 up in match three. \"So Azinger's encouraging the American spectators to be louder and more patriotic?\" asks Nick Parish. \"Good grief. Isn't that like encouraging Joey Barton to show a bit more of his aggressive side?\"</p> <!-- Block 43 --> <p><strong>2.30pm BST</strong> Harrington finds the rough at the monster 601-yard par 5 seventh and Karlsson can only hack out. \"Re: Faldo v Monty. I'd go for Monty every time,\" says Jamie Kennedy. \"You never know he might actually lamp a spectator one of these days and you couldn't get a better stage than the Ryder Cup in the US to do that.\"</p> <!-- Block 44 --> <p><strong>2.34pm</strong> The Americans are also having some adventures on the seventh, but despite Kim's five-wood going into a high bank about 100 yards from the flag, Mickelson is able to send his approach to within 15 feet. They have the advantage here ...</p> <!-- Block 45 --> <p><strong>2.37pm BST</strong> \"Why is anyone worried about whether Faldo is a bit obnoxious or not?\" asks Gary Naylor. \"I hate sport's slick public relations stuff, thanking the sponsors, following the spun script, executing the media training gameplan blah, blah, blah. I doubt that I'd select Faldo or Monty were I planning a dinner party, but that's not the point is it? The Ryder Cup is great because although the players like to win, they really hate to lose, which produces gladiatorial combat. There's room for nice guys in that scenario, but more room for the likes of Seve, memorably described by Alan Partridge <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH-5KUaeMaw\">here</a>. Why can't a player be nice <em>and</em> competitive, Gary? Most of the British medallists I spoke to during the Olympics didn't seem to have a problem doing both ...</p> <!-- Block 46 --> <p><strong>2.39pm BST</strong> A huge fist-pump from Justin Rose as he makes a 15-footer at the fourth to put Europe 2 up in the third match.</p> <!-- Block 47 --> <p><strong>2.42pm BST</strong> Superb golf from Europe: Garcia and Westwood have gone back up in the fourth match while Harrington has made an 18-footer for par to stay one up in match one.</p> <!-- Block 48 --> <p><strong>Latest scoreboard at 2.45pm</strong></p> <p>Mickelson/Kim v <strong>Harrington/Karlsson (1 up</strong> (after seven)<br>Leonard/Mahan A/S Stenson/Casey (after six)<br>Cink/Campbell v <strong>Rose/Poulter 2 up</strong> after five<br>Perry/Furyk v <strong>Westwood/Garcia 1 up</strong> (after four)</p> <!-- Block 49 --> <p><strong>2.48pm BST</strong> \"So who's playing well Sean?\" asks Mark Cruise. \"Harrington in the first game? Anyone being propped up by their partner?\" Harrington has missed a couple of fairways and greens but has putted like a dream; Garcia is Highland Toffee solid; Rose and Poulter are playing well as a team. For the Americans, Kenny Perry seems to be struggling - the huge putt on the third, apart - and so does Anthony Kim.</p> <!-- Block 50 --> <p><strong>2.51pm BST</strong> The Kentucky crowd are certainly taking Azinger's advice to heart: after Karlsson's putt at the eighth lips out, which brings the first match back to all square again, there are loud claps and whoops. Given some face paint and a few Tomahawks it could almost be the Battle of the Little Big Horn.</p> <!-- Block 51 --> <p><strong>2.54pm BST</strong> Meanwhile Padraig Harrington is being treated by the physio for a neck problem. \"Neck knacked, Paddy whacked,\" sighs my colleague Barry Glendenning.</p> <!-- Block 52 --> <p><strong>2.56pm BST</strong> Oh dear oh dear oh dear. First Paul Casey finds the water at the seventh - much to the delight of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2005/apr/04/golf.lawrencedonegan\">Americans</a>. And then so does his partner, Henrik Stenson.</p> <!-- Block 53 --> <p><strong>2.59pm BST</strong> Cink and Campbell have the chance to pull a shot back at the sixth but Cink slides an eight-footer for birdie past the hole. The Americans body language as they leave the hole is about as sunny as Bolton in February.</p> <!-- Block 54 --> <p><strong>3.04pm BST</strong> Anthony Kim, who is still struggling away, finds the bunker at 10 but Mickelson hits a marvellous recovery to five feet. \"Can any of your American readers answer the following question,\" asks Richard Decker. \"Sarah Palin: why?</p> <!-- Block 55 --> <p><strong>Latest scoreboard at 3.10pm BST</strong></p> <p>Mickelson/Kim A/S Harrington/Karlsson (after 10)<br><strong>Leonard/Mahan 2 up</strong> Stenson/Casey (after eight)<br>Cink/Campbell v <strong>Rose/Poulter 2 up</strong> (after six)<br>Perry/Furyk A/S Westwood/Garcia (after six)</p> <!-- Block 56 --> <p><strong>3.13pm BST</strong> There's been a huge swing in the last five minutes: the Americans secured a par on the 10th following Mickelson's bunker chip, while Harrington missed an 18-inch tiddler to square the hole. Then Furyk made a huge birdie putt to put pressure on Garcia, who dabbed his 15-footer for par wide. So both sides lead in one match, while the other two are all square.</p> <!-- Block 57 --> <p><strong>3.15pm BST</strong> \"I think Richard Decker's question is wrong,\" says Benjamin Hendry. \"It should be 'Sarah Palin: How?' As in, <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jacob-alperinsheriff/sarah-palin-instituted-ra_b_125833.html\">how can a woman believe that even rape victims should not be allowed to have an abortion</a> (or even the morning-after pill) or, according to some accounts, that rape victims should be charged for the after-attack examination?\"</p> <!-- Block 58 --> <p><strong>3.19pm BST</strong> A thunderous three wood approach by Kenny Perry at the 601 yard, par-5 seventh, flies 255 yards before landing on the green. Garcia, from six yards closer, sends his shot over the back. Advantage USA.</p> <!-- Block 59 --> <p><strong>3.23pm BST</strong> Meanwhile Gary Naylor is back. \"It's perfectly possible to be nice and successful, but there are reasons why this combination is relatively rare. High level success in sport demands dedication, self-denial, ruthlessness and a fierce will to win. They sit on top and eventually (for many) drown out all the qualities that one needs merely to enjoy sport: teamwork, generosity of spirit, respect for oneself and one's opponent. It seems perfectly logical to me that the higher up the sporting food chain one goes, the fewer nice guys and gals one might meet. Who do you want to enjoy a drink with and who do you want playing for your life of these pairs? Ronnie O'Sullivan and Jimmy White; Shane Warne and Ashley Giles; Nick Faldo and Jean van de Velde?\" </p> <p>Having met a few sports people in my time, Gary, I suspect that there is a closer relationship between money/high public attention (particularly at an early age) and nastiness, particularly when it comes to footballers.

(Can we keep this up until polling day, then let them in on the truth?)\"</p> <!-- Block 74 --> <p><strong>4.04pm BST</strong> Three pieces of good news for Europe in the space of a few seconds of TV time: Mickelson misses a 12-footer to win the hole on 13, Mahan sends his 10-footer to win the 12th at least five foot past, and Rose makes a birdie with a 20-footer on the par-five 10th.</p> <!-- Block 75 --> <p><strong>4.06pm BST</strong> Leonard makes his par putt at 11 to keep the US one up in the second match while Kim sinks his par putt at 12, to bring Europe's advantage in the first match back to two shots.</p> <!-- Block 76 --> <p><strong>Latest scoreboard at 4.07pm BST</strong></p> <p>Mickelson/Kim v <strong>Harrington/Karlsson 2 up</strong> (after 13)<br><strong>Leonard/Mahan 1 up</strong> Stenson/Casey (after 11)<br>Cink/Campbell v <strong>Rose/Poulter 2 up</strong> (after 10)<br><strong>Perry/Furyk 1 up</strong> v Westwood/Garcia (after 9)</p> <!-- Block 77 --> <p><strong>4.11pm</strong> For those of you who have been asking, Padraig seems to have recovered from his neck injury earlier. Speaking of which, this from Niall Glynn. \"Perhaps Padraig was getting massaged in preparation for all the holes he has been carrying Karlsson since?\"</p> <!-- Block 78 --> <p><strong>4.14pm</strong> Harrington and Karlsson looked home and hosed for a few minutes ago; now they're beginning to wobble. After yet another poor tee shot from Karlsson, this time on the 215-yard par 3 14th, Harrington can't get a horrible-positioned chip to within 40 foot.</p> <!-- Block 79 --> <p><strong>4.16pm</strong> More genius from Mickelson. Kim's tee shot landed high on the bank above the green; Mickelson had to land his chip right on the fringe and allow the slope to lead it gently down to the hole. Somehow he did it: the US are within six feet, Europe more like 50.</p> <!-- Block 80 --> <p><strong>4.18pm</strong> \"Pandering to Paul Broughton's head-in-the-sand isolationist war cry to keep things ignorantly frothy; how exactly does a Spaniard [Miguel Angel Jimenez] end up ginger?\" asks Darren Ford.</p> <!-- Block 81 --> <p><strong>4.20pm</strong> Leonard misses a makeable putt to win the hole on 12, which would have put the US two up in the second match. Meanwhile Harrington makes a six-footer for bogey on the 14th.</p> <!-- Block 82 --> <p><strong>4.21pm</strong> Kim makes his par, to bring the US back to one shot in the opening match. It's <em>this</em> close right now: Europe are up by one shot in two matches, the US are up by one shot in the others.</p> <!-- Block 83 --> <p><strong>4.23pm</strong> Garcia slides a 15-footer for birdie past the hole; Perry has a putt from an almost identical position but it begins to wheeze a foot or so before the cup and eventually dribbles just wide. A let-off for the Europeans. \"Re: Ginger Spaniards. Darren Ford should know that the Celts came from Spain originally (remember Celta de Vigo?),\" says Rob Lewis.</p> <!-- Block 84 --> <p><strong>Latest scoreboard at 4.26pm BST</strong></p> <p>Mickelson/Kim v <strong>Harrington/Karlsson 1 up</strong> (after 14)<br><strong>Leonard/Mahan 1 up</strong> Stenson/Casey (after 13)<br>Cink/Campbell v <strong>Rose/Poulter 1 up</strong> (after 11)<br><strong>Perry/Furyk 1 up</strong> v Westwood/Garcia (after 10)</p> <!-- Block 85 --> <p><strong>4.28pm BST</strong> \"Paul Broughton might be bored to tears with what Guardian readers have got to say about the US election but I'm bored to tears with Naylor and his prattling.

Campbell and Cink make par at the 12th from 15 feet, which will leave Rose with a four-footer for a half.</p> <!-- Block 87 --> <p><strong>4.32pm BST</strong> Rose makes his par to keep Europe one up after 12 in the third match. Meanwhile Leonard and Mahan are now two up after 14 in their match against Casey and Stenson.</p> <!-- Block 88 --> <p><strong>4.35pm BST</strong> Westwood hits a stunning approach to the par-four 11th but Furyk is equal to it. It'll be a putting contest. \"Who's Faldo going to drop for the fourballs Sean?\" asks Mike Hatcher. \"Sounds like Karlsson is wilting (maybe the erratic Stenson is a better bet in fourballs anyway).\" Karlsson, Casey and Stenson are all candidates, Mike.</p> <!-- Block 89 --> <p><strong>4.37pm BST</strong> More woe for Europe! First Rose hits a straightforward approach at 13 into the water; then Kenny Perry makes a 20-footer for birdie on 11.</p> <!-- Block 90 --> <p><strong>4.39pm</strong> Garcia misses his birdie putt at 11 and so Perry and Furyk are now two up in the final match. Cue loud chants of USA! USA! Speaking of which, this from Tony Scott. \"I have nothing against the Yanks, but that chanting of 'U-S-A, U-S-A' every time one of the American players so much as farts does get a bit tiresome sometimes.

Coming off the 12th, the Europeans were three up; now Harrington has a 20-foot putt on the 16th to square the hole. He steps up ...</p> <!-- Block 93 --> <p><strong>4.46pm BST</strong> ... and nails it! Superb from Harrington. Absolutely superb. That's his third long-distance save this match and it keeps the first match level.</p> <!-- Block 94 --> <p><strong>4.49pm BST</strong> \"Not sure if this has been given the courage it deserves, but Hunter S Thompson is, after Mohammad Ali, Lousiville's most famous son,\" points out John in Belfast. \"And even though he shot himself in the face a few years ago, it would be safe to assume what he thought of the Presidential election and Sarah Palin \u2013 good on hunting and random gunnery \u2013 bad on the future of the Presidency.

That's why we log on.\"</p> <!-- Block 95 --> <p><strong>4.51pm BST</strong> Another superb drive from Mickelson at the 477-yard par-four 17th, while Harrington has pulled his drive far left. No one knows it is, which isn't a positive sign.</p> <!-- Block 96 --> <p><strong>4.53pm BST</strong> The American charge continues! Poulter is unable to make a 60-footer for par and Europe are now one down in the third match. Looking at the scores, Europe are down in three matches and all-square (but in trouble) in the other. They could be 4-0 down at the end of the foursomes if they're not careful.</p> <!-- Block 97 --> <p><strong>4.55pm BST</strong> At last some joy for Europe as Garcia rolls in a 20-footer and Perry, from 15 feet, misses. The Americans are now just one up in the final match.</p> <!-- Block 98 --> <p><strong>4.58pm BST</strong> Justin Leonard and Hunter Mahan make their par at the 16th to win 3 &amp; 2 and <strong>put America ahead by 1-0</strong>.</p> <!-- Block 99 --> <p><strong>5.01pm BST</strong> Harrington and Karlsson somehow par the 17th; Harrington hit a lovely bunker shot to within three feet and Karlsson <em>just</em> made the putt.

He rolls his first one close and the Americans concede.</p> <!-- Block 103 --> <p><strong>5.09pm</strong> Drama at the par-five 18th as both Kim and Karlsson find the bunker with their drives. Harrington thins Europe's second barely 120 yards, while Mickelson stuffs his approach into a greenside bunker.</p> <!-- Block 104 --> <p><strong>5.11pm</strong> \"I hope Faldo has the good sense to put McDowell out with Harrington this afternoon,\" says Cathal O'Flaherty. \"Karlsson is a corpse at this stage, hope he can finally get it together for the final hole!\" Speaking of which, Karlsson has a 92-yard approach to the flag. He's got a sand wedge in his hand ...</p> <!-- Block 105 --> <p><strong>5.12pm</strong> ... and sends the approach to 15 feet. What can Kim do from the bunker?</p> <!-- Block 106 --> <p><strong>5.13pm</strong> Kim fluffs it! His ball climbs out of the bunker and falls back into the rough. Now it's Mickelson's turn ...</p> <!-- Block 107 --> <p><strong>5.14pm</strong> ... he lands five foot from the hole. Harrington will have one putt to win the match and at least two to tie. He's mulling over it now.</p> <!-- Block 108 --> <p><strong>5.15pm BST</strong> It's on it's way ... it's looking good ... but his putt slips to the left and slides a foot past.

Kim makes his putt to ensure the opening match finishes all square.</p> <!-- Block 110 --> <p><strong>5.19pm</strong> Meanwhile Garcia has had a shocker on the 15th: he fired an easy approach into the drink and Europe ended with a six.

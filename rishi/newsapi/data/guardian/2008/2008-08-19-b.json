  "<p>When Montana's governor, Brian Schweitzer, launched his campaign for re-election this summer he chose to be pictured on a horse lassooing a calf, and in silhouette against a barn door, presumably after a long hard day on the ranch. What was not mentioned was the word Democrat - a party affiliation that in some parts of the west still conjures up associations with gay marriage, gun control and abortion.</p> <p>Those sensibilities could be in for a shake-up as Barack Obama launches the Democrats' most aggressive drive for years for votes from the Rocky Mountain west.</p> <p>The strategy unrolling now across the west could turn once reliably Republican states such as Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico, and possibly even Montana into America's new electoral battleground. But it is Colorado which is viewed as the biggest prize.</p> <p>\"Colorado defines competitive,\" said Dick Wadhams, the chairman of the state Republican party. \"I think either party could carry Colorado.\"</p> <p>It all hinges on how you define Democrat - a political label that has been comprehensively altered by a new generation of elected politicians in the west - and an impressive grassroots organisation now being assembled by the Obama campaign.</p> <p>The big push begins next week, when some 50,000 Democrats are expected to converge on Denver for the party's convention. Democrats see the convention, especially the spectacle surrounding Obama's nomination speech at a giant football stadium, as a chance to impress on voters in Colorado and other states the party's renewed commitment to the west.</p> <p>Obama's first appearances on his return from holiday this week were in Nevada and New Mexico, and he is planning to campaign in Colorado after the convention. \"Colorado and the west are both a big focus of this campaign,\" said Stephanie Mueller, a spokeswoman for the Obama campaign in Denver.</p> <p>Not that John McCain, the Republican candidate, is expected to yield easily. McCain has lived in Arizona for the last 25 years, and has made frequent visits to Colorado and Nevada.</p> <p>But after eight years of an unpopular George Bush, Democrats believe that voters in Colorado and other states are disillusioned with Republicans. They are frustrated with the rising deficit, the war in Iraq, and worried about the economy. This could be Obama's moment.</p> <p>Unlike previous elections, when the Republicans rode a wave of emotion over terrorism, or issues such as gay marriage and abortion, this time voters' concerns are down to earth: the economy and the need for renewable energy sources.</p> <p>That has led to a blurring of the conventional political divisions. In Colorado, unaffiliated voters outnumber Democrats and Republicans. Soaring petrol prices have turned conservative farmers into ardent conservationists. Even the Republican candidates have taken to carrying around solar film panels and using public transport to get to campaign events.</p> <p>The early signs are encouraging for Obama. The two candidates are virtually tied in Colorado, although a Rasmussen poll last week put McCain ahead of Obama in the state for the first time in seven months. McCain and Obama are also running neck and neck in Nevada and New Mexico.</p> <p>But Obama claims the edge in organising, grafting his campaign on top of rejuvenated local organisations.</p> <p>In every state of the west, the Obama campaign has taken the lead in voter registration, increasing the number of Democrats.</p> <p>In New Mexico, the campaign has opened 20 offices - compared to just five in the 2004 elections - and the organising effort has extended into rural areas that have not been involved in presidential contests for decades.</p> <p>In Colorado, Obama's campaign has opened 10 offices, including in towns seen as redoubts of the Christian right.</p> <p>Even in Montana, a state of 950,000, the campaign has deployed 40 paid organisers to register new voters.</p> <p>Wadhams insists that much of the excitement about Obama's organising prowess is over-stated. \"There is a lot of smoke and mirrors,\" he said.</p> <p>But Democrats across the west believe enthusiasm about Obama's candidacy and the campaign's investment in the region could make this the Democrats' moment.</p> <p>\"That investment and the energy that we see on the ground in New Mexico will absolutely translate in November,\" said Brian Col\u00f3n, the chairman of the New Mexico Democratic party.</p> <p>The challenge for Obama though will be to resist Republican efforts to brand him as an elitist, or a textbook liberal more at home in San Francisco or New York than in the west.</p> <p>For the last 40 years, the west has sent only Republicans to the White House - except for 1992 when Bill Clinton benefited from a third party candidate who drained Republican support. By 2000, Republicans governed all eight states, and controlled 13 of the 16 Senate seats.</p> <p>Then Democratic activists began to plot their comeback. In Colorado, local entrepreneurs began funnelling money towards liberal causes, building up institutions that could put Democrats on a surer footing. First came the thinktanks, then media monitoring organisations. By 2004, the local renewal efforts under way in Colorado and other states had a powerful patron in Howard Dean, the Democratic national committee chairman.</p> <p>Under Dean, the Democrats began putting money and resources into building up party networks even in states which had little prospect of voting a Democrat into the White House. Western Democrats credit the strategy with gaining a foothold for the party even in staunchly Republican states such as Utah and Wyoming, and say it will prove its value over the coming years.</p> <p>\"In a place like Montana there simply weren't the resources to keep a party headquarters opened during the entire year in non-election years and so it was very difficult,\" said Schweitzer. \"It kept people on the ground recruiting new candidates, maintaining voter files, making sure we have county committees that are working and organised.\"</p> <p>At the same time, the Democrats began recruiting a new generation of organisations, and began scouting for political candidates who could appeal to moderate voters in the west.</p> <p>Eight years on, five of the eight governors of western states are now Democrats, and five of the 16 senators.</p> <p>Betsy Markey, who is hoping to unseat a Christian right member of Congress in Colorado, has a simple formula for success that Obama might want to heed. What makes a successful Democrat in the west? \"The government not telling you how to live your life and what to do,\" she said.</p>",
  "<p>While Brown and Cameron have been fighting it out to see who can fill the nation with the most despair, Barack Obama and John McCain have had their first head-to-head clash as presidential nominees. I have always thought American election debates - where the candidates fight it out live before a mighty audience of the unwashed - distil everything that is unsophisticated and bullheaded about their political system.</p> <p>Saturday's debate was out of the ordinary, being conducted in an evangelical church with questions posed by a cleric, Pastor Rick Warren. In the feverish TV debates the questions come from the audience, but that distinction is pretty minor since no audience member is invited to go off piste with his or her inquiry. It all centres on the hot issues, and they all seem to be faith-based. </p> <p>Abortion and creationism dominate the political landscape to an absurd degree. Issues unrelated to faith - like Iraq - tend to be yoked to religiosity to make them seem slightly less like the unilateral actions of a lunatic. And while the place of religion in American debate reflects a more intense and committed church-going, it is also in this style of debating that black-and-white rhetoric, heightened emotion, binary arguments, sentimentality, crusading and moralising come to dominate. Put simply, listening to people talk is boring. You can't take it in for very long. If you want to retain complex ideas, you have to read them. If you listen to someone speaking from a closely argued text that was designed to be read, it is like temazepam. This is not to say that rhetoric cannot be rousing, but we need drama, simplicity, boldness, big emotions gurning all over the stage like a one-legged Victorian accordionist. </p> <p>Naturally, theatricality is at the core of all political systems, but the American hyper-debate allows, indeed systematises, its worst elements. On telly, with the aid of a little flashing light, there is an extremely short time limit on each answer. As well as putting forward your own case, you have to trounce your opponent's, so a lot of it is a polite slanging match. Only, because that makes you look bad, you then have to waste even more time insincerely praising one another to make up for it. There is neither time nor attention span to introduce a new idea or policy, so if a candidate chances to mention his own manifesto at all, it is in the sketchiest terms. This is, by almost universal assent, what the voters finally plump for: whoever can make the best fist of saying obvious things very fast, with feeling, without confusing anyone, and without perceptible embarrassment at being a very intelligent person saying crass, high-school things.</p> <p>What a blessing, then, that our political leaders do the bulk of their arguing in parliament over the despatch box, where we don't have to watch. And what a blessing that we rarely have to behold the embarrassing spectacle of candidates squabbling over who loves their family the most and believes in God the best. What a blessing that they can command attention with innovation, not just with tub-thumping.</p> <p>And yet polls this week show a laughable 42% of people believe Cameron would make a better PM than Brown. On what grounds? What policies? What actions? What experience? What ideas? What promises? Gah. Don't be silly. It's because he smiles more and doesn't have funny eyes. A major televised or stadium face-off between these two could not drag down the sophistication of our political debate because, short of stripping these hopefuls to their pants and bringing in some bears for the interval, there is nowhere lower for it to go. Go on, boys. Take it to Wembley. David Dimbleby will help.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:mszoewilliams@yahoo.co.uk\">mszoewilliams@yahoo.co.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>One of the more memorable observations by <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Benn\">Tony Benn</a>, the veteran British socialist, is that there are <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2002/jul/20/interviews.labour\">five questions</a> we should ask of anyone who has power: </p> <p>1. What power have you got?<br>2. Where did you get it from?<br>3. In whose interests do you use it?<br>4. To whom are you accountable?<br>5. How do we get rid of you?</p> <p>It is question five that has been exercising Pakistanis of late, in connection with ex-general (and now <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/aug/19/pakistan5\">ex-president</a>) Pervez Musharraf.</p> <p>Musharraf could have bowed out with a lot more dignity last year instead of using jiggery-pokery to sneak an <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistani_presidential_election,_2007\">extra presidential term</a>. In the event, his attempts to cling on merely increased his unpopularity. He jumped only when it became obvious he was about to be pushed. But at least he did jump \u2013 which is more than can be said of many authoritarian leaders, most notably at the moment, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/aug/15/zimbabwe\">President Mugabe</a> of Zimbabwe.</p> <p>Naturally, 19-year-old <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilawal_Bhutto\">Bilawal Bhutto</a> (Benazir's son and nominal leader of the Pakistan Peoples party) is jubilant about Musharraf's departure. \"The biggest hurdle in the way of democracy has been removed\", he <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/7569311.stm\">said</a>. Somehow, I doubt that. Even so, the fact that Pakistanis have succeeded in ridding themselves of an unwanted leader is no mean achievement. Musharraf had been in power for nine years \u2013 quite a long time by European standards, though by the standards of Arab leaders he had barely got beyond the overture.</p> <p>The late Syrian president, Hafez al-Assad, spent 29 years in office, while Habib Bourguiba, the first president of Tunisia, outdid him \u2013 just \u2013 by completing 30. Saddam Hussein ruled Iraq for almost 24 years, Yasser Arafat led the Palestinian struggle for 45 and the late King Hussein of Jordan, who came to the throne at the age of 16, reigned for 46 years. </p> <p>Among the Arab leaders who are still in power, Colonel Muammar Gadafy of Libya is the longest survivor, having come to power through a military coup in 1969. Not far behind in the longevity stakes is Sultan Qaboos of Oman who assumed the throne in 1970 after deposing his father. Ali Abdullah Salih of Yemen will have ruled for 35 years when his current presidential term expires in 2013, and Hosni Mubarak, who became president of Egypt in 1981, secured a fifth six-year term in 2005 which \u2013 if he survives \u2013 will take him up to the age of 83.</p> <p>Only one of these, as far as I know, has ever talked publicly of retiring. In 2005, President Salih surprised a rally that had been called to celebrate his 27th year in power by saying that he was \"fed up\" and would not be seeking re-election at the end of his presidential term.</p> <p>\"I hope that all political parties ... find young leaders to compete in the elections because we have to train ourselves in the practice of peaceful succession\", he <a href=\"http://www.al-bab.com/yemen/artic/mei110.htm\">said</a>. Our country is rich with young blood who can lead the country ... let's transfer power peacefully among ourselves, people are fed up with us, and we are fed up with power.\"</p> <p>This turned out to be nothing more than a political ploy (and perhaps a test of his supporters' loyalty). The crowd at the rally certainly knew what was expected of them: \"No, no, we want you, we want you for ever\", they chanted \u2013 and the following year Salih was duly re-elected with 77% of the vote.</p> <p>There are several reasons why Arab leaders stay in power so long. The monarchs among them, of course, have a job for life (unless their son gets impatient, as happened in Oman and Qatar). Arab presidents tend to view their job in much the same way and, apart from keeping the lid on any opposition, are careful to ensure that the kind of political mechanisms that removed Musharraf in Pakistan do not take root in their own countries.<br>Two other factors, apart from a taste for power, probably explain their reluctance ever to step down voluntarily.</p> <p>One is the systems of patronage that they establish in order to consolidate their power: providing jobs, business opportunities and other privileges for key sections of society in return for their support. Thus the survival of the head of state is not merely about one man \u2013 the prosperity of thousands of others is tied to his fate. </p> <p>The other difficulty in persuading them to relinquish power is the risk that a new regime will blame them for all the country's problems and pursue them with criminal charges, perhaps even seizing whatever ill-gotten gains they have stashed away in foreign bank accounts.</p>",
  "<p>At last the news is in, from senior figures in the Democratic party familiar with the presumptive nominee's thinking. I can exclusively put an end to the speculation by confirming that Barack Obama will indeed pick a vice-presidential candidate to be his running-mate, and that he will do so today, tomorrow, or at some point after that, but before the mystery figure addresses the convention in Denver. Further intriguing revelations: *Obama will definitely not reveal his VP pick earlier than today; *Aides say he's \"highly unlikely\" to postpone the decision until after the election; *It is \"all but certain\" that he won't choose the same running-mate as his rival, tiny Republican John McCain.</p> <p>...Meanwhile, lesser pundits have been spending the morning speculating on the identity of the eventual candidate. Sphinx of the day is Mark Halperin at The Page, whose cryptic language <a href=\"http://thepage.time.com/2008/08/19/say-it-is-so-joe/\">here</a> I can barely decode, though it seems to suggest he's been talking to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beau_Biden\">Joe Biden's son Beau</a>, and has a pointer towards Biden Sr as Obama's choice. Biden definitely seems to be the favourite this morning in buzz terms, far ahead of Virginia governor Tim Kaine and Evan Bayh, the other two men named in <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/19/us/politics/19veep.html\">this morning's New York Times piece</a> as the leading contenders. Tomasky <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/michaeltomasky/2008/aug/18/barackobama.uselections20082\">points out Bayh's advantages</a> -- boring, white, Clinton-supporting, swing-state senator, moderately experienced (though Bloomberg <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=washingtonstory&amp;sid=auTmNXiBqkjE\">reports here</a> on a potential conflict-of-interest embarrassment involving his wife's business interests). There's presumably a real risk, on the other hand, that Biden's sheer quantity of experience and foreign-policy credentials could make Obama look bad by contrast.</p> <p>The loose-tongued Biden's relative silence on the VP question so far, <a href=\"http://www.reason.com/blog/show/128171.html\">notes Hit and Run</a>, is highly uncharacteristic: does it mean something? Biden has been consolidating his lead in <a href=\"http://www.intrade.com/jsp/intrade/contractSearch/\">prediction markets</a>, too (click the link, then Politics, then 2008 Election, then Democratic VP): Intrade has Biden in an easy first place, followed by Bayh, Kaine and Clinton in that order. But as Ben Smith <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/blogs/bensmith/0808/Close_to_the_vest_on_veep.html?showall\">points out</a>, all we know for certain is that Kaine has been officially vetted, along with two other candidates who aren't considered to be front-runners -- senators Chris Dodd and Tom Daschle. In other words, we know almost nothing.</p> <p>Meanwhile, conservativeland is up in arms at rumours that McCain might pick Joe Lieberman, or another pro-choice candidate... Giuliani? That could be fun. [<a href=\"http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=ZWZmN2VkODFkZTBkYTg5OTEyNWFiZjBkNGFjZDRiZGM=\">The Corner</a>]</p>"

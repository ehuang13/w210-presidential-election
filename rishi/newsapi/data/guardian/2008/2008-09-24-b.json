  "<p>Karl Friedrich is proud to live in Karl Marx Hof, Vienna's vast monument to municipal socialism. But not as proud as he used to be.</p> <p>\"We had great times here. There were artists and writers all around. Great parties. They're all gone now,\" says the former communist. \"Now half the families in my block are immigrants. They can't speak German. They can't even speak English.\"</p> <p>Built in the 1920s to house the working class of the post-imperial capital, Karl Marx Hof was one of the first social housing schemes in Europe, an expressionist fortress of the left in \"Red Vienna\" and then a battleground in Austria's civil war that pitted the socialists against the neo-fascists in the 1930s.</p> <p>Gottfried, an 80-year-old who has lived here most of his life, remains loyal to the political creed that automatically went with the address.</p> <p>\"I'm a worker. I grew up with the socialists, always voted for them,\" he says, declining to give his surname. \"And I'll be voting for them again on Sunday. How could it be otherwise?\"</p> <p>The problem for Austria's Social Democrats, hoping to win an early general election on Sunday triggered by the collapse of the coalition government of Social and Christian Democrats, is that Gottfried is a member of a dying breed - the core voters of the centre-left.</p> <p>\"Everybody here used to vote socialist. But on Sunday a lot of people here will vote for the [far right] Freedom party,\" says Friedrich, who hopes the centre-left and hard right will form a new taboo-breaking coalition.</p> <p>His hunch is borne out by the opinion polls, which predict a surge in support for the anti-immigrant populists of the extreme right, not least because of the inroads they are making into what used to be the guaranteed support for the Social Democrats.</p> <p>\"The Freedom party is now the most proletarian party in Austria,\" says Anton Pelinka, an Austrian political scientist. \"If you look at Vienna, the Freedom party is doing very well in the working class districts.\"</p> <p>That spells trouble for Austria's Social Democrats (SPO), whose own leader and chancellor, Alfred Gusenbauer, committed political suicide in June by pandering to the main tabloid newspaper and turning Eurosceptic. The U-turn brought down the government and ended Gusenbauer's career. But the problem is more fundamental.</p> <p>\"Austrian social democracy,\" says Fritz Plasser, a leading analyst, \"is in a deep crisis, over its identity, over its programme, and over its prospects.\"</p> <p>The same might be said about almost anywhere you look in Europe. If Labour is anxious about Gordon Brown and the prospects of electoral meltdown, the picture is similarly grim for the centre-left in Germany, France, Italy and beyond.</p> <p><strong>Demoralisation</strong></p> <p>In eight general elections over the past year in Europe from Poland to Ireland and from Finland to Greece, the centre-left has suffered defeat. Only in Spain and Portugal does the centre-left remain solidly in power. Almost everywhere else the mood among social democrats is one of demoralisation and confusion, with hapless leaders adding to the disarray and incapable of drafting popular policies on salient issues such as immigration or the turmoil resulting from free markets and globalised economics.</p> <p>\"All economics nowadays are borderless, while politics still has national borders,\" says Pelinka. \"National governments can do less and less and national politics are in decline.\"</p> <p>If true, this appears to hurt the left more than the centre-right, which claims it is more in tune with the zeitgeist.</p> <p>\"We've won the ideological battle. The culture and moral relativism that the left spread around from the 1980s, we're leaving it behind,\" the French prime minister, Fran\u00e7ois Fillon, told a conference of 70 centre-right parties this summer.</p> <p>Fillon's confidence might be misplaced. Since taking power last year he and President Nicolas Sarkozy have sunk to ever lower levels of popularity in France, according to the TNS-Sofres pollsters. But this apparent weakness does not translate into gains for the opposition Socialists, who have lost three presidential elections in a row and are mired in a six-way battle to decide who will become the party leader.</p> <p>What has historically been Europe's biggest and oldest political party, Germany's Social Democrats or SPD, is haemorrhaging support, bogged down in internal fighting and policy confusion, despite coalescing in government with Chancellor Angela Merkel's Christian Democrats. If the extreme right is eating away at the Social Democrats in Austria, in Germany it is the hard left that is stealing the SPD vote in what might be described as old east Germany's revenge.</p> <p>The new party, called simply the Left, the rump of cold war east German communists joined by west German SPD defectors, is polling at 15%, mainly at the expense of the SPD, which slumped to 20% in the polls this summer under the leadership of Kurt Beck, who has just been ousted in a coup by the right wing of the party. </p> <p>The popular foreign minister, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, will now challenge Merkel for the chancellorship next year. But while he might halt or reverse the SPD's decline, Steinmeier is a civil servant who has never stood for elected office or held senior party political jobs.</p> <p>In Italy the predicament for the mainstream left seems even more dismal as it struggles to present a coherent challenge to the rightwing populist Silvio Berlusconi, who is enjoying high poll ratings despite immigration controversies, the collapse of the national carrier, Alitalia, and the Naples rubbish crisis since being re-elected prime minister in April.</p> <p>\"He who maintains a coalition in Italy governs and Veltroni can't,\" says James Walston, a political scientist at the American University in Rome of the centre-left leader, Walter Veltroni, the former mayor of Rome who heads the new Democratic party. The new movement is crippled by old splits and rivalries between secular and Roman Catholic leftists. </p> <p>As in Austria, the populist parties of the far right, the Northern League and the post-fascist National Alliance, are also attracting traditional leftist voters on issues such as immigration.</p> <p><strong>Populist</strong></p> <p>In Karl Marx Hof, Gottfried is confident that despite the sliding fortunes of the centre-left his Social Democrats will win on Sunday. He may well be right. Under a new populist leader, Werner Faymann, who has the support of the Kronenzeitung bestselling tabloid, the SPO is narrowly ahead in opinion polls at around 30% after promising a spending bonanza, the slashing of VAT on food and the abolition of student fees.</p> <p>But that result would be a historic low for the Social Democrats, five percentage points down on two years ago and seven down on 2002. The real victor looks likely to be the far right, tipped to take a quarter of the vote, 10 points up on two years ago. \"The paradox,\" says Pelinka, \"is that the Social Democrats will get the worst result in their history, and still declare victory.\"</p>",
  "<video data-media-id=\"gu-video-337967602\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\">  </video>   <p>America's presidential election was thrown into disarray last night after John McCain said he wanted to suspend his campaign and delay tomorrow night's debate against Barack Obama to focus on the financial crisis. </p> <p>The Republican candidate made his stunning announcement at the end of a day spent on damage control, amid reports that a firm linked to his campaign manager was on the payroll of the mortgage giant whose collapse precipitated the meltdown on Wall Street.</p> <p>In an appearance from New York, McCain said it was time to put politics aside and return to Washington to help Congress reach a deal on President George Bush's proposal for a $700bn economic rescue package. </p> <p>\"It has become clear that no consensus has developed to support the administration's proposal,\" McCain said. \"I do not believe that the plan on the table will pass as it currently stands, and we are running out of time.\" He did not say he would suspend television advertisements, and did not rule out attendance at the debate.</p> <p>In response, Obama rejected McCain's argument that the Republican was trying to rise above politics. \"This is exactly the time when the American people need to hear from the person who in approximately 40 days will be responsible for dealing with this mess,\" the Democratic party candidate said. \"It is going to be part of the president's job to deal with more than one thing at once.\"</p> <p>The University of Mississippi, which is hosting the debate, said the encounter between McCain and Obama would go ahead as planned.</p> <p>Obama said he had been involved in talks to try to reach a consensus in the Senate while on the campaign trail. He said that McCain had mulled over the possibility of cancelling their debate in a conversation earlier yesterday.</p> <p>It is the third time in a month that McCain has shaken up the campaign, after choosing the outsider Sarah Palin as his running mate and cancelling the first day of his party's convention because of fears about Hurricane Gustav.</p> <p>The proposal to cancel the TV debates was immediately dismissed by Democrats as a play meant to divert attention from McCain's slide in the polls due to the deteriorating economy and the row over his campaign manager, Rick Davis.</p> <p>Republican senators claimed McCain's desire to return to Washington was evidence of his commitment to his \"country first\" election slogan. Other commentators described the move as an attempt to shift the public focus from the economy.</p> <p>The worsening economic outlook has led to a drop in support for McCain, with polls showing that voters consider Obama better equipped to lead America through the crisis. McCain was also buffeted yesterday by reports that a firm linked to Davis was on the payroll of a mortgage lender at the heart of the US credit crisis. </p> <p>The New York Times and Newsweek reported that the lending giant Freddie Mac had paid Davis's consultancy firm $15,000 a month from 2005 until last month - about the time Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae were taken over by the government and about two years after Davis took up his job as campaign manager.</p> <p>The continued arrangement contradicts claims from McCain as recently as Sunday that there was no connection between his manager's lobbying firm, Davis Manafort, and the mortgage companies. </p> <p>The McCain campaign accused the New York Times of extreme bias and of acting as an \"Obama advocacy organisation\". But the McCain camp did not deny the payments made to Davis Manafort. It said Davis had separated from the firm in 2006, and had not received a salary since.</p> <p>The revelations could accelerate an erosion in support for McCain as the public mood sours about the $700bn bailout of Wall Street firms. New poll yesterday gave Obama a lead over McCain after weeks of an apparent dead heat.</p> <p>The Washington Post-ABC news poll gave Obama 52% against 43% for McCain. Obama's lead over McCain was commanding on issues of the economy, with voters saying by 53% to 39% that they trusted the Democrat over the Republican. A Los Angeles Times-Bloomberg poll released later yesterday showed a narrower lead for Obama, who was on 49% against 45% for McCain.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-337956125\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/maps_and_graphs/2008/09/24/US_poll_2509.gif\" alt=\"US poll\" width=\"231\" height=\"476\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Davis, who worked on McCain's failed 2000 run for the Republican leadership, began working directly for Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae that year as head of the companies' pressure group, Homeownership Alliance. The alliance was set up to oppose regulation of the mortgage industry. Davis earned $30,000 a month for his work which ended in 2005, when Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac disbanded the coalition, according to the New York Times. But it said Davis's firm continued to be paid $15,000 a month by Freddie Mac.</p>",
  "<p>Since John McCain so desperately and obviously wanted to <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/news/politics/election2008/2008-09-24-mccain-debate_N.htm\">change the subject</a>, permit me to begin by not taking the bait and not changing the subject.</p> <p>Wednesday was the worst day of the campaign for McCain. The revelations about <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/24/us/politics/24davis.html\">Rick Davis' firm doing lobbying work for Freddie Mac</a> had the potential, and still may have the potential, to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/michaeltomasky/2008/sep/24/johnmccain.congress\">cost Davis his job</a>. Certainly the story had the potential to eat up a lot of cable television time over the next two days. Over the long term, and most importantly, the story has the power, if used properly by the Democrats, to dissolve any morsel of credibility McCain had on the subject of dealing with the current fiscal crisis.</p> <p>So keep that straight. The cable coverage of McCain's ridiculous gambit about suspending his campaign and delaying Friday night's debate is not making that link explicit, because that's just not the sort of thing television does except when it really slaps them in the face, like when Bill Clinton bombed Sudan the night the House of Representatives voted the impeachment articles. </p> <p>But I can guarantee you, if you think the McCain brain trust wasn't manically trying to conjure up a way to wriggle out of the Davis mess and hand the media a new story to yak about, then I have a non-bridge in Alaska to non-sell you.</p> <p>This was also the day when the <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/09/23/AR2008092303667.html\">Washington Post and ABC released a poll</a> showing McCain nine points behind Barack Obama. On Hardball, Chris Matthews is, to his credit, making this connection: that McCain is changing the subject because he's dropping in the polls. In fact the desperation of McCain's move makes one think that maybe his own internal polls show a gloomier picture still.</p> <p>What a joke. What an unserious and contemptible joke. And so typically dishonest. Now that <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/25/us/politics/25mccain.html\">Obama has spoken</a>, we know that it was Obama who called McCain, first suggesting that the two issue a bipartisan joint statement on the crisis. This obviously got McCain and Steve Schmidt thinking. Hey, maybe we can put country first here and \u2026 oops, scratch that. Since we're in such a tight spot today anyway, maybe we can put naked politics first here and go public, steal his thunder, act like we were the white hats who came up with the idea. Yeah! And while we're at it, let's take it a step further. Let's don the sack cloth of piety and insist that we feel this is so important we even think the debate should be suspended. </p> <p>Think about the kind of mind that's required to even think up something like this. I could never think up something like this. Most average people, of whatever political persuasion, could never do it. Some pundits are talking about desperation and Hail Mary passes and so on, but that doesn't really begin to describe the deviousness at work here. </p> <p>This is like a man who gets caught cheating on his wife and then, with his back against the wall and with confrontation looming, goes out and intentionally wrecks the car, contriving to break a few ribs and get rushed to the hospital, all to delay the inevitable conflict and in the cynical knowledge that, in front of the doctors and until the wounds are bound, the wife will be forced to offer sympathy. Males are messed up creatures, but believe me, only a rather small percentage of us is really capable of thinking this connivingly.</p> <p>Will it work? I don't think so. Granted, 98% of Americans don't know about the Rick Davis story, and probably around 90% don't know about the Washington Post poll. So some people may buy it. But I don't believe most will. It just looks too sneaky. Even if one doesn't smell desperation, the odor of weirdness is all over the move.</p> <p>And it looks unpresidential. Obama came out and looked presidential. Presidents need to be able to handle two problems at once, he said. Now is exactly the time when the American people need to hear from us. We both have big planes. They can get us from Washington to Mississippi pretty quickly if need be. His press conference offered, in fact, a good look at how he would be as president. He seeks non-confrontation. But he slips his points in steadily and coolly. Pretty smooth performance.</p> <p>And he seems to be winning. Perhaps inevitably, <a href=\"http://www.surveyusa.com/client/PollReportUC.aspx?g=54d651a7-a62b-4420-bb32-9dd6b2df8c02\">one polling outfit did a snap poll</a> on all this. Results? </p> <blockquote> <p>Hold the debate as scheduled: 50%<br>Hold it but focus on the economy not foreign policy: 36%.<br>Postpone: 10%.</p> <p>Suspend campaigns: 14%<br>Continue campaign: 31%<br>Re-focus campaign: 48%</p> </blockquote> <p>Oopsie. </p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.marketwatch.com/news/story/statement-commission-presidential-debates/story.aspx?guid={82328457-C331-4D2C-B2A1-28A01E37D7A7}&amp;dist=hppr\">commission on presidential debates</a> stated shortly after Obama spoke that the debate will go on. If the commission says it and Obama says it, it will go on, I suspect. But we have yet to see which chess piece McCain moves next. Who can imagine that? Think of the most cynical thing you can think of, then double it.</p> <p>Abraham Lincoln ran for re-election while leading the Union troops in the civil war. Franklin Roosevelt ran for re-election in the midst of terrible depression in 1936, a far worse economic crisis than we have right now, and in 1944 while prosecuting the second world war. </p> <p>If John McCain can't debate while thinking about the country's economy, then he's even more ill-equipped to hold the job than I think he is. But of course he is capable of doing both. His proposal is not serious. It is just a rancidly political act. That he goes before cameras and tries to pass it off as nonpolitical, hoping that people will buy it, is what makes it contemptible.</p> <p>When Mario Cuomo was governor of New York, he devoted a speech to improving the lot of children in New York state. He declared \"The decade of the child.\" When, after a year or two, it became clear that somehow child poverty rates had stayed more or less the same, a joke began circulating around Albany: but he didn't mean this decade.</p> <p>We've reached a similar point today, but far worse, because Cuomo's intentions were at least decent. John McCain's intentions have to do with nothing loftier than the next news cycle. He is the man who said country first. He just didn't mean this country.</p>",
  "<p>John McCain today proposed postponing the first presidential debate so he and Barack Obama could stay in Washington and help Congress craft an economic rescue package. Obama swiftly rejected the idea of rescheduling Friday's event.</p> <p>McCain proposed the two candidates \"suspend\" their campaigns and meet with fellow senators and others in Washington, saying the economic turmoil facing the country requires they put partisan politics on hold to work toward a solution.</p> <p>In a press conference in Florida shortly after the McCain announcement, Obama said the debate should go forward as planned.</p> <p>\"This is exactly the time when the American people need to hear from the person who in approximately 40 days will be responsible for dealing with this mess,\" Obama said. \"It is going to be part of the president's job to deal with more than one thing at once.\"</p> <p>The University of Mississippi, which is hosting the Friday debate, said the event would happen.</p> <p>During his press conference, McCain called for cooperation between Democrats and Republicans on the bailout plan, invoking what he described as the post-September 11 atmosphere of bi-partisanship.</p> <p>\"I am confident that before the markets open on Monday we can achieve consensus on legislation that will stabilise our financial markets, protect taxpayers and homeowners and earn the confidence of the American people,\" he said. \"All we must do to achieve this is temporarily set politics aside, and I am committed to doing so.\"</p> <p>Obama said he was involved in negotiations even on the campaign tail, speaking daily with congressional leaders and treasury secretary Henry Paulson, leader of the Bush administration effort. Obama added, \"If I can be helpful, then I am prepared to be anywhere, any time\".</p> <p>Obama said he and McCain earlier today discussed releasing a joint statement outlining principles they agree should be a part of the rescue package. He said McCain suggested suspending the debates, but added the announcement caught him by surprise.</p> <p>The move on McCain's part comes on the heels of bad news for his campaign, including reports this morning that top aide Rick Davis's consulting firm received substantial sums of money from mortgage company Freddie Mac, which is at the centre of the turmoil in the US banking system.</p> <p>The worsening economic situation has seen voters increasingly turning to Obama as the candidate best able to lead the country through the crisis. A Washington Post/ABC News poll this morning showed Obama leading 52% to 43% among likely voters. The poll shows voters trust Obama more to handle the economy, 53% to 39%.</p> <p>McCain said today he was driven to put the campaign on hold by the thus-far fruitless congressional debate on President Bush's proposed rescue plan. The plan, presented to legislators on Sunday, includes a $700bn bailout of the mortgage industry, and lawmakers are considering additional provisions to limit the pay of executives at the top of failing firms and to protect homeowners caught up in bad mortgages.</p> <p>Meanwhile, McCain told an Ohio television station yesterday that he had not had seen the Bush proposal \"in writing\".</p> <p>Neither McCain nor Obama hold leadership positions in the Senate, and senators involved in the negotiations have not indicated publicly that the men's absence is holding back progress on the economic rescue legislation.<br>Republican Senate leader Mitch McConnell pronounced McCain's proposal \"an outstanding idea\" and said he hoped the Obama campaign would consider it.<br>Independent senator Joseph Lieberman, a former Democrat who now backs McCain, also praised McCain's idea and said Obama should return to the Senate too. </p> <p>Democrats were quick to dismiss McCain's move as a ploy, with New York senator Charles Schumer, a top hand in the bailout legislation negotiations, labelling it \"weird\".</p> <p>Democratic Senate leader Harry Reid said the candidates' return would inject presidential politics into the sensitive negotiations and \"distract important talks about the future of our nation's economy\".</p> <p>\"If that changes, we will call upon them,\" Reid said. \"We need leadership, not a campaign photo op.\"</p> <p>Erick Mullen, a Washington Democratic strategist, said McCain's move is a cynical effort to distract voters from the economic situation.</p> <p>\"After a decade of suspending any activity in the Senate which could have prevented this meltdown, his call today to silence the national conversation is reckless but typical of his half-cocked worldview,\" Mullen wrote in an email. \"When someone read him the latest news about Davis, the polls and Palin's tepid reception at the UN, he wants to change the subject.\"</p>",
  "<p>A <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jl4HIc-yfgM\">new video</a> has emerged showing Sarah Palin, John McCain's running mate, playing a central role in a church service in Alaska in which witchcraft is denounced.</p> <p>Thomas Muthee, a Kenyan who is a regular preacher at Palin's local Pentecostal church in Wasilla, made a passionate plea to defeat witchcraft and other supposed enemies of Palin during a sermon three years ago.</p> <p>The role of the witchfinder in Palin's life raises new questions about how much McCain's team investigated her background before naming her as his vice-presidential running mate.</p> <p>The new video, available on YouTube, shows Palin standing in front of him at the service, head bowed, her hands held by two members of the congregation.</p> <p>Muthee, in the sermon, calls on members of the church to try to gain footholds in centres of influence, such as politics and the media, and praises Palin for her bid to become governor of Alaska. He spoke about the hindrances she faced from her enemies.</p> <p>\"In the name of Jesus, in the name of Jesus, every form of witchcraft is what you rebuke. In the name of Jesus, in the name of Jesus, father make away now,\" Muthee said.</p> <p>In a video that emerged last week, Palin, in a speech to the church on June 8 this year, thanked Muthee for his help in getting her elected governor. She said his invocation was \"very, very powerful\".</p> <p>The Democratic candidate, Barack Obama, faced weeks of damaging reports earlier this year over his links to his controversial Chicago pastor, Jeremiah Wright, who was accused of being unpatriotic. The links between Palin and Muthee have the potential to damage her candidacy.</p> <p>The Christian Science Monitor reported that Muthee, while in Kenya, led a campaign to find the source of alleged witchcraft after a series of fatal car accidents in Kiambu. He blamed a local woman called Mama Jane, who is reported to have been forced to leave the area.<br>Muthee, in a promotional video, said: \"We prayed, we fasted, the lord showed us a spirit of witchcraft resting over the place.\"</p> <p>McCain's campaign team has largely kept Palin away from the media. But she is doing occasional interviews and faces a debate with her opposite number, Joe Biden, next week, both of which offer a chance for witchcraft to be raised.</p>",
  "<p>Rick Davis, the day-to-day manager of John McCain's campaign who is now under scrutiny for his past association with two troubled mortgage companies, has been steeped in Republican presidential politics for nearly 30 years.</p> <p>Davis is a veteran of Ronald Reagan's 1980 and 1984 presidential campaigns and worked in Reagan's White House from 1985 to 1987. In 1988, he helped George Bush Sr's campaign coordinate debates, and managed the 1996 Republican convention for Bob Dole.</p> <p>With that experience, Davis was a sought-after commodity in the run-up to the 2000 race, the most open presidential election in years. He rebuffed offers to work for Dole's wife and North Carolina senator Elizabeth Dole, and early on linked up with McCain, who tapped him to run a committee tasked with gauging support for a White House bid. When McCain officially announced his presidential run late 1999, he named Davis campaign manager.</p> <p>After McCain's first Oval Office run collapsed following primary losses to President Bush, Davis remained close to McCain, serving as chairman of a political action committee the senator founded.</p> <p>In 2001, he was tapped to head the Homeownership Alliance, an advocacy group formed by government-sponsored mortgage company Fannie Mae. The group's goal was to fend off restrictions on its business sought by big banks. Davis's association with the company is at odds with McCain's effort to portray himself as a reformer set to clean up the financial services industry.</p> <p>Along with Paul Manafort, another seasoned Republican presidential strategist, Davis owns Davis Manafort, a consulting firm that has taken in $2.4m since 1999 to lobby the Senate on behalf of telecommunications firms, technology companies and other interests. The company has done consulting work for Fredie Mac. </p> <p>Last summer, Davis was made manager of McCain's campaign after flagging fundraising and support in the polls led the senator to shake up his top staff.</p> <p>Davis began his career in Republican politics in 1979 as a top field operative for the College Republicans. He then worked for the Republican party as a political director overseeing the southern states. After helping a Republican win a Virginia Senate seat in 1981, Davis joined Reagan's team.</p>",
  "<p>A consulting firm owned by John McCain's campaign manager accepted large fees from a mortgage company at the centre of the financial crisis ripping through Wall Street, according to reports today.</p> <p>A firm led by Rick Davis, a long-time McCain aide and chief of the Republican candidate's day-to-day campaign, received payments totalling $500,000 between the end of 2005 and last month from Freddie Mac, according to the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/24/us/politics/24davis.html?ex=1379995200&amp;en=c683f46019847144&amp;ei=5124&amp;partner=permalink&amp;exprod=permalink\">New York Times</a> and others this morning. </p> <p>The reports appear to directly contradict comments by McCain at the weekend. Asked in an interview about ties between Davis and the mortgage giants, McCain responded that Davis, \"has had nothing to do with it since, and I'll be glad to have his record examined by anybody who wants to look at it\".</p> <p>Freddie Mac was taken over by the federal government this month, along with fellow mortgage giant Fannie Mae, as credit markets froze and threatened the health of the US economy.</p> <p>McCain and Barack Obama have sparred over ties to lobbying firms and financial institutions caught up in the Wall Street turmoil. Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae both had long histories of aggressive lobbying to fend off government restrictions on their business.</p> <p>The McCain campaign has run advertisements saying Obama takes housing advice from Frank Raines, a former Fannie Mae chief executive, a link the Obama campaign denies.</p> <p>Citing two anonymous sources, the New York Times said Davis did not do much work for Freddie Mac, other than to address a meeting of high-level employees in October 2006, and was paid $15,000 per month. Davis took a leave from his company, Davis Manafort, to work for McCain's presidential campaign, but as an owner still holds an equity stake in the firm.</p> <p>Today, Davis skipped a regular luncheon with reporters sponsored by the Christian Science Monitor newspaper, the Chicago Sun-Times reported.</p> <p>A top aide to the Obama campaign this morning suggested that Freddie Mac had paid Davis merely to gain access to McCain. \"It is now clear that both John McCain and Rick Davis did not tell the truth about Davis's continuing financial relationship with Freddie Mac, one of the actors at the centre of this financial crisis,\" said Dan Pfeiffer, communications director to the campaign. \"It's troubling not only that Davis's firm\u2014with which he is still associated and which the McCain campaign paid directly last year\u2014continued to be compensated by Freddie Mac until as recently as last month, but that the firm did little work and apparently was being paid simply to provide access to the McCain campaign.\"</p> <p>On Monday, the New York Times reported that Davis received an additional $30,000 to $35,000 per month as president of the Homeownership Alliance, an organisation controlled by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac aimed at combating government efforts to restrict their business. When that organisation dissolved, Freddie Mac began paying Davis Manafort.</p> <p>The McCain campaign did not dispute the payments to Davis Manafort, but this morning released a long attack on the legitimacy of the New York Times article.</p> <p>\"Today the New York Times launched its latest attack on this campaign in its capacity as an Obama advocacy organization,\" the statement began. </p> <p>It continued: \"Therefore this 'report' from the New York Times must be evaluated in the context of its intent and purpose. It is a partisan attack falsely labelled as objective news. And its most serious allegations are based entirely on the claims of anonymous sources, a familiar yet regretful tactic for the paper.\"</p>",
  "<p>When the McCain campaign released the bad news it had accumulated in its post-haste vetting of Sarah Palin, it did so all at once, during the holiday weekend at the end of last month. They chose this strategy, as <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/02/us/politics/02assess.html\">one key campaign adviser promised a New York Times reporter</a>, \"to flush the toilet.\"</p> <p>And what a toilet it is. Just to pick one of the examples that actually relates to the issue of Palin's mode of governance \u2013 the ostensible reason she was chosen to be a heartbeat away from the presidency by a man with a 72-year-old ticker \u2013 is to enter a political and ethical looking-glass that makes Whitewater-era Arkansas appear to be a mirage of high-minded, almost Platonic public service. But while Whitewater obsessed Washington's journalists for almost a decade and led ultimately to the impeachment of an enormously popular president, 2008's version of <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/id/2200414\">Troopergate</a> has failed to inspire much in the way of outrage or even media interest.</p> <p>Despite any number of attempts to obscure them, the <a href=\"http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5iT8pcyCcfWAEBpugJsgWD1CRsgSgD93AJUD00\">facts of the matter</a>, while complicated, are also clear. Last July, Palin demanded of Alaska's public safety commissioner, Walt Monegan - whom she had appointed to the job - that he fire her ex-brother-in-law, Mike Wooten, from his post as a state trooper. (Wooten was, at the time, in divorce proceedings with the governor's sister.) A formal investigation of Wooten was undertaken, with the result that he was briefly suspended from his job - a punishment that did little to satisfy Palin. At one point Monegan felt forced to warn the governor's husband Todd Palin: \"You can't head-hunt like this. What you need to do is back off, because if the trooper does make a mistake, and it is a terminable offense, it can look like political interference.\"</p> <p>Unable to get what she wanted, Sarah Palin fired Monegan, without offering much in the way of a cause or an explanation. Monegan soon fought back with his story of public pressure over a private matter. The apparent capriciousness of Palin's action led to an <a href=\"http://www.newsminer.com/news/2008/jul/28/lawmakers-formally-call-investigation-palins-publi/\">investigation by a bipartisan panel</a> in Alaska's legislature. At that point, Palin complained that Monegan had not been a \"team player on budgeting issues,\" and created <a href=\"http://blogs.tnr.com/tnr/blogs/the_stump/archive/2008/09/23/ap-palin-abuses-power-in-abuse-of-power-inquiry.aspx\">her own investigation</a> inside the Alaska attorney-general's office.</p> <p>This <a href=\"http://tpmmuckraker.talkingpointsmemo.com/2008/09/palin_under_fire_at_home_for_t.php\">backfired</a>, however, when the attorney-general's office found that Palin's record was at odds with her public statements. In fact, members of her staff had sought Wooten's firing and - according to a recent report in the Washington Post - both Palin and her husband personally participated in the campaign to oust him.</p> <p>The Palins' <a href=\"http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2008/09/i-call-for-the.html\">new tactic</a> appears to be to try to shut down any investigation by virtue of <a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/09/19/palin.investigation/\">non-cooperation</a>. Key witnesses have ignored subpoenas, including the Palins themselves. They have attacked Monegan both personally and politically. As the <a href=\"http://www.adn.com/opinion/story/529587.html\">Anchorage Daily News complained</a>: \"Palin and McCain are trying to ignite a partisan firestorm that wipes out the Troopergate investigation until after the [presidential] election.\"</p> <p>This may not be possible, as the Alaska legislature is <a href=\"http://www.time.com/time/politics/article/0,8599,1843678,00.html?imw=Y\">planning</a> to issue its report \u2013 as originally promised \u2013 by October 31. Whether this strategy of non-cooperation, disparagement and, by all appearances, dishonesty, will work as an effective cover-up strategy will depend on how interested the rest of the mainstream media remains in the story, and how well <a href=\"http://www.juneauempire.com/stories/092108/sta_334953142.shtml\">the McCain team's strategy</a> of attacking all media institutions works.</p> <p>It's hard to believe that America might actually be even more dishonestly, ineffectually and ideologically governed after January 20, 2009 than before it. But the Palin/Troopergate story, like so much of the tone and tenor of the McCain campaign post-nomination, offers ample evidence for just such a nightmare scenario.</p>",
  "<p>Mark this day down. Today \u2013 last night, actually \u2013 the New York Times and Roll Call reported (it's hard to see who was first) what may be the biggest political story of the campaign. How big? John McCain might have to fire his campaign manager. Big enough?</p> <p>The story is this. The lobbying firm of Rick Davis, the manager, was being paid $15,000 a month by Freddie Mac until last month. That fact is a direct contradiction of words McCain had spoken Sunday night. At that time, responding to a Times story being prepared for Monday's paper revealing that Davis had been the head of a lobbying consortium led by Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae until 2005, McCain said Davis had done no further work for either mortgage giant.</p> <p>Someone's lying \u2013 either Davis to McCain, or McCain to the public. I trust you see the problem here.</p> <p>The stories are <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/24/us/politics/24davis.html?pagewanted=1&amp;_r=1&amp;hp&amp;adxnnlx=1222254510-sUiaCiHGAJvqdIlpeo2v%20g\">here</a>, by David Kirkpatrick (whose reporting on this topic has been leading the way) and Jackie Calmes of the Times, and <a href=\"http://www.rollcall.com/news/28629-1.html?type=printer_friendly\">here</a>, by Tory Newmeyer of Roll Call. You should definitely read every word of both. I think after you do you'll agree that, depending on how big the pick-up is today and how hard the Obama camp presses this, it's pretty difficult to see how Davis can stay on as campaign manager. </p> <p>The revelations are devastating for two reasons. First, as I noted above, either Davis lied to McCain or McCain lied to the voters. From the Times story:</p> <blockquote> <p>On Sunday, in an interview with CNBC and The Times, Mr. McCain responded to a question about that tie between Mr. Davis and the two mortgage companies by saying that he \"has had nothing to do with it since, and I'll be glad to have his record examined by anybody who wants to look at it.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Who lied to whom? This is the kind of thing we might not know for a while, or maybe never. My hunch would be that Davis concealed it from McCain and that McCain, as is his wont, just winged it Sunday night, without really caring whether it was true, because that's what he does. But let me clearly label that a hunch. I don't know. But it doesn't really matter.</p> <p>The second reason this is devastating is maybe even bigger than the question of the Sunday lie, which is limited in scope after all to a sort of narrow legal question. The second reason is that McCain has been going around putting lobbyists, specifically for F &amp; F, at the heart of the whole problem. This is from the Roll Call piece:</p> <blockquote> <p>Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac emerged as issues in the presidential race last week because of turmoil in the financial markets. In a radio address from Green Bay, Wis., on Saturday, McCain blamed the companies and their political clout for creating the housing mess now roiling Wall Street. \"At the center of the problem were the lobbyists, politicians and bureaucrats who succeeded in persuading Congress and the administration to ignore the festering problems at Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac,'' he said. \"Using money and influence, they prevented reforms that would have curbed their power and limited their ability to damage our economy. And now, as ever, the American taxpayers are left to pay the price for Washington's failure.''</p> </blockquote> <p>I just can't picture any way of wiggling out of that. He is talking in those sentences about his own campaign manager! And he's going to be able to keep him on? Strange things happen all the time, but I have trouble seeing it.</p> <p>Oh and by the way: No wonder Steve Schmidt, another top McCain strategist, said on a Monday conference call with reporters that \"Whatever The New York Times once was, it is today not by any standard a journalistic organization.\" He obviously knew that more was coming and was trying to lay some discrediting groundwork.</p> <p>This is a terrible, terrible story for McCain, and yes, the biggest political story of the general-election campaign so far.<br></p>",
  "<p>The crucial byelection in Scotland which will provide the next big test of Gordon Brown's leadership is expected to be held on November 6, it emerged today.</p> <p>No official announcement has been made on the date for the poll in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/glenrothes\">Glenrothes</a>, but party activists have been told to gear up for an election on November 6.</p> <p>By calling it in November, two days after the US presidential elections, Brown has left the election until the last possible moment.</p> <p>The convention is that a byelection should be called within three months of the seat becoming vacant.</p> <p>The byelection was triggered by the death of sitting MP John MacDougall on August 13 after he was diagnosed last year with the asbestos-related cancer mesothelioma.</p> <p>The party will be hoping for a bounce following a successful party conference which is widely seen as having succeeded in allaying Brown's critics within the party who want a leadership contest.</p> <p>Recent opinion polls suggest <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour\">Labour</a> will face a tough battle to retain the seat, where it holds a10,664 majority.</p> <p>The Independent reported today that a poll had put support for the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/snp\">Scottish nationalists</a> in the constituency at 50%, compared to 34% for Labour.</p> <p>Labour has chosen Lindsay Roy, the headmaster at Gordon Brown's old school in Fife as its candidate for the byelection.</p> <p>Activists said today they feared there could be a backlash from last week's shock decision for Halifax Bank of Scotland to be taken over by Lloyds TSB.</p> <p>Many HBOS employees who live in the Glenrothes constituency are among those waiting to hear about any job losses caused by the takeover.</p> <p>Scotland Office minister Ann McKechin said Labour faces a \"difficult fight\" in the byelection, which comes in the wake of Labour's defeat by the SNP in Glasgow East, but insisted the party was \"not pessimistic\".</p> <p>McKechin told BBC Radio Scotland's Good Morning Scotland that Labour was \"out to win\" in any byelection and pledged that they would be \"fighting for every single vote in the coming weeks\".</p> <p>She added: \"We don't take any vote for granted, and it is going to be a difficult fight, but we are certainly not pessimistic about it.</p> <p>\"We believe we have an excellent candidate. It will be an issue about who is the best candidate and who has got the best policies.\"</p> <p>A separate ICM poll published by the Mail on Sunday over the weekend also suggested that the SNP has wiped out Labour's majority in the constituency, situated next door to Brown's Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath seat.</p> <p>The two parties both had 43% of the vote, placing them neck and neck, according to the poll. It showed that Labour's majority of 10,664 at the 2005 general election has plummeted with a 14% swing.</p> <p>When asked how they would vote if the Glenrothes byelection was a vote of confidence in him as prime minister, 44% of those questioned chose the SNP, compared with 41% for Labour.</p> <p>The poll asked who had the best answers to Scotland's problems, with the SNP scoring 36% while Labour's rating was 17%.</p> <p>But Sunday's poll was conducted ahead of Brown's address to the party conference yesterday, which was well received by Labour MPs and party activists.</p> <p>Peter Grant, leader of Fife Council, will fight the seat for the SNP.</p> <p>McKechin said: \"We will be closely examining Mr Grant, who is the leader of Fife council, a council which has increased by enormous proportion charges for the elderly and disabled, and who proposes with his party to introduce a local income tax which we believe will really impact incredibly harshly on people in Glenrothes and that's what we will be setting out in our attack.\"</p> <p>But an SNP spokesman retorted: \"Labour has learnt nothing from their defeat in Glasgow East.</p> <p>\"What the 30,000 people in Fife who are at risk of fuel poverty this winter want to hear is why there will be no windfall to help with their fuel bills.\"</p> <p>He went on: \"Peter Grant is an excellent candidate who has already delivered improvements for Fife, turning around Fife council and freezing the council tax to put more money in people's pockets.</p> <p>\"With 56% of people in Glenrothes saying it is the SNP that has the answers for Scotland, it's clear Fifers know now that it's the SNP that is on their side.\"</p>",
  "<p>It was another strange day in this ever more strange election campaign, with the focus split between New York and Washington, and the presidential candidates playing a decidedly marginal role. On Capitol Hill, treasury secretary Henry Paulson <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/sep/24/wallstreet.georgebush\">continued to try to sell the Bush administration's bailout plan</a> to an angry Congress, whose members pressured him to toughen it up, while at the United Nations the president <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/sep/24/georgebush.usa\">added lines on the economy to his speech</a>. He didn't get much of a reception: fewer than 10 seconds of polite applause - and a \"thumbs-down\" gesture from Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, the president of Iran, whose own speech was a typically anti-Bush and anti-Israel affair. </p> <p>Barack Obama, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/sep/24/uselections2008.barackobama\">engaged in intensive debate preparation in Florida</a>, surfaced to condemn Ahmadinejad's \"outrageous remarks\", and also Bush's \"my-way-or-the-highway intransigence\" on the bailout. John McCain, meanwhile, once again played second fiddle to his running-mate, Sarah Palin, who met the heads of state of Afghanistan and Colombia, and Henry Kissinger, in New York. </p> <p>The McCain/Palin campaign engaged in a brief spat with the written press, which it initially tried to exclude from covering her handshakes with the world leaders, before eventually relenting. But the next round in McCain's war with the media seemed likely to be far more vicious: late last night, the New York Times reported on its website that a firm owned by McCain's campaign manager, Rick Davis, had <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/24/us/politics/24davis.html?_r=1&amp;hp&amp;oref=slogin\">received payments of $15,000 a month until last month</a> from Freddie Mac, one of the mortgage giants implicated in the current economic crisis, in contradiction to the campaign's claims. </p> <h2>What to watch out for</h2> <p>McCain and Palin remain in New York today, while Obama is in Florida, preparing for Friday's debate, which is expected to receive the highest television audience for a political debate in history. Palin will meet Katie Couric, for an interview to be broadcast on tonight's CBS Evening News; despite her friendly exterior, Couric has been known to lob tough questions at her interviewees. </p> <h2>Latest polls</h2> <p>Obama remains just ahead in most daily tracking polls: for example, <a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/poll/110608/Gallup-Daily-Obama-Holds-3Point-Edge.aspx\">Gallup has him at 47% to 44%</a>, down from 48% to 44% yesterday. A <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/09/23/AR2008092303667.html?hpid=topnews\">Washington Post/ABC poll puts Obama nine points ahead of McCain</a>, attributing his lead to turmoil in the financial industry (just 9% of those polled rate the US economy as good or excellent, the first time this figure has been in single digits since before the 1992 election). A new Pew poll meanwhile gives Obama a huge lead as the candidate voters consider best able to address the financial crisis: 47% to McCain's 35%. But a majority of those questioned backed the US government's bailout plan nonetheless. </p> <h2>On theguardian.com now</h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/michaeltomasky/2008/sep/24/johnmccain.republicans\">Tomasky Talk: War breaks out between McCain and the media</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2008/sep/23/uselections2008.useconomy\">Sasha Abramsky: Republican's can't distract attention from the economic crisis</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/sep/24/energy.uselections2008\">Obama declares support for clean coal</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/sep/24/uselections2008.johnmccain\">McCain drives into trouble over fleet of foreign cars</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/uselectionroadtrip/2008/sep/23/uselections2008\">Road trip blog: Washington's Orwellian wonderland</a></p> <h2>Best of the rest</h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0908/13823.html\">Politico: Palin continues to dodge the media horde</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122221440058969313.html\">Thomas Franks: Judgement day for McCain</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://firstread.msnbc.msn.com/archive/2008/09/23/1436850.aspx\">MSNBC First Read: Cost of the bailout (in perspective)</a></p> <h2>Quote of the day</h2> <p>\"What is his name?\" </p> <p>\"Mirwais, which means 'The Light of the House'.\" </p> <p>\"Oh nice\" - the only recorded exchange between Sarah Palin and Afghanistan's Hamid Karzai at the UN yesterday.

  "<p><strong>\"Is there any relationship (over a number of seasons) between teams in the 'Big Four' winning games against each other and their final places in the league table?\"</strong> wonders Andrew Webster. <strong>\"It seems to me that the ability to win away at Stoke, Wigan or Fulham might be more important in terms of title aspirations than whether you win or draw at Old Trafford, Stamford Bridge, etc.\"</strong></p> <p>This was (briefly) mentioned in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/audio/2008/sep/22/footballweekly\">Football Weekly</a> this week, though we didn't have a clue to the answer. So, not for the first time, it's left to the Knowledge to clear the issue up.</p> <p>So taking the 2002-03 season as the dawn of the Big Four era (with nods to Newcastle and Everton who broke into the elite group in 2003 and 2005 respectively), here are the standings:</p> <p><strong>2002/03</strong><br><strong>PREMIER LEAGUE:</strong> Man U 83pts, Arsenal 78, Chelsea 67, Liverpool 64<br><strong>BIG FOUR LEAGUE:</strong> Man U 14pts, Arsenal 7, Liverpool 5, Chelsea 5</p> <p><strong>2003/04</strong><br><strong>PREMIER LEAGUE:</strong> Arsenal 90pts, Chelsea 79, Man U 75, Liverpool 60<br><strong>BIG FOUR LEAGUE:</strong> Arsenal 14pts, Chelsea 7, Man U 6, Liverpool 6</p> <p><strong>2004/05<br>PREMIER LEAGUE:</strong> Chelsea 95pts, Arsenal 83, Man U 77, Liverpool 58<br><strong>BIG FOUR LEAGUE:</strong> Chelsea 14pts, Man U 12, Arsenal 5, Liverpool 3</p> <p><strong>2005/06</strong><br><strong>PREMIER LEAGUE:</strong> Chelsea 91pts, Man U 83, Liverpool 82, Arsenal 67<br><strong>BIG FOUR LEAGUE:</strong> Chelsea 15pts, Man U 11, Liverpool 4, Arsenal 4</p> <p><strong>2006/07</strong><br><strong>PREMIER LEAGUE:</strong> Man U 89pts, Chelsea 83, Liverpool 68, Arsenal 68<br><strong>BIG FOUR LEAGUE:</strong> Arsenal 14pts, Man U 11, Liverpool 6, Chelsea 5</p> <p><strong>2007/08</strong><br><strong>PREMIER LEAGUE:</strong> Man U 87pts, Chelsea 85, Arsenal 83, Liverpool 76<br><strong>BIG FOUR LEAGUE:</strong> Man U 13pts, Chelsea 10, Arsenal 6, Liverpool 4</p> <p>Pick the bones out of that. Well, it seems clear that the games between the Big Four <em>do</em> matter. In three of the last six seasons, the Big Four mini-league is the exact match of the final Premier League table, and in five of the six seasons the winner of the mini-league has gone on to take the title.</p> <p>The only anomaly comes in 2006-07 when Arsenal romped to the mini-league title but finished fourth in the real thing. Ars\u00e8ne Wenger's side's success at Old Trafford and victories over Liverpool and United at the Emirates were offset by the points dropped against West Ham, Middlesbrough and co. </p> <p>And no side has won the title having finished lower than second in the head-to-head contest. The overall theme is fairly emphatic, therefore - win the Big Four clashes to win the Premier League title. Looks like Liverpool are a good bet for the championship this year, then.</p> <p><strong>SHAMELESS PLUG ALERT</strong></p> <p>Coming soon, <a href=\"http://www.guardianbooks.co.uk/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/product_10401_25501_132806_100_38603_38603_category_\">The Knowledge</a> in book form, a collection of our favourite questions and answers from the past eight years.</p> <p><strong>PHILANTHROPIC FOOTBALLERS (3)</strong></p> <p>Philanthropy may not be a word that most footballers can spell, but it seems that many more of them than you would expect are familiar with its practice. Not content with the Robin Hood-style exploits of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2008/sep/10/clubstellingporkies\">Damiano Tommasi</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2008/sep/16/philanthropic.footballers\">Niall Quinn and others</a>, Ozzy Herries has drawn our attention to the blue half of Sheffield's most beloved altruist. </p> <p>\"Niall Quinn is famous for having donated his 2002 testimonial proceeds to a children's hospital, and fair play to him for doing it,\" says Ozzie. \"But I think David Hirst did exactly the same thing in 2000. About time the lad got some credit for it.\"</p> <p>Hirst, whose career was cut short by injury, donated 30% of the proceeds from his testimonial to the Sheffield Children's Hospital Appeal. \"I was fortunate to achieve just about all my goals as a player - pulling on an England shirt and playing in an FA Cup final at Wembley - and I wanted to give something back,\" Hirst said. </p> <p>Stephen D'Arcy is championing the causes of George Weah who, he says, is \"regularly funding work in his native Liberia\", and Craig Bellamy, \"who gave \u00a3500,000 of his own money to fund schools in Sierra Leone\". Bellamy may not be popular in the Cardiff nightclubs, but try telling that to the hundreds of children who will be receiving education and playing football thanks to the hard endeavour of the <a href=\"http://craigbellamyfoundation.org/\">Craig Bellamy Foundation</a>, in which the West Ham striker invested \u00a3650,000 to get off the ground. </p> <p>Former AC Milan striker Weah, as Stephen rightly points out, has spent years working for humanitarian causes in his home country investing huge amounts of his own money in the people and the children of the area. He also ran in the 2005 Liberian presidential election. Amazingly, the country voted for Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf instead who, we're pretty sure, has never <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMnR1QM5Te4\">dribbled past 147 people</a> to score at the San Siro.</p> <p><strong>PROS AT PUB TEAMS (5)</strong></p> <p>The seemingly relentless flow of offerings on the subject of professional footballers turned pub players continues. The latest contribution comes all the way from Ontario, where Jimmy Hamilton's local team, Streetsville Meadowvale Thistle FC, has twice hosted star opposition. </p> <p>\"We had our annual tournament and the local German lads, Scwharz Weiss FC from Milton, Ontario, pitched up with a pretty handy guest player - Dave Watson, the Sunderland and Manchester City defender who won 61 England caps. The guy was real gent and a great time was had by all. I think it was in 1989.</p> <p>\"We also had another brush with greatness when Grzegorz Lato, who won 104 caps for Poland and won the golden boot at the 1974 World Cup, played in our indoor league. This was also in the 80s.\" Who said the 80s were all about big hair and solving Rubik's cubes?</p> <p><strong>KNOWLEDGE ARCHIVE</strong></p> <p><strong>\"After seeing the Chelsea mascot ribbing Steven Gerrard the other day, I was wondering if a child mascot or ballboy has ever been sent off during a professional game?\"</strong> wondered Glenn Ashcroft back in 2006.</p> <p>Look no further than Real Betis's recent La Liga game at home to Atl\u00e9tico Madrid, Glenn. With Betis clinging to a 1-0 advantage as the game entered six minutes of added-time, referee Miguel \u00c1ngel Ayza G\u00e1mez became incensed by the ballboys refusing to return the ball (allegedly following orders from club officials). After the Atl\u00e9tico players complained, Ayza G\u00e1mez's patience eventually wilted, brandishing red cards to all 14 of them. It does appear that Betis have previous, though. Following Chelsea's 1-0 Champions League defeat at the Manuel Ruiz de Lopera earlier this season, Jose Mourinho claimed that strange things began happening once his side fell behind. \"The ballboys disappeared, making it very difficult for us,\" he said.</p> <p>But these are not the only cases of badly-behaved youngsters. In 2001, a Ghanaian touchline helper ran on during a game to attack the referee, while a pint-sized pitchside pest provoked Malaga defender Vicente Valcarce into hitting him in the same year. When he was in charge of Brazil, Luis Felipe Scolari was known to order ballboys to throw spare balls on to the pitch when his side held a narrow lead late in the game. And while the Knowledge can't find any official confirmation of the incident, it is believed a ballboy was sent off during a game between Bristol City and Notts County at Ashton Gate several years ago, when he cheekily began offering one of the visiting players some 'words of wisdom'.</p> <p>For much more sepia-tinged questions and answers, why not visit <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/series/theknowledge\">the Knowledge archive</a>.</p> <p><strong>Can you help?</strong></p> <p>\"I'm a Kilmarnock fan and our management duo of Jim Jeffries and Billy Brown have just signed a new contract,\" writes Stephen Black. \"They have worked together as manager and assistant manager at five different clubs (Berwick Rangers, Falkirk, Hearts, Bradford &amp; Killie) for 20 seasons in total so far - does anyone know of any other pair in world football who have celebrated or went past their China Anniversary as boss and sidekick?\"</p> <p>\"The average age of the Arsenal starting XI last night was just 19,\" writes Ryan Banks. \"Does that make them the youngest professional side ever?\"</p> <p>Send your questions and answers to <a href=\"mailto:knowledge@theguardian.com\">knowledge@theguardian.com</a></p>"

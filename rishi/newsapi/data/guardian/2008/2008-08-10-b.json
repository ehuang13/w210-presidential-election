  "<p>Robert Mugabe and Morgan Tsvangirai were locked in make-or-break talks last night over how power will be distributed in a coalition government aimed at ending Zimbabwe's deepening political and economic crisis. </p> <p>The two sides have reached broad agreement that Mugabe will remain president and Tsvangirai will be prime minister at the head of a large cabinet divided evenly between their two parties, but with a smaller opposition faction holding the balance of posts.</p> <p>Sources close to the talks, mediated by South Africa's president, Thabo Mbeki, said there remained significant differences over key issues that will decide whether Mugabe retains real control of the government, in effect overturning Tsvangirai's victory in the March presidential election. </p> <p>Mbeki was pushing for an agreement that would not only resolve Zimbabwe's crisis but permit him to claim that his strategy of quiet diplomacy, derided in the west as a failure, was ultimately successful.</p> <p>In June, Mbeki proposed that Mugabe remain as a titular president, after 28 years in total control, with executive powers transferred to Tsvangirai as prime minister. Mugabe went into yesterday's meeting determined not to cede most of his powers, while Tsvangirai argued that he won a mandate to govern from the people in the March election - the last one widely considered to be largely legitimate. </p> <p>Tsvangirai's Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) said before the talks that while it would accept Mugabe in a ceremonial role, if he were to retain significant powers it would reward his Zanu-PF party's campaign of killings, beatings, abductions and rapes that broke opposition support in a second round of elections in June.</p> <p>Among the other issues in dispute is the composition of the cabinet. Mugabe wants it to have 36 ministers, with Zanu-PF and the MDC holding 15 seats each and the remaining six held by a breakaway faction of the MDC headed by Arthur Mutambara. Tsvangirai wants a smaller cabinet and Mutambara to have only two seats. </p> <p>Zanu-PF is keen for a large number of cabinet seats in part because party leaders see sitting in government as a means of perpetuating their patronage and ensuring they are not prosecuted for past crimes. </p> <p>There is also wrangling over who will hold the most powerful portfolios. The MDC is anxious to control the ministries that oversee the police and intelligence services, believing that they are the key to ensuring that future elections are free and fair after the two organisations were roped in to the violent and bloody state-orchestrated campaign against opposition supporters. </p> <p>Tsvangirai is less concerned about winning control over the army, which the opposition believes will be loyal to the government of the day.</p> <p>The two parties also disagree over how long the incoming administration will serve. The MDC wants it to sit for about two years, during which a new constitution will be written and elections held. </p> <p>Zanu-PF favours a government serving a full five-year term, in part because if another ballot is held in the near future the party is likely to suffer a devastating defeat, while several years from now Zimbabweans may be less enamoured of the MDC, after they have seen it in power. </p> <p>Tsvangirai holds a number of important cards in the talks. There will be no significant financial aid from the west to stabilise Zimbabwe's economy amid hyperinflation expected to rise to 50,000,000% this month, without a significant shift in power to the MDC leader. Britain, the US and the EU have all said that a \u00a31bn aid package will only be released if Mugabe relinquishes control of the government.</p> <p>It could also be argued that Mbeki needs an agreement as much as Tsvangirai in order to justify his much-criticised Zimbabwe policy and regain some of his rapidly eroding political credibility at home. </p> <p>Some of those who have backed Tsvangirai fear he may be desperate to become prime minister and give too much away. </p> <p>The Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions, which Tsvangirai once headed and which gave birth to the MDC, has criticised the fact that negotiations take place behind closed doors with only political parties present. It said the talks should \"reflect the will of the people of Zimbabwe and not self-seeking, power-sharing agendas\".</p> <p>\"Zimbabwe is not made up of supporters of Zanu-PF and MDC alone, but a plethora of groupings which have to be consulted if the process is to gain wider acceptance by the majority,\" it said last month when talks were announced.</p> <h2>Backstory</h2> <p>Zimbabwe's political negotiations come against a background of <strong>rapid economic collapse</strong>, driven by hyper-inflation, which brought large parts of the country to the brink of starvation. The government officially puts <strong>inflation</strong> at 2,200,000% but economists say that it was closer to 10,000,000% last month and they estimate it will rise to about 50,000,000% in August. This month, the central bank removed 10 zeros from the Zimbabwe dollar because rapid <strong>devaluation</strong> had dragged it to Z$1.5tn to the pound. The currency has continued to implode, losing half of its value in a week. The World Food Programme warned that up to 5.1 million Zimbabweans - nearly one third of the population - will need <strong>food aid</strong> this year because the economic crisis and the redistribution of formerly white-owned farms has led to a collapse in crop production.</p>",
  "<p>Police investigations, commissions of inquiry examining the errors committed during the Lebanon war of 2006, repugnance at former president <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moshe_Katsav\">Moshe Katsav</a>'s alleged sex crimes, and now prime minister Ehud Olmert's announcement that, with charges of corruption swirling about him, he will resign in September: all of this suggests profound wounds in Israel's moral tissue. </p> <p>Old Israelis like myself are stupefied by the scope and scale of today's corruption and the multiplying investigations. Is corruption something that has always existed here but was somehow hidden until now? Are we learning of it because our prosecutor and police are bolder and better equipped nowadays? </p> <p>I do not believe that corruption is coming to light just because law enforcement is somehow better, or because citizens, like the presidential staff who accused President Katsav of sexual crimes and harassment, are more courageous. What is coming to light is a much deeper evil, a loss of values within Israeli society and its government, such as never existed before. </p> <p>This moral deterioration is most prominent in the behaviour of today's accused, who are much more impudent and aggressive than in the past. I remember how in the 1970's, when suspicion of corruption arose with respect to a Labour party minister, the minister took his own life. So did a director of a great bank, a brilliant economist, when he was suspected of financial crimes. </p> <p>When <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinchas_Sapir\">Pinchas Sapir</a>, prime minister Golda Meir's finance minister died, all that he owned was a modest apartment in Tel Aviv and some small savings. David Ben Gurion, Israel's founder and most prominent political personality, spent the last 11 years of his life living in a little wooden house in the desert kibbutz Sde Boker. Today, that house's extreme modesty still surprises visitors.<br> Former Prime Minister Menachem Begin also lived until his death in a simple apartment in Tel Aviv. Not the smallest shadow of the slightest suspicion of corruption ever disturbed his peace. </p> <p>True, corruption has also become more common in other countries in recent years, and many democracies are stained by links between politics and finance. Economic interests are supplanting ideology as the motor of politics, and money serves as the key instrument in elections. But how is it that Israel, which only a few years ago was hardly touched by fraud and corruption, is now swept by them? </p> <p>The recent episodes of corruption, I believe, are rooted in the division, beginning in 1967, of two altogether distinct sets of norms and values. On the one hand, the moral and jurisdictional principles of the democratic state have continued to be applied in Israel in accordance with the tradition of the rule of law. On the other hand, in the Palestinian territories, a new system of values has been progressively established. </p> <p>These two systems operate side by side, but the border that separates them has gradually become more porous, and the open breaches in it have become ever greater. Unlike colonial states, in which colonisers came from distant metropolises (and only in small numbers) the Palestinian territories are just across the border from Israel. </p> <p>In the West Bank the organs of jurisdiction operate in a completely different way. Palestinian lands are illegally confiscated. Jewish settlers act outside the law and commit provocative acts harming Palestinians, rarely incurring any penal sanctions. Injustice and exploitation are an everyday occurrence, justified by references to security or the ideology of Greater Israel. </p> <p>The boundaries between the two types of legalities could not remain impenetrable forever. Little by little, the state of occupation, which should have been temporary, became a stable reality, and the policy of creating Israeli settlements in the heart of the Palestinian population strengthened the connection between Israel and the occupied territories. The norms of a colonial and militarist regime have begun to infiltrate the governing organs of Israel's democracy, perverting their proper activities. Politicians, functionaries, army officials \u2013 usually coming from the right \u2013 introduced into Israeli political life the disgraceful norms in force in the occupied territories. So corruption has grown. </p> <p>Fortunately, Israel's judicial system remains independent and rests on foundations of proven integrity. The presence of many women in the magistrature and the police has also contributed significantly, in my view, to reinforcing the system. But when inadmissible norms become tolerated in silence, even the strongest juridical system becomes destabilised. </p> <p>Nor should we forget that the global economy, with which Israel is deeply integrated, creates infinite and complex opportunities for financial crimes. </p> <p>In these conditions, a strong judicial system and police force do not always suffice to contain corruption. The support of public opinion is also needed. </p> <p>I have the impression that the latest disturbing allegations of corruption among politicians and state functionaries have awakened Israel's citizens from their stupor. They are now demanding that the rule of law and justice return to their central place in public life. Of course, the true test will be whether such demands are reflected in September's parliamentary election. </p> <p><strong>Copyright: <a href=\"http://www.project-syndicate.org\">Project Syndicate</a>, 2008.</strong></p>",
  "<p>Gallup daily tracking poll: <a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/poll/109348/Gallup-Daily-Obama-47-McCain-42.aspx\">Obama 47%, McCain 42%</a></p> <p>\"His diagnosis of narcissism was weirdly narcissistic,\" Maureen Dowd <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/10/opinion/10dowd.html\">correctly observes</a> about John Edwards's contrite-but-strange <a href=\"http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/usa/2008/08/99_honest_is_no_longer_enough.html\">admission</a> that he'd told extensive lies during his presidential campaign about his affair with Rielle Hunter. Hunter is described as a filmmaker, although as Sam Stein points out in <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/08/08/the-anatomy-of-the-edward_n_117852.html\">this authoritative piece</a>, the films she made for Edwards's campaign look in hindsight to have been little more than an excuse for keeping Hunter around on the team. (On several occasions in the videos, which later went mysteriously missing, \"one could detect flirting between Hunter and Edwards, including blatant shots of his crotch and rear end.\") Hunter <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/08/09/AR2008080901298.html?hpid=topnews\">has ruled out</a>, for the moment, a DNA test to determine the paternity of her child, but Stein reminds us that the official Edwards line -- that the father is Andrew Young, an Edwards campaign worker -- is shaky: \"Rumors began spreading from North Carolina - where Young continued to live with his wife and three children - that Mrs. Young was non-too-pleased that her husband had to fall on the sword. Moreover, she was talking about her displeasure to her friends in the local hair salon.\" Meanwhile, MSNBC <a href=\"http://mediamatters.org/items/200808080013\">comes under fire</a> for suggesting that the Edwards story is \"a skeleton in the Democratic closet\" that could damage Barack Obama.</p> <p>The military confrontation between Russia and Georgia spills into the presidential campaign, thanks largely to the fact that John McCain's senior foreign policy advisor is <a href=\"http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/usa/2008/07/peace_is_born_of_wisdom.html\">Randy Scheunemann</a>, until recently a lobbyist on behalf of the Georgian government and still a principal at his old lobbying firm, where Georgia's still a client. The Obama campaign has been pointing out that this might help explain McCain's <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0808/12409.html\">strikingly fierce anti-Russia line</a> on the conflict. The McCain campaign, in full insinuation mode, calls Obama \"bizarrely in sync with Moscow\". [<a href=\"http://tpmelectioncentral.talkingpointsmemo.com/2008/08/mccain_camp_obama_bizarrely_in.php\">TPM Election Central</a>]</p> <p>McCain's aides try to limit the time available in his schedule for making phone calls, due to his problematic habit of adopting the most recent opinion he hears. Would it be going too far to suggest that it's not a good sign when you have to stop your candidate talking to people?

On the plus side, this might demonstrate bipartisanship. On the minus side, it might further alienate the conservative Republican base. On the other minus side, watching Joe Lieberman speak makes people want to fall asleep.

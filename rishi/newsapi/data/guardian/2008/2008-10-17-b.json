  "<p>As the US presidential election reaches a climax against the background of the financial crisis, another silent, dark, time bomb of an issue hangs over the two candidates: torture. For now, there seems to be a shared desire not to delve too deeply into the circumstances in which the Bush administration allowed the US military and the CIA to embrace abusive techniques of interrogation - including waterboarding, in the case of the CIA - which violate the Geneva conventions and the 1984 UN torture convention. </p> <p>The torture issue's cancerous consequences go deep, and will cause headaches for the next president. New evidence has emerged in Congressional inquiries that throw more light on the extent to which early knowledge and approval of the abuse went to the highest levels. What does a country do when compelling evidence shows its leaders have authorised international crimes?</p> <p>For three years I have followed a trail which leads unambiguously to the conclusion that the real bad eggs were not Lyndie England or others on the ground in Abu Ghraib, but the most senior officials in the White House, the Pentagon and the department of justice. Over recent months, Congress has been looking into the role of senior officials involved in the development of interrogation rules. These have attracted relatively scant attention; little by little, however, senators and congressmen have uncovered the outlines of a potentially far-reaching criminal conspiracy. </p> <p>The first hearings were convened before the judiciary committee of the House of Representatives, at the instance of its chairman, Congressman John Conyers, apparently off the back of my book Torture Team. Parallel hearings have been held before the Senate armed services committee. </p> <p>The evidence that has emerged is potentially devastating. It confirms, for instance, that the search for new interrogation techniques for use at Guant\u00e1namo began not with the local military but in the offices of Donald Rumsfeld and his chief lawyer, Jim Haynes. It shows that when the career military expressed objections on legal grounds, Haynes intervened to stop the normal process of review. And it shows a previously unknown interplay between the department of defence and the CIA: a visit to Guant\u00e1namo in September 2002 by the administration's most senior lawyers was followed days later by a senior CIA lawyer, to brief on the new techniques. \"If someone dies while aggressive techniques are being used,\" he explained, \"the backlash of attention would be severely detrimental.\" </p> <p>Last month the Senate armed services committee received new material from Condoleezza Rice, the first cabinet-level official to confirm high-level involvement in discussions on interrogation techniques. \"I participated in a number of meetings in 2002 and 2003 ... at which issues relating to detainees in US custody, including interrogation issues, were discussed,\" she said. Those present at such meetings included Rumsfeld, attorney general John Ashcroft, Colin Powell, Paul Wolfowitz and CIA director George Tenet. The meetings, which concerned the CIA programme, \"occurred inside the White House\". Rice confirmed she was aware of the existence of, but did not read, the justice department legal advice of August 1 2002 that abandoned the international definition of torture and replaced it with a definition drawn from a US Medicare statute. </p> <p>Buried away in this testimony lies the most dangerous material of all: evidence which may establish that abuses on detainees in Iraq in September 2003, in the period perhaps including the events at Abu Ghraib, were the result of decisions taken at the highest levels of the administration. The administration has long proclaimed it did not allow aggressive interrogations in Iraq, since the Geneva conventions applied. Last month we learned this was false: not everyone had protection under Geneva. If you were considered to be a terrorist, you had no protection at all. A senior US intelligence officer visited Iraq in September 2003. He witnessed abusive interrogation techniques that violated Geneva and complained. The response? He was told the techniques \"were pre-approved by DoD GC or higher\". DoD GC is the general counsel at the department of defence, Jim Haynes. Who could be higher? His boss: Rumsfeld.</p> <p>I have testified before Congress on these issues, and have been asked if there should be criminal investigations and prosecutions. At the very least, the next US president must ensure the full facts are established. It will then be for others to decide what follows. But if the US doesn't get its own house in order and restore its reputation for the rule of law, others will surely step in. </p> <p>\u2022 Philippe Sands QC is professor of law at UCL, a barrister at Matrix Chambers and author of Torture Team <a href=\"http://mailto:p.sands@ucl.ac.uk\">p.sands@ucl.ac.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>With avenues to victory in the presidential race closing fast, Republicans are now laying the groundwork for casting doubt on the results. Prepare yourself for lurid tales, these next two-and-a-half weeks, of \"voter fraud\".</p> <p>Here's the situation. Turnout in America is lower than in other countries - we consider 55%-60% to be an achievement. The 40%-45% of Americans who do not vote, studies show, tend to be from lower-income and more African-American and Latino households than the general population. In other words, more Democratic.</p> <p>Hence, Democrats are forever trying to expand the electorate. In the past two years, they have registered huge numbers of voters in some important states. In Florida this year for example, Democrats have added about 450,000 voters, Republicans just 170,000.</p> <p>Republicans have always tried to suppress turnout, sometimes by fair means but often by foul. Every election season in black communities across the US, mysterious handbills appear warning citizens - untruthfully - that if they owe back taxes or even parking tickets, they can't vote. Voting machines have tended to \"malfunction\" on election day at a higher rate in black areas than in white. None of this, of course, is ever traceable.</p> <p>This is what we historically call voter suppression. Republicans, ever alert to opportunities to spoon-feed the media storylines proving that \"both sides\" are guilty of excess, have countered with narratives about voter fraud. But how real is voter fraud? It exists here and there, no doubt. But a study by a Columbia University found that between 2002 and 2005, the US justice department won just 24 successful voter-fraud convictions - in the entire country - during the same period that the department made such prosecutions a high priority. </p> <p>If this is a crime wave, we could do with many more like it.</p> <p>This year, with an African-American Democratic nominee and black turnout expected to hit record levels, the effort has gone into overdrive. One nationwide community organising group, Acorn, stands accused of all manner of fraudulent voter registration. The group acknowledges that some of its organisers did pad out their numbers. But it says it fired them. </p> <p>A few days ago the FBI leaked that it was investigating Acorn - interesting timing, no? A former federal prosecutor in New Mexico, a conservative Republican who was controversially fired by the Bush administration in large part because he did not see voter fraud as a major criminal enterprise, says the investigation smells to high heaven. \"I'm astounded that this issue is being trotted out again,\" he told the website Talking Points Memo on Thursday. \"Based on what I saw in 2004 and 2006, it's a scare tactic.\"</p> <p>It's that, all right, but it's more. Republicans are bracing themselves for a John McCain loss. They probably don't believe that \"exposing\" large-scale fraud can salvage the election for them. But they may well be thinking along other lines.</p> <p>Suppose Barack Obama wins, but a narrower victory than expected. Say he gets 284 electoral votes, and that 20 of those 284 come from Ohio. Since 270 are needed to win, Ohio will be the difference between victory and defeat. And suppose the Ohio vote is outside the margin that automatically triggers a recount, as was the case in Florida in 2000, but is still moderately close - 3% or so.</p> <p>You can bet in such a case that the Republicans will challenge the result. They will find a few cases of people voting from the wrong address. Their propagandists on the Fox News channel will follow. They likely won't prevail, but the effort will have the crucial effect of casting doubt on Obama's legitimacy and impinging on his mandate.</p> <p>The Obama people know all this, which is why they're working for a margin that would make such challenges moot. In the meantime, as you hear and read the sensational stories, remember the 24-person crime wave.</p>",
  "<p>Former secretary of state <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/colin-powell\">Colin Powell</a> is expected to use a high-profile television appearance tomorrow to end months of speculation by throwing his support behind <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/barackobama\">Barack Obama</a>.</p> <p>His decision to go on television just two weeks before the election suggests he has finally made up his mind.</p> <p>Powell, a four-star general who worked closely with three Republican presidents, said he would decide between Obama and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/johnmccain\">John McCain</a>, a long-time friend, after watching the presidential debates, the last of which was held on Wednesday.</p> <p>His endorsement would be the biggest Obama has secured so far. As a prominent member of President George Bush's administration, he may shift some Republican-leaning voters into Obama's camp.</p> <p>McCain's campaign team admitted privately it would be a blow, not least because it would be another day in which Obama dominated the news. But Democratic strategists are divide about the benefits. One said yesterday he was concerned it could backfire. He suggested that Powell's decision might be seen as being based on racial solidarity and that could alienate some white voters already reluctant to back Obama on grounds of race.</p> <p>The sceptical strategist added that Powell, though once so popular he was considered as a potential candidate for the White House, was badly tarnished by his involvement, as secretary of state, in making the case for Saddam Hussein having weapons of mass destruction.</p> <p>Powell, 71, who is to appear on NBC's Meet the Press, told a conference in Washington last month that he was undecided. \"I've said to my beloved friend and colleague, John McCain, a friend of 25 years - John, I love you - but I'm not just going to vote for you on the basis of our affection and friendship,\" Powell said.</p> <p>\"I've said to Barack Obama, I admire you, I'll give you all the advice I can, but I won't vote for you just because you're black. We have to move beyond this.\"</p> <p>Obama won the endorsement yesterday of the Washington Post. \"There are few public figures we have respected more over the years than Senator John McCain. Yet it is without ambivalence that we endorse Senator Barack Obama for president,\" the Post said.</p> <p>The newspaper said McCain had lost its support because of the way he conducted his campaign - singling out his choice of Sarah Palin as his running mate. The Post was the 40th newspaper to endorse Obama for president. So far McCain has the support of 15 newspapers.</p> <p>The presidential race continued to be transfixed by Joe the Plumber, the Ohio man invoked by McCain in this week's final debate as the symbol of what he claimed was Obama's \"class warfare\" against ordinary working people. Joe Wurzelbacher's 15 minutes of fame is now stretching into its third full day and shows no sign of abating.</p> <p>McCain organisers have been trying to get Wurzelbacher to appear alongside McCain at a campaign rally in Toledo, Ohio, tomorrow. But invitations to appear on the weekend's TV talkshows may prove more alluring. Though he has refused to say who will get his vote, Wurzelbacher's story has prompted a fiercely partisan reaction from the US media. </p> <p>Liberal bloggers focused on idiosyncracies in his personal details - the fact that he owes almost $1,200 in back taxes, that he has had no formal plumbing training and holds no licence, and that his full name is not Joe at all but Samuel J Wurzelbacher.</p> <p>Rightwing bloggers retaliated against what they called such smear-mongering. \"The left's political plumbers are attacking the messenger ... It's standard operating procedure for the Obama thug machine,\" wrote Michelle Malkin.</p> <p>In Pennsylvania on Thursday McCain told a rally that Wurzelbacher had been the real winner of the debate \"because people are not going to let Senator Obama raise taxes in a tough economy\", prompting chants of \"Joe! Joe! Joe!\" from the crowd.</p> <p>In New Hampshire, Obama asked supporters: \"How many plumbers do you know making a quarter of a million dollars a year?\"</p> <p>Meanwhile McCain's running mate, Sarah Palin, is taking her critics at first hand by appearing in Saturday Night Live. The entertainment show has been running a popularly parody of the Alaska governor by comedian Tina Fey.</p> <h2>The week</h2> <p><strong>Confession of the week</strong></p> <p>\"If I were watching Fox News, I wouldn't vote for me, right? Because the way I'm portrayed 24/7 is as a freak! I am the latte-sipping, New York Times-reading, Volvo-driving, no-gun-owning, effete, politically correct, arrogant liberal.

For the three weeks I have been in Roanoke we have talked politics together over the buffet most days.</p> <p>But yesterday was different. Barack Obama was coming to town, and Sam was going to be there. \"I've got to go,\" he said. \"That's going to be our next president.\"</p> <p>All over Roanoke people were making preparations. Meghan, an Obama volunteer, asked me what I thought she should wear. Students at Patrick Henry high school were discussing taking the day off. Three hours before Obama's scheduled appearance, hundreds of people were queuing in the rain. It seemed like almost everybody in town wanted to be there.</p> <p>It is a stark change from the day I arrived at the end of last month. Back then, the Dow index opened at 11,139, Obama and John McCain were tied in the polls in the state, and most local Democrats were still in the closet.</p> <p>Roanoke sits like a tiny Democratic island in a sea of staunch Republican waters. Culturally and economically the city dominates the region; but politically it is completely surrounded. Just three weeks ago, Obama supporters in a nearby town were asking the local Democratic campaign organiser not to reveal their affiliations publicly for fear of being ostracised.</p> <p>At Pop's Ice-cream and Soda Bar, patrons discussed their support for Obama in hushed tones until they spotted an Obama sign on the popcorn machine. \"Oh, it's OK,\" one said out loud. \"They have an Obama poster.\"</p> <p>When you asked black people if they thought whites in the state would support a black candidate they responded with a lengthy pause, and then equivocation. </p> <p>\"They should,\" said one woman after what seemed like an age. \"If they're paying attention.\"</p> <p>\"But do you think they actually will?\" I asked. Pause. \"I don't know,\" she said.</p> <p>As I prepared to leave the town yesterday, the Dow was down 25%, Obama was up in Virginia by 5% and Democrats were out and proud as Obama addressed a capacity crowd at the local civic centre.</p> <p>This gathering in confidence has been slow but definite. There was an art auction, Fine Art to Elect a Fine Man, which raised $4,100. Last weekend Bill Clinton visited the town. One night this week, more than 30 new volunteers showed up to the opening of a new campaign office just outside Roanoke.</p> <p>And, yesterday, the man himself - the first visit from a presidential candidate to Roanoke since JFK in 1960. In contrast, Republicans are still waiting for a high-profile visit. And it's not clear that they would be overjoyed to see McCain anyway. Most of the people I spoke to at a Republican vice-presidential debate-watching party had not voted for McCain in the primaries, but had been energised by the nomination of Sarah Palin.</p> <p><strong>Hard fight</strong><br>\"Republicans were OK with McCain, but not excited,\" explained James Mixon, sporting a badge saying \"Sarah!\" with the words \"McCain and Palin\" much smaller underneath. </p> <p>\"He's come on strong since then and by nominating Palin he's indicated to conservatives that he's serious.\"</p> <p>Republicans are not used to fighting this hard in Virginia - a state that has not voted Democrat in more than 40 years. One man confided that he believed McCain could not win the presidency if he didn't take the state. </p> <p>Roanoke is a pretty town, sitting in a valley between the Appalachians and the Blue Ridge mountains, divided by route 581 from north to south, the railroad tracks from east to west and by race and class throughout.</p> <p>Crudely speaking, the south-east is poor and white, the south-west is affluent and white, the north-west is black, and the north-east more of a mix.</p> <p>The same things that dominate the national political conversation play out locally, only differently. Economically, the area has never experienced the highs or lows of the national booms and busts. But they are still feeling it. The food bank has seen a 9% increase in those seeking assistance. Last week the state announced it would axe 1,400 jobs. The week before the nearby university, Virginia Tech, raised its tuition fees by 11%.</p> <p>Healthcare is also a big issue here. Once a railroad town, Roanoke is now dominated by the healthcare giant Carilion. Around 40% of the judgments in Roanoke general district court since 2003 have been brought by Carilion, chasing people who cannot pay their medical bills.</p> <p>David Crimmins is one of them. He was treated for a herniated disc 10 years ago and ended up with a $5,000 bill. Crimmins, who earns $15,000 a year, did not show up to court to challenge Carilion's action. </p> <p>\"I didn't see the point,\" he said. \"They're going to do whatever they want anyhow.\" The debt to Carilion was deducted from his wages until the company finally relented.</p> <p>The hospital is also deducting owed money from his sister's wages and his mother's pay packet. So many are the debt collection actions before the court that it sets aside one day a week just to deal with healthcare. They call it Carilion day.</p> <p>Otherwise, Democrats here are more likely to talk about the war, and Republicans more about tax, socialism and guns. With the registration deadline past, Democratic areas have seen at least double the increase in new voters compared with Republican areas. The task now is to get them out.</p> <p><strong>Mood shift</strong><br>And in some quarters, excitement at the possibility of Obama's election has been tinged with a sense of alienation from his campaign. Leaders in the black community believe the young, white out-of-town staffers are ignoring their local knowledge and connections which could result in an under-performance of the black vote. African Americans comprise a quarter of the city and a fifth of the state - Obama cannot win the city or the state without them.</p> <p>\"The older crowd just don't connect with a 20-year-old white person telling a 50-year-old black person what to do,\" said Onzlee Ware, the Virginia House delegate for Roanoke. \"Especially how to run their own communities. And then they get discouraged and go back to their communities.\"</p> <p>Ware said there was time to turn things round by election day. If there was a doubt in his mind about Obama winning, he was not showing it. </p> <p>It's a mark of the mood shift these last three weeks. The pauses are shorter. The polls show the Democrat nomination up. And yesterday lunchtime there were no whispered conversations at Pop's. The owners had shut up shop and gone to see Obama.</p> <h2><strong>Local Voices</strong></h2> <p>\u2022 <strong>Onzlee Ware</strong>, delegate to the Virginia legislature </p> <p>Ware is the most senior black politician in town. He is convinced that Obama will win. He said: \"The thing I like about this campaign is that America has said that there's an entire America. Not just a white male America. But a black America and a female America.\"</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Chelsea Shinneman</strong>, Obama volunteer </p> <p>Shinneman is not so much a volunteer for Obama as an evangelist for him. She devotes pretty much every waking hour when she's not working to the campaign, so much so that her voicemail message also gives the Obama <br>office number.</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>David Crimmins</strong>, painter </p> <p>David Crimmins, a painter, lives with his girlfriend, Melissa Hicks, who has never left Virginia, and their two boys. They want McCain to win. \"He's got the experience,\" he says. Hicks says she does not know why she does not like Obama but it is not because he is black.</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Anna Robertson</strong>, owner of Pop's Ice-cream and Soda Bar </p> <p>Robertson sends both her children to the local school, where half the pupils are black. \"People would ask me how I felt about my kids going to school in Roanoke as though the schools were really bad. The racial element of it is always unspoken. But it's there.\"</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on Thursday October 23 2008. The accidental removal of a zero led us to say that Virginia had not voted for a Democratic president for more than four years. That should have been 40 years. This has been changed.</p>",
  "<p>We know election day is approaching when Republicans start screaming about voter fraud, but the McCain campaign has reached a new low and the death rattle of the Republican party has entered its last violent spasm. At this week's debate John McCain accused the Association of Community Organisations for Reform Now (Acorn) of \"one of the greatest frauds in voter history in this country, maybe destroying the fabric of democracy\". His running mate, Sarah Palin, warned that they were trying to \"steal this election\". <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/14/uselections2008-republicans-acorn\">These kinds of allegations</a> are absurd and obviously false and the McCain campaign knows it. It is McCain himself that is damaging to our democracy because it calls into question the legitimacy of our election process in a deceitful way. </p> <p>Voter fraud and voter registration fraud are two different things and they are being deliberately conflated for political purposes. Voter fraud is simply bogus. Study after study, and major nationwide enforcement efforts by the department of justice and other enforcement agencies in the states have never, ever produced any evidence of anything more than a handful of cases, and I mean two or three, of actual voter fraud. The failure of many US attorneys to actually find cases of voter fraud to prosecute was the motivation for Karl Rove to push a scheme to fire nine of them and the resulting scandal ultimately led to attorney general <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/aug/27/usa.marktran\">Alberto Gonzalez's resignation</a>. </p> <p>Voter registration fraud is real, but the kinds of allegations about Acorn are actually frauds perpetrated on Acorn and not the political process. Organisations that engage in voter registration drives are required by law to submit every registration form that they receive, no matter how obviously fraudulent the information. That law is in place as an extremely important protection for the process so that organisations are not able to go on a mass registration drive and then throw out all the Republican registrants or Democratic registrants before they submit the forms to the state government. They have a responsibility to flag those forms that they believe are fraudulent or invalid, but they cannot disqualify them on their own. For example, <a href=\"http://www.acorn.org/\">Acorn</a> goes and registers 100,000 people in Ohio out of which they identify 5,000 registration forms that are clearly phony that they flag, but they have to turn them in anyway. Then Republicans go around spreading malicious stories about Acorn turning in thousands of fraudulent registrations, but they know Acorn is required by law to turn them in and they know that those registrants will never be added to the voter rolls.</p> <p>Acorn is uniquely susceptible to these kinds of problems because it engages in the questionable practice of paying its organisers by the number of people they register. I can understand why they do this \u2013 to give unemployed or low-income people a paying job \u2013 but it opens them up to fraud perpetrated on them by paying for sham registrations. They believe that the multi-layered system of first flagging questionable registration forms and then having the voting agencies provide further checks is adequate protection against actual fraudulent registrants ending up on the voter rolls and the benefits of helping these people earn a living outweigh these risks. </p> <p>The reason why voter registration fraud does not lead to actual voter fraud is that voter fraud is hard and voter registration fraud is usually very transparent. The charges flying around right now \u2013 people registering as Mickey Mouse, or a guy filling out 73 registration forms \u2013 are simply not credible as voter fraud. It would require us to believe that an election board would place Mickey Mouse on the rolls and poll workers would then allow someone to vote who is claiming to be Mickey Mouse, or to allow the same person to vote numerous times. That is just ridiculous and impossible to imagine occurring in the real world. </p> <p>For systemic voter fraud to occur, the organisers of such an effort would need hundreds if not thousands of people to participate in a massive conspiracy to show up at the polls claiming to be someone else (a felony) who had been fraudulently registered and placed on the rolls, they will often now need to have a government issue photo ID with that other person's information (another felony), then actually vote for the chosen candidate in a secret ballot, and then keep this massive clandestine conspiracy hidden in the face of numerous investigations designed to uncover that very situation. It's even harder for systemic mail-in voting fraud because the ballots can only be mailed to each voter's registered address meaning that hundreds of households would need to be part of this conspiracy that adds mail fraud to its list of felonies. It's more likely that Mickey Mouse would be allowed to vote than systemic voter fraud to occur undetected.</p> <p>Republican officials know this. They know that this election cycle has seen an unprecedented surge in new voter registrations and that those registrations have been disproportionally Democratic. They are raising the spectre of imaginary voter fraud to further their efforts to disqualify a large number of those registrations through cumbersome requirements that elections boards cannot complete by November 4 to fix a problem that does not exist. It is a deliberate effort to delegitimise both their probable defeat and, combined with despicable efforts to portray Obama as a supporter of terrorism, an Obama presidency. Should Obama win, a large percentage of the country will think that he is a terrorist supporter who conspired to steal the election, that will present a real governing problem for Obama. The reason they will believe that outrageous suggestion is that the Republican presidential and vice-presidential candidates have told them it is true. This from the man who claims to put country first.</p>",
  "<p>The UN's chief climate change negotiator has predicted that a Barack Obama victory next month would jump-start progress toward global limits on carbon emissions.</p> <p>Dr Rajendra Pachauri, head of the UN intergovernmental panel on climate change (IPCC), said yesterday that other nations would solidify their position on emissions caps after watching how the new American president approaches the issue.</p> <p>\"If Obama is elected, and this seems more likely, this would create positive momentum\" for the December climate talks in Poland and next year's round in Copenhagen, Pachauri told Bloomberg News.</p> <p>The IPCC's mandate states that its reports on climate science should remain \"policy neutral\", giving a ring of the unexpected to Pachauri's remarks on the US political scene. He made no similar remarks about the climate-change policy of Republican nominee John McCain.</p> <p>The Poland talks are likely to determine whether nations can agree on a climate pact to replace the Kyoto protocol by next year's deadline. Environmental activists and Yvo de Boer, chief of the UN climate secretariat, have urged the newly elected US president \u2013 whether Obama or McCain \u2013 to commit to attending the Poland meeting.</p> <p>Neither candidate has publicly stated whether Poland is on his agenda, but Obama has vowed that if Congress does not act on climate change within 18 months after the election, he would use his presidential regulatory powers to set emissions limits.</p> <p>The announcement on climate regulation, from Obama energy adviser Jason Grumet, came in a separate interview with Bloomberg News. Grumet said the short timeframe for a new global climate accord \u2013 the Copenhagen talks end in December 2009 \u2013 would influence Obama's decision-making.</p> <p>\"We cannot have a meaningful impact in the international discussion until we develop a meaningful domestic consensus,\" Grumet said. \"So he'll move quickly.''</p> <p>Under George Bush, the US environmental protection agency (EPA) has refused to use its power under the Clean Air Act to curb emissions. Several state governments and environmental groups successfully challenged that stance before the US supreme court, but the Bush administration has postponed action until the next president arrives.</p> <p>An Obama administration's decision to use the EPA as a regulator of carbon emissions would represent a stark turnabout from the Bush years. Advisers to McCain have suggested that he would prefer Congress to drive American action on climate change to an approach steered by the EPA.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Who is running? </strong><br>Democratic senator <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/barackobama\">Barack Obama</a> of Illinois and Republican senator <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/johnmccain\">John McCain</a> of Arizona are the major party candidates. Their vice-presidential running mates are Delaware senator <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/joebiden\">Joe Biden</a> and Alaska governor <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/sarahpalin\">Sarah Palin</a>, respectively. </p> <p>Also running are Ralph Nader, the liberal consumer advocate whom Democrats blame with spoiling the 2000 election by siphoning votes from Al Gore and Cynthia McKinney, a former Democratic congresswoman from Georgia who is running on the Green party ticket. Former Georgia Republican congressman Georgia Bob Barr is running on the Libertarian ticket, hoping in part to win over conservative gadfly Ron Paul's backers.<br> <strong>How were Barack Obama and John McCain chosen as their parties' nominees? </strong><br>They were nominated by a vote of delegates to their respective national conventions in the late summer. They earned the support of those delegates by winning the long series of primary caucuses and elections held in the winter and spring. The Democratic nomination also need to be secured by the allegiance of party insiders and elected officials known as \"superdelegates\". <strong>So whoever gets the most votes on November 4 wins?</strong> <br>No. US presidential elections are awarded to the winner of what is known as the electoral college. Under the system, each state is allocated anywhere from three to 55 votes according to its population. </p> <p>The winner of the popular vote wins a state's electoral votes - with two exceptions, Maine and Nebraska, which award electoral votes by district. The candidate that wins 270 electoral votes takes the White House. <br> <strong>What happens if the winner of the electoral college has tallied fewer popular votes? </strong><br>This has happened three times in US history, most recently in 2000. Under the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/constitutionandcivilliberties\">US Constitution</a>, the presidency nevertheless goes to the candidate who wins the electoral college. <br> <strong>What are the most important states?</strong><br>California, New York and Texas offer the most electoral votes, with 55, 31 and 34 respectively. But those mammoth lodes are not up for grabs: the first two states are safely Democrat, and Texas has voted Republican every year since 1976. The candidates typically spend most of their time in a handful of large \"swing states\" that could vote either way, including <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/florida\">Florida</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/ohio\">Ohio</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/pennsylvania\">Pennsylvania</a>. <br> <strong>When do Americans vote?</strong><br>Election day is November 4, but many states allow voters to cast a ballot before then.  <strong>Why vote early?</strong> <br>Voters like early voting because it adds convenience and precludes having to wait on a long queue at the polls. This year, the Obama campaign is encouraging supporters to vote early to mitigate the chances of a late McCain surge in momentum. Research shows early voting does not dramatically increase turnout, as early voters would have cast a ballot on election day anyway.  <strong>How many Americans vote?</strong> <br>US citizens must be at least 18 years old and be registered with their local elections supervisor in order to vote. In 2004, 64% of voting-age citizens cast a ballot, up from 60% in 2000. This year Americans are expected to vote in record numbers, in large part because Obama has energised young voters and African-Americans in unprecedented levels. </p> <p><strong>What is the vice-president's role in the campaign? </strong><br>Vice-presidents run alongside presidential candidates on the party ticket. They have few official governing duties under the Constitution, and it is often joked that the most important day in a vice-president's career is the day he (or she) is brought onto the campaign. During the campaign, vice-presidential running mates are often tasked with attacking the record and character of the opposing presidential candidate, and this year Democrat Joe Biden and Republican Sarah Palin have embraced that role.  <strong>What does the president actually do? </strong><br>The president is commander in chief of the US military, sets foreign policy and negotiates treaties, oversees dozens of executive agencies and departments, signs bills into law and submits a budget to the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/congress\">US Congress</a>. </p> <p>The president also appoints federal judges including new <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/supremecourt\">US supreme court</a> justices. From the White House \"bully pulpit\", the president can wield extraordinary influence over legislation. <br> <strong>Who can run for president? </strong><br>The Constitution states only that the president must be a \"natural born citizen\", at least 35 years old and have resided in the US for 14 years.  <strong>John McCain was born in the Panama Canal zone. Is he a \"natural born citizen\"? </strong><br>The term has been widely interpreted to mean people born in the US, although the Constitution does not define it. </p> <p>Politicians in Washington are in broad agreement, however that McCain is a natural born citizen because he was born on a US military base in a US territory and his father was in the US navy. The Senate in May passed a resolution affirming that McCain is eligible to be president. <br> <strong>My friend in America wants to run for president. How does he go about doing this?</strong> <br>It is very, very difficult to run for the highest office in the nation. With the noteworthy exception of Barack Obama, serious presidential contenders have typically spent decades positioning themselves for a White House run, building political support by winning lower office, campaigning for other candidates, assembling coalitions of supporters and financiers, and mapping an electoral college strategy. </p> <p>Presidents and major-party nominees often fail their first attempt. Richard Nixon lost to John Kennedy in 1960 and spent the next eight years out of office, plotting his return to power in 1968. John McCain sought the Republican nomination in 2000 but lost to George Bush. He soon began positioning himself for this race. <br> <strong>How did Barack Obama manage to put himself in contention after less than three years in the Senate and eight years in the Illinois legislature? </strong><br>Obama first gained national attention in 2004 as a candidate for Senate in Illinois. He made a well-received speech at the Democratic convention that year, and struck party faithful with his charisma and his call for an end to divisive partisan and racial politics. </p> <p>But his relative lack of experience was a top issue for his opponents for the Democratic nomination. <br> <strong>Running for president sounds expensive. How much have the candidates spent so far?</strong> <br>Up until the end of August, McCain and the Republican party had spent $197.4m on the campaign. Obama and the Democrats had spent $391.4m.</p> <p><strong>How do they raise so much money?</strong><br>An individual may donate only $2,300 per election to a presidential candidate, so the campaigns rely on \"bundlers\" - well-heeled and influential people who can gather checks from large numbers of wealthy associates on behalf of the campaign. Obama's campaign this year has raised large sums of money in small contributions from a broad network of supporters, while McCain's campaign has relied on a smaller number of big checks. The political parties may take up to $28,500 from an individual every calendar year, but the federal government restricts how much they can spend in coordination with the campaign.</p> <p><strong>McCain and Obama are both senators. Do candidates always hold this office? </strong><br>No. In fact, the last sitting senator elected president was John Kennedy in 1960. Americans prefer electing governors or former vice-presidents, largely because governors have executive experience that is in many ways analogous to the presidency. Former vice-presidents have already stood on the national and international stage.  <strong>What else is up for grabs? </strong><br>The whole of the House of Representatives and one-third of the 100-member Senate are elected every two years, so those seats are up on November 4. Plus 11 states will hold elections for governor.  <strong>I won! Now what? </strong><br>The next president will be sworn into office on January 20. In the meantime, the president-elect will this year have one of the most urgent transition periods in history because of the fast-changing turmoil in the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/useconomy\">US economy</a>. The president-elect will immediately begin naming his cabinet and preparing to take the reins in the White House and in the executive agencies. <br> <strong>How much does the president get paid? </strong><br>The president is paid $450,000, including a $50,000 per year expense fund. </p> <p><strong>That does not sound like very much, considering the power and prestige of the job. </strong><br>The president does not have to pay rent, or for meals and transportation, and takes holiday at Camp David, a retreat in the mountains of Maryland. Also, former presidents make large sums on book deals and speaking fees.  <strong>The White House sounds like a pretty neat place to live. </strong><br>It is. It is one of the most secure places in the entire world. The 200-year old mansion has had several additions and renovations, and every president has put his own stamp on the interior. For the president's off-hours, the White House features a tennis court, jogging track, swimming pool, movie theatre and bowling alley.</p>",
  "<p>John McCain ceded, the country, if not the election as a whole, on <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/16/us/politics/16debate.html?_r=1&amp;scp=1&amp;sq=third%20debate%20transcript&amp;st=cse&amp;oref=slogin\">Wednesday night</a>. The Senator gave in to the trend he's been moving towards for weeks now. He decided to go with red states rather than blue, to choose creaky conservatism over forward looking bipartisanship. McCain chose the politics of anger and bias. He just let it all wash over him, and then he waded in it up to his neck and happily splashed around in it, oblivious to those around him. On Wednesday night John McCain gave up on independents and so-called Reagan Democrats entirely and threw his campaign to the fiery Republican base. It's a move that will fail him. <br> There were three crucial moments in the debate that speak best to McCain's final descent, and they all connect to the culture wars, the fires of which he and his running mate Sarah Palin have been stoking for more than a month now. The first we'd seen before \u2013 his <a href=\"http://www.startribune.com/politics/national/president/31001129.html?elr=KArks8c7PaP3E77K_3c::D3aDhUMEaPc:E7_ec7PaP3iUiD3aPc:_Yyc:aULPQL7PQLanchO7DiU\">reference to Obama creating \"class warfare,\"</a> a trope that is as out of touch as it is disingenuous (as one friend said to me last night during the debate, \"Does McCain think the Bush years haven't been about class warfare?\"). </p> <p>But the other two were new. This was the first time these presidential debates have touched Roe versus Wade. For a moment it seemed McCain would advance a centrist (if not entirely plausible) position, begging off <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/kari-lundgren/catholics-shouldnt-trust_b_135393.html\">the idea of a litmus test for Supreme Court</a> judges. And then with a grimace and an eye roll he mocked the idea of granting women abortion exceptions for the health of the mother. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_CxQzm42hE\">\"Health\" he sneered</a>, derisively, and made little air quotes with his fingers. And with that, he lost all those centrist, mildly, or avowedly, pro-choice women in America who, yes, care about the health of the mother.<br> It was also the first time that McCain has been asked to address, in front of Obama, allowing the general level of character assassination \u2013 beyond the construct of the ridiculous Weatherman links \u2013 to escalate past the typical election year sludge into the Rovian territory it has wandered into of late. It was a chance for McCain to distance himself from some of the scarier elements that have popped up at his rallies recently \u2013 the people who scream \"kill [Obama]\" in the audience or \"terrorist\" that have even seemed to <a href=\"http://www.thedailyshow.com/video/index.jhtml?videoId=188473&amp;title=10,000-mccainiacs\">panic McCain</a>. Instead he <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQfkZF20YwQ&amp;feature=related\">made it worse</a>. Here were the crucial lines:<br> </p> <blockquote> <p>Obama: At some of the rallies that your running mate was holding, in which all the Republican reports indicated were shouting, when my name came up, things like \"terrorist\" and \"kill him,\" and that you're running mate didn't mention, didn't stop, didn't say \"Hold on a second, that's kind of out of line.\" \u2026 We can have serious differences about our health care policy, for example, John, because we do have a difference on health care policy, but we...</p> <p>McCain: We do and I hope...</p> <p>Obama: ... talking about it this evening. But when people suggest that I pal around with terrorists, then we're not talking about issues. </p> <p>McCain: Let me just say categorically I'm proud of the people that come to our rallies. Whenever you get a large rally of 10,000, 15,000, 20,000 people, you're going to have some fringe peoples. You know that. And I've \u2013 and we've always said that that's not appropriate. But to somehow say that group of young women who said \"Military wives for McCain\" are somehow saying anything derogatory about you, but anything - and those veterans that wear those hats that say \"World War Two, Vietnam, Korea, Iraq,\" I'm not going to stand for people saying that the people that come to my rallies are anything but the most dedicated, patriotic men and women that are in this nation and they're great citizens. And I'm not going to stand for somebody saying that because someone yelled something at a rally \u2013 there's a lot of things that have been yelled at your rallies, Senator Obama, that I'm not happy about either.</p> </blockquote> <p>This was completely specious. Obviously Obama wasn't deriding veterans in hats or military wives for McCain. It was nonsensical. And with that moment McCain lost his chance to take the high road, to try to undo some of the more egregious scenes at Sarah Palin's rallies. He might have said, I'm proud of those veterans and military wives for McCain who come to my rallies, but yes, of late there were a few horrible things shouted, or asked, and I repudiate those jeers. He was pointedly asked to distance himself from those that seem ready to burn a cross on the lawn of the White House, and McCain couldn't bring himself to do it.</p>",

  "<p>Both John McCain and Barack Obama tout their green credentials on the campaign trail, but today their frequent absences from Congress doomed them to abysmal ratings on a leading US environmental group's annual scorecard.</p> <p>The League of Conservation Voters has ranked the environmental commitment of members of Congress for 37 years on its annual scorecards, which tally votes that legislators take on green issues. Missed votes detract from one's score, however, which proved bad news for Obama and McCain.</p> <p>Obama missed nearly all of the League's environmental \"key votes\" this year due to his whirlwind campaign schedule, earning an 18% green rating. His score during 2007, when a primary battle against Hillary Clinton also pulled Obama away from Washington, was 67%.</p> <p>But even those diminished rankings were better than McCain's. The Republican nominee, who depicts himself as a conservationist, got a 0% score for the second straight year after missing every vote tallied by the League.</p> <p>Neither Obama nor McCain voted on the US Senate's climate change legislation, which was defeated in a test vote in June. Although both men submitted public letters declaring that they would have backed the carbon-emissions plan, the absence still counted against their score for the League's purposes.</p> <p>Even if the presidential nominees had shown up to vote on the climate proposal, however, it still would have fallen 10 votes short of passage.</p> <p>Tiernan Sittenfeld, the League's legislative director, noted ruefully that Congress had scored a promising environmental victory last year, agreeing to increase automobile fuel efficiency standards for the first time in decades.</p> <p>\"The success of 2007 should have led to even more progress in 2008,\" Sittenfeld added in a statement, \"but a vocal minority of big-oil allies instead turned the year into a series of missed opportunities and major steps backward.\"</p> <p>Members of Congress who seek the White House commonly miss the overwhelming majority of legislative votes while campaigning across the US. John Kerry missed so many Senate votes during his bid to unseat George Bush in 2004 that one government watchdog group tried to force him to give back his congressional salary.</p> <p>But rarely do those missed votes make the difference between success and failure for major legislation. When a package of clean-energy tax credits came within one vote of passage in December, McCain was the only senator missing from the Capitol \u2013 although he was in Washington at the time. </p> <p>McCain joined David Vitter, a Republican from Louisiana, as the only senators receiving 0% ratings from the League this year. Seventy members of the House of Representatives earned zeroes. </p> <p>Among the senators receiving perfect 100% scores, all but one are Democrats. The exception to that trend is Susan Collins of Maine, whom the League has endorsed in her difficult re-election fight against Democratic challenger Tom Allen.</p>",

  "<p>For Barack Obama, it may be better to be grey above the ears than wet behind them.</p> <p>His newly salt-and-pepper pate was plainly visible during Wednesday night's debate, and the candidate joked about the change last night at a charity dinner in New York City last night.</p> <p>\"Hillary Clinton is one of the toughest and most formidable presidential candidates in history,\" he said. \"She's broken barriers, she's inspired millions, she is the primary reason I have all this grey in my hair now.\"</p> <p>The sprightly hopeful who wowed the crowd at the 2004 Democratic National Convention in Boston has matured into a serious and deliberate campaigner - and, with that maturity comes signs of age.</p> <p>The specks of silver may not be all bad for Obama.</p> <p>\"Obama's emerging grey definitely closes the gap experientially between him and McCain, at least in the public perception,\" said Simon Doonan, creative director for Barney's New York. \"I'm sure L'Oreal are very disappointed.\"</p> <p>Doonan noted that the to-dye-or-not-to-dye decision is much easier for men than women: \"The guys get off easy because they cannot dye it and achieve gravitas, whereas the chicks are all screwed because if they don't dye it they're an old hag and if they do dye it they're duplicitous.\"</p> <p>The life of a sitting president is famously trying, and years in the White House dramatically age the men who hold high office. Bill Clinton emerged from the White House in 2001 white-haired after eight years in the Oval Office and needed open-heart surgery just a few years later. George Bush's locks have similarly faded in the last eight years.</p> <p>Since Obama officially announced his presidential bid in February 2007, Obama has celebrated two birthdays, and watched his young daughters grow.</p> <p>Presidential candidates say the rigours of managing a campaign - with, in Obama's case, a nearly $400m budget and a staff of thousands across the country - is good practice for managing the White House. This year's campaign has been especially difficult because it began earlier, than usual and Clinton forced Obama to compete for the Democratic nomination into June. In 2004, John Kerry had the nomination sewn up by mid-March, giving him three month of rest Obama couldn't enjoy.</p> <p>While Obama's staff manage the schedule, and his personal attendants make sure he is fed and his clothes are cleaned and pressed, Obama must nevertheless spend countless hours each day in the public eye, chatting with voters, raising money and answering reporters' questions. Any conversation can become fodder for the Republicans and for the 24-hour news media - witness Obama's interaction with \"Joe the Plumber\" in Toledo, Ohio. </p> <p>Obama has been hitting the campaign trail full force for more than a year, and has taken only two brief breaks with his family, in the US Virgin Islands and Hawaii.</p> <p>\"You know what I got for Christmas?\" Obama asked in December, \"Eight hours sleep\".</p>",
  "<p>From the medieval Mystery Plays through Hamlet to Christopher Shinn's excellent <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/2008/sep/12/theatre1\">Now or Later</a>, now at the Royal Court, fathers and sons give good <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/theatre\">play</a>. The dynamic between a man and his boy has provided me with some of the most memorable moments of my theatregoing life, and it's easy to understand why. </p> <p>Transformations are at the heart of theatre. As <a href=\"http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-the-stanislavski-method-of-acting.htm\">some guy called Stanislavski</a> said, they are best achieved by overcoming obstacles. A father faces some of the biggest obstacles in psychology and society when he tries to transform his overwhelming feelings about his son into a healthy relationship. </p> <p>However cliched it may sound, women are both more inclined and more encouraged to reinforce and <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zr1xppNU9w4&amp;eurl=http://www.fragrancediva.net/2007/10/do-women-really-talk-more-than-men.html\">rearticulate their emotions</a> with each other. Observing fathers and sons tackle their feelings on stage doesn't just come across like monkeys trying to use tools for the first time, it feels like discovering monkeys trying to master Black &amp; Decker Decor Mate Multi Drills. </p> <p>Last year, my top theatrical moment was a five-second, silent gesture from Malcolm Sinclair as Stephen in Sam West's revival of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/2007/dec/13/theatre\">Patrick Marber's all-male Dealer's Choice</a>. Normally suavely controlling over his resentful son Carl, in the third act Stephen allowed the fa\u00e7ade to crack and half-embraced, half-sniffed his son's recently vacated chair. It was a brilliantly shocking moment of unspoken longing and animal instinct. </p> <p>Currently, the cast of <a href=\"http://www.officiallondontheatre.co.uk/news/interviews/view/item101956/Matthew-Marsh/\">Now or Later</a> are nailing a father-and-son scene with comparable power. On US election night, John (Eddie Redmayne), the son of the Democratic presidential candidate, fights to retain his hard-won anonymity and autonomy, as he is gradually coerced by party members, friends and finally his father into publishing a public apology for a politically insensitive prank. John Sr (Matthew Marsh) is the ever-pervasive absence at the centre of the play, and when he finally enters John's hotel room like a bison in a suit, the bland carpeted suite becomes the plains of the Serengeti. John Sr initially circles their issues with a painfully careful approach evidently learned from the therapist of his son's troubled teen years. But as John resists, provokes and finally derides his own name, his father springs on him with pantherish intent: Oedipus ripping through the Armani.</p> <p>As a daughter and a sister, my fascination may be partly stoked by the foreignness of the subject, like watching lions sparring in a zoo. But the rich tradition of theatrical fathers and sons suggests they have a unique dramatic power. The tensions and tenderness between them exemplify a great human quest - how, in the face of confusion, repression and danger, we still strive to find ways to articulate love.</p>",

The Arizona senator was funnier than Obama, and appeared at ease in a room packed with Democrats.</p> <p>\"There are signs of hope even in the most unexpected places, even in this room full of proud Manhattan Democrats,\" he said. \"I can't shake that feeling that some people here are pulling for me; I'm delighted to see you here tonight, Hillary.\"</p> <p>McCain also riffed on the lingering tension between Obama and the former president Bill Clinton.</p> <p>\"When Larry King asked President Clinton a couple weeks ago what was the delay and why wasn't he out there on the trail for Barack, Bill said his hands were tied until the end of the Jewish high holidays,\" McCain said, referring to the CNN talk show host.</p> <p>\"Now, you've got to admire that ecumenical spirit. I just know Bill would like to be out there now, stumping for Barack until the last hour of the last day. Unfortunately, he is constrained by his respect for any voters who might be observing the Zoroastrian new year.\"</p> <p>McCain quipped about his own wealth - in a well-publicised gaffe this summer McCain could not remember how many houses he owned - and referred to Joe the Plumber, his new campaign mascot.</p> <p>\"[Obama] claims that this honest, hardworking small businessman could not possibly have enough income to face a tax increase under the Obama plan,\" he said. \"What they don't know is Joe the Plumber recently signed a very lucrative contract with a wealthy couple to handle all the work on all seven of their houses.\"</p> <p>Before relinquishing the microphone to Obama, McCain played on the \"expectations game\", in which the campaigns engaged in the run-up to the debates this fall.</p> <p>\"Now, of course, it would be unfair - and even a little unkind - to put my opponent on the spot before he gets up here or to throw him off his game with unreasonably high expectations,\" McCain said. \"But I do need to warn you, ladies and gentlemen, you all are about to witness the funniest performance in history - Senator Obama, the microphone is all yours.\"</p> <p>Obama, who accepted the ribbing with laughs and broad smiles, poked fun at his own convention acceptance speech, which he delivered before more than 80,000 people at an outdoor football stadium on an elaborately constructed stage.</p> <p>\"I was originally told we'd be able to move this outdoors to Yankee Stadium,\" he said of the dinner. Then, pausing and surveying the room, he said: \"Could somebody tell me what happened to the Greek columns that I requested?\"</p> <p>He quipped that the Fox News channel, the conservative-leaning cable broadcaster that Democrats say repeats scurrilous rumours about Obama, reported he had fathered two African-American children \"in wedlock\".</p> <p>\"It is an honour to be here with Al Smith,\" Obama said, referring to the host of the dinner, the scion of the politician. \"I obviously never knew your great-grandfather, but from everything that Senator McCain has told me, the two of them had a great time together before Prohibition. Wonderful stories.\"</p> <p>He cracked wise about his middle name, Hussein, which some Republicans have used in an effort to paint him as a Muslim: \"I got my middle name from somebody who obviously didn't think I would ever run for president\"</p> <p>On his association with William Ayers, a 1960's-era radical with whom the Republicans insinuate Obama is close to, he said, \"John McCain is onto something. There was a point in my life when I started palling around with a pretty ugly crowd, I've got to be honest. These guys were serious deadbeats, they were lowlifes, they were unrepentant, no good punks. That's right, I've been a member of the United States senate.\"</p> <p>The two men had kind and respectful words for each other. Obama praised McCain's service in the Vietnam war, saying few Americans had served their country with \"the same honour and distinction\" as the Arizona senator, a former navy pilot who was a prisoner of war for more than five years in Vietnam.</p> <p>McCain said Obama was \"an impressive fellow in many ways\" and praised \"his great skill, energy and determination\". He noted that Obama was positioned to make history as the first African-American president, and said: \"I can't wish my opponent luck, but I do wish him well.\"</p>",

  "<p>A question. What adjective is most closely associated with Barack Obama on Google, and what epithet is linked with John McCain? Answers: \"professorial\" and \"fighter-pilot\", respectively. </p> <p>This is what the 2008 gladiatorial combat has boiled down to: mortarboards versus flying helmets. Swots versus warriors.</p> <p>The standard descriptions of Barack, in newspaper reports of the presidential debates, have been: \"cool\", \"detached\", \"wry\" and - time and again -\"professorial\". </p> <p>And McCain? \"Hot-tempered\" comes up routinely, as does \"aggressive\" (\"Grumpy McNasty\" has also been popular). </p> <p>\"Academic\", although not as dirty a word as \"liberal, is not something any politician wants strung round their neck. It suggests ivory-tower unworldliness. </p> <p>\"Professorial\", on the other hand, is what Orwell calls a \"plusword\". You can be a professor and worldly.</p> <p>Professors have not, of course, always been admired by real-world politicians. George Wallace was scathing about \"pointy-headed professors that can't park a bicycle straight\".</p> <p>Henry Kissinger (a Harvard prof in his early years) memorably declared that he would rather have as president of the United States anyone in the first 100 pages of the Boston telephone directory rather than someone on the Harvard faculty. No pointy-heads in the White House, thank you very much.</p> <p>None the less, \"professorial\" has worked powerfully for Obama in this keenly contested election. Why?<br> Four reasons suggest themselves: </p> <p>\u2022 First: do a free-association exercise on the word \"professorial\". What image comes to mind? My guess is: \"dignified white male\". To be blunt, \"professorial\" works against the stock associations of \"African-American\" - or less savoury variants of that term. It subliminally blanches the candidate.</p> <p>\u2022 The second reason, I suspect, is that American professors have scooped up all the Nobel prizes this month for science and social science. </p> <p>Particularly relevant is the economics award, won by Paul Krugman. Krugman is a distinguished professor at Princeton, a syndicated op-ed columnist on the New York Times, and a relentless critic of Bush's.</p> <p>\u2022 There's a feeling that whereas fighter-pilot aggression might help in the hills of Afghanistan, it's not going to get America out of the ditch into which George Bush (another ex-fighter pilot) and his deregulation policies have crashed his country. </p> <p>It's not dash and derring-do that's needed, but thoughtful reflection. Not warriors, but professors. Enter \"professorial\" Obama.</p> <p>Barack Obama is very brainy. An alumnus of Columbia and Harvard, he was president of the Harvard Law Review. He could easily have followed an academic track and, at 47, would surely by now have been, yes, a very distinguished professor, had he not elected, instead, to become the most powerful man in the world. If, that is, his country so elects.</p> <p>Time and again, Obama (unlike his opponent) has stressed how vital it is for working and middle-class Americans to be able to send their kids to college. </p> <p>What's the current package at an Ivy League institution? Around $50K a year. If you've got three children, and are in receipt of the national average income (under $50K, as it happens) what hope do you have of doing what Obama and his wife, in a more generous era, managed to do? The American dream is just too expensive, nowadays, for the Barack Obamas and Michelle Robinsons.</p> <p>Famously, Obama and his wife have barely finished paying their student loans. Democracy, Obama asserts - and demonstrates in his own career - depends as much on assisted access to higher education as on invading Middle Eastern oil-rich countries. Most professors would agree with him.</p> <p>\u2022 It used to be pastors who led the African-American community. Dr Martin Luther King broke the mould. He was a preacher with a PhD (no president of the US, incidentally, has had an earned, as opposed to an honorary, doctorate). Now black professors are moving into leadership roles.</p> <p>In spite of what I described above as the male-whiteness of the term, there are nowadays a significant number of African-American professors of both sexes among the very top echelon of \"public intellectuals\". </p> <p>They include: Cornel West III (Princeton); Henry Louis Gates Jr (Harvard); Houston A. Baker Jr (Vanderbilt); Toni Morrison (Princeton). And, of course, there is Condoleeza Rice (formerly president of Stanford, before that, a professor there). There is, in short, a black professoriate. And it is an increasingly powerful player in American public life. Obama slips easily into that company.</p> <p>If Obama wins - and the polls strongly suggest he will - it will be because of, not in spite of, his professorial demeanour. Professors, for the moment, are cool. And admired for being level-headed, not pointy-headed. Gaudeamus.</p>",
  "<p>So, after eight years of Blair and Brown toadying up to Bush, 65% of Brits want Barack Obama to win the presidential election, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/17/uselections2008-barackobama1\">according to the Guardian's international poll</a> published today, and only 15% are rooting for the McCain/Palin ticket \u2013 and one suspects that some of those would be voting for the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2006/dec/22/politics.thefarright\">racist BNP</a> given half a chance, not least when the numbers indicate that Obama is only supported by the 54% of the lowest socio-economic class, whose neglect by New Labour has left many of them clutching at racist straws.</p> <p>In every country, opinions of the US have declined to record levels over George Bush's two terms as president. One can understand why 75% of the French would think so, but what do you make of the Swiss, 86% of whom think so, even though not even the Republicans boycotted Helvetian cheese or cuckoo clocks?</p> <p>The world is showing what it thinks of Sarah Palin and the Bushite know-nothings who have usurped McCain's campaign. So should Americans care? Of course, they <strong>should</strong>, but more pertinent is whether it could be a factor in the election. At this stage, it could well be important.</p> <p>Except in times of war, when American foreign policy happens to the citizenry rather than to others, it is often assumed that presidential politics is all local. In fact, the president, as head of state, symbolises their country, and it is important for Americans how he (or, heaven help us at this present juncture, she) represents them.</p> <p>While it would be easy to dismiss French gall as a natural, well Gallic, prejudice against the Anglo-Saxons, the opinions of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/oct/17/uselections2008\">close allies like Britain</a>, Canada and the rest are certainly worth broadcasting, subtly, by the Obama campaign. After all, even John McCain has invoked the world's low regard for the US as an important issue.</p> <p>An earlier poll this August <a href=\"http://www.undispatch.com/archives/2008/08/new_poll_americ_1.php\"> showed that 78% of American voters</a> also believe the United States is less respected by other countries than it has been in the past and that 80% of voters believe that working with major allies, and through international organizations, is a wiser strategy for achieving the US's international affairs goals.</p> <p>The high international regard for Barack Obama is only a surprise for six-packing evangelist <a href=\"http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=g7TgDanmWkg\">hockey moms like Sarah Palin</a>. She keeps referring to the \"City on a Hill\" as her vision of America \u2013 a phrase she attributes to the Prophet Reagan. And her version is indeed Reaganesque: one of the reasons people used to build cities on hills was because their sewage would fall on the people downhill. The rich usually lived at the top and the poor at the bottom.</p> <p>But of course the original was from a more distinguished prophet in his Sermon on the Mount, and its American form came through the <a href=\" http://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/winthrop.htm \">Puritan divine John Winthrop</a>. Now one may, with justice, consider the Pilgrims to be a dangerously bigoted cult, but they had \"a decent respect for the opinions of mankind proper regard for the opinions of mankind.\"</p> <p>Winthrop went on to say (somewhat optimistically, with the self-importance of a cult leader) that \"the eies of all people are upon us; soe that if wee shall deale falsely with our god in this worke wee have undertaken and soe cause him to withdrawe his present help from us, wee shall be made a story and a byword through the world.\"</p> <p>So, far from being a declaration of isolation and disregard for where the city's sewage flowed, Winthrop had a deep regard for the opinions of the rest of the world. The attitude of the freedom-frying Republicans flies not only in the face of their forgotten and erased history, but, happily, runs against the American voters, who <strong>do</strong> care what other people think about them and their leaders.</p> <p>And for its part, the rest of the world will little note nor long remember what the candidates said in the debates, here. But it will never forget what the electorate does on November 4.</p>",

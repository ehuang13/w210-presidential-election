  "<p>For years now, ABC Radio and Fox News Channel star Sean Hannity has kissed his callers goodbye by telling them: \"You're a great American.\" But he seems to have convinced at least some of his fans that they somehow love their country - and mine - more than those who didn't call or write to say they agreed with whatever nonsense Hannity was spewing on any particular day.<br> Recently, Sarah Palin <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/10/17/palin-clarifies-what-part_n_135641.html\">spoke</a> at a fundraiser in North Carolina about small towns she believed to be the \"real America\" as the \"very patriotic ... pro-America areas of this great nation.\"<br> The next day, Michelle Bachman, Republican congresswoman from Minnesota, may have hit the eject button from her own, otherwise safe US House seat by <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vbw4pdxVSOg\">telling</a> MSNBC's Chris Matthews that she believed Barack Obama was \"anti-American\" and that she wished \"the American media\" would do an investigative expos\u00e9 to determine \"the views of the people in Congress and find out, are they pro-America or anti-America.\"<br> The day after that, Nancy Pfotenhauer, an adviser to John McCain, <a href=\"http://thinkprogress.org/2008/10/18/real-virginia/\">told</a> a reporter that only the part of Virginia supporting the Republican presidential nominee was the \"real Virginia\".<br> The remarks of all three women came after the McCain campaign, with its poll numbers sinking, spent days calling Obama the equivalent of a terrorist and/or communist. And that was the polite stuff. After <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2008/oct/16/republicans-acorn-voter-fraud\">specious Republican allegations</a> that it was committing voter fraud, offices of the community organising group Acorn were <a href=\"http://www.mcclatchydc.com/251/story/54360.html\">ransacked and burglarised</a> in several states, and its employees were met with death threats. They were deluged with threatening and <a href=\"http://www.prosebeforehos.com/word-of-the-day/10/15/al-jazeera-exposes-racism-at-sarah-palin-rally-in-ohio/?red\">racist phone messages and email</a>, including: \"Hi, I was just calling to let you all know that Barack Obama needs to get hung. He's a fucking nigger, and he's a piece of shit. You guys are fraudulent, and you need to go to hell. All the niggers on oak trees. They're gonna get all hung honeys, they're gonna get assassinated, they're gonna get killed.\"</p> <p>Powder-laced packages and death threats were <a href=\"http://www.bradblog.com/?p=6539\">sent to the office of Jennifer Brunner</a>, Ohio's Democratic secretary of state, after she had the temerity to fight back against Republican party lawsuits alleging voter fraud (again, with no actual evidence to back up the suppressive fear-mongering). She was forced to set the secretary of state website into \"static mode\" temporarily following \"security breaches\" on the site. That came at the height of voter interest in election information the site carried following a \"barrage [of] menacing messages and even threats of harm or death,\" according to <a href=\"http://www.bradblog.com/?p=6539\">a statement</a> from Brunner's office.<br> The official Republican website in Sacramento County, California was caught <a href=\"http://rawstory.com/news/2008/GOP_site_that_linked_Obama_bin_1015.html\">featuring</a> a graphic that read: \"The only difference between Obama and Osama is BS.\" Another graphic, in the fashion of a political bumper sticker, urged people to \"Waterboard Barack Obama.\"<br> In Indiana, an election official <a href=\"http://www.americablog.com/2008/10/indiana-election-official-calls-obama.html\">distributed</a> copies of an email describing Obama as a \"young, black Adolf Hitler\".<br> In Chicago, some Obama supporters found <a href=\"http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/chi-villa_park_signoct17,0,1501910.story\">hand-written notes</a> in their mailbox which read: \"Get the Obama signs off your property \u2013 now. ... Failure to obey this order will result in the immediate death of all family members.\"<br> A dead bear was discovered at a North Carolina university campus last week. \"It looked like it had been shot in the head,\" said campus security. \"A couple of Obama campaign signs had been stapled together and stuck over its head.\" Given the rhetoric from Republican officials, including Palin and McCain, can anyone be surprised that things continue to escalate? No, it's not new. The US owns a dark history of blood, evil and oppression. Unspeakable terror was wrought against African-Americans in the decades following the US civil war, after they were blessed with a right to vote. In 1964, three civil rights workers - James Chaney, Andrew Goodman and Michael Schwerner - were killed in cold blood for having the temerity to try and register to vote those lost minority voices in the deep American south.</p> <p>Now, for the last eight years, the very people who would threaten a community worker with death for registering voters, or send a powder-laced package of hate to a secretary of state, or kill a bear to terrorise a town, or equate the most evil of terrorists with a presidential candidate in hopes of intimidating him and his supporters have been told by the loudest and most powerful people in the land - on radio, television and print, and from the very bully pulpit of the White House - that they are the \"great Americans\". They have been told that they, and they alone, support the troops who fight and die, ostensibly to assure our freedoms. Those cruelly used and misled must now come to terms with the fact that their wonderland is giving way to the welcome, if much too slow, return of a reality-based world in which they are relegated to the margins. Who can blame them for having a few issues with anger and denial right about now?<br> But all is not lost. Following Bachman's comments, her hitherto unknown Democratic opponent in the Minnesota congressional race received more than a million dollars in campaign contributions. The congresswoman's once-safe seat was downgraded to \"leans Republican\" by the political scientists, and the Republican party, seeing the writing on the wall, all but gave up the ghost on her by pulling TV ads and money out of that fight. She'll be left alone to <a href=\"http://tpmelectioncentral.talkingpointsmemo.com/2008/10/new_poll_bachmann_fighting_for.php\">twist in the wind</a> of her own misguided ideas of America, anti-Americanism and the real price paid for freedom.<br> The worst have been told they are the best Americans for nearly a decade by Hannity, by Bush, by Rove, by those who played along to fool the easily fooled. The triumph of good over evil will not come without a price. But come it will.</p>",
  "<p>Let's make an assumption \u2014 perhaps a rash one but certainly one that the polls all now imply. This time next week it will be day one of the rest of Sarah Palin's political career. Is that all there is? Will these last two months have been as good as it ever gets for the much derided Alaska governor? Or will defeat nevertheless be the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/29/us/politics/29palin.html\">springboard to a bigger nomination</a> in four or eight years' time, with Palin as the Republicans' considered choice to unseat or follow President Obama? Is she, in short, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2008/oct/23/sarah-palin-2012-election\">Republican history</a> or <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/oct/23/sarahpalin-uselections2008\">Republican promise</a>?</p> <p>The boring but true answer is that it is much too soon to say and that many months will pass before the answer begins to assume a clear shape. It is beyond question that Palin will <a href=\"http://features.csmonitor.com/politics/2008/10/26/palin-pushes-mccain-staff-aside-as-blame-game-begins/\">get a lot of the blame</a> if Obama wins next week. She will be attacked both as an <a href=\"http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20081019/ap_on_el_pr/powell\">inadequately qualified vice-presidential choice</a> \u2014 the Colin Powell critique \u2014 and as an excessively polarising one \u2014 the apparent view of many independents who have tipped to Obama after rejecting John McCain's choice of running mate after listening to the way she campaigns. There will be questions, too, about the Alaska factor \u2014 the issue of whether a candidate from such a unique and unfamiliar state can ever have sufficient wider appeal in middle America. And there will be mutterings, more private than public but important nonetheless, about whether <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2008/10/27/081027fa_fact_mayer\">putting a woman like her on the ticket</a> is really such a smart idea after all. </p> <p>Palin's supporters will counter that she energised the Republican ticket at a crucial time and in ways that no one else could have rivaled. They will say she brought millions of conservative voters and some serious conservative money back into the GOP fold. They will say that the problem in 2008 was McCain's age, message, character or tactics \u2014 and that Palin merely did what she could to rescue a doomed ship. They will say that this was always going to be a Democratic year anyway. And they will say that, however the Republican party now chooses to reinvent itself, the party will need to bind the Palin conservatives in \u2013 not try to freeze them out.</p> <p>The reality is that Palin will take a lot of flak over the coming weeks and months but she can still be a player if she chooses to be one \u2014 something that McCain, who will be history from Wednesday, certainly will not be. The eventual outcome will mainly depend, I think, upon two things. </p> <p>First, it will depend upon whether Palin is smart enough and determined enough to reinvent herself as someone with a Republican narrative that speaks to the moderates who the conservatives who feel their party has somehow been taken from them. If there is one question Palin might usefully ask herself each morning over the next two years it is this: how can the Republican party win California again? It is 20 years now \u2014 five elections \u2014 since a Republican presidential candidate <a href=\"http://www.multied.com/elections/1988state.html\">won California's massive sack full of electoral college votes</a> \u2013 yet in the preceding 40 years Republicans won the state every time except in 1964. If Palin can surround herself with enough smart people to come up with a strategy that would win in California she will embody the party's answer \u2013 not its problem.</p> <p>The second thing that will matter will be how Obama governs. If Obama manages to translate a 2008 win into a successful governing strategy and record on health, the budget, energy and foreign policy then it won't be Palin's fault if she has little to offer against him in 2012 \u2014 because no one else will be able to do that either. But if Obama gets it wrong, presides over a deepening recession and intractable wars, and alienates middle America, then his coalition may begin to unravel. In that case, Palin becomes the Anyone But Obama candidate.</p> <p>I think Palin should take her example from another female politician who was mocked and patronised, satirised and underestimated, but who eventually reinvented herself as the improbable answer to a nation's crises and who seized her chances when they came along. Margaret Thatcher wasn't always the Margaret Thatcher we think of today. In the early 1970s she was widely considered unimpressive, inflexible, unappealing and a disaster \u2014 and that was just what her parliamentary colleagues thought. But Thatcher had three big things going for her. First, she had a lot of legislative and executive experience. Second, she liked ideas and was willing to listen. Third, she had the audacity to go with her ambition. Over time she reinvented herself not just as a politician with a political purpose but as a politician who could connect with non-traditional voters. The rest is history.</p> <p>I'm not at all saying that Palin should simply ape everything that Thatcher did. Different times and different societies require different answers. But it is Thatcher \u2013 not Thatcherism \u2013 that offers the lesson fro Palin right now. There was a time when Thatcher was a figure of scorn among male politicians and commentators rather in the same way that Palin is now. Thatcher made her critics swallow their words. The test of Sarah Palin will be whether she has the right combination of artful bloody-mindedness to do the same.</p>",
  "<p>Will every vote cast this election season count? Of the possible snafus that could occur on November 4, from malfunctioning voting machines to insufficient ballots, one issue that hasn't gotten much attention is provisional voting. Essentially a stop-gap measure, provisional balloting assures that people whose names do not appear on voter registration lists due to bureaucratic errors (or who have other troubles) can exercise their right to vote.</p> <p>Provisional voting got traction after the administrative debacle of the 2000 presidential election when millions of people were turned away from the polls, many because of problematic voter rolls. Two years later, Congress mandated provisional voting nationwide as part of a larger package of election reforms known as the <a href=\"http://www.fec.gov/hava/hava.htm\">Help America Vote Act</a> or HAVA, to insure that everyone who is eligible to vote can. End of story, right? Not quite. </p> <p>Today, many state and local election officials despise provisional voting. Why? Even within a state, provisional voting requirements can be subject to conflicting interpretations by election officials. Sorting out who should get a provisional ballot on election day and researching voter eligibility afterwards is a confusing and time-consuming exercise. </p> <p>So stuff happens. The Pew Centre for the States/Electionline.org's <a href=\"http://www.pewcenteronthestates.org/uploadedFiles/Election Preview FINAL.pdf\">Election 2008 Preview</a> (pdf) documents that in more than half of the states that use provisional ballots, a person who thinks they are registered must vote in the correct precinct. Go to the wrong polling place, and your vote won't get tabulated. Some poll workers even use provisional ballots to pacify irate people in situations where the ballot may not solve the actual problem, such as missing the voter registration deadline. (Most state cutoffs fall in early or mid October.)<br> In Massachusetts, residents also get tripped up by a quirk in the <a href=\"http://www.usdoj.gov/crt/voting/nvra/activ_nvra.php\">national motor voter law</a> which permits a person to register to vote when he or she applies for a driving license. Here's how it works: Say you move from Provincetown on Cape Cod to Boston and opt to change your address online. Most people forget or don't know that they must go in person to a <a href=\"http://www.mass.gov/rmv/express/index.htm\">state registry of motor vehicles</a> office and fill out another form so that the changes get forwarded to the new city or town. </p> <p>Miss this step and once again you're out of luck at the friendly neighbourhood polling place. \"We will no doubt have many people because they have relocated for whatever reason looking to try to vote and not be on the rolls,\" said Massachusetts secretary of state William Galvin, the Bay State's <a href=\"http://www.sec.state.ma.us/ele/\">top election official</a>.</p> <p>To cut down on people needing provisional ballots, Deval Patrick, the governor of Massachusetts, today signed into law a change that would allow some voters who failed to re-register within 18 months of moving to go back to their old neighbourhoods to vote in the presidential and state races only. But local election officials fear that the move will create more problems than it solves, since poll workers won't have enough time to figure out how the process should work.<br> Worse still, when people vote provisionally, most fail to check the status of their ballot after the election. If the ballot wasn't counted, the person never finds out and, consequently, doesn't take the necessary steps to correct the error. So the cycle can start all over again in the next election, likely creating a permanent sub-class of voters who use provisional ballots, but whose votes never count. About three million people turned out for the <a href=\"http://elections.gmu.edu/Turnout_2004G.html\">2004 presidential election in Massachusetts</a>. A little more than 10,000 provisional votes were cast. Only about 2,300 were validated. Yet if election officials in true-blue Massachusetts, where elections run smoothly for the most part, are seizing up over the prospect of dealing with provisional voting while coping with a turnout of epic proportions, imagine the nightmares of officials in states with less-than-stellar track records like Florida or Ohio, where the outcome of the presidential race is not at all assured.<br> Add in a shortage of poll workers and the likelihood that provisional voting will muck things up multiplies, especially in locales with tight races. Just last week, federal election officials announced the <a href=\"http://www.eac.gov/News/press/preparing-for-historic-voter-turnout-eac-renews-call-for-poll-workers/base_view\">need for some two million volunteer poll workers nationwide</a>. \"I hope that election officials in every state are ready for this,\" said former presidential candidate and Massachusetts governor Michael Dukakis, now a political science professor at <a href=\"http://www.northeastern.edu/neuhome/index.php\">Northeastern University</a>.<br> Not everyone is sweating bullets. Eight states allow residents to register and vote on election day: Idaho, Iowa, Maine, Minnesota, Montana, New Hampshire, Wisconsin and Wyoming. Exempt from the HAVA provisional voting requirements, this cohort also posts some of the highest voter-turnout numbers in the country. (North Dakota doesn't have statewide registration, while North Carolina residents can vote anywhere from three to 19 days before the election.) </p> <p>This year, 24 states including Massachusetts tried and failed to pass comparable laws. Diane Jeffery, president of the <a href=\"http://www.lwvma.org/\">League of Women Voters of Massachusetts</a>, believes that provisional voting is necessary to prevent some people from being denied the right to vote. But she believes there is a better way. \"I would rather see election day registration than have to go through this kind of process,\" she said.<br> If provisional voting contributes to chaos this time around, count on lawmakers and civic leaders in states across the country to embrace election day registration and move to toss a well-meaning but frustrating procedure into the dustbin of history.</p>",
  "<p>Senior Republicans are planning to meet at a rural retreat in Virginia within days of the election to discuss how to rebuild a party they expect to be badly beaten in the White House and congressional races.</p> <p>News of the meeting emerged as a poll in Arizona indicated that John McCain could suffer the embarrassing loss of his home state. The poll put McCain on 46% and Barack Obama on 44%, indicating the Republicans are struggling to hold on in their traditional heartlands.</p> <p>Details of next week's post-election meeting, to be attended by state chairmen and prominent activists from the conservative wing of the party, are being kept secret for fear of being seen to preempt the outcome of the presidential contest.</p> <p>It is intended to look at who should take over chairmanship of the party, whether the party needs to switch to the right, and to make plans for the next presidential election.</p> <p>Sarah Palin, John McCain's running mate, though not present, will be a central figure in discussions about the party's future.</p> <p>\"It is about what direction the party takes, the proverbial struggle for the soul of the party,\" Norm Ornstein, an analyst at the Washington-based American Enterprise Institute, the home of the neo-conservatives, said today.</p> <p>\"There will be a million post-mortems and finger-pointing. What is unusual is that the finger-pointing has begun before the campaign is ended.\"</p> <p>One of the biggest post-mortems, if McCain loses, is scheduled for the week after the election, the Republican governors' annual meeting in Miami. Sessions planned include one looking back on the election titled, An in-depth evaluation of the 2008 election cycle.</p> <p>Another session is titled, Looking towards the future: the Grand Ole Party in transition. There is also a section on the \"rising stars of the party\".</p> <p>One of the concerns of the party is that, if the polls prove accurate, the Democrats are poised to make huge advances into its traditional base in the south and in western states such as Colorado. With New York and the north-east and almost all of the West Coast primarily in Democratic hands, the question is where to rebuild their base.</p> <p>The other problem is that the party is short of political \"stars\" in contrast with the Democrats, apart from Palin. The hunt for new potential leaders could shift to the younger generation, including figures such as Bobby Jindal, the governor of Louisiana.</p> <p>The Virginia meeting, to avoid accusations of being premature, is to go ahead whether McCain wins or loses. If he were to win, the discussion would turn to how conservatives can influence the new administration.</p> <p>On the agenda for the meeting, at the home of a prominent Republican, are economic, foreign and social policy. The aim is to build a new grassroots organisation, comparable to Republican efforts after Jimmy Carter won the White House for the Democrats in 1976, and a similar rebuilding by the Democrats after a wipe-out in the 1994 congressional race.</p> <p>An unnamed source involved in the planning told the Politico website, which first disclosed news of the Virginia meeting, said: \"This is going on if McCain wins, loses or has a recount - we're not planning for the loss of John McCain.\"</p> <p>The source blamed the party's decline on betrayal of conservative principles by President George Bush and Republican leaders in Congress.</p> <p>\"There's a sense that the Republican party is broken, but the conservative movement is not.\"</p> <p>Ornstein said he had heard the buzz about the Virginia meeting for some time and had spoken to some of those involved. The participants were mainly state chairman and political activists and he did not anticipate elected representatives taking part.</p> <p>\"There are a bunch of people who are planning, assuming that McCain loses, to try to shape the future of the Republican party. You are going to get a little bit of a struggle,\" Ornstein said. There will be those who argue that the party lost because it strayed from the conservative path while others will argue that the party lost the middle ground, he said.</p> <p>At the governor's conference, from November 12 to 14, speakers lined up include Charlie Crist, the governor of Florida, and a host of southern governors, as well as retired general Tommy Franks, the right-wing columnist Bill Kristol and the pollster, Frank Luntz.</p> <p>Another post-election meeting is one to be hosted by the South Carolina Republican chairman, Katon Dawson, who has invited state party leaders and others to Myrtle Beach, South Carolina to \"\"discuss the lessons learned from the 2008 campaign, what we can do better and what it will take to win in 2010\", the congressional mid-terms will be held. Dawson is among those seeking to become the next party chairman.</p>",
  "<p>It's the same story wherever we go. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/uselectionroadtrip/2008/oct/29/obama-campaign-volunteers\">Barack Obama is dominating the ground game</a> and has out organised the McCain campaign in almost every state, even states that were reliably Republican. In the critical swing state of Missouri, I spoke to David Drebes, who blogs at <a href=\"http://www.archcitychronicle.com/\">Arch City Chronicle</a> in St Louis and writes for the St Louis Business Journal and also produces a letter for lobbyists in the state. When I asked about Obama's oganisation, he said one word: \"Unbelievable\".</p> <p>\"There are people with clipboards (for the Obama campaign) everywhere,\" he said. </p> <p>And the Republican Party is worried. Last month, he spoke to a Republican lobbyist. \"He thought (Obama's organisation) was more impressive than what they've done, and they were pretty proud\" of their get out the vote efforts, David said.</p> <p>To illustrate this, he was talking to someone in rural <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monroe_County,_Missouri\">Monroe County</a> in the northeast part of the state, an area settled by Southern migrants, often referred to as Little Dixie. In this overwhelmingly white county, David said that this person ran into people going door-to-door canvassing for Obama on horseback.</p> <p>Missouri is a toss-up state, with <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2008/president/mo/missouri_mccain_vs_obama-545.html\">RealClearPolitics.com showing a statistically insignificant 0.6% advantage for Obama</a>. David said that politically people refer to Missouri as a \"miniature map of the country\". On the 'coasts' of this United States in miniature are two huge cities, St Louis and Kansas City, which are more urban, more liberal and, therefore, more Democratic. Apart from university towns like Columbia, the rest of the state in between those two cities is rural and reliably Republican. \"When you factor that all together, you've got a toss up state\", David said.</p> <p>On the other 'coast' of Missouri in Kansas City, I spoke to Eric Rogers, who writes <a href=\"http://blogkc.com/\">blogKC.com</a>. He's seeing the same thing as David. \"Barack Obama has dozens of field offices all over the state. He has opened offices in small towns that have probably never seen a Democratic field office before.\"</p> <p>Both candidates are fighting hard for the state with dueling appearances, but the strategies and turnout at their events have been very different, as <a href=\"http://blogkc.com/archives/2008/10/turnout-at-recent-presidential-visits-in-missouri/\">Eric blogged recently</a>. Obama recently held huge public rallies in Kansas City where 75,000 people are estimated to have turned out and St Louis where the crowd was even larger, an estimated 100,000. McCain held much smaller invitation only or ticketed events with only a few thousand people.</p> <p>But Eric is slightly sceptical about the ability of the Obama machine to win Missouri. Four years ago, he volunteered for the John Kerry campaign. They told volunteers how they were going to build a grassroots organisation that would rival Republicans' efforts, just as the Obama campaign has promised. But George Bush won the state by a <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/elections/2004/mo/\">comfortable 53%-46% margin</a>.</p> <p>There are signs that the Obama campaign is making good on its promise to out organise the Republicans, he said, but added, \"it will be interesting to see if this enough\".</p> <p><strong>No rallying point for social conservatives</strong></p> <p>There were other factors four years ago that might have contributed to George Bush's victory. Missouri was one of the states where an anti-gay marriage amendment rallied social conservatives. David said in that election he saw something that he'd never seen before. Usually, people vote for president and they cast fewer votes on more minor candidates and 'down-ballot' issues.</p> <p>\"There were certain places in the state where more votes cast on that constitutional amendment than there were for top of the ticket (for president),\" he said.</p> <p>There isn't a ballot initiative with the same resonance for social conservatives this year, with the possible exception of an \"English-only\" amendment. It would require all government meetings to be conducted in English. It's <a href=\"http://www.stjoenews.net/news/2008/sep/24/english-only-amendment-sparks-heated-debate/?local\">sparked some controversy</a> in areas such as St Joseph where there is a large Latino population. But as with the rest of the country, the economy has pushed everything else off the agenda, David said.</p> <p>\"It's faded into irrelevance. No one seems to be talking about it all. There has been no organised campaign. No money has been put forward to it. People seem to have forgotten about in the face of issues like the economy,\" he said.</p>",
  "<p>The sentiment can be expressed in any number of ways: 'lost the plot', 'jumped the shark', or even <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/mediamonkeyblog/2008/jun/13/indysfridgeblastsfonzsshar\">'nuked the fridge'</a>. But no matter how it's phrased, I can't keep it inside any longer. This presidential election has become a meaningless heap of tired narratives and manufactured scandals.</p> <p>I'm under no illusion that my feelings are shared by my colleagues in journalism or by my fellow American voters. After 631 days of a campaign that began with more than a dozen viable candidates, the public still appears insatiably hungry for <em>one more story</em> on Obama's two-year <a href=\"http://foro.univision.com/univision/board/message?board.id=puertorico&amp;message.id=157201\">stint as a backbench senator</a> or McCain's fixation on <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/13/us/politics/13mccain.html?partner=rssnyt\">the honour of wartime service</a>. The tales are compelling, to be sure, and after eight years of faux-country-boy George Bush, one is hard-pressed to begrudge the nation a little romance about the biographies of the presidential finalists.</p> <p>Yet politics, even in the age of limitless online dialog, remains a zero-sum game. Every minute of the news cycle spent on one plotline is a minute lost to alternative topics \u2013 or, in this case, every minute spent treating Obama, McCain, Sarah Palin and Joe the Plumber like characters on a long-running TV show is a minute lost to righting our wrecked financial ship or refining our relations with our neighbours.</p> <p>The Project for Excellence in Journalism, run by the non-partisan Pew centre, has churned out stunning though little-noticed data on the nation's obsession with irrelevant campaign narratives. For the <a href=\"http://journalism.org/node/13391\">week that ended Sunday</a>, the candidates' responses to the still-raging credit crisis accounted for only 2% of total election coverage. Obama's visit to his ailing grandmother in Hawaii got double that amount of attention.</p> <p>Is it nice that Obama cares enough to be by his beloved Toot's bedside? Sure. But why do I know his grandmother's nickname and not how he would regulate credit default swaps to prevent another Wall Street implosion? There's something wrong with this picture. </p> <p>Let's not even talk about ol' Joe the workin' man, as <a href=\"http://www.boston.com/news/politics/politicalintelligence/2008/10/mccain_ad_compa.html\">McCain might call him</a>, who dominated 8% of the campaign coverage <a href=\"http://journalism.org/node/13283\">during a week this month</a> when healthcare and Iraq each got less than 1%.</p> <p>Turning the \"most important election of our lifetime\" (if 23,700 Google hits for the term is any guide) into a procession of offbeat personalities rivalling the cast of <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0306414/\">The Wire</a> is no mean feat. We've distracted ourselves from the devolving war in Afghanistan as well as the sub-prime mess by crafting a quasi-realistic PoliticsWorld to frolic in, where Bill Ayers, Mike Wooten, Vicki Iseman and Rev. Jeremiah Wright enjoy a brief reign of relevance before drifting offstage. It's been a strange but effective form of self-medication for a nation adrift.</p> <p>On that note, I'm surprised to say I miss that Hillary Clinton character. She still makes guest appearances on PoliticsWorld, but she made for a compelling heroine/villainess hybrid during her time in the opening credits, a regular <a href=\"http://www.film.com/features/story/tv-addict-top-ten-brenda/22774949\">Brenda Walsh of Washington</a>. </p> <p>In all seriousness, no one expected the election to be a marathon of <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/28/opinion/28tue1.html?hp\">detailed comparisons</a> between McCain's tax-credit-based healthcare plan and Obama's mandate for employer-based coverage. And the candidates are as much to blame as the media for this year's recycled squabbles \u2013 particularly McCain aides, who seem to nurse a fixation on Wright, Ayers and other shadowy personae in the House of Obama.</p> <p>But there could have been an election that didn't hinge so completely on a dumbed-down distillation of two stereotypes.

  "<p>A human rights activist swept to power today in the first democratic presidential polls in the Maldives, ousting from office the man who once imprisoned him and prompting jubilant scenes on the streets of the Indian Ocean island's capital Male.</p> <p>Mohamed 'Anni' Nasheed, a former Amnesty International prisoner of conscience who founded the Maldivian Democratic Party (MDP) in 2003, secured 54 per cent of the vote \u2013 beating Maumoon Abdul Gayoom, Asia's longest serving leader, in the run-off election.</p> <p>In a bitter campaign marked by personal animosity, Nasheed - a Sunni Muslim \u2013 was said to be spreading Christianity in the Islamic nation via his links with Britain's Conservative party. However his message of change coupled with a call for social and economic liberalism lifted him above the fray.</p> <p>The results mark the end of the three-decade rule of 71-year-old Maldivian strongman, Gayoom, who won the last six elections, never having before faced an opponent. Gayoom has had Nasheed thrown into jail several times over the last six years. </p> <p>Following the results, Gayoom told the nation in a live concession speech that he fully supported Nasheed:</p> <p>\"I accept the results of the ... run-off election and I respectfully congratulate Mr. Mohamed Nasheed and his party.\"</p> <p>Thousands of MDP supporters flocked to Mal\u00e9, waving yellow flags while others rejoiced at the beachfront promenade where they had camped for days in support of the opposition. Nasheed, who had emerged as a unity candidate for the five opposition parties, said he wanted a \"peaceful transition. I want my supporters to be calm.\"</p> <p>The archipelago of 300,000 people on 1,196 islands will officially get its new president on November 11, exactly 30 years after the Gayoom \"sultanate\" began. Until 2004, opposition parties were banned and it was not until violent riots broke out in August 2005, protesting Nasheed's arrest that month, that the country was set on the road to democracy.</p> <p>Autocracy did bring wealth to the string of islands. President Gayoom single-handedly built the modern Maldivian economy that rests on high-end tourism, with resorts overlooking white sand beaches and crystal clear waters where hotels charge thousands of pounds a night.</p> <p>Its per capital income of $2,200 (just under \u00a31,350) made the Maldives the wealthiest country in South Asia. </p> <p>But the figures masked huge inequalities, rampant drug abuse and corruption amid crumbling public infrastructure. \"People have seen a tiny group of people get very, very rich in the last thirty years. Meanwhile we have no communications between our islands. Our health system is in a bad way,\" said Naseem Mohamed, a spokesman for the MDP.</p> <p>\"People wanted a change from all this\". Mr Mohamed said that, although most people in the Maldives practised a relaxed form of Islam, there was an unspoken concern about the \"explosive mix of poverty and terrorism\". He said that social discord led to religious extremism, resulting in a bomb in a tourist spot last year: </p> <p>\"With our economy so dependent on tourism and the economic slowdown there is a concern the situation could turn volatile.\" </p> <p>Analysts say that the real issue for the Maldives was the period of political uncertainty before elections to the new 74-member parliament next March. The parliament has considerable powers \u2013 including the right to block presidential cabinet appointments.</p> <p>\"It is what people like Nasheed wanted\u2026 a check on presidential power. But there needs to be time to allow the politics to stabilise after Gayoom's one-man show. The opposition has everybody from the democrats to the conservative Islamic parties. It'll be hard to keep them together,\" said P Sahadevan, professor of South Asian studies at Delhi's Jawaharlal Nehru University.</p> <h2>Profile - the victor</h2> <p>Known throughout the Maldives by his nickname, Anni, Mohamed Nasheed founded the Maldives Democratic Party in 2003 while in exile in Sri Lanka and Britain. He took his inspiration from India's Gandhi, preaching non-violence as the only route to freedom.</p> <p>He was acutely aware that his country would explode without the safety valve of democracy. Although he graduated from Liverpool with a degree in maritime engineering, Anni was best known as a fiery journalist \u2013 and quickly ran foul of the authorities. Imprisoned in the 1990s for giving an interview to the international media, Mr Nasheed spent 18 months in solitary confinement, tortured at the hands of security services. He was deprived of sleep and water, fed food with crushed glass and still has a limp from being chained to a chair outside for 12 days. He became an Amnesty Prisoner of Conscience in 1997.</p> <p>But he never lost hope in democracy. After being elected to parliament in 1999, he lost his seat in 2001 after he was prosecuted on trumped-up charges of stealing. A thorn in the side of President Gayoom, Anni has spent a total of six years either in jail or work camps. He left the Maldives in 2003 and returned in April 2005 but was arrested again the following August, sparking off civil unrest. </p> <p>By 2004, the tide was turning in the Maldives \u2013 and Anni was winning the battle of ideas. In response the government declared a state of emergency. He finally managed to register the MDP in the Maldives in June 2005.</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/sarahpalin\">Sarah Palin</a> today gave a rare policy speech, reciting Republican themes on energy independence in a late-hour bid to slow <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/barackobama\">Barack Obama</a>'s momentum.</p> <p>The speech, which came late in the campaign season for a policy address, contained no new details. It was notable for Palin's tentative delivery, a marked contrast from her enthusiastic and energetic stump attacks on Obama several times a day.</p> <p>The speech came in a week in which McCain and Palin insiders have engaged in numerous rounds of recrimination in the news media, with one side blaming the other for the Republican ticket's inability to make significant gains in the polls in the final week of the campaign. Democrats say the speech may reflect discord within <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/johnmccain\">John McCain</a>'s camp - a teleprompter speech on energy is a safe use of the vice-presidential candidate, leaving her little opportunity for embarrassing gaffes or off-message remarks.</p> <p>Palin's talk before a Toledo, Ohio solar power manufacturer, may mark an early effort to position her for the 2012 presidential race, should she and McCain lose on Tuesday. Palin is governor of oil- and gas-rich Alaska, and she and the Republicans have sought to portray her as an expert on energy policy.</p> <p>Palin said that a McCain administration would boost domestic energy production and curtail the country's dependence on foreign oil. Those are both stated goals also of Democratic candidate Barack Obama.</p> <p>Departing numerous times from her prepared remarks, Palin spoke of taking on the \"good ol' boys\" of Alaskan energy politics - the Republican party old guard and the entrenched oil companies - and signing a pipeline deal without their support.</p> <p>Palin called for increased drilling of domestic oil supply, more nuclear and coal-fired energy capacity and development of renewable energy sources such as wind and solar power. She lambasted Obama and his vice-presidential nominee <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/joebiden\">Joe Biden</a> for what she described as their reluctance to embrace those proposals. The Democrats have said they are open to expanded nuclear power and offshore drilling but only with appropriate environmental safeguards.</p> <p>Palin said that by refusing to back increased domestic production without qualification, the Democrats encourage environmentally unsafe production abroad.</p> <p>\"John McCain and I, we're determined to set this country firmly on a path toward energy independence,\" she said. \"America has the resources to achieve this vital goal. We certainly have the ingenuity. And John McCain and I, if we are elected, we will supply the political will to finally get this done.\"</p> <p>In a response released by the Obama campaign, Ohio's governor, Ted Strickland, criticised McCain's proposal to cut corporate income tax rates, which he said would benefit the companies who trade in middle eastern oil.</p> <p>\"In a bit of rare straight talk, Sarah Palin attacked her own running mate's record today by blaming our oil addiction on 30 years of failure' in Washington,\" Strickland said. \"John McCain was there for twenty-six of those years, during which he voted against alternative sources of energy and stood with oil industry lobbyists instead.\"</p>",
  "<p>John McCain is in danger of suffering an embarrassing loss in his home state of Arizona, according to a shock new poll released today.</p> <p>Democrats are seizing upon the results of today's Arizona State University poll, which found McCain on 46% and Obama on 44%, to depict the Republican as struggling to hang on to even his faithful backers.</p> <p>McCain held a 7% lead over Obama in Arizona just one month ago and a double-digit polling advantage earlier this year. Although the state McCain has represented in Congress for 26 years has slightly more registered Republican voters than Democrats, today's poll gave Obama a 20% lead with Arizona independent voters.</p> <p>Only three presidential candidates in US history have won an election while losing their state of residence. The loss of a home state became an especially harsh political prospect after Al Gore lost Tennessee in 2000, prompting public hand wringing over what might have been.</p> <p>Republican spokesman Jeff Sadosky defended the candidate's prospects in a statement to Politico.com. \"John McCain has never lost an election in Arizona, and this one will be no different, regardless of Obama's attempt to buy the election with millions of dollars in advertising,\" Sadosky said.</p> <p>Yet even McCain's fellow Arizona senator and close ally, Jon Kyl, offered a subtly dire prediction in a Sunday interview with one of the state's local newspapers.</p> <p>Asked whether Arizona, long known for its conservative ethos, could become a swing state as new residents change its demographics, Kyl foreshadowed a McCain defeat.<br> \"[U]nfortunately, I think John McCain might be added to that long list of Arizonans who ran for president but never were elected \u2026 Maybe we'll be able to say, Arizona's the only state where your child can't grow up to be president,\" Kyl told the Daily Star.</p> <p>Kyl closed by adding: \"So let's hope that doesn't happen.\" But the caveat did not stop Democrats from circulating the critical quote, which Kyl later claimed was taken out of context.</p> <p>Today's poll is a departure from the recent average of Arizona surveys, which finds McCain with a lead of more than 6%. Obama's advantage in his home state of Illinois has reached as high as 25%, according to the most recent polls.</p>",
  "<p>Big campaign donors typically come with deep pockets and influence. But in Illinois this election cycle, no one not running for office himself has given more to the nation's federal campaigns than Shi Sheng Hao, a virtual unknown in business and political circles.</p> <p>Before September 2007, Hao's name had never appeared in the 15-year-old federal database of campaign contributors. Since then, however, his donations have topped $120,000 - including $70,100 on a single June day to Republican presidential candidate John McCain.</p> <p>Over the same time frame, a network of Hao relatives has kicked in more. The take from this group over the last 13 months exceeds $269,000, most of it to McCain and the Republican National Committee, records show.</p> <p>Hao didn't register to vote at the north-west suburban address attached to his donations until October 2007, a month after he wrote his first political check, $25,000 to the RNC.</p> <p>The circumstances surrounding Hao's sudden and prolific political activism are curious and his whereabouts unclear. His name isn't listed on property records or the mailbox at the unassuming tract home listed on his donations. Hao lives \"overseas\", insisted a man who answered the door at the Roselle home recently. The man declined to identify himself.</p> <p>The story of Hao - whose varied roster of business associates appears to include a Taiwanese government investment arm as well as the mastermind of a decade-old Democratic fundraising scandal - is an eyebrow-raiser in the current election climate.</p> <p>Ethnic Chinese donors became an issue in the battle for the Democratic nomination last year because some didn't seem to live where they claimed on contribution records. Now, Republicans are raising questions about the authenticity of many small donations Democrat Barack Obama has received from abroad.</p> <p>Sheila Krumholz, the executive director of the Washington-based Center for Responsive Politics, said the timing of the Hao-related contributions appeared troubling, though there could be a plausible explanation. \"Large contributions from people who have never given previously do generally provoke questions about who they are and what they're up to and most importantly, what they're looking for,\" said Krumholz, whose non-partisan group closely tracks political donations. \"The public needs to be concerned because there are fraudulent donations and persons use them to gain influence and access in Washington.\"</p> <p>McCain spokesman Brian Rogers said Hao was not a \"major donor\" and \"not a part of this campaign in terms of fundraising,\" but declined to discuss him further or address the campaign's procedures for vetting donors. RNC spokesman Danny Diaz said he would not respond to questions from the Tribune, contending the newspaper was biased against McCain.</p> <p>So who is Shi Sheng Hao and what are his means and motives for becoming a mega-donor? No one answers a telephone listed in his name in the 630 area code and there's no answering machine. Messages left for him by phone and email with several relatives went unanswered.</p> <p>But this much can be gleaned from public records:</p> <p>Donation disclosures list his occupation as a businessman with entities identified only by slightly different acronyms: ADECC, AAEC, A.A.E.C.C. On some he is also listed as president of American Chinese Entertainment Ltd.</p> <p>Hao and his wife, Hsin-Ning, declared bankruptcy in 1995, at the time using the Roselle, Ill., home as an address and listing as a business a firm called Asian American Environmental Control.</p> <p>Hao holds an Illinois driver's license that lists his address as the Roselle home, but property records show the four-bedroom house has been owned since 1992 by Robert and Jen Chi and their last name is on the mailbox. Contacted at the Des Plaines marketing firm where she works, Jen Chi said she didn't want to discuss Hao, though she said she knew how to get in touch with him and would have him call the Tribune. He never did.</p> <p>\"I don't know anything about his business,\" said Chi, who herself gave $15,000 to the RNC the week after Hao's first donation. \"I don't want to be stuck in the middle.\" Hao's wife, Hsin-Ning, also used the Roselle address when she made a $25,000 contribution to the RNC last year. In September, however, she listed a Taipei address on a $2,300 contribution to the campaign fund of former Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton.</p> <p>There is no record in business databases of American Chinese Entertainment Ltd, the firm listed in some Hao donation records. However, an Asian American Entertainment Corp, was incorporated early this year in California with a Shi Sheng Hao as president. Government records show that firm and at least two other Hao companies have connections to the family of Gene and Nora Lum, onetime prominent Democratic fundraisers in the Asian-American community who were convicted in 1997 of making political donations through illegal straw donors.</p> <p>A Taiwanese firm with a nearly identical name as Hao's new California company, Asian American Entertainment Ltd, is also headed by a Shi Sheng Hao. That firm has been embroiled in a lengthy legal battle in Las Vegas over a soured partnership in an application for a casino license in Macau, the former Portuguese colony now part of the People's Republic of China.</p> <p>A court filing in that case described Hao's firm as a business affiliate of the China Industrial Development Bank, a finance arm of the Taiwanese government. Hao is listed as a resident of Taiwan in corporate papers filed in the case.</p> <p>It is not clear whether the Shi Sheng Hao in the lawsuit and the California ventures is the same Shi Sheng Hao using the Roselle address. But public records point to numerous coincidences, including corporations with similar names and an overlap of investors. Some political donations from the Roselle address also refer to Hao by a nickname, Marshall, the same nickname given for Hao in the Las Vegas court action.</p> <p>Federal records indicate a pattern of large and coordinated donations from Hao, relatives and associates. Collectively, eight of them gave a total of $130,000 to the RNC in late September to early October of last year.</p> <p><strong>LOOPHOLE</strong><br>Given federal contribution limits, how can Shi Sheng Hao give $70,100 to John McCain?</p> <p>In general, individuals are barred from giving more than $2,300 to the main fundraising committee of presidential candidates in a primary race and another $2,300 in a general election.</p> <p>But the law has a loophole exploited by Democrats and Republicans alike. Barack Obama and John McCain each control what are called joint fundraising committees that are allowed to put the arm on individual donors for tens of thousands of dollars. Between them, Obama and McCain have raised $300 million that way.</p> <p>The joint committees act as funnels, distributing money they raise to other political committees which, by law, aren't allowed to coordinate with each other on how the funds are spent. That's a feeble restriction since experienced political operatives know how to promote a candidate without comparing notes with colleagues, said Massie Ritsch, of the non-partisan Center for Responsive Politics.</p>",
  "<p>Bill and Hillary Clinton today begin a multi-state tour to rally last-minute support for Barack Obama ahead of next Tuesday's election. </p> <p>The Democrats are dispatching the party's top arsenal of star power to solidify Obama's support in several key states, including Ohio and Florida, and hoping they can bring around voters who backed Hillary Clinton in the primaries and Bill Clinton in past presidential elections.</p> <p>Although Obama has arguably eclipsed them, the Clintons are two of the most popular Democratic politicians in the nation. The former president showed during the 16-month primary battle that he could still draw a crowd.</p> <p>The trip is Bill Clinton's first extended effort on behalf of Barack Obama's race against John McCain. The former president's relationship with the Illinois senator reportedly remains testy, although the two met recently in Clinton's New York City office and posed for a photograph together.</p> <p>Hillary Clinton, a New York senator, has been more conciliatory, at least in public. She has campaigned for Obama, and appears enthusiastic about his candidacy. Clinton won roughly 18 million votes in the primaries, and her already considerable influence in the Democratically-controlled Senate is likely to grow if she campaigns hard for Obama and he wins.</p> <p>Today, Hillary Clinton campaigns in the state of New York for Democratic congressional candidates. She does not have to run for re-election herself until 2012, but may be eyeing a run for the governor's seat in 2010, and this trip would help build support for that.</p> <p>In the coming week, Hillary Clinton will campaign in Ohio, Florida and Virginia for Obama and vice-presidential running mate Joe Biden. </p> <p>Bill Clinton will campaign for Obama today in Pennsylvania and Florida, and attend a rally with Obama in Florida.</p> <p>Tomorrow, he heads to Youngstown and Toledo, Ohio, two depressed working-class cities where Hillary Clinton enjoyed ample support in the state's primary election. While polls show Obama beating McCain by roughly five percentage points, white working class voters continue to resist Obama, and the campaign hopes Bill Clinton will help bring them aboard. Toledo is home to Joe the Plumber, a labourer whom McCain has used a mascot to illustrate the candidates competing economic policies.</p> <p>Bill Clinton then travels to Minnesota to campaign for Democratic Senate candidate Al Franken, a comedian challenging incumbent Republican Norm Coleman. On Saturday, Bill Clinton will campaign in West Virginia. Voters in that state are fond of the Clintons. Bill Clinton was the last Democratic presidential candidate to win the state, in 1996, and Hillary Clinton won West Virginia's primary by 41 percentage points. Polls show Obama running about 11 percentage points behind McCain there. </p> <p>On Saturday, Bill Clinton is scheduled to campaign for Obama in New Jersey, where Obama enjoys a solid lead in polls, and in New Hampshire on Sunday.<br> In the last two presidential elections, Bill Clinton did not campaign heavily for Democratic nominees Al Gore, his vice-president, and John Kerry. Among other things, Clinton was busy that year drumming up support for Hillary Clinton's Senate race in New York.</p> <p>In autumn 2004, Bill Clinton suffered heart trouble and underwent major surgery as Kerry's campaign against George Bush entered its final stages.</p>",
  "<p>A <a href=\"http://www.azcentral.com/arizonarepublic/news/articles/2008/10/29/20081029asupoll1029.html\">new poll </a> from that state's flagship paper shows McCain with just a two-point lead over Obama, 46-44%. I find it pretty difficult to believe that McCain is going to lose Arizona. Still, I think Obama ought to arrange a weekend rally there for Saturday or Sunday.<br> Here's why. The Obama campaign, as I've been writing for weeks now, has been properly not-too-obsessed with short-term news-cycles victories. But I think this is one case where you want that kind of win. A large rally in McCain's backyard will get tremendous television coverage and will drive two days' worth of speculation on the cable nets about how McCain's situation has become so desperate that he can't even hold his home state. It will give Obama the smell of a winner, and McCain the odor of a loser. And here's why that's important. It's hard for ideologically committed people to believe, but there is a chunk of voters who have no such commitments and who just want to vote for the winner. </p> <p>They don't see a presidential election as that different from any other competition - the American Idol finale, the Rose Bowl - in which they don't have a strong rooting interest. They just want to be able to say, \"I voted for the guy who won.\" Makes them feel like they called it. If Obama pulls off a big rally in Arizona, those voters will watch the coverage and tell themselves, \"This is the guy who's gonna win.\" Could be worth a point or two in some states.</p>",
  "<p>Barack Obama and John McCain are the two contenders in America's presidential election this year, but the campaign has also been dominated by two very different women, Hillary Clinton and Sarah Palin. Indeed, many observers believe that women will determine the election's outcome. So, to paraphrase Sigmund Freud: \"What do American women want?\"<br> Until the 1960s, American women were more likely than men to support Republicans. In the 1980 election, a different gender gap emerged, with women more likely than men to support Democrats. In 1996, women's support for Bill Clinton was 14 percentage points higher than men's, and in 2000, women favoured Al Gore over George Bush by 12 points. But, since 1996, the political gender gap has been halved. The women gravitating back to the Republicans, according to conventional wisdom, are <a href=\"http://www.time.com/time/columnist/klein/article/0,9565,421149,00.html\">\"security moms\"</a> - suburban wives and mothers who started worrying about their families' safety after the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/09/09/AR2008090903045_pf.html\">McCain's selection of Palin</a> was an attempt to appeal to these mothers and to <a href=\"http://www.upi.com/Top_News/2008/09/22/Poll_Palin_helping_GOP_with_women/UPI-65911222090518/\">pick up votes from women</a> disappointed about Clinton's loss.<br> In fact, the shift to Republicans since 2001 was largely confined to southern white women. In the nation as a whole, notes political scientist Karen Kaufmann, 50% of mothers with children voted for Bush in 2000, and this actually dipped to 49% in 2004. But southern white women, who were much more likely than southern white men to support Bill Clinton in 1996 and Al Gore in 2000, were less likely than southern men to support Democrat John Kerry in 2004. There is now a bigger difference between the voting preferences of southern white women and white women in the rest of the country than between men and women. </p> <p>Outside the south, female voters are less likely to be hawkish on foreign policy and more likely to support spending on health, education and other social-welfare programmes. Women also tend to be more sympathetic to efforts to reduce income inequality, although African-American men are just as \"compassionate\" on these issues as African-American women. </p> <p>Can either party really win by appealing to gender? Women do like to see other women emerge as leaders. When the Democrats nominated Geraldine Ferraro for vice-president in 1984, she attracted huge crowds, just as Palin does today. Shortly after Palin's nomination, one in three white women said that they would be more likely to vote for McCain. </p> <p>At first glance, it seems reasonable that political parties might be able to translate women's gender consciousness into a unified voting bloc. Women do have some common interests, especially with regard to controlling their own reproductive decisions and protecting themselves against sexual exploitation and rape. Most women also recognise and resent that the media judge them more harshly than they judge men. And, because women generally expect to bear most of the responsibility for nurturing children, they tend to evaluate social policies through this lens. </p> <p>But how women address gender-based reproductive, sexual and family interests varies by their class position and their personal options outside the family. Women who compete in the labour market generally support efforts to challenge sexual double standards and vigorously prosecute sexual harassment. But women who are more dependent upon a husband often accept a double standard that stresses female purity and male gallantry. These women believe that adherence to stereotyped gender roles protects \"good\" women.<br> Similarly, women know that they are usually paid less and have less chance for professional advancement than men. But they may choose different strategies for coping with these disadvantages. Those who can or must support themselves outside marriage tend to favour expanding economic opportunities for women and to oppose laws and values that give familial authority to husbands and fathers. By contrast, women with less economic autonomy may feel that their interests are best served by emphasising family hierarchies and reciprocal duties. Wifely deference may be seen as reinforcing the husband's obligation to support the family. Even on issues like contraception and abortion, women's positions are sometimes influenced by conflicting assessments. Women who plan to postpone marriage while building their careers are far more likely to want to ensure that they can avoid or end an unintended pregnancy. But women who believe that their best hope for security is to find a husband often tell interviewers that if other women are allowed to escape the biological consequences of having sex, men will be less willing to offer marriage in return for it. Likewise, women who want to stay home with their children tend to favour tax breaks or family subsidies, whereas women who want to combine work and family are more likely to support expanded childcare and guaranteed parental work leave. </p> <p>In the long run, these differences <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/08/17/AR2006081701484.html\">outweigh</a> women's commonalities. <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/10/24/AR2008102402698.html?hpid=topnews\">Palin's approval ratings among women fell</a> as they learned more about what she stands for. The main reason some women - and even more men - are more likely to vote for a McCain-Palin combination is not because of Palin's gender, but because her presence on the ticket reassures social conservatives of McCain's willingness to accommodate their agenda.<br> Palin's nomination, however, could have an unintended consequence on the gender views of social conservatives. This summer, the Pew Research Centre found that <a href=\"http://pewresearch.org/pubs/950/mommy-wars\">only 20% of Republicans said they would support a female candidate who had school-age children</a>. Today, those same Republicans seem to find nothing to criticise in the fact that Palin returned to work three days after the birth of her last child. In supporting a woman's choice to combine motherhood with a demanding job, social conservatives now seem to agree with long-time feminists. </p> <p><em>In cooperation with <a href=\"http://www.project-syndicate.org/\">Project Syndicate</a>, 2008.</em></p>",

  "<p>Contrary to published reports, the presidential election won't happen until November 4. Those hundreds of thousands of robo-calls, the blizzard of TV ads, or other unforeseen events could propel a Republican team to the White House, leaving president-elect John McCain to assemble a cabinet to run the government. (See Barack Obama's potential green team <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/oct/30/network\">here</a>)</p> <p>The global economic crisis, for the moment, is dominating the headlines, but there is no doubt the next president will have to grapple with daunting energy and environmental issues fairly quickly once in office. For starters, fuel prices could careen upward again, and a post-Kyoto summit between 189 countries to hash out new greenhouse-gas reduction targets is set for Copenhagen in late 2009. </p> <p>McCain would need to decide quickly whom he would trust to navigate his climate, energy, and conservation policies through the tricky shoals of environmental groups, powerful Democrats in Congress, conservative Republicans, and industry barons. Not to mention the leaders of rapidly developing China and India ...</p> <p>So who would staff a McCain administration's environmental posts? Grand Old Party (GOP) Republican insiders, industry lobbyists, and think tankers talked to Grist about names being mentioned for a McCain government.</p> <h2>Secretary of Energy</h2> <p><strong>Pete Domenici</strong><br>Right-wingers who still challenge global warming, or at least linking it to human activities, say they don't have a glacier's chance in hell of being heard in a McCain administration on energy. But if they did, they'd pick Sen. Pete Domenici (R-N.M.) to lead the Department of Energy. Domenici, New Mexico's retiring elder statesman, is a backer of nuclear power who's a favorite among conservatives and industry groups, but they acknowledge he probably wouldn't get the nod. Politically, Domenici's tangential involvement in the U.S. attorneys firings wouldn't help him win confirmation, but more practically, he announced last year that he's suffering from a degenerative brain disease.</p> <p><strong>Heather Wilson</strong><br>Another New Mexican who gets mentioned is Rep. Heather Wilson (R), a Domenici prot\u00e9g\u00e9 who lost the GOP primary this year to run for Domenici's seat. McCain, who is pushing construction of nuclear power plants, might find Wilson hard to dismiss. Women and minorities are often traditionally picked for Cabinet posts. A former Rhodes Scholar, she has served on the House Energy and Commerce Committee, where she supported nuclear energy, and on the Select Committee on Intelligence, which monitors nuclear weapons. Her district is home to the Sandia National Laboratories, and she is an Air Force veteran. \"From her background in national security, she knows the nuclear issues that make up much of Energy's jurisdiction,\" said Jack Pitney, politics professor at Claremont McKenna College.</p> <p>But environmentalists and others might fight her appointment. Wilson voted to scrap critical habitat for endangered species, and against a multimillion conservation fund that New Mexico farmers backed. The League of Conservation Voters put her on its \"Dirty Dozen\" list in 2002, citing her support for uranium industry practices that contaminate groundwater, and for mining company polluters.</p> <p><strong>James Inhofe</strong><br>Under their breath, industry groups invoke Sen. Jim Inhofe's (R-Okla.) name for this post. But it's hard to see an expanded Democratic Senate majority voting to confirm one of the most outspoken climate-change skeptics.</p> <h2>Environmental Protection Agency Administrator</h2> <p>The nation's top pollution cop, the EPA's mission is to protect human health and the environment under the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Superfund law, and other regulations. Many career staff, scientists, and environmentalists say that under Stephen Johnson that mission has been impossible to carry out, citing his refusal to quickly act on a U.S. Supreme Court order to evaluate greenhouse gases as a public risk, among other decisions. Industry groups say he's gotten a bad rap, but know the winds of change are blowing.</p> <p>\"I think industry groups are all going to have concerns about anybody McCain will pick. In my mind it's going to be Lieberman, or somebody like that,\" said Frank Maisano, an energy specialist at the law firm of Bracewell &amp; Giuliani (yes, that Giuliani). \"Somebody like Sherry Boehlert who's a real champion of the environment.\"</p> <p><strong>Sherwood Boehlert</strong><br>Sherwood Boehlert, who retired last year after 24 years as a New York congressman, is still widely respected by Washington insiders as a consummate moderate Republican. He spent his entire career on the House Science Committee and is best known for his environmental policy work, including helping to design a pioneering cap-and-trade program to control acid rain, fighting for higher fuel-economy standards, and pushing to fund science and math education. He currently sits on the board of the bipartisan Alliance for Climate Protection, headed by former vice president Al Gore. </p> <p><strong>Joe Lieberman</strong><br>Many feel that Sen. Joe Lieberman (I-Conn.) deserves his pick of plum administration jobs for faithful support of his Senate colleague. As coauthor with McCain of Congress' first attempt at a cap-and-trade program for greenhouse-gas emissions, he could make a good EPA administrator - or perhaps energy secretary.</p> <p><strong>Christopher Shays</strong><br>Rep. Christopher Shays (R-Conn.) shares McCain's positions on many environmental issues, including developing wind, geothermal, and biofuel energy, exploring for oil off the coast, and building new nuclear plants. He coauthored a bipartisan bill to improve vehicle fuel efficiency, promote renewable energy, and repeal some tax breaks for fossil-fuel industries.</p> <p><strong>William Reilly</strong><br>William Reilly, a longtime director at DuPont and former president of the World Wildlife Fund, is an investment capitalist who still wins kudos for his tenure at EPA under the first President Bush. In 2007, he pulled off a coup through the leveraged buyout of TXU, which reduced plans for a dozen new coal-fired power plants to three. </p> <p><strong>Christine Todd Whitman</strong><br>Christine Todd Whitman, the former New Jersey governor and later EPA administrator during much of George W. Bush's first term, is a woman who could deliver the message loudly that a McCain administration would not be the same as a Bush administration when it comes to energy and the environment.</p> <p><strong>Mary Gade</strong><br>Mary Gade said she was forced to quit as EPA administrator in the Midwest after tangling with Dow Chemical Co. over dioxin contamination. She is seen by many as a poster child for current agency abuses. She's also a Republican and corporate attorney who understands how EPA works.</p> <p><strong>David McIntosh</strong><br>Conservatives say David McIntosh, a Newt Gingrich Republican who gave up his House seat for an unsuccessful run for Indiana governor back in 2000, would be dandy, while environmentalists say he would be a doozy. McIntosh, now a D.C. law partner, served as executive director of former vice president Dan Quayle's Council for Competitiveness, where he worked to roll back environmental regulations and push a rewrite of the Clean Air Act that would allow polluters to increase emissions without notifying the public.</p> <h2>Secretary of Agriculture</h2> <p>This position executes farming and ranching policy (obviously), promoting agricultural production and trade. But it also administers ethanol subsidies and handles food safety and hunger prevention, including the food-stamp and organic-food-labeling programs. And don't forget that the Forest Service falls under this department, overseeing nearly 300,000 square miles of national forests.</p> <p><strong>Calvin Dooley</strong><br>Conservatives and industry representatives say if McCain is serious about appointing Democrats to high posts, this would be a good spot. They drool over Calvin Dooley, a former Democratic congressman from California's Central Valley who understands agribusiness issues. He was previously head of the Food Products Association and the Grocery Manufacturers Association, two major food-industry trade groups, and he's currently CEO of the American Chemistry Council. But he may be making too nice of a salary at his new job to be lured away for government service.</p> <p><strong>James Leach</strong><br>Some environmentalists, on the other hand, see a Republican they like. Jim Leach, a 30-year Iowa congressman who was defeated in 2006, is now interim director of Harvard's Institute of Politics, on leave from Princeton where he's a professor of public and international affairs. He \"was very much interested in reform and good government, and would not be susceptible to the kinds of political pressures brought to bear on farm policy,\" said Jim DiPeso, policy director for Republicans for Environmental Protection. But that endorsement speech Leach gave for Obama at the Democratic National Convention might dim his chances, not to mention his current job as leader of the campaign finance reform group Common Cause.</p> <p><strong>Ben Nelson</strong><br>Nebraska Sen. Ben Nelson is another heartland Democrat who tends to be in line with McCain on a number of issues, particularly climate change. But they don't see eye to eye on ethanol subsidies, which McCain famously told Iowa voters he would cut. Taking a job in a McCain administration would give Nebraska's Republican governor the chance to appoint a GOP replacement, which could factor into Nelson's decision making, particularly if losing his seat would deny Senate Democrats the 60-vote supermajority needed to truly command the Senate.</p> <p><strong>Mark Sanford</strong><br>South Carolina Gov. Mark Sanford (R) wins praise from some who note he shares McCain's views on farm subsidies, but others say South Carolina is too far from the nation's corn fields.</p> <p><strong>Terry Everett</strong><br>Alabama Rep. Terry Everett (R) is from the South, not the Plains states or the West, but \"he knows ag backwards and forwards\" because of his long tenure on the House Agriculture Committee, said Myron Ebell, director of energy and global warming policy at the Competitive Enterprise Institute.</p> <p><strong>Edward T. Schafer</strong><br>\"Why not keep the current guy [Schafer] in place?\" suggested Maisano of Bracewell &amp; Giuliani. \"He just came into the job a year or two ago.\" Well, the current agriculture secretary's chances of holding onto his job might be harmed by those E. coli outbreaks.</p> <h2>Secretary of the Interior</h2> <p>The nation's landlord, the Interior Department manages 500 million acres of land and the oil-rich Outer Continental Shelf, overseeing not just oil supplies but coal, natural gas, wind, solar, and geothermal too. The department also administers much of the West's water supply, national parks, relations with the nation's tribes, and protection of endangered species. Traditionally headed by a well-known Westerner, Interior has endured embarrassments in recent years, including meddling by a high-ranking deputy on endangered-species protections that allegedly could have affected her family farm, and drunken sexcapades by Minerals Management Service employees hobnobbing with industry representatives.</p> <p><strong>Dirk Kempthorne</strong><br>There's been some speculation that McCain might just keep current Interior Secretary Dirk Kempthorne in place. \"That would not be smart in light of the departmental scandals,\" said Pitney at Claremont McKenna College. Environmentalists agree, saying he has protected fewer endangered species than James Watt, is a strong backer of oil-shale leasing in the Rockies, and supported polluting industries as Idaho governor. They say he has done little to clean up agency shenanigans.</p> <p>Nonsense, says Maisano of Bracewell &amp; Giuliani. \"Kempthorne doesn't have an ounce of any responsibility for those scandals; in fact he's been part of the team breaking them up.\" Maisano and others say Kempthorne knows D.C. and the West well (as a former Idaho governor and U.S. senator). Kempthorne has come up to speed on the controversial issues facing Interior, including offshore oil drilling, the proposed listing of the polar bear as endangered, wind power leases, and coal mining permits. He is also as passionate about national parks as McCain. In fact, says Maisano, \"I would think Kempthorne might be more comfortable with the McCain camp than the Bush camp.\"</p> <p><strong>Jon Huntsman, Jr.</strong><br>Utah's Jon Huntsman, Jr. (R), another Western governor who is the son of a chemical magnate, would be more palatable to some. He has been more moderate than expected, and wants Utah to reduce fuel and energy consumption. He is also concerned about nuclear waste being stored in his state, which might raise red flags for McCain.</p> <p><strong>Barbara Cubin</strong><br>Right-wingers say it is vital for McCain to remember that to win and keep Republican support in the West, he needs to select a rural, lands-rights supporter \"who knows something about the history of federal lands and what the problems really are,\" said Ebell of the Competitive Enterprise Institute. \"Someone from the intermountain West like Gale Norton, but who is not an urbanite like her.\" Rep. Barbara Cubin (R-Wyo.), a pro-mining, rural Republican who is pushing a bill that would require new refineries to be permitted within 90 days, would be ideal for them.</p> <p><strong>Wayne Allard</strong><br>Colorado's Wayne Allard (R), a veterinarian by trade who is retiring from the Senate, also would fit the bill for lands-rights GOP'ers.</p> <p><strong>Wayne Gilchrist</strong><br>Surprisingly, environmentalists and industry reps alike mention Maryland Rep. Wayne Gilchrist, a nine-term congressman who this year was defeated for reelection in the GOP primary by a right-wing conservative. Gilchrist is a senior member of the House Natural Resources Committee, and he worked for the Forest Service in Idaho for a brief period. But Ebell says it would be ridiculous to have an East Coaster running Interior, no matter how liked he may be inside the Beltway for protecting Chesapeake Bay. The real deal-killer could be his endorsement of Obama, though.</p> <h2>Bonus Position: Energy/Climate Czar (or Czarina)</h2> <p>The 2008 oil spike proved how politically potent energy issues can be. A President McCain might seek to demonstrate a firm hand by appointing a top White House official to coordinate administration policy on energy, with climate change also tacked onto his or her portfolio.</p> <p><strong>James Woolsey</strong><br>Jim Woolsey, the former CIA director turned climate-change and renewable-energy wonk, was hired by McCain during the primary season as a senior adviser on these issues. Some say he's the leading candidate for an energy czar job because he knows global politics so well and is a formidable advocate for domestic energy production as a security policy, not to mention for electric cars. Woolsey has already served under four U.S. presidents in a variety of roles. It would be interesting for the one-time head of the nation's secretive spy agency to sit down with world ministers to hammer out climate-change policy. \"I'm sure he can disarm them,\" quipped one Republican strategist. </p> <p><strong>Sarah Palin</strong><br>Sarah Palin, who has already said she'd like to handle the energy portfolio as vice president, might pull rank and keep the energy czar job for herself. Somebody needs to pick up where Dick Cheney left off, property-rights advocates and climate-change skeptics say. Environmentalists say not a chance. Palin has sued the federal government to stop listing of polar bears as an endangered species and pushed for more oil and gas drilling, among other moves. \"I think Sarah Palin would be great,\" said Ebell of CEI.</p> <p><strong><br>Arnold Schwarzenegger</strong><br>California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger (R) is termed out as California governor in 2010, can't be president because he wasn't born in the United States, and is looking for greener pastures. He's got megawatt star power and hands-on experience crafting an ambitious climate plan.</p> <p>\"I can't think of a better energy czar than Arnold Schwarzenegger,\" said DiPeso of Republicans for Environmental Protection. He said that while the \"Governator\" could run for the Senate, \"I don't think he'd be interested. He's the sort of guy who likes to be in charge. \u2026 The best job for the Terminator is to hold a high-level executive position. He's demonstrated an interest in the issue, and he's got the policy right. There wouldn't be any on-the-job training there. He's done the bipartisan cracking of heads and gotten people together.\"</p> <p>Of course, AB 32 -- the California climate law -- has yet to be fully implemented, and Schwarzenegger's popularity has sunk amid the state's fiscal woes. Still, California and its toothsome governor could both be winners no matter who becomes president. Both McCain and Obama have said that unlike Bush, they would order a waiver granted to enable California to proceed with plans to regulate greenhouse gases from automobiles.</p> <p>Curiously, Schwarzenegger hasn't visibly campaigned much for his good friend John McCain (though he's scheduled to hit the trail in Ohio this week on the GOP ticket's behalf). There's talk in Sacramento that the reason is that he'd love to be energy czar for someone else: Barack Obama. With his spouse's Kennedy clan connections (cue the Maria Shriver endorsement footage), he might be ready to pack his bags.</p> <p>Schwarzenegger spokesperson Julie Soderlund laughed off all the talk, saying, \"The Governor is 100 percent focused on California and meeting the challenges the state is facing right now. So at this point the governor is not looking beyond the immediate needs of the state.\" She said he had done half a dozen in-state appearances for McCain, and would stump for him in Ohio on Halloween. Also, his air board's plan for cutting greenhouse gases would give free permits to polluters, which McCain favors, rather than the 100 percent auction that Obama supports. Some environmentalists say while Schwarzenegger has taken bold action at times, he has also vetoed or stalled on key protections, mollifying large utilities and the heavily polluting shipping industry, for instance. Trick or treat, anyone?</p>",
  "<p>If you see a lurid version of Sarah Palin arm-in-arm with Joe the Plumber walking down a New York street this Friday, don't be alarmed. It's only Halloween. This is a city which likes its fancy dress costumes to be topical. </p> <p>A New York chain of beauty supplies, <a href=\"http://www.rickyshalloween.com/\">Ricky's</a>, has carved out a lucrative niche in selling up-to-the-moment outfits for October 31. </p> <p>For most of the year, Ricky's sells make-up, hair products and cosmetics at 23 locations in the city. But each October, it takes temporary leases over vacant stores to create impromptu Halloween bazaars. </p> <p>\"Every Halloween, our beauty supplies stores were becoming more Halloween-ish,\" says Ricky's chief executive, Todd Kenig. \"People kept asking for wigs, costumes, facepaint. The stores would have such an overflow of customers that we started looking for temporary locations each year.\" </p> <p>Kenig seems to have hit upon a winner. Three years ago, he had six temporary Halloween shops in New York. This year, there are 19, making them ubiquitous in parts of lower Manhattan. </p> <p>He says about 20% of his company's $45m (\u00a328m) annual sales now derive from the brief run-up to Halloween. \"I go up and down the entire city of New York, from 125th Street to Battery Park, looking for empty stores every year,\" he says. </p> <p>Americans like their pumpkin-themed festival. The <a href=\"http://www.nrf.com/modules.php?name=News&amp;op=viewlive&amp;sp_id=578\">National Retail Federation</a>(NRF) reckons the US public will spend $5.77bn on Halloween costumes this year - a rise of 14% on 2007. On average, each shopper will splash out $24.17 on a costume and $66.54 on the holiday as a whole. </p> <p>While Europeans tend to stick to dressing as witches, wizards and ghosts for Halloween, pretty much anything goes in the US. Each year brings an eclectic assortment of random costumes from superheros to antiheros, generally with an adult theme. </p> <p>Two years ago, Borat was very much in vogue, complete with hideously revealing <a href=\"http://boratswimsuit.com/\">mankinis</a>. Then there was Amy Winehouse's rehab look, which was something of an easy target, plus Lindsay Lohan and Britney Spears in their car crash descents from stardom. </p> <p>This year, Ricky's offers a jumpsuit embroidered with the words \"client nine\" in honour of Eliot Spitzer, the hooker-loving former governor of New York state. There are Obama and McCain masks or a do-it-yourself \"greedy banker\" outfit, comprising a business suit and a pig's face. There's even a costume for pet dogs based on Star Wars' Yoda character. </p> <p>But the hottest look, according to Kenig, is the Palin costume. Ricky's has offloaded mre than 600 sashes bearing the words \"Miss Alaska\", together with about 200 Palin wigs. \"She's the biggest seller, certainly, of all the politicians,\" he says. </p> <p>Ricky's prides itself in getting an outfit into the shops in a matter of days. The Republican hero, Joe the Plumber, only emerged into the limelight on October 15, when John McCain began to trumpet his virtues during the third and final presidential debate. It didn't take long for an outfit to emerge - complete with plunger. </p> <p>\"What really sells is what's happening now,\" says Kenig. \"It's current items that do so well.\" </p> <p>The recession seems to be doing little to dampen spirits. The NRF points out that this year's Halloween is on a Friday, providing a good excuse to party all weekend. </p> <p>\"Though the economy is struggling, Halloween sales may be a bright spot for retailers this fall,\" says the federation's president, Tracy Mullin. \"Consumers, who have been anxious and uncertain for the past several months, may be looking at Halloween as an opportunity to forget the stresses of daily life and just have a little fun.\" </p> <p>About 35% of consumers expect to dress up and 31% will be going to a party. </p> <p>There's a more complex psychological explanation for this outburst of jollity from Bob Thompson, a professor of popular culture at Syracuse University. </p> <p>\"Lately, Halloween has been reclaimed as a holiday celebrated by adults,\" he told Conde Nast's <a href=\"http://www.portfolio.com/views/blogs/daily-brief/2008/10/01/just-dont-wear-a-dick-fuld-mask\">Portfolio magazine</a>. \"I think this year that the state of the stockmarket, and the economy, and a hotly contested presidential election taking place on November 4 all make October 31 an even riper time to let loose and have a party.\"</p>",

  "<p>Bad weather on Election Day itself generally harms Democrats more than Republicans, but yesterday the heavy Pennsylvania rain left Barack Obama with the upper hand in the image war: he spoke in the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/29/elections-mccain-obama-pennsylvania-swing\">open air</a> to an audience of 8,000, some of whom had waited or hours in ankle-deep mud, while McCain instead decided to cancel a planned outdoors event. \"This is an unbelievable crowd for this kind of weather,\" Obama said. \"If we see this kind of dedication on election day there is no way we are not going to bring change to America.\" But the twin spectres of complacency and triumphalism weren't far away. \"If we're overconfident,\" Obama's deputy campaign manager Steve Hildebrand said in response to one such charge, \"I don't know why we're working so hard.\"</p> <p>Blows were traded on healthcare: Obama seized on a remark by McCain's economic advisor, Doug Holtz-Eakin, that young people wouldn't want to leave their company health schemes for the McCain alternative because \"what they are getting from their employer is way better than what they could get with the credit we're going to give 'em.\" (Holtz-Eakin said his point had been that they'd have the choice.) And the McCain campaign - scrimping and saving? - re-released an ad from August, editing Obama's remarks about Iran to present him as suggesting it wasn't a \"serious threat\". Meanwhile, the website Politico further fuelled rumours of tensions within the Republican campaign, quoting an anonymous McCain aide describing Sarah Palin as a \"whack job\".</p> <p>For more than 12 million of the electorate, however, none of this will make any difference, Daniel Nasaw writes in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/29/uselections2008-barack-obama\">the Guardian today</a>: they've already voted. According to a poll released yesterday by the Pew Research Centre, Obama leads McCain among those who have cast their ballot by 53% to 34%. </p> <h2>What to watch for</h2> <p>McCain, Obama and Joe Biden all visit Florida today, Obama is also due in North Carolina. Sarah Palin is in Ohio and Indiana. And tonight's a big night for political TV: Obama has spent $1m on half an hour of paid programming tonight, which will be aired on Fox, NBC and CBS before an important baseball game. (Some fans are annoyed that the start time will be delayed as a result.) Obama's then due to appear on The Daily Show, while McCain talks to Larry King on CNN. </p> <h2>Latest polls</h2> <p>Gallup's daily tracking poll is at 51%-44% among the \"expanded\" model of likely voters, a three-point narrowing compared to yesterday; Rasmussen's is unchanged at 51%-46%. Obama leads among likely voters in the battlegrounds of Ohio (49% to 40%) and Florida (50% to 43%), according to an LA Times/Bloomberg survey.</p> <h2>Quotes of the day</h2> <p>\"They're going to throw out votes. I can't say exactly how, but they are going to accomplish that quite naturally. I'm so afraid for my friend Obama. I look at this through the eyes of the 60s, and I feel there ain't no way they're going to let him make it.\" - Larone Wesley, a 53-year-old black voter in Jacksonville, Florida, expresses a widely held anxiety in the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/29/us/politics/29anxiety.html\">New York Times</a>.</p> <p>\"When Barack Obama said folks like you and me were bitter, and clinging to religion, I knew he just doesn't understand small town America. We love our God, and we love our guns, 'specially handed down from our grandfathers. And we resent it when liberals like Obama question our way of life. Don't be bitter. Vote McCain\": the country musician Hank Williams Jr in a McCain radio ad in Montana. The telling thing is that the campaign is running ads in Montana at all, since it's usually solidly Republican when it comes to presidential votes.</p> <h2>On theguardian.com now</h2> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/29/elections-mccain-obama-pennsylvania-swing\">Rivals slug it out in battleground state of Pennsylvania</a></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2008/oct/28/election-the-view-elisabeth-hasselbeck\">How the View got politics</a></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/29/reggie-love-barack-obama\">The man behind the man: Obama and the aide who makes his campaign tick</a></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/29/barack-obama-middle-east\">Obama, inshallah!

  "<p>Like millions of people all over the world, Arabs are awaiting the outcome of the US presidential election with excitement and anticipation to see if the new man in the Oval Office turns out to be any more favourable to their interests than George Bush has been.</p> <p>Polls conducted from May to August in six predominantly Muslim countries showed interest in who wins ranging from high in Saudi Arabia and Lebanon to very low in the Palestinian territories and Pakistan. Those who did express a preference preferred Barack Obama to John McCain by margins of at least two to one.</p> <p>Reports of the slogan \"Obama, inshallah\", or God willing, appearing in the Gaza Strip - and even some organised telephone campaigning for the Illinois Democrat - look like vivid but untypical examples of active mobilisation on his behalf.</p> <p>Still, even a brief survey of comments from across the region underlines the sense of qualified hope that, should he win, Obama will turn out to be different - even if the only certainty is that he could not be worse than Bush. Feelings of indifference and cynicism about the result are harder to register.</p> <p>McCain recently provided a painful reminder that Arab expectations of America begin from a very low base when he defended his opponent against the charge that he was not \"an Arab\" but \"a decent man\" - as if the two categories were somehow mutually exclusive.</p> <p>But if US citizens are uneasy at electing a black president whose middle name is Hussein and who was brought up partly in Indonesia, others see huge potential for transformation. \"It's easy to demonise Bush's America if you are a Muslim,\" commented one pundit. \"Less easy if America is led by a black man with a Muslim middle name who grew up in the world's largest Muslim country.\"</p> <p>Probably the biggest immediate hope in the Middle East is that Obama, emphasising diplomacy and dialogue, will be more likely than McCain to avoid war with Iran over its nuclear ambitions. Ali Larijani, the speaker of the Iranian parliament, has explicitly backed the Democrat \"because he is more flexible and rational, even though we know American policy [towards Iran] will not change that much\".</p> <p>Endorsements of this kind do not necessarily help Obama. Yet McCain can hardly be pleased by the support he received via an Islamist website from an al-Qaida supporter who said a Republican victory on November 4 was desirable because likely continuity with Bush's policies meant that the \"failing march\" of the \"war on terror\" will go on.</p> <p>Obama's stance on Iraq - having opposed the 2003 invasion he now backs an ambitiously speedy withdrawal - is distinct from that of McCain, though he shows no signs of any second thoughts about Afghanistan.</p> <p>Strikingly, even some of America's fiercest Arab critics acknowledge that Obama's big theme of \"change\" is a powerful one. Colin Powell's endorsement of him had nothing to do with political party, commented the London-based paper al-Quds al-Arabi, but came about because he is simply the best candidate to fix past \"bloodthirsty\" mistakes. \"It is the choice of a large portion of Americans who want change and to see their country liberated from the slavery of those who hijacked its decision-making and led it toward the devastation we are currently witnessing.\"</p> <p>For most Arabs there is no doubt that the biggest long-term question is whether Obama will be able to crack the nut of Israeli-Palestinian peace, and optimism is hard to detect. Observers wearily note his unblemished voting record for Aipac - the powerful pro-Israeli lobby he addressed immediately after winning the Democratic nomination. Then he was quick to warn those who were enthusiastic about his candidacy not to be \"confused about my unyielding support for Israel's security\".</p> <p>And Senator Joe Biden, Obama's running mate, is a self-described \"Zionist\" who believes that there can only be progress in the Middle East when \"the Arab nations have known that there is no daylight between us [the US] and Israel.\"</p> <p>It may be that energy and commitment - of the kind shown far too late in the day by Bill Clinton - will matter more than any substantial shift in policy. The appointment of a high-profile, heavyweight Middle East envoy could be one way of demonstrating this (though it will help a great deal if the centrist Kadima party rather than the rightwing Likud wins the Israeli elections and the Palestinians can resolve their own bitter divisions).</p> <p>Another key factor could be Obama's promised new approach to Syria, coaxing Bashar al-Assad in from the cold as he cleans up his act in Lebanon and resumes peace talks with a new Israeli government. This weekend's US special forces raid across the Iraqi border - lambasted by Damascus as more of Bush's \"cowboy politics\" - felt like the end of an era. Still, Syria's support for Hizbullah in Lebanon and Hamas in Palestine seem no more likely to end than its close relationship with Iran. But if Assad had a vote on November 4, it too would go to Obama.</p> <p>Beyond the specific issues on the table there has been much positive comment about the new atmosphere Obama could conjure up. The Arab-American blogger Ghassan Michel Rubeiz described a dream for the future in which the Democrat could be a \"catalyst\" for a more favourable climate and trigger a cycle of virtuous events that could actually resolve the Palestinian issue.</p> <p>\"For the US to vote in an African-American progressive liberal would certainly mark a departure from the hyper and violent conservatism of the Bush-McCain camp,\" observed Al-Jazeera's Marwan Bishara.</p> <p>\"The rest of the world would certainly embrace a less fearful and more open post-9/11 America,\" according to the Egyptian intellectual Mona Makram Obeid. \"Choosing Barack Obama, a symbol of hope, would do more to restore the image of the United States in the world than anything else.\"</p> <p>Sensibly, some have hinted too at the danger of exaggerated expectations. \"It is only natural for Arabs to lean towards supporting a black candidate with roots in Africa on the basis that he understands the concerns of the developing world and is aware that there are other nations who have a right to live,\" wrote Mohammad Salah in the pan-Arab paper al-Hayat. But beware, he said, of \"rosy dreams that the solutions to Arab problems will come from the next US president if he is black and a Democrat\".</p>",
  "<p>The US election may still be six days away, but more than 12 million Americans across the country have already cast their ballots, sometimes queuing around the block to do so, a sign of early enthusiasm likely to translate into a high turnout.</p> <p>According to a poll released yesterday by the Pew Research Centre, Barack Obama is leading 53% to John McCain's 34% among those who have already voted, although the actual ballots will not be tallied until next week.</p> <p>Under the early voting system, 32 states allow voters to cast a ballot before election day, either in person at the polling site or by mail. An additional 14 states and Washington DC allow it if voters can argue they will be unavailable on Tuesday.</p> <p>The long queues would appear to herald a surge in turnout compared with previous elections, with statistics from key states indicating a clear advantage for Barack Obama. \"If we're in an election year where you have to wait two hours to vote early, you can imagine what it will look like on election day proper,\" said Doug Chapin, an election expert at the Pew Centre.</p> <p>Campaigns, voters and poll workers have enthusiastically embraced early voting. Election workers like it because the system allows them to test election procedures, affording them time to iron out flaws. It also lessens the crunch on election day.</p> <p>Voters, meanwhile, welcome the convenience, and if they discover a problem with their registration, there is time to correct it and lessen the risk of being disenfranchised, Obama campaign workers say. That is increasingly vital as states enact polling place identification requirements and strictures on the voter roll.</p> <p>\"The more people we can get out, the fewer we have to deal with on November 4,\" said Faulkner Fox, an Obama volunteer organiser in Durham, North Carolina. \"We can bank those votes.\"</p> <p>In 2004, 22.5% of American voters cast their ballot before election day. That is expected to rise to as much as one-third of all voters this year.</p> <p>\"The question remains if this means a greater share of the 2008 vote will be cast early, if turnout will be up overall, or - as I suspect - a combination of these two factors are in play,\" writes Michael McDonald, an associate professor of government and politics at George Mason University.</p> <p>Research indicates early voters tend to be more partisan than average, and the campaigns of Barack Obama and John McCain have encouraged supporters to vote early. The campaigns have dispatched volunteers and paid canvassers to push supporters to the polls ahead of election day. </p> <p>In Florida, where more than 2 million people have already cast ballots, the Democratic vice-presidential candidate, Joe Biden, said an early vote could decide a close race.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Michelle Obama has launched a two-day swing through the western US to promote early voting.</p> <p>The queues at early voting stations seem to be aiding the Democrats. While votes will not be counted until election day, the party registration data in key states anticipate an advantage for Obama.</p> <p>In North Carolina, for instance, registered Democrats have cast 55% of early ballots, compared to 28% for the Republicans and 17% with no party affiliation, according to McDonald's analysis. In Florida, Democrats have cast 45% of early and absentee votes, compared to 40% for the Republicans and 15% other.</p> <p>The apparent advantage may narrow because the Republicans typically start their mobilisation efforts closer to election day, McDonald said.</p> <p>One early vote the Democrats were happy to advertise was that of President George Bush, casting his Texas absentee ballot for John McCain last week.</p>",
  "<p><em>For the field is full of shades as I near <br> the shadowy coast,<br>And a ghostly batsman plays to the bowling <br> of a ghost,<br>And I look through my tears on a <br> soundless-clapping host<br>As the run-stealers flicker to and fro,<br> To and fro:<br>O my Hornby and my Barlow long ago!</em><br>- At Lord's, by Francis Thompson</p> <p>Francis Thompson's famous poem encapsulates the feeling of a certain type of cricket lover - wistful, nostalgic, yearning for a golden age. Think of John Major, with his warm beer, bicycling spinsters and village greens resounding to the thwack of willow on leather. But traditionalists - I count myself among this dewy-eyed throng - now face a challenge: to carry on feeling for a game that is undergoing its greatest revolution for more than a century. The epicentre of the earthquake is India, with its big-money Indian Premier League (IPL), where players can earn more in a month than their predecessors earned in their entire careers. But the starkest manifestation of the new mentality comes this Saturday, when England play the \"Stanford Superstars\" in a winner-takes-all Twenty20 (20 overs a side) match in Antigua worth $1m to each player on the winning side.</p> <p>The match is a disgrace at almost every level, and not just because its Texas billionaire backer, Sir Allen Stanford, has spent the past week on a dollar-driven ego trip, parading around his private ground, hogging the limelight and cavorting with the England players' wives. The key charge against the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB), which sanctioned the game, is that it is has sold its soul for the Stanford millions (the ECB gets $3.5m regardless of the result). </p> <p>\"The match has no cricketing value whatsoever,\" said Steve James, a former England player, when the squad was announced last month. \"Indeed to call it cricket at all will be difficult. For November 1 will be the night cricket is turned into reality TV, where some grisly voyeuristic fare is served up for those of a short attention span. Big Brother has finished: roll up instead to watch the nervous antics of the England cricket team. Who will drop a catch to cost his mates half a million quid?\"</p> <p>The traditionalists' view is expressed even more eloquently by Matthew Engel, the former editor of Wisden, though the eloquence comes from his silence - and absence. Engel is currently in the US covering the presidential election. I emailed him to ask what he thought of the Stanford match. \"I'd love to help,\" he emailed back, \"but I'm really really out of it, partly because I've been doing other things, partly because I'm so appalled by what is happening to cricket.\"</p> <p>It is an extreme view, but we spurned lovers of the game can become overwrought, embittered. Returning to the poem, the point about Hornby and Barlow is that they were not great or especially famous players - just the players that Thompson grew up with watching Lancashire. The field is full of shades - not just for Thompson but for all cricketing traditionalists. \"I saw Hutton in his prime /Another time, another time,\" hymns the arch-memorialist Harold Pinter. Now Pinter on Stanford - that would be a poem worth reading!</p> <p>Michael Atherton, the former England captain, once said that sportsmen should play for love of the game, and one would like to think that in the long term a successful career can only be sustained by such a feeling. But here is a match that exists purely and simply for money. Alastair Cook, the young England opener who is tipped as a future England captain, even admitted it. \"The actual cricket is quite unimportant, apart from financially,\" he said last month. </p> <p>The press conference in June that launched the match - and the series of which it is the culmination - was in execrable taste. Stanford arrived at Lord's by helicopter, touching down on the hallowed turf of the Nursery Ground, and had brought the all-important dosh with him, showing off a plastic crate full of $50 notes said to amount to $20m - the prize fund for the match. It was an appalling spectacle. \"Twenty20 is the future. That's where you're going to make your money,\" declared the man who thinks Test matches - the long-drawn-out, sometimes soporific five-day games that pit country against country - are boring. </p> <p>From the beginning, the ECB have been on the defensive over its link-up with Stanford. But chief executive David Collier argues that it had to take up the sponsorship. \"We would have been massively criticised if we'd not taken advantage of the opportunity,\" he tells me. \"If we don't embrace change, entrepreneurs will step in, and control of the game will slip away from governing bodies which care about Test cricket. There is always potential for unauthorised events, and that can pose a significant threat.\"</p> <p>The shadow of Kerry Packer, who bought up the 50 best players in the world for his own televised tournament in 1977, hangs over much of this thinking. Administrators feel they have to ride the wave, or it will overwhelm them. Collier believes that both Test cricket and Twenty20 can thrive as long as \"balance\" - the watchword of every current administrator - is maintained. \"The attraction of the Stanford series,\" he says, \"is that it's short and doesn't impact on the rest of the schedule. It will also benefit the grass roots of the game [through the $3.5m the ECB receives] and pay for development work in the Caribbean.\" </p> <p>The Stanford series may be an unedifying spectacle, but it is a symptom of what is happening to cricket, not the central problem. Cricket worldwide has gone Twenty20 crazy. Twenty20 began, as a professional attraction as opposed to a pub knockabout, in England in 2003. It was cricket-lite for a generation that didn't want to sit through a five-day Test match, or a four-day county game, or even the 50-over-a-side form of the game that had been seen as the salvation of the sport 30 years ago. Now, as it roars through India and beyond, it threatens to take over the world.</p> <p>When I pitched up at the Metropolitan police ground in East Molesey in July 2003 to see Surrey play Sussex in one of these new-fangled Twenty20 games, I didn't realise I was witnessing a watershed for cricket. Twenty20 was a clever wheeze developed by Stuart Robertson, the then marketing manager of the England and Wales Cricket Board. It was designed as a brief mid-season break from the rigours of the \"proper\" game - two weeks of high-summer fun and frivolity, with evening matches, lots of families, burger vans, bouncy castles and the occasional post-match gig. Atomic Kitten seemed to pop up a great deal. My hazy memories - the beer and the still-hot evening sun of a wonderful summer - are happy ones. But back then we didn't realise we were nurturing a monster.</p> <p>Five years on, this two-week antidote to the slog of long-form cricket has turned into a juggernaut that threatens to steamroller the global game. The heart of the danger lies in India, where the success of the glitzy, money-soaked IPL launched last April has transformed the power balance between Twenty20 and Test cricket. The IPL will henceforth be an annual competition lasting almost two months in which the world's best players can earn \u00a3700,000 - at least double what they would be paid on an annual contract with their countries. </p> <p>The Stanford series exists primarily because the England players were not allowed to take part in the inaugural IPL competition. While every other leading cricketer joined the IPL party, the England players were engaged in a low-key Test series against New Zealand, whose best players - rubbing salt into the England stars' financial wounds - arrived late to play the Tests carrying their money-filled suitcases from India. </p> <p>The success of the IPL has led other countries to contemplate their own Twenty20 competitions. The ECB and the counties are currently haggling over what form an English Premier League should take. There is also talk of a southern hemisphere Twenty20 league spanning Australia, South Africa and New Zealand. The result is likely to be less and less time for Test cricket. \"The IPL want a window for their matches,\" says one leading administrator, \"but give them a window and everyone else will want one too. It'll be all windows and no glass.\" </p> <p>There is, though, another view to that of the nostalgists. Ed Smith, the captain of Middlesex, reckons it's too early to judge which way cricket will go. \"There's a danger of writing things off just because they're new,\" he says. \"Probably when the first Ashes series took place [in 1877], there were people moaning that it detracted from traditional county matches.\"</p> <p>There is some truth in his criticism - the average anoraked county cricket lover would make Edmund Burke look like a crazed radical. It is no coincidence that arch-Tory journalist Simon Heffer adores county cricket, and has rejected every alteration to the playing conditions since about 1952 - \"O my Boycott and my Edrich long ago!\". And it has to be said that WG Grace, progenitor of the modern game and shameless \"shamateur\", would have been the first one on the plane to India. </p> <p>But even Smith admits there are worries. \"There are lots of grounds for concern. We have to preserve what makes cricket unique and special - and that's the five-day game. Even though I love all forms of the sport, when I am asked to make a case for cricket I always turn to Test cricket. The narrative is so complicated and subtle and varying that no sport can match it.\"</p> <p>Test cricket is War and Peace; Twenty20 is a Jeffrey Archer short story. Test cricket, in its many-sidedness, reflects the age of George Eliot and Henry James; Twenty20, in its brashness and cupidity, reflects the age of Jonathan Ross. Administrators want both - long-form for its history, short-form for its hysteria - but, as ever, facing both ways is dangerous.</p> <p>Stuart Robertson, the man at the ECB who started the ball rolling back in 2003 and who is now commercial director of Hampshire cricket club, says that ultimately the market will decide which form of the game takes precedence. \"I love two-innings cricket [first-class matches played over four or five days],\" he says, \"and we saw Twenty20 as a means to an end - a way of bringing in new audiences. But it is not for administrators to determine the future of the game. That will be shaped by customers voting with their wallets and their feet. Tradition and heritage is one of cricket's strong points, but that mustn't mean cricket dies the death of a hundred cuts. Back in 2003, we'd seen a 17% decline in county attendances over the previous five years and we had to do something.\"</p> <p>What Robertson and his colleagues did was supposed to galvanise the county game, which - with a bit of help from Atomic Kitten - it did. But the law of unintended consequences has now kicked in ferociously, and the structure of the global game is under threat. The organisation which is supposed to keep the show on the road is the International Cricket Council, and its job over the next decade will be extraordinarily difficult, with rich businessmen such as Stanford offering players instant fortunes and national boards keen to organise lucrative tournaments that cut across ICC-backed events such as the World Cup and Champions' Trophy. </p> <p>Rather brilliantly, the ICC's spokesman Brian Murgatroyd turns this potential nightmare on its head and sees it as a sign of cricket's success. \"It's an indication that people want to be involved with cricket, and that has to be a good thing,\" he says. And those tacky Stanford millions? \"If players reach the top of their profession, there's an argument that they should be paid appropriately. If you were offered $250,000 for this article rather than the \u00a3200 the Guardian will pay you, you'd find it hard to say no.\"</p> <p>Murgatroyd says the ICC wants to preserve all three forms of the game - long-form, one-day and Twenty20. Indeed, he says, that will give the sport a unique advantage in the Darwinian struggle for fans and broadcasting money. \"It offers something for every taste,\" he argues, \"from the traditional fan who loves the cut and thrust of Test cricket, to the 50-over game, which has a history stretching back to the World Cup in 1975 and will also be appreciated by the purist, to Twenty20, the new kid on the block.\" Odd to hear one-day cricket proclaimed as a game for the purist - \"O my Capel and my Pringle long ago\" - but he makes this three-pronged attack sound an attractive proposition.</p> <p>Whether it is achievable is another matter. Murgatroyd suggests that after 2012, when the current cycle of Test tours come to an end, there may be scope for a new Test match structure, with national teams playing each other as part of a Test league system. My guess is that windows will be opened up to permit at least three glitzy, six-week Twenty20 competitions modelled on the IPL, and that all the less saleable Test series will be downsized and shoehorned into that league structure. Tours and major series, except for \"iconic\" ones such as the Ashes and Australia v India, will be consigned to history, and Test teams will instead jet in and out to play their league Test match. </p> <p>Does any of this matter? Who cares if it's played over three hours or, as in the case of the so-called Timeless Test between South Africa and England in Durban in 1939, 10 days (even then they didn't finish because England, close to making an astonishing 696 to win, had a boat to catch). I would say yes. First, because I value \"real\" cricket - the engrossing battle between bat and ball fought out over a sufficiently long period for true strength to emerge. Second, because context and tradition are everything - teams should represent a country, county or region, rather than a brand. But, most of all, because if money and the whim of the rich rule a sport, it consumes itself.</p> <p>The Stanford match marks another grisly stage in cricket's loss of innocence - or at least relative innocence, compared with the ugly, ill-tempered, money-obsessed, corporatist world of football. Perhaps Engel is right and the soul of the game has already been lost. After more than 40 years of loving the game, and always finding in its verities and absurdities solace in dismal times, it may be time for me to give up too. Certainly on November 1, I will be averting my eyes. But I hope something of its character and variety can be saved. The winners in Saturday's edition of Strictly Come Cricketing may make a cool million, but they could lose everything, including the essence of this odd and wonderful game. A game that used to be rich in the true sense.</p> <p>\u2022 Stephen Moss is editor of Wisden Anthology 1978-2006: Cricket's Age of Revolution </p> <p>\u2022 Follow the Stanford Super Series live on the web with our over-by-over reports <a href=\"http://theguardian.com/sport/stanford-super-series\">theguardian.com/sport/stanford-super-series</a></p>",
  "<p>The morning after the last presidential debate, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/barackobama\">Barack Obama</a> was fundraising in front of a small group of elite Democrats inside the gilded interior of Manhattan's Metropolitan Club. He spoke about the financial crisis on Wall Street and thanked the Clinton supporters who were present, before explaining how he felt at the start of the final phase of the election.</p> <p>\"As some of you know, I have a body guy named Reggie Love, who is very famous because he's young and good looking. You know, cooler than the candidate,\" he began. \"But the reason I'm raising his name is that the other day, somebody said to him, 'Hey Reggie, how are you?' He said: '20 days!' And so, from here on out, any time someone asks Reggie what's going on, it's '17 days!' After two years of campaigning, that is basically our entire perspective.\"</p> <p>The shared perspective between Obama and Love is the result of an intense two-year campaign which they have experienced like buddies on a ridiculously long road trip. </p> <p>Obama likes to say that he lives vicariously through Love, trapped as he is inside the restraints of a presidential candidate's life.</p> <p>It was Love who introduced Obama to Jay-Z, loading the New York rapper's music on to an iPod which he bought as a birthday present for his boss. (Love himself spends most of every campaign flight wired into his own iPhone.) And it was Love who introduced Obama and his wife Michelle to the fist-bump that Fox News suggested was a greeting between terrorists. In truth, it was a greeting between Love and the staffers and reporters who were pretending (rather sadly) to be as cool as him.</p> <p>Reggie, as everyone on the campaign calls him, is more than a body man, whose official duties are to look after the candidate's personal needs. He carries the candidate's pens, his favourite snacks and drinks, an endless supply of chewing gum (Dentyne and Nicorette), as well as numerous bottles of water. </p> <p>He lines up the podium before the candidate steps out, and adjusts the autocue machines to the correct height, a few inches lower than his own. </p> <p>Body men and women have nothing to do with security - that is handled by the Secret Service - and everything to do with the immediate needs of the candidate. In reality, there is no official job description for a body man or woman. </p> <p>Marvin Nicholson was John Kerry's body man and now serves as Obama's national trip director (he is also one of Love's close friends). A New York Times profile of Nicholson in 2004 described him as \"part butler,\" which only served to heighten the caricature of Kerry as an aloof elitist. </p> <p>Hillary Clinton's body woman, Huma Abedin, was often portrayed as inscrutable and efficient. The only constant is that journalists like to portray body staffers as a mirror image of what they see in the candidate.</p> <p>But the official duties don't come close to capturing Reggie's close bond with Obama, who plays a role that is part boss and part big brother. At the start of Obama's day, Reggie is with him in the hotel gym or local YMCA, where they work out together. As the day rolls along, he travels with the nominee in his armoured SUV, managing the phone call list and dialling the numbers. At events, he is his personal photographer and stopwatch, alerting the candidate to the need to wrap up his comments and stick to his schedule.</p> <p>At 6ft 4ins (1.93m), the 26-year-old Love is a standout presence on the campaign - and not just because of his bald head or his proximity to the candidate. An impressive college athlete, he played football and basketball at Duke University, in North Carolina. After graduating in political science and public policy, Love was talented enough to try out with the Green Bay Packers and Dallas Cowboys football teams, but did not make the cut. </p> <p>A year later, he applied for an internship in Congress and landed an interview in Obama's office, rising to the position of deputy political director.</p> <p>Love remains the best basketball player on Team Obama, and one of a handful of the candidate's regular teammates who can dunk the ball on a good day. Whether Love is having a good day depends on his after-hours activities. Early on in the campaign, Love spent a few of those hours having his inner arms tattooed with the phrase: \"My Word, My Bond, My Boyz, My Blood.\"</p> <p>With his prominence has come an unusual degree of public attention. People magazine named Love one of America's most eligible bachelors, a title that he would not dispute. Vanity Fair listed him as one of its In items.</p> <p>Back in his hometown of Charlotte, North Carolina, Love is something of a college legend. At a rally earlier this year, Obama called his body guy on stage and led the crowd in a chant of his name. Then he handed him his jacket to carry off stage.</p> <p>Small wonder that he has his sights set on something other than being a body guy. As the campaign winds down, Love is cramming for law school exams. His goal: to return to Duke and emerge with the kind of qualification that Washington - and the rest of the world - takes seriously.</p> <p>\u2022 Richard Wolffe is Newsweek magazine's correspondent travelling with the Obama campaign.</p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2008/oct/28/obama-reggie-love-democrat-campaign?picture=339091542\">In pictures: Reggie Love on the campaign trail with Barack Obama</a></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> This article was amended on Thursday October 30 2008.

  "<p><strong>Barack Obama</strong>'s inspirational Victorian muse <strong>George Frederic Watts</strong> has a timely outing in London coming up. Three days after the US presidential election, Watts' vast allegorical painting Hope goes on show at the Guildhall art gallery. The blind woman with a lyre was the theme of a sermon about \"the audacity to hope\" by Obama's former pastor, the <strong>Rev Jeremiah Wright</strong>. Obama attended, and borrowed the title for a book. Hope's trip to London has contrastingly mundane origins. The roof at the Watts gallery in Surrey where it normally hangs has sprung nasty leaks.</p> <p>A different sort of painter gets a richly deserved showing at the Boundary gallery in London next month. <strong>Miles Richmond</strong> was a disciple of <strong>David Bomberg</strong> whose time, critics reckon, is about to come. Richmond died this month, aged 85, after planning the show with his son <strong>Robert</strong>, following two retrospectives in M\u00e1laga and Ronda in Spain. His career ranged from an inspirational 72-hour session of painting non-stop, to giving tuition from his last home in rural North Yorkshire.</p> <p>It's a while since the Thatcherite mantra of \"Ten more years!\" was belted out by Iron Lady fans, but there they were going hoarse at a Bruges Group dinner in London's Grosvenor House hotel. <strong>Lady Thatcher</strong>, now 83, was guest of honour at the bash which marked 20 years since her speech in Bruges warning of a European superstate. Guests included <strong>Freddie Forsyth</strong>, <strong>Sir Rocco Forte</strong> and <strong>Lord Tebbit</strong>, who said he'd be up for a weekend in Corfu, but in a dry land villa, not on a yacht. No one from the shadow cabinet was there.</p> <p>They don't do castrati in the opera world these days, but the nearest - and rarest - comparison sings at York University on Friday. Mexican \"natural male soprano\" <strong>Javier Medina</strong> was left by childhood illness with a hybrid larynx indistinguishable from those of 18th- and 19th-century castrati. <strong>Dr John Potter</strong>, York's expert, says the sound has not been heard in Britain since the late nineteenth century when <strong>Alessandro Moreschi</strong> became the only one to be recorded.</p> <p>Still time, just, for Sarahpalindromes, a new form of wordplay invented by blogger <strong>Alex Beam</strong> of the Boston Globe. You know, constructions such as: Are we not drawn onward, we few, drawn onward to new era? Or: Meet animals; laminate 'em.

  "<video data-media-id=\"gu-video-339097000\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/bc/281851582/281851582_1886152824_McCain-Hershey-rally-To-Brightcove-16x9.flv\"/> </video>   <p>Barack Obama demonstrated his pulling power by attracting thousands to an outdoor rally in torrential rain yesterday in Pennsylvania, a state on which John McCain has staked almost all his hopes of a surprise win in next Tuesday's election.</p> <p>Confirming the state's pivotal position on the electoral map, McCain was also in Pennsylvania, campaigning alongside his running mate, Sarah Palin, who told a crowd of about 10,000: \"It is going to come down to the wire here.\"</p> <p>Although it was one of McCain's best performances in weeks, he is facing polls that put Obama consistently ahead - the latest has Obama on 51% to McCain on 41%. He is also beset by continuing distractions over Palin. Amid persistent rumours of strains between his campaign team and her advisers, the Politico website quoted one of his aides, speaking anonymously, describing her as a \"whack job\".</p> <p>With time running out for McCain, Obama yesterday showed how difficult it will be for the Republican candidate to make up ground in the state. In spite of ankle-deep mud and freezing rain, campaign workers estimated about 8,000 people waited hours for him to arrive in Chester, on the outskirts of Philadelphia, huddled under umbrellas, draped in plastic ponchos and wearing plastic carrier bags over their shoes.</p> <p>\"This is an unbelievable crowd for this kind of weather,\" Obama told them when he stepped out in a dark rain jacket over jeans. \"If we see this kind of dedication on election day there is no way we are not going to bring change to America.\"</p> <p>Pennsylvania, which has voted for Democrats in every presidential election since 1988, is the only Democratic state where McCain is still strongly competing. Despite a strong poll lead over McCain, Obama's main ally in the state, the governor, Ed Rendell, has warned the campaign not to take Pennsylvania for granted.</p> <p>Although Obama is ahead overall, detailed polls show several key counties have tightened in McCain's favour in the last week and the two are in a dead heat.</p> <p>McCain is also pinning his hopes on white, working-class voters reluctant to turn out for Obama on grounds of race. But many of them are angry over the economy, and the blame they attribute to the Republicans outweighs prejudice.</p> <p>McCain's rally was indoors, at the Giant Arena in Hershey, the central Pennsylvania home of the chocolate bar, and, after days of attracting derisory crowds, he almost filled the 12,000-seat stadium. He appeared to be reinvigorated, and to have settled on a message portraying Obama as a socialist and untested in a crisis.</p> <p>Appearing to address reports of tension between his and Palin's teams, McCain, standing only a few feet from her, said: \"When two mavericks join up we don't agree on everything, but it's a lot of fun.\"</p> <p>McCain took a swipe at Obama over the $1m he is spending on a half-hour paid-for TV address tonight, unprecedented in US political history. It will be held before a World Series baseball game, delaying the start, to the irritation of some fans.</p> <p>\"By the way, no one will interrupt the World Series for an infomercial when I'm president,\" McCain said.</p> <p>In spite of a standing ovation, many in the audience had turned out to see not McCain but Palin, who received the loudest cheers. Some of the audience left after she had spoken and before McCain had a chance to begin.</p> <p>Despite Obama's turnout yesterday, there is still resistance to him in places such as Hershey. Kim Condran, 40, a health worker who was at the McCain rally, thought he could still take Pennsylvania. \"Obama is not a truthful person. I don't think he is revealing everything in his past. He has too many connections to foreigners, the bad ones,\" she said.</p> <p>McCain and Palin had a good turnout given the event was early in the morning, that it was a working day, and that the rain was heavy. But McCain opted against testing whether he is capable of drawing, like Obama, an outdoor crowd in heavy rain, cancelling such an event later in the day.</p> <p>Pennsylvania's two major cities, Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, are expected to vote heavily for Obama, while McCain hopes to wrap up the small towns and rural areas sandwiched between them.</p> <p>Behind the scenes, the Obama camp is worried about long lines at polling stations and other disruptions in battleground states. Voting rights advocates in Pennsylvania have filed lawsuits to demand state election officials increase their supply of paper ballots, and have reserves of trained poll workers on hand.</p> <h2>Pennsylvania</h2> <p>Pennsylvania's 21 electoral votes are crucial for McCain if he hopes to win the election. In the centre of the state, religious, culturally conservative white voters dominate the electorate. But Pittsburgh and Philadelphia, in the western and eastern ends of the state, are home to large numbers of African-Americans, students and more affluent liberal voters inclined to back Obama. </p> <p>McCain hopes to exploit that support, though the state has not voted for a Republican since 1988 and polls show Obama has built a sustained lead of about 12 points.</p> <p>The state, which was politically and culturally prominent early in US history, has seen hard times in recent decades. A top source of jobs, western Pennsylvania's steel industry, has been in long-term decline. The state has the second-largest elderly population in the country, after Florida.</p>"

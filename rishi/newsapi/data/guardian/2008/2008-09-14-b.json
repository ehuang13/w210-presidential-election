  "<p>As the longest US presidential campaign in history enters its final 50 days, the world is watching Barack Obama and John McCain battle it out. But America is watching its media chase after something else entirely: the saga of Sarah Palin. The hunt may be unedifying for some but it has raised questions about the media's role in a heated climate where charges can't always be fact-checked.</p> <p>Since castigating the press in her national political debut, Palin has given just one mainstream interview, to ABC news. Yet lack of access has only led to more attention, giving liberals heartburn and conservatives fuel for attacks on the media.</p> <p>\"Her critics like to say that Palin hasn't accomplished anything,\" Arianna Huffington blogged. \"I disagree. In the space of ten days she's succeeded in distracting the entire country from the horrific Bush record - and McCain's complicity in it.\"</p> <p>The early numbers suggest Palin has indeed crowded out other stories. She was the subject of 60% of US news stories during the Republican party convention, according to the independent Pew research centre, even more than McCain and three times as many as Obama in the same week.</p> <p>Palin's unexpected nomination, combined with the relative exoticism of her Alaskan roots, made the media fascination somewhat inevitable. The questions mounted: did she raise taxes as mayor of Wasilla, Alaska? How much government money did she seek to study seal DNA? Where did she get her children's names from?</p> <p>\"Let's not underestimate how much of a surprise she was,\" warns Mark Jurkowitz, associate director of the Pew centre's Project For Excellence in Journalism. \"Not just to the political chattering class, but also to the media itself. You're getting this rush of information - some gossip, some rumours, some of it important, all of it coming out in a small timeframe.\"</p> <p>Indeed, the way her quick ascension sent the press into a tizzy has led the gun-toting mother of five to be compared with Obama.</p> <p>More important than the Palin-mania of the 24-hour news cycle is the Republican campaign's savvy use of her popularity, however. Before she uttered a word to the voting public, McCain aides refused to answer media questions about Palin's record, deeming them too sexist.</p> <p>US reporters and commentators may have called it a \"marketing ploy\" - in CNN president Jon Klein's words - but they were left wondering how to cover a candidate who demonised them.</p> <p>\"There's a rhetorical case the McCain campaign has made, that shock [at Palin's nomination] was similar to disapproval,\" Clint Hendler, a staff writer at the Columbia Journalism Review, says. \"I don't think that's true. But they've blurred the line there, because it's advantageous to them to draw a parallel between the 'good-old-boy' network in Alaska and the 'good-old-boy' network in the media.\"</p> <p>Perhaps ironically, it also meant that the support given to Obama by liberal bloggers during his campaign against Hillary Clinton was used against him by Palin supporters.</p> <p>The mainstream media cannot ignore popularity. Her convention speech was watched by an eye-popping 37.2 million US TV viewers. (The finale of American Idol, by contrast, attracted just 31.7 million.) In the speech, she launched cutting broadsides at the media, emboldening Republicans in the crowd to vent their anger over perceived liberal bias at the MSNBC network.</p> <p>The marquee pundits at MSNBC, the third biggest news channel after CNN and Fox, dismissed Palin's vitriol. Keith Olbermann sighed at the Republican \"picking of fights\". Chris Matthews shrugged: \"This is showbiz. They know what they're doing. It might work.\"</p> <p>Within days, Olbermann and Matthews had been removed from their anchor chairs for the rest of the election season, despite being hugely popular with younger viewers. Paul Waldman, a senior fellow at the watchdog group Media Matters, says: \"The problem is, you had all this protest coming from the right\" even before Palin's speech. \"When you make the shift in the wake of that, it looks like you're trying to compensate and knuckle under.\" The ripple effect of Palin's rise has grown more intense as the US media tries to find its rudder in a sea of short-lived campaign scandals. Scrutiny of her record has turned up a slew of contradictions. As hypocrisies emerge, liberals have joined conservatives in chastising the press - albeit for very different reasons.</p> <p>Democratic partisans cried foul, for example, when the media quoted Palin's claim to have terminated an expensive Alaskan bridge project. A simple Google search confirms that she actually supported the bridge. \"The US mainstream media is very much a prisoner of a perhaps obsolete idea of balance,\" says the CNN analyst and New Yorker writer Jeffrey Toobin.</p> <p>\"For the most part, the media is very uncomfortable saying that one side is right and one side is wrong, even on factual matters like this one.\"</p> <p><strong>Sexist jibe</strong></p> <p>While liberals seethed about Palin's bridge claim, conservatives were pouncing on any press criticism of the vice-presidential candidate as sexist. Wary of having their words twisted into a gaffe, Obama aides steered clear of Palin - but Obama himself stepped into a trap on Tuesday by calling Republican rhetoric \"lipstick on a pig\".</p> <p>The McCain camp promptly accused him of a sexist jibe, which the mainstream media felt bound to report despite the fact that it is a common expression in the US. And though the mainstream media had spent a week rebutting sex-bias charges, Obama got no such help in the wake of the remark.</p> <p>Cable TV dedicated hours of airtime to questioning whether Obama's use of the US colloquialism referred to Palin, who often jokes that hockey mums like herself are pit bulls in \"lipstick\". The Associated Press wrote that Obama was \"clearly drawing a connection to Palin's joke, even if it's not what [he] meant\".</p> <p>Tom Patterson, professor of government and the press at Harvard University, says the media's focus on trivialities is dragging down its credibility with the public. \"The problem is that on cable, which is usually the driver of news content, they love this stuff,\" he adds. \"The press, because it needs to feed the 24-hour beast, has almost lost its compass, and the public recognises it.\"</p> <p>Academics are not alone in questioning the media's self-control in the post-Palin era. When politico.com asked senior Republicans and Democrats about the coverage of the sexism furore, both sides said the press response was utterly predictable. It is clear that the US press - with the unusual exception for a serious political candidate of Us, OK! and People - has not yet figured out how to approach Palin two weeks after she burst onto the scene.</p> <p>Palin's debut interview on ABC last week highlighted all these tribal divisions - between the sexes and the parties - that have been shown up by her brief career in the national spotlight. As she prepares to debate with her Democratic counterpart on October 2, the mainstream media will again have to weigh their desire for a great story against the risk of more attacks on alleged bias. And with the compass spinning through a fast-changing media landscape ahead of the elections on November 4, time is running out.</p>",
  "<p>Few were surprised when Rupert Murdoch's New York Post, part of a US News Corp empire led by the Wall Street Journal and Fox News, endorsed John McCain last week. But the timing of the nod - the staunchly conservative Post had waited to back George Bush for president until late October of 2000 and 2004 - was surprising.</p> <p>The Post's endorsement came days after Murdoch biographer Michael Wolff reported that the 77-year-old News Corp chairman had played peacemaker between Fox News and Barack Obama, paving the way for the Democrat to sit down with conservative host Bill O'Reilly.</p> <p>Wolff's declaration in Vanity Fair magazine that \"Murdoch is becoming a liberal - sort of\" got tongues wagging on both sides of the Atlantic. Was the media mogul ready, as Murdoch hinted at his Dow Jones conference in May, to vote for Obama? The Post's pro-McCain headline appeared to answer that question in the negative. Wolff is now left wondering whether his remark on Murdoch's changing politics prompted a backlash out of \"irritation that I perceived him as becoming a liberal\".</p> <p>\"I don't think Rupert Murdoch likes people to tell him what they think he's going to do,\" Wolff said in an interview. \"Would he change his political inclinations to make that clear? Yeah, I think Rupert can be a little bit of a bitch.\"</p> <p>But Wolff also noted that Murdoch views the Post's readership as naturally inclined against Obama, particularly on the question of how hawkish the US should be to defend Israel. \"So it's probably a combination of factors\" driving the Post's harsh dismissal of Obama.</p> <p>Of course, few in America expect Fox News to soften its coverage of Obama in the wake of his rapprochement with the network. Hours after the Democratic nominee sat down with O'Reilly, a Fox host threatened to \"shut down the microphone\" of a senior Obama adviser during an on-air appearance. </p> <p>Another development that would shock even seasoned Murdoch watchers is an endorsement of either party in the Wall Street Journal, now that the newspaper has become part of News Corp. Despite its famously conservative opinion page, the Journal has not endorsed any presidential candidate since Herbert Hoover - best known in the US for bringing on the 1930s Great Depression. Will Robert Thomson, who took a decidedly New Labour line when editor of the Times, make history and back a candidate for the US election?</p>",
  "<p>One of America's biggest investment fund bosses, Bill Gross, shocked fellow Republicans last week by suggesting that he will vote Democrat in the presidential election. \"I ... think it's time for a rebalancing of interests between the wealthy and less wealthy,\" he said. It is interesting to speculate whether this outbreak of social conscience reflects humility, or merely the naked terror that is gripping the financial community on both sides of the Atlantic.</p> <p>Regardless of whether the Wall Street giant Lehman Brothers is rescued from bankruptcy by a takeover - the subject of fevered speculation in recent days - the financial world is sailing uncharted waters. Nobody knows where the voyage will end, because they cannot work out the scale of irrecoverable liabilities.</p> <p>A year ago, New York and London bankers shook their heads grimly over the fact that an estimated $1 trillion of supposed assets had vanished into space. Today the US taxpayer has accepted responsibility for the $5.4 trillion liabilities of the Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae mortgage businesses, without the remotest notion of how much of this money, too, will disappear down the Swanee. A mere trillion seems less serious money than it used to be.</p> <p>Ordinary mortals who live outside the financial community are torn between delight at the humbling of the Masters of the Universe, who paid themselves fantastic rewards on the basis that only they knew how to manage capitalism, and awareness that we shall all end up paying for their failure. Half a century ago, the City of London was a quaint place which kept a few thousand rather dim ex-public schoolboys off the streets, and raised a little money for the real business of Britain - manufacturing ships, cars, textiles, washing machines and suchlike. Today, when the City's activities account for around one third of GNP, the nation is frighteningly vulnerable to their frailty.</p> <p>The first good reason for not succumbing to schadenfreude about the financial catastrophe is that it highlights alarming issues about what Britain will live off in the 21st century. Our manufacturing base has moved east, never to return. A couple of years ago conventional wisdom held that this need not prevent us running a successful economy founded on services: tourism and suchlike; intellectual property (thank goodness the world works in English); and financial expertise, in which we were assured that we had no peers.</p> <p>Today matters look rather different. Beyond the vast sums of money which the supposed wizards have lost, there is the question of reputations. Hardly a single institution, or its bosses, have emerged unscathed from the carnage.</p> <p>Businesses such as Lehman Brothers and Merrill Lynch borrow stupendous sums in wholesale money markets, and use them to place bets in a fashion indistinguishable from punters at Newbury racecourse or in Las Vegas. Worse, at least in a horse race you can see the animal on which you stake your little all. In the City and on Wall Street, by contrast, billions have been wagered on financial instruments of a complexity beyond the understanding even of those who invented them. A wise financial journalist said: \"The first rule of investment is not to put money into things you don't understand.\" American and European financial institutions have flouted this principle on a colossal scale. The panic prevailing in London and New York is driven by the fact that, even now, none of those involved can figure out how bad things are for their own businesses, never mind for the system as a whole.</p> <p>It is sobering to hear one of those up to his neck in this universe acknowledge, without embarrassment: \"What is happening represents a major failure of market capitalism.\" There is amazingly widespread agreement within the financial world, as well as outside it, that the first lesson of what has happened is that the big beasts of Wall Street and the City were allowed to become far too powerful in their own societies. For several decades, governments have deferred to the supposed wisdom and ruthless clout of bankers. Presidents and prime ministers have walked small in the company of those whose lightest word could move trillions.</p> <p>Now, instead, those same people are on their knees to their governments and central banks, trying to save their own skins. The credibility of the financial community will take years to recover. Trust and confidence, pillars of capitalism, are at their lowest ebb for decades. Nobody can decide what anything is worth - shares, currencies, oil, houses, businesses. Until a basis of belief is re-established at some level, the scary times will continue.</p> <p>Optimists, of whom some survive, say it is still unclear how badly the US and European financial crisis will impact on the real world. Many countries, including those in Asia, remain relatively unaffected. The Middle East is awash with oil money, and spending enthusiastically. Some \"real\" businesses in America and Europe report buoyant trading. They say that \"real\" people, thank goodness, are getting on with their lives, heedless of the dramas on trading floors - but if the credit crunch persists, if real people and real businesses find it hard to borrow money, then pain must spread.</p> <p>When the dust settles, there will be a rebalancing of relative power between financial communities and regulators on both sides of the Atlantic. The kings of the market have been proved wrong. Unless the US and Britain want to go through this nightmare again in a few years' time, it will be made more difficult for banks to expose themselves to risk so recklessly.</p> <p>Yet it would be naive to suggest that it will be easy to get a new dispensation right. Market capitalism has delivered amazing prosperity to the west. Curbing its excesses without destroying the conditions for future wealth-generation will be tough. The bankers, market makers and hedge fund overlords have been insufferably arrogant in their decades of triumph, and nemesis is their just reward. But it will be flagellatory if, in our desire to punish the architects of systemic failure, governments introduce measures that stifle growth.</p> <p>Rather as we must keep wanting to see Iraq stabilised, even if this might seem to vindicate George Bush, so we have to continue reminding ourselves that we need Wall Street and the City of London and some of their admittedly horrible people. There Is No Alternative, as Margaret Thatcher liked to say, sometimes rightly. There may be an important lesson in the experience of Goldman Sachs, the big house least tarnished by recent events. Commentators suggest that one reason for this is that Goldman's traders rely more heavily on their own funds, and less on other people's, to place big bets.</p> <p>To keep our children in work and our society relatively prosperous in the decades ahead, amid the huge transfer of wealth from old to new economies, the financial services industry will be indispensable to Britain. The next generation of money moguls will probably prove as hubristic as this one has done; arrogance is seldom separable from riches. The highest aspiration, I suspect, will be to ensure that next time around, on the Goldman Sachs model, Masters of the Universe gamble with less of our money and more of their own.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:comment@theguardian.com\">comment@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>The campaign of US Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama today announced it had raised a record $66m in August with the help of more than half a million new donors.</p> <p>Obama's total for August was almost $20 million more than the $47 million his Republican rival, John McCain, raised last month - giving the Democratic candidate a possible cash advantage in the race for the White House.</p> <p>But Obama's fundraisers have said he still has to do better in the next two months before the election on November 4 to remain on a par with McCain and the Republican National Committee, which has more money to spend on McCain's behalf than the Democratic National Committee has to aid Obama.</p> <p>Obama's campaign said that with the latest figures he had more than $77m available in cash.</p> <p>The August total exceeds the $55m Obama raised last February during the primary campaign - an all-time high for any presidential candidate during a primary.</p> <p><a href=\"http://my.barackobama.com/page/community/post/stateupdates/gG5Zxk\">Writing on Obama's website</a>, his campaign manager, David Plouffe, said: \"The 500,000 new donors to the Obama campaign demonstrate just how strongly the American people are looking to kick the special interests out and change Washington.</p> <p>\"We are proud of the millions of volunteers and more than 2.5 million donors to the Obama campaign who are contributing to help us deliver the change we need instead of letting John McCain just continue the same failed Bush policies while middle class Americans struggle.\"</p> <p>More details about the campaigns' finance are expected later this week, when their monthly financial reports are due at the Federal Election Commission.</p> <p>Obama, a prodigious fundraiser, has decided not to accept public financing for the general election, choosing instead to spend as much money as he can raise on his bid to put the Democrats back in the White House.</p> <p>McCain has accepted public financing, which limits his direct spending up to the election to the $84 million he received in public funds after the Republican convention earlier this month.</p> <p>On Tuesday, Obama is attending one the Democrats' biggest fundraisers, a glitzy Beverly Hills event that will include a performance by singing star Barbra Streisand, a long-time Democratic supporter.</p>"

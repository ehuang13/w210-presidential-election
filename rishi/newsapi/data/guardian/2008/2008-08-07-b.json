  "<p>Most of us would agree that the world is full of fascinating people; unlike most of us, however, the film-maker Jonathan Demme seems to be compelled to make documentaries about them, all at the same time. As a result, the atmosphere in his New York apartment is one of low-level hysteria, as if everyone present has been drinking too much coffee. At an all-day production meeting that is just dispersing, the 64-year-old director and his collaborators have been discussing a new film about Bob Marley; there's also a Neil Young movie in the works - Demme's second - as well as a project following families made homeless by Hurricane Katrina. Then there are the short works he's been posting on YouTube and, finally, the movie we're meeting to discuss, Jimmy Carter: Man from Plains, about the post-presidential adventures of Jimmy Carter. </p> <p>Documentaries have always been a part of Demme's output, but these days the director of big-budget fictions such as The Silence of the Lambs and Philadelphia seems intoxicated by fact. \"I can sometimes fall victim to my own enthusiasm,\" he concedes. \"Especially now, with all the new technology, because even I can shoot the camera. I'm always ready to jump up and say, 'Let's film that!'\" He rubs his eyes and blinks, a little sheepishly. \"Filming stuff is great,\" he says, as if it were a recent discovery.</p> <p>The 39th president of the United States might not sound like the most promising of subjects. He's a hero to many for the humanitarian work he's done since leaving office in 1981, but not necessarily a very interesting hero. To some on the American right, he's a scold and a has-been, whose ultra-liberal views are best ignored. But in Demme's film, which follows Carter on the 2006 publicity tour for his controversial book Palestine: Peace Not Apartheid, he emerges as a compelling character - stubborn yet compassionate, unfazed by vicious criticism, yet ready to burst into tears as soon as he recalls his Georgia childhood. Pulling his wheeled suitcase behind him - Carter won't let anyone else touch it - the 83-year-old ex-president tirelessly criss-crosses the country on commercial flights, signing books in stores, giving TV and radio interviews and responding to mounting hostility, most of the time with implacable patience. </p> <p>Demme says he thinks of the film as a western. \"The more I thought about Carter, the more I started thinking about High Noon,\" he says. \"The idea of the ageing peacemaker who should be in retirement, having once again to strap on his guns - in Jimmy Carter's case, he's strapping on his heart and soul - and coming forth into town, one last time, to confront his adversaries, those who would perpetuate violence. It's Gary Cooper, striding down the street, all alone: no one's stronger than the really old guy who takes on a good mission when he should be allowed to be on the porch in his rocking chair.\"</p> <p>Carter's mission isn't quite as incendiary as his book title suggests. As he tirelessly explains to interviewers who haven't read his book, he uses the word \"apartheid\" to describe the situation in the occupied territories, not in Israel. Primarily, he wants to communicate the fact - little-known in much of America - that the Israeli-built security barrier makes deep incursions into Palestinian territory. And he wants the two sides to talk. But his analogy with South Africa provokes a parade of critics, from a coalition of Arizona rabbis to the high-profile Harvard professor Alan Dershowitz, who accuse him of antisemitism, plagiarism, senility and more.</p> <p>Demme received his earliest cinematic education from the exploitation director Roger Corman - Demme's first movie was Caged Heat, an instance of the lurid \"women in prison\" genre - and credits Corman with first teaching him that a film should never grow too enamoured of its hero. \"One of the very first things Corman tells you, as a new director, is that you've got to make sure your adversary is every bit as strong and interesting as your protagonist,\" he says. \"So when we were filming at the Carter Centre in Atlanta, and the consul from Israel was identified as being in the audience, I was, like, 'Oh my God, I've got to get him.' I was desperate for points of view in opposition. I chased him across the grounds of the Carter Centre, and in the end I was lucky enough to have this very attractive guy, giving a very heartfelt, non-didactic comment.\" </p> <p>Even Dershowitz, whose initial media attacks on Carter bordered on the rabid, comes across as eminently reasonable, scrupulously fact-checking his broadsides before unleashing them. \"He was a tremendously important figure to have in there,\" Demme says. \"As a person of his generation, I felt his pain. I grew up with the emerging documentation of the Holocaust; I'm not Jewish, yet I know the profound impact that had on me. So if you're a Jewish-American of that generation ... I get Dershowitz's pain, and his rage.\"</p> <p>Man from Plains may also be the most candid portrayal ever of the personal and emotional life of a former president. We get to see Carter off-duty at local cook-outs in Plains, the small Georgia town where he was born, and cycling slightly goofily down its main street with his wife, Rosalynn; he explains how they read the Bible to each other at night - on the phone, if necessary - before going to sleep. (\"Shocking intimacy!\" says Demme.) Carter's encounters with strangers seem intimate, too: fans at book signings gaze at him with uncensored affection; TV makeup artists flirt openly. Even the film's only foray into archive footage, an account of the brokering of the Camp David accords, is memorable less for the grand historical events it records than for the images of a sleepy but determined Carter, shuttling back and forth through the night between Menachem Begin and Anwar Sadat's cabins in the Maryland countryside. </p> <p>\"In America, you almost want to apologise for being a Jimmy Carter fan,\" says Demme, \"but I don't apologise. Surely now, in the run-up to this particular election, Jimmy Carter must be seen as the great president.\" Carter's term is probably best remembered for the drawn-out humiliation of the Iranian hostage crisis, his handling of which has been blamed for fuelling the rise of Islamist extremism - though Carter is at pains to remind interviewers in the film that all the hostages escaped alive, and no Iranians died, either. (Eight US service personnel were killed.) Barack Obama, for several reasons, has been derisively described recently by rightwingers in America as a new Carter. But to Demme, that's a compliment and not necessarily one Obama deserves. The Democratic candidate has promised to open dialogues with the nation's enemies if elected, but on the Middle East Demme argues that he's been subject to \"brainwashing\" by Aipac, the pro-Israel lobby group, and is \"kowtowing to the pro-Israeli lobby position, and showing incredible insensitivity to the Palestinian side. Carter never got brainwashed ... maybe that's why he didn't get a second term.\" (Demme has also said he would like to \"strap George Bush into a chair and make him watch [Man from Plains] again and again and again.\")</p> <p>Demme had made plenty of factual films before - a sequence of movies about the struggle for democracy in Haiti and numerous concert films such as Stop Making Sense, about Talking Heads. Following Carter, though, his control over unfolding events was at an all-time minimum. One of the most dramatic moments that he shot was never screened - an impassioned meeting between Carter and a group of Arizona rabbis furious at his book. \"They hit him with all the strong stuff, and he responded; he didn't persuade anyone, nor was his mind changed, but everybody got to say what they wanted to say, and it ended beautifully, with a prayer circle. One of the rabbis gave a blessing and wept.\" Everyone present agreed to be filmed, but one of the rabbis later threatened legal action if the footage was used. The result is a strange sequence of silences - we hear some of Carter's words, but not those of the people he's responding to, and the rabbis' faces are blurred - that is, in its own way, an eloquent demonstration of how hard it is to talk about the Middle East in America. \"I was devastated,\" Demme says, \"because I'd been banking on that scene. But then I thought, well, this is a documentary, and this is what happened.\"</p> <p>Through cultish material like Melvin and Howard and Something Wild, Demme became at least as well known for fictional films. Later came the box office successes of Philadelphia and The Silence of the Lambs - which became only the third movie in history to win the Oscars for best director, movie, actor, actress and screenplay - and a remake of The Manchurian Candidate, starring Denzel Washington. But large-budget studio fictions \"are probably a thing of the past for me\", he says now. \"I have no interest. I'm a working film-maker, so I don't need that much money to live, and I just can't take the fashioning-of-the-product aspect to all that. I've had my fill of it.\" In fact, he has just made a fictional film - a drama called Rachel Getting Married, starring Anne Hathaway - but he shot it as a documentary, with the cinematographer Declan Quinn. \"We pretended that what the actors were doing was reality, and we responded to it as we would in any documentary,\" Demme says. \"We never did a take-two of any shot; we did the scenes a number of times, but always from a new perspective. The actors loved it, because the more you do a take, the more you're going to drain the spontaneity out of a performance.\"</p> <p>Fate did, in the end, present Demme with a cinematic confrontation in Man from Plains, despite the problem with the rabbis. Brandeis University, which has a strongly pro-Israel student body, refused his offer to speak there. Then, after much media controversy, it changed its mind. \"Shamefully, I was delighted when Brandeis refused him permission to come - because now we have some adversaries,\" Demme recalls. \"And then they decided, no, he could come ... so that gave us our final gunfight! He'll waltz on to this fiercely pro-Israel campus, and confront the students, and his views will be tested to the maximum.\" Carter and the students do have a frank exchange of opinions; nobody ends up looking worse for having agreed to talk. \"And then he jumps in the car to the airport, and he's off to Darfur!\" Demme says. \"Fantastic! It's, like, 'Who was that masked orator?'\"</p> <p><strong><strong>\u00b7</strong> Jimmy Carter: Man from Plains is released on August 15.</strong></p>",
  "<p>The Democrats' acrimonious primary battle came back to haunt Hillary Clinton yesterday, a day before she sets off on her first solo campaign swing for Barack Obama, with John McCain using footage of her attacking the Democratic candidate in a new campaign ad.</p> <p>The ad, which was released on the internet, features a number of Democratic leaders - including Obama - offering praise for McCain. But only Clinton, who is the closing speaker, goes so far as to take a jab at Obama, in footage culled from one of her primary rallies.</p> <p>The ad surfaced a day before Clinton is to step in as Obama's chief cheerleader with a campaign appearance in Nevada today. She is to travel to the pivotal state of Florida next week.</p> <p>The appearances are intended to keep up the momentum while Obama is on holiday in Hawaii.</p> <p>In the new ad released by the Republicans, Clinton is shown saying: \"I know Senator McCain has a lifetime of experience that he will bring to the White House and Senator Obama has a speech that he gave in 2002.\"</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/uSpcxkKlEFA?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <object width=\"460\" height=\"385\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/uSpcxkKlEFA&hl=en&fs=1\"></param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"></param><embed src=\"https://www.youtube.com/v/uSpcxkKlEFA&hl=en&fs=1\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"460\" height=\"385\"></embed></object> </figure>   <p>The damaging footage is the realisation of Democratic fears at the height of the contest that Clinton's no-holds-barred attacks on Obama, with repeated questioning of his experience and readiness to serve in the White House, would provide ammunition to the Republicans during the presidential contest.</p> <p>A spokesman for the McCain campaign said yesterday: \"Hillary Clinton was making a strong and valid argument for why John McCain will be the next president.\"</p> <p>\"In this case, we couldn't have said it better ourselves,\" Tucker Bounds said in an email to the Guardian. Bounds said the ad would not be released on television, allowing the McCain campaign to capitalise on Clinton's now embarrassing comments at relatively little expense.</p> <p>Aside from the immediate damage, the ad revives questions about Clinton's commitment to unifying the party behind Obama - despite her repeated appeals to her loyalists to come on board. </p> <p>Some of those loyalists said this week that they had no intention of backing Obama, and are planning to hold a protest march through Denver on the day Clinton is scheduled to address the Democratic convention.</p> <p>\"We are 18 million voices dedicated to seeing Senator Clinton reach the next milestone: the White House,\" says one of the loyalist websites.</p> <p>Clinton has kept a low profile since a highly orchestrated unity rally with Obama in June. But she has been working behind the scenes to persuade her loyalists to come on board, and this week issued a joint statement with Obama promising \"all voices\" would be heard at the convention. </p> <p>\"At the Democratic convention, we will ensure that the voices of everyone who participated in this historic process are respected and our party will be fully unified heading into the November election,\" the statement said.</p> <p>Clinton told a fundraiser in California last week that she wanted the convention to be a \"cathartic\" experience for her supporters. She said it was hard for some of her diehard supporters to acknowledge defeat.</p> <p>\"I mean everybody comes, and they want to yell and scream and have their opportunity, and I think that's all to the good, because then, you know, everybody can go, 'OK great. Now let's go out and win,'\" she said, on YouTube footage.</p> <p>\"The best way I think to do that is to have a strategy so that my delegates feel like they've had a role and that their legitimacy has been validated and that kind of ... you know, there is a catharsis,\" she said.</p>",
  "<p>Hang on there. Did I misjudge Paris Hilton? John McCain has been using Hilton and Britney Spears in an attack ad designed to suggest that Barack Obama is also, like, a global celebrity airhead, someone who attracts a crowd of 200,000 foreigners in Germany \u2013 twice what's he's managed at home \u2013 and has become both arrogant and presumptuous as a result of his premature fame.</p> <p>So far, so predictable. I ignore all controversy involving Hilton, so I ignored this one too. I did last night in a bar where it was showing on TV with the sound turned down - always instructive. But no. Hilton's counterattack is in the papers and on high IQ radio. I've just checked it out on <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSJCnBz7cTg\">YouTube</a> and it's both smart and funny. It mocks McCain, who had it coming to him, but it also laughs at Paris Hilton. On her lounger in a leopard print swimsuit she shows self-awareness of the kind which has always eluded bluestockings like Germaine Greer and Richard Dawkins.</p> <p>\"Hey America, I'm Paris Hilton and I'm a celebrity too. Only I'm not from the olden days and I'm not promising change like that other guy. I'm just hot!\" she says in a script written for her by Chris Henchy, Brooke Shields' husband. </p> <p>But were Henchy (44) and Hilton (27) right to mock McCain (almost 72) for being a \"wrinkly white-haired dude\", so old he can remember when dancing was a sin and beer was served in buckets? My instinct is yes, partly because the McCain camp started it and partly \u2013 see above \u2013 because Paris is also funny about herself. Before explaining her energy policy, she dips into Conde Nast Traveler looking for the best place to get a tan.</p> <p>The energy policy isn't daft at all: take McCain's commitment to drill for oil off the US coastal shelf (under strict environmental controls) and Obama's demand for alternative energy sources, and do a bit of both. Give Detroit tax incentives to make better hybrid and electric cars, she says. \"Energy crisis solved, I'll see you at the debates, bitches!\"</p> <p>The crucial point is that viewers will probably join in the joke. That's important: jokes work. Tony Blair defused Cherie's waspish aside about Gordon Brown by telling Labour conference: \"At least I know she won't run off with the bloke next door.\" Much more relevant here is Ronald Reagan's <a href=\"http://www-cgi.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/1996/debates/history/1984/\">ambush</a> of Walter Mondale in the second of the 1984 presidential debates. Mondale had knocked Reagan about a bit in the first, making him look tired and out of touch. In round two the wily president was waiting for his moment. When it came, Reagan said \"I am not going to exploit for political purposes my opponent's youth and inexperience.\" Not a great gag, but everyone laughed. I was there and felt Reagan won re-election in that moment.</p> <p>A friend I chatted with at a wedding in Washington, who is desperate for the Democrat to win, almost whispered \"Does Obama have a sense of humour?\" It's a good question, and others share that fear. A sense of humour matters. McCain is not only old and notoriously bad-tempered, he's also said by people who know to be mean-spirited and capable of abandoning his more attractive and independent positions ( even on torture!) to ingratiate himself with the suspicious Republican mainstream. But he can be funny. When a reporter suggested that \"voters may reject you because they feel you're too old to be president\", McCain didn't move for a second or two. He was pretending to be asleep.</p> <p>You can imagine Vince Cable doing that, but not Ming Campbell, who is only a touch older but thinks older. Blair might pull it off, probably not Gordon Brown. David Cameron has a sense of humour. It's no guarantee \u2013 Mrs Thatcher was never accused of having one \u2013 but it helps.</p> <p>The McCain attack ads, and those freelance ones not authorised by him, are nastier than European voters probably realise, insulated as they are from paid political adverts (a great European achievement, incidentally). In 1988, Bush senior used racist crime ads to diminish that turkey of a Democrat, Mike Dukakis.</p> <p>But there's often a germ of truth in such viciousness. McCain's attack dogs want to paint Obama as an exotic: almost-foreign, liberal and elitist. That <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/online/covers/slideshow_blittcovers\">New Yorker cover</a>, intended to caricature that view of the Democratic candidate and his wife, helped McCain, I feel sure. </p> <p>Trouble is there's something there, a kind of distance from the electorate in the highly-efficient Obama campaign which American friends - mostly Democrats - confirm. I don't think he's got the election in the bag, as much liberal commentary around the world assumes. Middle America is a very cautious and conservative place. Even in states like Massachusetts, white working class Americans are not sure what to do. It isn't just the race thing, either. With 97 days to go, you can take comfort if you seek it from <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/08/05/obama-calls-mccain-out-af_n_117142.html\">Obama's response</a> to McCain's jibe that the Democrat's answer to the fuel crisis is that American drivers should keep their tyre pressure up and save gas. It's good advice, of course, but McCain mocked it. \"It's like these guys are proud of being ignorant,\" Obama told his own crowds. </p> <p>But George Bush is said to have quoted Abraham Lincoln's maxim about being able \"to fool some of the people all of the time\" - adding \"they're they ones we have to concentrate on.\" A good joke - though scary. Don't push your luck and post another ad, Paris, there's too much riding on this election. You may not get it right next time.</p>",
  "<p>African-Americans are <a href=\"http://news.yahoo.com/page/election-2008-political-pulse-excited-voters\">excited about Barack Obama's success</a> so far. However what they expect of him during this presidential campaign is another matter. It is clear that there are a significant number of people, including those who <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-Se6E4uZhs&amp;feature=related\">heckled him at a town hall meeting last week</a>, who expect an African-American candidate to focus on African-American issues and are disappointed that they have not been placed centre stage in Obama's campaign. </p> <p>The young African-American men who heckled Obama in Florida last week held up a banner that read \"What about the black community, Obama?\" They accused him of not addressing issues specific to African-Americans such as Jena 6, Hurricane Katrina and the killing of Sean Bell. They asked: \"Why is it that you have not had the ability to speak to the interests and even speak on behalf of the oppressed and exploited black community in this country?\"</p> <p>Black British writer <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/04/race.usa\">Vanessa Walters expressed dismay</a> that Obama has distanced himself from rapper Ludacris's latest song, which features crude lyrics about Hillary Clinton, John McCain and George Bush. Writing in Comment is Free on Monday, she asserted: \"In the future, [Obama's] got to actually tackle some of the conflicts about being black and excluded.\" </p> <p>Regular Cif commenter <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/jul/10/barackobama.race?commentid=c67d0aba-384f-47e8-80b7-48752b453c1e\">halgeel84</a> takes a great deal of umbrage at what she sees as Obama's lack of interest in black issues. She regularly expresses her concern about what Obama has not, for example, said \"with respect to the challenges black men is facing in America today such as lack of jobs, racial profiling, mass incarceration.\"</p> <p>Such concerns are legitimate. There are indeed serious problems within the African-American community that need to be not only addressed, but solved. It's also natural that African-Americans would hope that Obama, who apparently understands their struggles and challenges and may be about to become part of a system that has oppressed them for so long, would want to effect change on their behalf. </p> <p>However, should African-Americans be managing their expectations? After all, Obama is running for president of the United States, not the NAACP. He is not a civil rights activist. Obama has carefully built up an image as a man for all Americans, carefully treading a fine line when it comes to racial issues and avoiding any attempts to pigeon hole him as \"the black candidate\" whose exclusive concern is African-American issues. </p> <p>It isn't that Obama doesn't care about, or isn't addressing, these issues. He has spoken in front of all-black audiences in churches and town halls, recently addressed the NAACP Annual Conference and in April met with the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1NA4T0F-rU\">North Carolina Black Press Association</a> to talk at length about African-American issues. In that discussion he acknowledged that \"we have some issues which are very specific to the African American community that have to be dealt with\" before going on to explain that \"my approach to this campaign has been to say that all Americans \u2013 black, white, Hispanic, Asian, Native American, all of us - have an interest in seeing a more just and equitable society.\" </p> <p>It is that focus on all Americans, as opposed to just African-Americans, which is bothering some people. Considering that African-Americans tend to be at the bottom end of most aspects of American life, including disproportionate incarceration rates, a 25% poverty rate (as opposed to 8% for white Americans) and major economic inequality, this is understandable. A focus on everyone is great, they argue, but it is clear that African-Americans require more attention than others. But as Obama told the hecklers, he has indeed spoken out \"forcefully\" about the issues they have accused him of ignoring: \"Listen, I was a civil rights lawyer. I passed the first racial profiling legislation in Illinois. I passed some of the toughest death penalty reform legislation in Illinois. \u2026 That doesn't mean I am always going to satisfy the way you guys want these issues framed.\"</p> <p>The way in which Obama has framed the issues has been politically savvy. African-Americans who expect Obama to run as the \"African-American candidate\" and talk all day, every day about black issues are expecting him to fail in his bid to become president. When Jesse Jackson ran on an all black platform, it did not get him anywhere close to where Obama is now. </p> <p>The truth is that most Americans who Obama would be representing as president and therefore needs to appeal to care more about the economy, Iraq and the housing crisis than Jena 6. It does not mean, however, that African-American issues are not important, just that they are being addressed as just one part of the wider political whole. People may indeed have more success with these issues on a state or local level.</p> <p>Furthermore, the questions about what the next president will do to solve problems within the black community are not just for Obama. McCain \u2013 currently not so far behind Obama in the polls - should also be held to task.</p> <p>I understand why some African-Americans expect Obama to champion their causes more often and more publicly. However, by now they should have realised that Obama's campaign is not about them. At the end of the day, Obama may be an African-American, but he is an African-American whose role, should he become president, will be to stand for all people, regardless of race.</p>",

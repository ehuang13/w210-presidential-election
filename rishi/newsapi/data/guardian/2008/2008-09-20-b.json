  "<p>The opening was superbly choreographed. To the sound of thundering rock music blaring from speakers, several thousand people watched as John McCain's campaign plane swooped out of the sparkling blue Iowa skies.</p> <p>The plane taxied to a halt only 100 metres away from the crowd gathered at an airport outside the city of Cedar Rapids. They cheered wildly as McCain and his running mate, Sarah Palin, descended from the aircraft and trooped through the throng, smiling and shaking hands.</p> <p>Then things started to go wrong. 'Thank you so much, Iowa. It's great to be here in Grand Rapids,' Palin said as she took the stage, naming a completely different city in the far-off state of Michigan. 'CEDAR Rapids!' came shouts from the crowd. Palin ignored her gaffe and ploughed on with a speech that was quickly interrupted by anti-war protesters. For several minutes the hangar was filled with shouts and chants, drowning out the Alaska governor's words. Then McCain took the stage, and the same thing happened to him, forcing him off his script to address an unruly scrimmage as security hauled out the shouting demonstrators. 'The one thing Americans want us to do is stop yelling at each other,' McCain said in exasperation.</p> <p>Suddenly, after hauling his campaign back into contention for the White House, the wheels are starting to come off McCain's fabled Straight Talk Express. The gaffe-ridden rally in Cedar Rapids was only one indication. In a week of almost unprecedented economic crisis, when Wall Street seemed on the brink of meltdown, McCain's presidential bid was hit by mistake after mistake, varying from the serious to the surreal. </p> <p>As stocks dropped off a precipice, McCain said the economic fundamentals were strong. Then a senior aide seemed to suggest McCain had invented the BlackBerry. His top economic adviser, Carly Fiorina, confessed she thought neither McCain nor Palin was capable of running a large company. Then, in the middle of the worst financial collapse since the 1930s, McCain got the public endorsement of Donald Trump, a celebrity tycoon who symbolises raw capitalism. For a candidate trying to strike a populist tone, the backing of 'the Donald' was poorly timed. 'It's like a Saturday Night Live routine,' quipped rival Barack Obama on a campaign stop in Nevada.</p> <p>At the same time the remarkable surge of support inspired by Palin seems to be ebbing. Polls show women voters drifting back to Obama, who has established a slim lead again. Palin is increasingly mired in the 'Troopergate' scandal related to allegations that she fired a senior official out of a personal grudge against her sister's former partner. Palin's star, which shone so brightly for two weeks and reinvigorated the Republican base, is showing every sign of dimming. But the real problem is the biggest one: the stunning economic rollercoaster of last week. Americans in their tens of millions have been glued to their TV screens watching banks collapse, stocks slide and their own government pump billions of dollars into the system to bail out troubled banks and insurers. It has turned the election right back to the core issue that Democrats have wanted to talk about all along: the economy and its terrible woes. McCain, with the first presidential debate looming this week, is now fighting the election on his opponent's strongest turf. In an America shaken and scared by the spectre of a second Great Depression, no one is talking about pigs, lipstick or moose-hunting any more.</p> <p>But McCain is nothing if not a fighter. In Cedar Rapids he came out blazing against Wall Street, reckless investors and the regulators who let them place such risky bets. His speech was full of fiery language as he vowed to sack government officials, defend US workers and clean up Washington DC. 'Right now you are hurting and it is not your fault,' he told the crowd of several thousand packed into an aircraft hangar. 'It started at the top. It started in Washington. It started on Wall Street and we are going to fix it.' </p> <p>The crowd dutifully cheered its support, swinging behind this new image of McCain as a man of the people. The applause lines just kept on coming. 'They turned our markets into a casino,' McCain added, to more cheers. 'The regulators were asleep at the switch. They were asleep, my friends. They were not working for you,' he said. It seemed to work, too, though only with an all-Republican crowd that had long bought into his message. 'I am very excited about this. McCain right now is the best thing for this country,' said Harry Meek, owner of a local Iowa pest management company, who had driven more than 100 miles to get to the rally. </p> <p>Outside the confines of a friendly Republican crowd, McCain's message is likely to meet greater resistance. For many years, McCain has been an outspoken advocate of easing restrictions on Wall Street, not tightening regulations. His campaign is closely linked to lobbyists and the financial industry is a huge donator to his cause. That has allowed Obama's speechwriters to hurl some sharply worded barbs. 'The old boys' network? In the McCain campaign, that's called a staff meeting,' is one of Obama's most popular lines in his current stump speech.</p> <p>At the same time McCain is facing an American electorate likely to blame eight years living under a Republican White House for the current mess. The words that McCain never mentions on the campaign trail are 'President George W Bush'. In effect, McCain has to run against what his own Republican party has done for the last two presidential terms, almost turning his campaign into a third party. But the Bush legacy is still likely to cast a deep shadow over his efforts. 'It is hard for his message to ring true: \"If you elect me I will finally clean up Washington, having been there for 30 years\",' said Professor Seth Masket, a political scientist at Denver University. 'It is a really hard needle to thread.' </p> <p>The economy is not the ground on which McCain wanted to fight the election. His line last week that 'the fundamentals of our economy are strong' was the latest in a long list of verbal mistakes he has made over economic issues. The subject has been a weak one for Republicans ever since the Bush administration turned a surplus into a massive deficit and jobless figures started creeping up. </p> <p>A recent Washington Post poll found that people preferred Obama on the economy by 51 per cent to 39 per cent. Almost three-quarters of people said Obama understood their economic problems, compared with only 53 per cent who thought McCain felt that way. Certainly McCain's recent successes in the polls have not been built on his economic image. Instead they were boosted by a tough, disciplined message machine that had successfully torn into Obama's image and accused him of being elitist, liberal and sexist. But now that apparatus of attack is starting to splutter too. Reporters on McCain's campaign plane recently staged a protest against a decision to cut off access to McCain. They chanted 'Bring Mac back!' as they sat in their plane seats. The demonstration had little impact but showed how broken relations have become with the press corps that once fawned upon the candidate.</p> <p>At the same time, the hard-edged anti-Obama attacks have become so extreme that many commentators have accused the campaign of outright lies. Even the conservative Fox News channel joined the debate when one of its anchors publicly ripped into a senior McCain spokesman on air for misrepresenting Obama's tax plans.</p> <p>Finally, to add to the misery, there has been a slew of negative news about Palin. After first promising to co-operate in the Troopergate investigation in Alaska, she has now refused to testify. So has her husband, Todd. The McCain campaign is taking the whole issue so seriously that it has dispatched a rapid response team to Alaska to rebut the regular new revelations emerging from the state. The effort is being directed by lawyer Edward O'Callaghan, a McCain aide who was previously a terrorist expert. Polls have shown that the story has damaged Palin, and a carefully planned media rollout, via a series of TV interviews, has done little to blunt it. After massive swings in her direction after her stunning debut at the Republican convention, the pendulum of popularity has started to reverse course. Last week one poll showed Palin registering an 11-point drop in support among women. Another showed white women voters going back to Obama by a margin of 21 points. Not that anyone could tell that from Palin's performance in Iowa. When not shouting over the noise of protesters, she doggedly delivered her trademark speech, complete with introduction of her husband as 'First Dude' and touting her experience as a 'mom'. She exuded confidence and kept up the barrage of attacks on Obama. 'He likes to point the finger of blame,' she said of the Democratic candidate 'But has he ever really lifted a finger to help?' </p> <p>The message is aimed at people like Ron Eversman and small towns like Newton, Iowa. Eversman, a baker, was sitting last week in the neat square at the heart of Newton, a town surrounded by cornfields and reeling from the closure of a factory and the loss of hundreds of jobs. It is a story repeated all over America and uppermost in voters' minds. Eversman had watched the events on Wall Street unfolding with a mixture of fear and grim fascination. 'It sure isn't good, is it? I have a little investment and it has taken a beating,' he said.</p> <p>Eversman had good news for Obama. He plans to vote for him. 'McCain is too much like Bush. He's better than Bush, of course. But I want something different.' But it would be a mistake to think the Democrats have the support of Eversman - and millions of worried voters like him - sewn up. Eversman admitted that he could change his mind by November. 'I don't think Obama is any kind of saviour or anything,' he said with a shrug.</p> <p>The economic crisis holds many pitfalls for Obama too. His style and rhetoric have been based on lofty idealism and inspiration. That created an astonishing political movement, based on young voters, black people and the well educated. But, as Hillary Clinton showed in the final weeks of her nomination run, Obama is vulnerable to a candidate who can tap into the deep concerns of working-class white America. His choice of Joe Biden as a running mate was meant to solve the issue, but so far the Delaware senator has had little impact, apart from developing a long line of mistakes, including opining that Clinton might have been a better choice. Obama himself might have trouble striking a populist tone, too. As the first black candidate of a major party, his staff is aware that he cannot afford to be portrayed as the 'angry black' candidate. His appeal is based on unity, good governance and an attempt to be 'post-racial'. </p> <p>Like McCain, he has been hit by some unfortunate events in the past week. Both campaigns seem to be expert at attacking each other and less good at their own performance. First, Biden called for rich people to pay more taxes as their patriotic duty. That comment was co-opted into McCain's speech literally within hours. 'Raising taxes in a tough economy is not patriotic. It is not a badge of honour. It is just plain dumb,' McCain said in Cedar Rapids, getting the biggest cheer of the rally.</p> <p>Then Obama was hit by the fund-raising needs of his campaign. As the economic crisis sloshed over the country, he held a celebrity-studded event in California, at which Barbra Streisand sang. The cost for a ticket was a staggering $28,500(\u00a315,500). Obama was ruthlessly mocked on the late-night talk shows. 'All the big Hollywood stars were there... I believe the topic was how John McCain is out of touch with the common people,' quipped TV host Jay Leno.</p> <p>But there is little doubt that the Democrats are now much happier to be fighting this election on economic issues. The past few weeks of 'Palin mania' threw them off balance. Now it has put their campaign where it always wanted to be: attacking McCain directly and making it about serious issues. The airwaves are full of Obama ads portraying McCain as out of touch and Obama as in tune with the needs of ordinary people. They even include a two-minute advert in which Obama outlines his economic agenda. 'That's a pretty amazing ad to be running. It shows how serious people are taking this,' said Masket. On the stump last week Obama launched salvo after salvo in McCain's direction. 'What we've seen the last few days is nothing less than the final verdict on an economic philosophy that has completely failed,' he said at a Colorado rally. The Democrats are sensing their chance again. The polls bear them out. They are back in the game. Obama has re-established a small but solid lead in recent surveys. The RCP average of polls has him two points ahead of McCain. In the key battleground states things are tight again. </p> <p>A week ago all the buzz was about McCain closing the gap in Democratic strongholds like New York and New Jersey. Now the stress is on Obama's growing strength in red states like Virginia, Colorado and North Carolina. With seven weeks to go, the election is swinging to and fro but is still too close to call. </p> <p>Yet as the economic crisis has swept all before it and dominated the headlines, a few people are beginning to question what it is that the next occupant of the White House is going to inherit. 'Whoever it is, Obama or McCain, I really don't envy the next President,' said Masket.</p> <h2>Locking horns</h2> <p>'I could walk [100 miles] from here to Lansing and I wouldn't run into a single person who thought our economy was doing well, unless I ran into John McCain.'<br><strong>Joe Biden</strong>, Monday</p> <p>'The fundamentals of our economy are strong.

  "<h2>Marjorie Nshemere Ojule<br>32, Ugandan refugee, now a trustee of Women for Refugee Women in the UK</h2> <p><strong>'If my husband is out there, if he sees my photo, I would love him to contact me'</strong></p> <p>In Uganda I was active in opposition politics at a grassroots level: working in my village, helping women to know their rights and teaching them reading and writing. I was detained twice. The horror that I experienced in there, you wouldn't wish that on anyone, not even your enemy. I was tortured, I was raped, I was burnt with cigarettes, I was cut with razors, electric shocks: all the horrible things you can think of to get information from someone. Eventually I escaped and came to England. It was scary but I'd been in this torture for some time, and I just wanted to be able to breathe fresh air again. I left my husband when I escaped and that's the last time I saw him. I don't have a clue where he is. If he's out there, if he sees my photo, I would love him to contact me. I may be dreaming about him when he's already dead but life is full of surprises. </p> <p>The child I have now is out of rape and at first I didn't want to keep her, I wanted to put her up for adoption. When I arrived in 2002, they took me to the hospital: I was malnourished, I was dehydrated, I didn't have any blood and the Home Office told me I had to go home when the child was born. After six months they wanted to check my daughter was healthy and it was only after that they said 'Oh by the way we have a family for her'. I said I'm not ready to give someone my child if they first want to see if she's developing at the normal rate and so on. At this time I was going to counselling and it made me a strong person: my wounds had healed, I was looking and feeling myself and I realised this child was part of me. It's difficult bringing her up but if I didn't have her I would have gone insane waiting for a decision from the Home Office. </p> <p>It's easy to say 'Oh asylum seekers have taken all the houses and so on', but the truth is that asylum seekers really suffer in the current system. When my case was heard in court, the judge agreed that I was tortured and gave me leave to remain on human-rights grounds. But the Home Office appealed against that decision. That was in 2004 and, until January this year, I was living in limbo, waiting to hear the outcome. Finally they gave me indefinite leave to remain.</p> <p>I got tired of sitting at home so I started looking for charities and it was through Women for Refugee Women that I met Natasha [Walter, who runs the charity]. I've been public speaking ever since, telling my story and telling the stories of other women who can't speak English. It felt like therapy as well: when there's a place where you can explode with anger and say 'why would the government do this?' it feels good afterwards, like I could breathe properly. Everyone asks me 'Oh my God Marjorie, how did you manage to deal with all these things?' I'd say the work I do with you keeps me busy. I've been to the House of Commons I don't know how many times. The first time was so scary but when I stood up and spoke, I looked around and everyone was nodding and I thought: oh my God, I have power. You can make me sign [for asylum seekers' financial support] 1,001 times a day [asylum seekers have to sign regularly to comply with Home Office regulations. Breach of signing requirements can result in detention] but you can't take my brains out of my head. I thought 'Way to go, woman!' Natasha tells me I'm amazing and I say 'I'm amazing because of you'. That makes me cry because if it wasn't for people like that I could not have had that power. I am so grateful to them. </p> <p>I'm putting in an application for my 10-year-old daughter to come here because my mother, her guardian, passed away. Looking forward to meeting her - that hope keeps me going. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.refugeewomen.com\">refugeewomen.com</a></p> <h2>Hollman Morris<br>40, Colombian journalist, winner of the 2007 human rights watch defender prize</h2> <p><strong>'I had to find out how people were slaughtered and nothing happened'</strong></p> <p>My seven-year-old daughter asked me a while ago 'Daddy, why do you only interview sad people?' She had just seen one of my shows where I talked to victims of Colombia's conflict but I explained to her they are not just sad, they also have dreams, hope and dignity...</p> <p>The people I interview are the voice of the 'other' Colombia, a Colombia that you don't see in most media, a Colombia that some people wish didn't exist. I knew from when I set out to be a journalist that my job was to show their stories. </p> <p>I first saw that need when I was a teenager watching the TV news and when they reported about a massacre in Segovia where 70 people were killed in one day (11 November 1988) and I thought 'Shit, what is that about?' and then a few hours later we were watching a national beauty contest. That defined my role as a journalist because I decided I had to find out how it could be in this country that people were being slaughtered and nothing happened. </p> <p>That has always meant problems for me with all the armed actors in the Colombian conflict. Since 1997 there have always been death threats from one group or another. But the most critical year of my life was between 2000 and 2001. A colleague who had been kidnapped and raped (by paramilitaries) said her captors had told her: 'Hollman Morris is next.' Around the same time my wife Patty told me she was pregnant. We fled to Spain with the help of an Amnesty International programme for human rights defenders because I was able to show my work from a human rights perspective.</p> <p>After a year we came back to Colombia. My options for work in Spain were to do menial tasks, be a parking lot attendant. So it was a choice between shooting myself [out of frustration] in Spain or I get shot doing what I love in Colombia. </p> <p>Our job as journalists is to look after people's rights. In a way we are the guardians of human rights. We may not be the activists who put out urgent action notices every day. But our work as journalists is to write, publish and denounce when there is a violation of any fundamental right. </p> <p>My generation has never seen a day of peace in Colombia. What I want is through journalism to try to build a better country for my children to live in so that they can live in peace.</p> <h2>Zmitser Dashkevich<br>27, leader of Youth Front, Belarus</h2> <p><strong>'I received hundreds of letters of support every day from all over the world'</strong></p> <p>I was arrested in September 2006 and charged with 'organising and participating in the activity of an unregistered non-governmental organisation'. After six weeks in detention and on trial I was sentenced to one-and-a-half years in prison.</p> <p>At that time I was leader of Youth Front, which is a Christian organisation of young people in Belarus. It is an independent political and social force which is in stark opposition to President Alexander Lukashenko, the last dictator in Europe. Lukashenko has openly praised Stalin and wants to turn our country back into the evil empire, the Soviet Union. We believe his politics are leading to the spiritual and moral degeneration of Belarussian society.</p> <p>On six occasions we have tried to register our organisation but every time our application was refused. In early 2006 Lukashenko became very worried in the run-up to presidential elections. He understood that he was losing his power because the younger generation - despite all the ideology and repression - did not support him. Young people are mostly pro-European and pro-democratic in outlook. We were holding protests against falsification of the vote. So he introduced a new article into the law making it illegal to participate in the activities of an unregistered organisation. I was the first to be prosecuted. </p> <p>After sentencing I was sent to prison. We slept in barracks and ate porridge and rotten meat. Very soon I started receiving hundreds of letters of support every day. They came from ordinary Belarussians, from Christian organisations and from members of human-rights groups from all over the world. These activists also sent thousands of letters to the government. And they sent lots of origami cranes - a symbol of freedom. I received some in prison. The censors checked my post and they unfolded the cranes to see if anything was inside. So I just received these creased, flattened-out pieces of coloured paper. But it was a powerful statement. </p> <p>The government had painted us oppositionists as a sad, marginal group on the payroll of the CIA. But when the prison guards saw all my letters, they said: 'Wow, the people are really behind this guy.' They started to understand the gap between the propaganda and reality. Even the administrators admitted the letters were proof of something big. It altered their outlook. As a direct result of the huge campaign of public solidarity I was released one-and-a-half months early and returned to lead Youth Front. We are still struggling against Lukashenko's regime but now they are too afraid to imprison people under the registration law. </p> <h2>Odette Mupenzi<br>31, victim of Rwandan genocide </h2> <p><strong>'I was very ill... I wanted to commit suicide. Now, I feel alive again'</strong></p> <p>I realised being a Tutsi was not considered good by some people when I was 11, because I had a teacher who picked on us, saying we had funny faces. Then in 1990 [the majority Hutus] killed many Tutsi intellectuals in a stadium near where I lived. After that, I knew we were in danger, but I didn't expect what was coming.</p> <p>In January 1994, my family stopped sleeping at home because we thought we would be taken away during the night. When the genocide began in April, we fled to a religious seminary. The next day, lots of people turned up with machetes, guns, spears and axes. </p> <p>Many of us hid in a classroom. They came to the door and my father opened it, because they threatened to burn the building down. When he did, I saw them cut him open. I was hiding under a mattress and they put a gun to my face and shot me. I could hear people praying, then there was silence - everyone was dead. The next thing I remember was waking up in hospital.</p> <p>I've been fighting for life ever since. In Rwanda, all they did was wash the wound. An NGO helped me get treatment in Switzerland, but they ran out of money. I went to Germany and the same thing happened.</p> <p>I first met the human-rights group Aegis Trust when it set up a genocide memorial in Kigali [in 2004]. I was very ill at the time - my bones were infected and I was living on morphine. </p> <p>In March 2006, I came to England. I've had metal bones put in my jaw, and skin taken from my side and put in my face. I don't think people at home would recognise me. I can eat with a spoon and fork and drink from a tap. I don't know how to explain how the trust has helped me - thank you isn't enough. When they met me, I wanted to commit suicide. Now, I feel alive again.</p> <p>To be honest, I don't want to go back to Rwanda. The war has stopped, but there are still troubles - survivors have been killed to stop them testifying against people. I just want to live in a country where I don't have to look over my shoulder all the time. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.aegistrust.org\">aegistrust.org</a></p> <h2>Ignatius Mahendra Kusuma Wardhana<br>25, Indonesian student activist </h2> <p><strong>'They put me in a cell. There were a lot of blood prints over the walls'</strong></p> <p>I was imprisoned when I was 20 due to my involvement in the National Student League for Democracy. In January 2003, the President brought in a new policy to increase fuel and electricity prices, so mass demonstrations took place across Indonesia. We held a demonstration in Jakarta and it ended with a performance in which we burnt pictures of the President and Vice President. The police surrounded us and one of my friends was captured. I was not arrested at this point because the police didn't have a warrant. But my friend was blindfolded and they threatened him, saying they would shoot him and throw his body in the sea. He told me all this afterwards - at the time we didn't realise that he was captured. </p> <p>When we went to the police station to find him, they gave me the warrant and arrested me. They interrogated me for about seven hours and a lot of the questions were not about the demonstration but about my organisation, who I was dealing with and so on. They put me in a cell that they called 'the tiger cage' because there was no bathroom in there; it's like when you're in the zoo and you see animals in a cage. It's a place where the police beat up prisoners too so there were a lot of blood prints over the walls. </p> <p>In every trial the President's supporter came and threatened me and my lawyer. Maybe my lawyer was not brave enough because at the sixth or seventh trial he backed down and gave up. I was in despair because I thought I had no other way out. In April 2003 I was sentenced to three years. I was put in a cell they called the dry cell because there is no water at all - they gave us a drink once a day. There was a prisoner who sort of ran the prison, a member of the President's party, who fought me every week. Well, it wasn't really a fight because they were about 20 people and I am only one. The prison officer knew what was going on but I guess he was given money.</p> <p>Amnesty International is familiar with the Indonesian movement and it made a greeting-card campaign, sending cards to me and to the Indonesian President. I counted more than 4,000 letters. They made me feel better and gave me hope but, most important, they meant that the prison officer was more careful with me. I was there for two years, seven months and three days: I counted every day but the most significant factor in keeping my spirits up was the campaign. When I got letters from children in the UK I just couldn't believe that they were aware of me and were doing something about it. </p> <p>Indonesia is in a transitional period right now and there is still a lot to do for human rights. The first thing I did when I was released was demonstrate outside the prison because even though we got a new President with the 2004 election, he has continued repressive policies against activists. Prison is a bad memory but I got a lot of experience and lessons from it. I'm going to study human rights and politics at York University in October and after that I will continue my organisation. This is what I live for, this struggle.</p>",
  "<p>At the heart of London's Docklands, once a mouldering reminder of Britain's history as a great trading nation and now a gleaming glass and steel symbol of the might of global finance, the Canary Wharf offices of American investment bank Lehman Brothers - a name few people would have been aware of until a week ago - has suddenly become a stop on the tourist trail. A group of business people over from China on a training course have stopped to stare and have their photographs taken.</p> <p>'It is very shocking. We are here and it is very dramatic,' says a young woman among them, but she is interrupted by a Lehman security guard who charges over. 'You can't take photographs here, bloody gawpers!' he says. The group race off immediately, heads down, and the guard turns back muttering about their lack of respect for other people's misery.</p> <p>In New York, too, the 'gawpers' thronged to Lehman's headquarters in their hundreds to watch history unfold. On both sides of the Atlantic throughout the past tumultuous week, from Lehman's catastrophic collapse on Sunday night to US Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson's promise on Friday to spend 'hundreds of billions of dollars' of American taxpayers' money to ride to the rescue of the banks, there was a profound sense of world-changing events unfolding at breakneck speed.</p> <p>Exuberant investors may have piled back into the stock markets on Friday, welcoming Paulson's mooted corporate aid package, but few believed anything would ever be the same again. Behind the anguished yells of disorientated City traders watching the markets oscillate from depression to mania and back again, and the macho insistence by Gordon Brown that he was in control of the crisis, something else was audible throughout - the sound of long-cherished truths being smashed to smithereens.</p> <p>Financiers in New York and London's Square Mile have enjoyed an extraordinary decade of global dominance, blowing unthinkable sums on yachts, racehorses and fine wines. Not only did they convince themselves of their own invincibility, but their glamour and sheer wealth blinded politicians into believing the alluring myths of the unfettered market.</p> <p>For Brown, who made it his mission from the early 1990s to woo London's money men, the reward for making sure regulators had a light touch and that taxes were low was a decade of turbo-charged growth, and the right to boast that the economic cycle of boom and bust was over.</p> <p>But while the banks were chalking up impressive profits, and driving growth, they were spoon-feeding Britain's consumers on a rich diet of cheap credit, which they gladly swallowed. The UK piled up the biggest debts in the G7 group of industrialised nations, sending up the price of homes from Cornwall to the Highlands of Scotland. Far from exercising Brown's cardinal virtue of prudence, consumers were saving less than at any time since the 1950s.</p> <p>The events of the past week may have played out among the larger-than-life characters of Wall Street, but on a smaller scale here at home they have finally slammed down the shutters on the era of cheap credit. For Britain's buy-now-pay-later, shop-till-you-drop economy, a mighty reckoning is now in store.</p> <p>For the staff of the investment bank Lehman Brothers, the reckoning came fast, last Monday morning. Glued to their BlackBerries all weekend for the latest news, they had pinned their hopes on a Sunday announcement of a government-brokered rescue, like the one Paulson clinched for Bear Stearns, then America's fifth-biggest investment bank, in March. But this time it was different. Dick Fuld, Lehman's abrasive chief, had stubbornly refused to countenance a series of offers to sell parts of his battered business, and Paulson thought he - and Wall Street - deserved to be taught a lesson.</p> <p>Lehman, he decided, must be left to sink or swim. 'He was effectively trying to identify \"insider money\" and \"outsider money\",' says Russell Jones, chief strategist at investment firm RBC Capital Markets. 'He was saying, \"Where an institution affects Main Street [outsider money], we'll save it; but where it only affects Wall Street [insider money], we won't\".'</p> <p>Barclays was one potential buyer for Lehman, and the head of Barclays Capital, Bob Diamond, flew out to New York to try to cut a deal. Paulson, however, refused to stump up any public cash to help rescue the 158-year-old institution - and the regulators back in London informed Diamond that they would need rock-solid assurances that bringing Lehman, with its billions of dollars of 'toxic' mortgage assets, under the wing of a British bank would not endanger the stability of the UK's financial system. Diamond walked away.</p> <p>Just before midnight on Sunday, its last chance exhausted, Fuld filed for bankruptcy, bringing down the curtain on an illustrious Wall Street dynasty - and rocking the financial world to its core.</p> <p>Back in London, where Chancellor Alistair Darling was in regular contact with Paulson, the prospect of such a high-profile casualty immediately set warning lights flashing. Lehman employed 5,000 staff in the UK at its swish Canary Wharf headquarters, whose jobs and livelihoods would be at risk; but Darling, and Financial Services Authority chairman Callum McCarthy knew that its collapse could ripple far beyond Docklands, to threaten the stability of Britain's entire banking system.</p> <p>Last Monday morning, as Lehman staff left Canary Wharf with boxes full of belongings, Darling held a fraught phone conference with McCarthy and Gordon Brown to discuss the risk that Lehman's collapse could so alarm investors that it would destabilise banks. Already, HBOS - which had tried and failed to raise \u00a34bn of cash from its shareholders in June - was in their sights. Later that day, Treasury officials, led by Darling's senior fixer Tom Scholar, began talking to HBOS about its future.</p> <p>Lloyds TSB, which had been hit less hard by the credit crunch than many of its rivals, first approached HBOS's ebullient boss, Andy Hornby, back in July. Despite the bungled fundraising, Hornby, once in charge of the George clothing range at Asda and a protege of retail millionaire and former Tory MP Archie Norman, was still determined he could go it alone.</p> <p>But the events of last Monday changed everything. As if Lehman's unseemly demise was not enough for the world's shocked investors to digest, Merrill Lynch, another mighty Wall Street broker brought low by rash bets on American mortgages, was swallowed up by its rival, Bank of America, in a hasty $50bn deal.</p> <p>Takeovers are hardly rare in banking; but for two such venerable Wall Street brands to disappear from the corporate jungle in a single day induced an alarming sense of vertigo among even the most hard-bitten investors.</p> <p>Economists call it 'contagion': the process by which the violent swings of mood caused by dramatic events in one financial market can rapidly spread around today's globalised world. From Moscow to Sydney, Paris to Beijing, investors dumped shares, wiping billions of dollars off the value of the world's companies, and poured cash into the traditional 'safe haven' asset of gold.</p> <p>On cable TV financial channel Bloomberg News on Monday night, usually the purveyor of bone-dry financial statistics, a ticker whizzed across the bottom of the screen that read 'Lehman staff clear desks, call headhunters, weep'.</p> <p>In the UK, all bank shares were pummelled, as investors began to think the unthinkable; but HBOS, long known to be woefully exposed to the shaky British property market, was most at risk. Its share price dropped by 18 per cent on Monday alone.</p> <p>That evening, Gordon Brown cornered Lloyds chairman Victor Blank at a party. Brown knew that if Lloyds was to succeed in rescuing HBOS, the government would have to throw its weight behind the deal by waiving competition rules.</p> <p>On Tuesday morning, Darling, McCarthy and Bank of England governor Mervyn King gathered at Number 11 Downing Street to review the unfolding crisis; and decided HBOS directors must be told that 'soldiering on wouldn't do'. The sense of crisis was heightened later that same day, when Ben Bernanke, chairman of the US central bank, the Federal Reserve, announced he would use $85bn (\u00a346bn) of public funds to make an emergency loan to the American insurer AIG, the world's biggest - and sponsor of Manchester United.</p> <p>Under its charismatic former boss Hank Greenberg, AIG had transformed itself from an old-fashioned insurer into a whizzy financial player with a spider's web of complex bets, and it was now facing massive losses as a result of the Lehman collapse.</p> <p>Bernanke, who forged his reputation as an economics professor studying the catalogue of mistakes that turned the Wall Street crash of 1929 into the decade-long Great Depression, feared that allowing AIG to follow Lehman into the bankruptcy courts would leave its clients throughout the banking world dangerously vulnerable, and put the health of the whole financial system at risk.</p> <p>In London, meanwhile, there was rising concern that if talks between Lloyds and HBOS were not concluded fast, savers would begin queuing outside Halifax branches to withdraw their savings. Already, other banks had begun to withdraw some of their funds, the first sign that a run on the bank could be in the offing.</p> <p>The humiliating run on Northern Rock a year ago is seared into the government's collective memory. It was the most public evidence of a government losing control of Britain's economy since Norman Lamont had to stumble on to the steps of the Treasury on what became known as Black Wednesday, in 1992, to announce the pound's unceremonious departure from the European exchange rate mechanism.</p> <p>After 'the run on the Rock', as it became known, Richard Lambert, director-general of the CBI, said that 'outside the movies, a run on a bank is something that happens in a banana republic. That one should have happened, under our noses, in a mature and prosperous country like the UK, is almost unimaginable.'</p> <p>Brown was determined not to allow another run on his watch. On Wednesday morning, the Financial Services Authority issued a statement insisting that HBOS was 'a well-capitalised bank that continues to fund its business in a satisfactory way'; but by then, Blank, together with his chief executive Eric Daniels, was close to finalising a deal with Hornby.</p> <p>By Wednesday night, the \u00a310bn deal was done, and the Halifax, well-known to savers for its cheerful ads starring Howard the singing bank clerk, and the 300-year-old Bank of Scotland had been trampled under the thundering hooves of Lloyds' black horse. The credit crunch, once a distant drama played out on Wall Street, had well and truly come home to Britain's shores.</p> <p>On Thursday morning, a shattered-looking Hornby joined Daniels at a press conference in London to reveal the details of the deal. US-born Daniels gleefully announced that he would create a 'great British bank,' and promised to slash at least 10 per cent of costs as a result of the merger, implying that at least a tenth of the combined 140,000 staff facethe threat of redundancy - a fact not lost on Alistair Darling, who represents many of them in his Edinburgh South West constituency.</p> <p>While the HBOS takeover allowed investors in Britain to catch their breath, in the US the fallout from Lehman's collapse was spreading. Speculation was mounting about the health of the only two independent Wall Street brokers left standing - Morgan Stanley and the mighty Goldman Sachs.</p> <p>Morgan's boss John Mack, known as 'Mack the Knife' for his ruthless management style, was incandescent, complaining that speculators, in 'a market controlled by fear and rumour', were shorting Morgan's share price. But at the same time he began to talk to potential buyers, including the Chinese government, fearing Morgan might need to be rescued. There could hardly be a more potent illustration of the leaching of economic power east, from New York, to Beijing, Bangalore and Dubai, than these global titans scurrying to find a merger partner from China.</p> <p>On Thursday lunchtime in London's Bishopsgate, vendor Lorraine Cross, 57, was unlocking her news-stand, ready for the first edition of the Evening Standard. As the delivery of the first edition arrived, she pulled off the top sheet and exclaimed at the headline: 'God, look at this, Goldmans now!'</p> <p>A young American woman in a tan leather coat grabbed at the paper with trembling hands. 'That's my husband's firm, that's my husband,' she told Cross. She was led away by a friend, close to tears. 'Poor girl,' said Cross, 'but I have been here 36 years and I have been here for three lots of these big crises and it'll pick up again, it always does.'</p> <p>Her colleague Steve Jackson, 63, agreed. 'We've got no pensions and I had a letter the other day saying my endowment would be falling short and so I don't have a whole lot of sympathy for these flash boys playing with other people's lives just to buy their \u00a3400 bottles of wine and the rest.'</p> <p>For a group of builders taking a breather, it was clear that the effects of the financial meltdown would spread way beyond the Square Mile. 'It's bloody capitalism: the rich get richer and the rest of us pick up the pieces,' said Barry Solace, 38, from Greenwich. 'It's all negligence to have got into this state with so much money that they don't even know how to find it, never mind count it.' His colleague Ben Anderson nodded his head towards the building work behind them. 'It's a knock-on effect, isn't it? There were 10 contracts up in this area for building work and three have been cancelled. And when the work goes our jobs go, we're sacked, no pension, no big bonuses for us, nothing. It's always the same, the lower down the ladder you are, the worse off you are. The guys with the big bonuses might be losing a bit now, but they're already well set up.'</p> <p>Like the builders who have missed out on City contracts, some of the victims of last week's events are immediately visible: the hotdog sellers on Wall Street complaining about lack of business; the waitress in the champagne bar at Bishopsgate who raises an eyebrow when asked how many bottles of champagne she's sold. But there are many less visible victims, hit by the credit squeeze sucking funds back towards the embattled banks, as they scramble to get their finances in order.</p> <p>As the week went on, it became increasingly obvious that without more help one financial firm after another would fall victim to the vicious spiral of fear and greed that had brought down Lehman. So concerned did the authorities on both sides of the Atlantic become about the dizzy swings of the markets that they slapped a temporary ban on the short-selling of financial stocks, to prevent the share prices of any more banks falling off a cliff.</p> <p>And on Friday morning, Paulson finally went for the nuclear option, unveiling an audacious plan for Washington to spend 'hundreds of billions of dollars' of taxpayers' money on buying up the hard-to-value assets held by US banks, gathering them into a so-called 'bad bank', freeing their erstwhile owners to get back to business usual. The markets reacted jubilantly - in London, the FTSE 100 made its biggest ever one-day gain.</p> <p>Spending public cash to rescue the banks will be hugely controversial, and could leave America's taxpayers with hefty bills for years to come. But on Friday Paulson declared: 'I am convinced that this bold approach will cost American families far less than the alternative - a continuing series of financial institution failures and frozen credit markets unable to fund economic expansion.'</p> <p>And it's that great fear which has been at the hub of politicians' concerns throughout this crisis: how will the struggles of the banks hit Main Street - or Acacia Avenue?</p> <p>Long after the dust has settled on the past seven nerve-shredding days, the economic hangover from the credit boom will still be felt. Already, house prices in the UK have fallen by 10 per cent, economic growth has stalled and more than 100,000 jobs have been lost. But most analysts believe that we are slipping into at least a year of sickly economic growth, and it may be 2010 before any signs of a genuine recovery are visible.</p> <p>The US has already been in the grip of a housing crash for more than two years; but while prices continue to fall, and a growing number of poor homeowners default on their loans, the value of the complex mortgage-backed assets in banks' portfolios has continued to plummet. Banks have responded by tightening the loan taps in an effort to get their finances back in order; which in turn makes it harder to get a new mortgage, and accelerates the fall in house prices, which have already dropped by close to 20 per cent.</p> <p>Paulson and Bernanke hope last week's dramatic intervention will finally act as a circuit-breaker in this pernicious financial storm, which has already brought down some of Wall Street's biggest names - and swept thousands of the poorest Americans out of their homes. British banks will not be able to offload their toxic assets into Paulson's new 'bad bank', but the government hopes that the US moves will at least restore a sense of calm. 'It should draw most of the poison out of the system,' said one regulator this weekend.</p> <p>For the time being at least, Gordon Brown may just have become that rare commodity, a Prime Minister actually saved - rather than destroyed - by an economic catastrophe.</p> <p>When the resignation of Scottish minister David Cairns, with his potentially devastating admission that he could not in all conscience pretend he thought Brown could win an election, was relegated to the inside pages of Wednesday's newspapers by turmoil in the markets it became clear to Labour rebels that now was not the time to rise up against their leader.</p> <p>One minister who shares their despair at the government's plight said none the less that the City crisis had now made a truce essential: 'It's not that people will say, \"Gordon's the best man to deal with this\", because the public perception is that he was the Chancellor and completely identified with the economic policies that have got us here. It's that we will not look credible or responsible if while this such a crisis is ensuing we are engaging in internal warfare.'</p> <p>Labour MPs are already clamouring for a root-and-branch review of City regulation, further clampdowns on what the SNP leader Alex Salmond called the 'spivs and speculators' bringing banks to their knees, even curbs on City bonuses to limit risky activity - a call endorsed by none other than Labour chairman Harriet Harman, who made fat-cat pay part of her campaign for the deputy leadership on Friday.</p> <p>The Chancellor, who will address the party conference tomorrow, is under pressure to respond, and Treasury officials are hurriedly drawing up plans for a radical overhaul of financial regulation.</p> <p>But John McFall, the Labour chairman of the Commons Treasury select committee, warned that ministers should concentrate on sorting out the current crisis rather than being panicked into responding. 'I think there has to be a post mortem. The primary task is to get the financial community out of the gigantic hole into which they have put themselves. That is hugely important, and then after that is achieved we can have time to look at what undoubtedly needs to change.'</p> <p>The Tories' traditionally deregulatory instincts, meanwhile, have been shaken by the new political reality of millions of swing voters in Middle England angrily contemplating the wreckage of their pensions, share portfolios and - in some cases - careers. They are in no mood to hear, as the former Bank governor Eddie George suggested in a pamphlet for the Tory think-tank Politeia last week, that the City itself is better placed than the government to sort out its problems.</p> <p>Shadow chancellor George Osborne is demanding new powers for the Bank of England to intervene in the markets and greater protection for savers, to prevent panicking customers staging runs on another bank.</p> <p>The Conservative backbencher John Redwood, a former director of the merchant bank NM Rothschild and chair of David Cameron's economic competitiveness review, said it was time to restore the Bank of England's powers of oversight. 'The banks have managed to evolve a system that allows them to lend more in good times and stop lending in bad times. There's an overall answer, and that's more intelligent central banking that keeps the banks shorter of money in good times.</p> <p>The role of the Bank of England - and the Federal Reserve when under the control of former chairman Alan Greenspan - in fomenting the credit crisis is coming under fierce scrutiny on both sides of the Atlantic. When both slashed interest rates to cushion their economies against recession after the dotcom bubble burst in 2000, the stage was set for an extraordinary credit binge.</p> <p>Jim O'Neill, chief global strategist at Goldman Sachs, says: 'Alan Greenspan ran too easy a monetary policy. I think already, one year on, the right questions are being asked: why were US real interest rates so low, for so long?'</p> <p>With Greenspan keeping the cheap money flowing, the banks became increasingly creative. Not content with the old-fashioned banker's job of taking in savers' deposits, and handing them out to worthy borrowers, they devised ever more ingenious methods of channelling billions of dollars of investors' cash, much of it from overseas, into high-risk loans to unsuspecting members of the public.</p> <p>Now the American banks are paying the ultimate price for this frenzied bout of 'financial innovation,' as they and their political backers called it - the promise of much harsher scrutiny; and the worst humiliation of all, nationalisation.</p> <p>The very financial masterminds who have spent the past decade urging governments to set free the 'wealth creators' and safeguard their 'competitiveness' have been brought under the control of Washington. And the government most associated with free-market capitalism and suspicion of state intervention has been forced to undertake the most costly nationalisation programme in living memory.</p> <p>In the US, Republican presidential candidate John McCain has criticised what he called 'failed regulation, reckless management and a casino culture on Wall Street', and called for the sacking of Christopher Cox, the chairman of US regulator the Securities and Exchange Commission.</p> <p>Paulson may be promising that no expense will be spared as he rides to the rescue of America's bombed-out financial sector; but the quid pro quo is likely to be a large helping of humble pie.</p> <p>O'Neill, at Goldman, which itself came under fire last week, says Paulson has deliberately held the banks' feet to the fire. 'They were quite happy to see all of us in the private sector shaken up. If you look at what evolved with the unfolding of Lehman, we all have to think about the quality of the model we have got. While it feels traumatic, it doesn't half focus the mind.'</p> <p>Shaun Springer, chief executive of Napier Scott , the financial headhunter based in the City, said he was hoping to pick up a bit of business over the next few weeks as staff at Lehman and other troubled banks looked for new berths; but he knows that the golden age of the City is over.</p> <p>'What we are living through now will reverberate through the rest of the century in the same way the Great Depression did last century. We are witnessing a very real power shift. Money is moving eastwards - while they're creating wealth, we're losing it hand over fist. Where it ends no one knows.</p> <p>'London has enjoyed an unprecedented decade of global dominance. Let's hope people took lots of photos to look back on in the years to come'.</p>"

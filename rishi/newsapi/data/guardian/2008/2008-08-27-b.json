Moments later, a roar went up from the convention floor and it was done.</p> <p>Tonight's events could at last bring closure to the Democrats' long and bitter primary campaign.</p> <p>The scene for the closing of ranks around Obama was set in motion earlier today when Clinton formally released her delegates, freeing them to vote for Obama.</p> <p>\"You've come here from so many different places having made this journey and feeling in your heart what is right for you to do,\" she told the crowd in emotional scenes. </p> <p>\"I want you to know that this has been a joy. Yes, we didn't make it. But, boy, did we have a good time.\"</p> <p>She did not go so far as to direct her followers how to vote, but as the traditional roll call of the states got under way, beginning with Alabama, it soon became apparent that most Democrats wanted to set the past aside, and focus on Obama's election battle against John McCain.</p> <p>Clinton's name was placed in nomination by the farm workers' leader, Dolores Huerta. Obama was nominated by an Iraq war veteran from Tennessee.</p> <p>Some Clinton supporters did register their support for their candidate, but it was clear within the opening minutes of the vote, but by far the greater majority had swung around behind Obama.</p> <p>Even Arkansas, which Clinton claims as her adopted state, rallied behind Obama, in a unanimous vote for his candidacy that drew huge whoops from the crowd.</p> <p>Obama also handily carried Kentucky, a state that had voted by huge margins for Clinton in what as then seen as a sign of his difficulty in appealing to white working-class voters.</p> <p>Tonight's nomination vote had been one of the most contentious issues between the Obama and Clinton camps.</p> <p>At first, the Obama camp had been uncertain about holding a vote at all. But the Clinton camp applied relentless pressure.</p> <p>Clinton argued that her disappointed supporters needed to be allowed to cast their votes for her as a form of \"catharsis\", and a number of activists started petition campaigns calling for a vote.</p>",
  "<p>In August 1980 Ronald Reagan kickstarted his first run for the White House with a speech at the annual fair of Philadelphia, a small town in Mississippi. It was an odd choice of location for such a high-profile event, just days after he had accepted his party's nomination as presidential candidate. A community of a few thousand people, Philadelphia is well off the beaten track. But as he spoke in front of an enthusiastic and all-white crowd, his purpose became clearer. He famously posed on stage in a rocking chair, Nancy on his knee, her shoes caked in Mississippi mud. Then he started addressing the crowd.</p> <p>He was in favour of states' rights, he said, earning a lusty cheer. That sounds innocent enough as a political statement, but made in the deep south it had resonance. It was a euphemism, widely recognised at that time, for support of southern racial segregation and opposition to the meddling anti-racism of the federal government.</p> <p>It would have been a controversial statement anywhere in the south. But to make it in Philadelphia's fairground was more than that. A little more than a mile away from where Reagan spoke was the mound of earth where 16 years previously three young civil rights activists had been found buried, each one with a single shot through the heart. The men had been investigating an African-American church that had been burned to the ground by the Ku Klux Klan. Their murders, later immortalised in the Hollywood film Mississippi Burning, provoked nationwide revulsion and helped to secure the passage of Lyndon Johnson's civil rights act and with it the dismantling of southern segregation.</p> <p>Given the location, Reagan's clarion call for states' rights was a bold and deeply cynical move. As the liberal commentator Paul Krugman has put it: \"Everyone got the message.\"</p> <p>And the message stuck. It helped convert southern whites, the so-called Dixiecrats who had backed the Democratic party for decades, to defect to Reagan's cause, securing him victory in 1980 and completing the Republican stranglehold on the south that remains firm to this day. Mississippi has voted Republican in every presidential election since Reagan entered the White House. In 2004, John Kerry carried not a single southern state. </p> <p>But now something is in the air. In March the unthinkable came to Philadelphia, in the form of a politician who has dubbed himself \"a black man with a funny name\" and who won the Democratic primary in Mississippi by a landslide: Barack Obama.</p> <p>His victory in this quintessential corner of the deep south has brought back to the surface questions of race and allegiance that have to some degree been suppressed or reconciled over the years. For the 40% of the town's 7,000 residents who are black, it is evidence that change - so long in coming - is on its way. But it has put the white leadership of the local Republican party, as one party member told me, into a tailspin. \"The combination of Obama's liberal record, his middle name, Hussein, and his blackness - those three things are enough to put an elderly southern conservative into a state of shock.\"</p> <p>Tonight, on the 45th anniversary of Martin Luther King's famous \"I have a dream\" speech in front of the Lincoln Memorial, Obama will present America with his own dream speech. But as he does so, the racial divisions that he hopes to transcend remain unclear. How much has the country moved on from the dark days of segregation? Are towns like Philadelphia now free of their past? </p> <p>Despite the ugly symbolism of the town's history, today it looks outwardly transformed. The Confederate flag still flies in the central square as part of the Mississippi banner, but those other hallmarks of segregation - the separate drinking fountains, hospital waiting rooms, \"coloured\" sections at the back of the bus - are, of course, long gone. The schools are technically, if not practically, integrated; black businesses have opened up in the central square; even the local country club opened its doors to black members five years ago.</p> <p>Stan Dearman has observed the gradual sea-change with a semi-outsider's eye. He moved to the town in 1966, about 18 months after the murders, to take up editorship of the local paper, the Neshoba Democrat. \"I was hoping that most of the turmoil in this community was behind us, but it was just starting. It was like a cancer in the whole community. It wouldn't go away no matter how much people wanted it to.\"</p> <p>But over time, he's noticed the prevailing mood of the town grow less clannish, less insular. The conviction in January 2005 of Edgar Ray Killen, a local resident, on three counts of manslaughter - the first and only successful prosecution of a perpetrator of the 1964 killings - was a huge step forward in Dearman's view, though he says six or seven men are still out there \"who need to be brought before the bar of justice\".</p> <p>But it is striking that though Dearman thinks change has come to Mississippi, he doesn't think it will translate into an Obama victory, not in Philadelphia, at least. \"There's still a racial edge. People still see things in black and white - it's deeply ingrained. The mindset is: whites vote Republican, blacks Democrat.\"</p> <p>It is a sign of how the tectonic plates of race in the south are shifting that while Dearman, who is white, is sceptical about the extent of political movement, many of the black residents of Philadelphia are fired up, to use an Obamaism. James Young, 53, was of the generation put through state-enforced integration of schools, and bears the emotional scars to prove it. He remembers white kids hurling the N-word at him. He also recalls lying on the floor of his living room, his father with a gun in his hand, when the Klan were, in his words, \"on the move\".</p> <p>For years the black side of the tracks in Philadelphia, where he still lives, had a cloud over it that was part apathy, part despondency. \"If a black man stood for president you would just say, 'No way, no way'.\" Now, as a pastor in the local black church, he is exhorting the congregation to get out and register to vote.</p> <p>\"The generation that wouldn't contemplate a black president is passing on, and that's good for everybody. If it's not now, it's just around the corner. We will no longer be denied,\" he says. </p> <p>How important is that for African Americans in the south? </p> <p>\"It's a feeling you can't put into words. It's like we are no longer a subculture. Finally it's given us reason to think we are part of the overall scheme of things.\"</p> <p>That newfound optimism is reflected in voting trends in Mississippi. Until this year, the average turnout for a Democratic primary there would be about 90,000. In March it was 500,000, three-quarters of whom were black. In 2004, George Bush took the state with 670,000 votes to his name - suggesting that a huge turnout of black voters in November would give Obama a big bounce in Mississippi, a state with the highest proportion of African-Americans in the US (39%). That would certainly scare the Republican elders even more than they are already.</p> <p>But, of course, that still leaves the balance of power in the hands of the majority white voters. As Professor Marty Wiseman of Mississippi State University explains, race is no longer the number one issue for most white voters, but it remains an issue. \"Any Democratic candidate who gets a big turnout of black voters is off to a very good start. It's just getting that other 20% that's difficult.\"</p> <p>Philadelphia has changed; its ugly old ways are being shed. But this is evolution, not revolution, and some of the racial canker remains. Several people tell me that interracial relationships are no longer taboo. And then I meet Taneil Long. She is sitting in her nail salon in the central square, serving a black customer, the smell of varnish heavy in the air. In 2002, after she split up with the white father of her two daughters, she started dating a black man.</p> <p>\"I honestly thought this would be different - I mean, we're not in the 60s any more. But it really became a big issue for me,\" she says. </p> <p>The first thing she noticed was that her white clientele thinned out, to be replaced by a customer base largely comprising black women. Then her landlady turned on her, saying there had been complaints in her white neighbourhood about her boyfriend. \"I asked her was there a problem with the fact that he was black. She told me I had to get out.\" The father of her children recently told the girls he will never allow them to go out with black men.</p> <p>Long is herself mixed-race - part white, part Vienamese (her white father served in the Vietnam war), giving her a natural affinity to the mixed race Obama. And yet she is uncertain about him. \"You don't want a president with no connection to Christianity,\" she says.</p> <p>But he is a Christian, I reply, to her surprise.</p> <p>\"Really? I'd heard he was a Muslim.\"</p> <p>I'd been warned about this. Young had told me that in his pastoral work he found the Muslim question frequently popping up. But even so, it was a shock to find the false rumour, spread maliciously by Republican-leaning websites and gossipmongers, circulating so freely.</p> <p>It comes up in my chat with Steve Wilkerson, the affable white owner of a clothing shop, Steve's, on the square. He has worked hard for the past few years, together with black residents such as Young, to heal Philadelphia's troubled race relations. Wilkerson says he has received emails with such titles as \"Obama: the real story\", dwelling scurrilously on his supposed Muslim faith. He says there is much apprehension abroad. \"When you drive through white neighbourhoods I don't think you'll see many Obama signs or bumper stickers. People who vote for him will do it quietly. They don't know who he is, what his religion is. Is he the antichrist?\"</p> <p>Wilkerson himself is clearly conflicted. He knows Obama calls himself a Christian and says \"that's good enough for me. I'm not a judge.\" But later in our conversation he admits that he too is troubled. \"I'd like reassurance about who he is, who's backing him, just to be sure there's not an underlying current.\"</p> <p>What is his worst fear?</p> <p>\"That he does turn out to be a Muslim after all.\"</p> <p>And it comes up forcefully when I step in to Wilson's barber shop. Wilson is sitting looking slightly forlorn in the empty premises, clippings of hair scattered on the floor around his feet. \"I don't have anything against a black man as president,\" he begins. \"But Obama, he's not qualified. When you are president you represent everyone, not just your race. I've heard him talk about 'his people'.\"</p> <p>He goes on: \"And what about his religion, he can't just drop his religion.\" </p> <p>What do you mean, I ask. </p> <p>\"He's a Muslim.\"</p> <p>No, he's not. He's a Christian.</p> <p>\"Well, he should make it clear he stands by Christian values in America. That he doesn't hold those other values.\"</p> <p>But he has made that clear.</p> <p>\"I don't think he's done that at all. He's just run from it. He should have nipped it in the bud and made clear he's a president for everybody.\"</p> <p>But he's said that. What else can he do?</p> <p>\"Just because he's a Muslim, he should make it clear he doesn't believe in suicide bombing and killing.\"</p> <p>The prevalence in my admittedly unscientific survey of downtown Philadelphia of the Obama = Muslim myth helps explain the ongoing furore over race preoccupying the two presidential campaigns. Obama first sounded the alarm in June, saying he was preparing himself for underhand Republican tactics that would try to spread jitters among voters. \"They're going to try and make you afraid of me. He's young and inexperienced and he's got a funny name. And did I mention he's black?\"</p> <p>That comment sank without trace, but when Obama repeated last month that the Republicans were trying to play up the fact that \"he doesn't look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills\", the McCain camp grabbed the ball and ran with it. A McCain aide accused Obama of playing the race card, from the bottom of the deck.</p> <p>Despite McCain's protestations that he is fighting an honest and race-blind campaign, Obama has good reason to be wary about the negative hits that are now coming at him from the rival camp. He knows all too well that the Swiftboat attacks that floored John Kerry, by calling into question his wartime record in Vietnam, were made by outrider groups that kept themselves scrupulously clean of Bush's fingerprints. There has been a creeping drift towards racial innuendo within McCain's increasingly venomous campaign. Attack ads run over the summer have shown Obama playing basketball - an overwhelmingly black sport in the US - and placed him in juxtaposition with Britney Spears and Paris Hilton in what some commentators have interpreted as a play on that old taboo on black men associating with sexualised white women. In one of his earliest ads, McCain referred to himself pointedly as \"the American president Americans have been waiting for\". That is an uncanny echo of the secret advice we now know was given to Hillary Clinton by her former chief strategist, Mark Penn, during the primary contest. In leaked memos, he urged her to portray Obama as someone whose \"roots to basic American values and culture are at best limited\".</p> <p>The Obama campaign is fighting back against this insidious and underhand play on his race by stressing all this week that his is a \"very American story\" - neatly turning on its head the message of his assailants. But that device is in part a recognition on his part that there is a problem. </p> <p>As the Democratic convention opened in Denver, opinion polls suggested that the clear lead he had held over McCain nationally for several weeks had all but slipped away, creating a palpable anxiety among Democratic supporters. They know that by August in their respective presidential election years - 1988 and 2004 - Michael Dukakis was 17 points ahead of George Bush Sr and John Kerry was four points ahead of George Bush Jr. And we know what happened to them.</p> <p>A growing chorus can be heard among pundits and pontificators. Is Obama's inability to pull away decisively from McCain, even though everything seems to be going in his favour, something to do with race? As John Heilemann, New York magazine's sharp political observer, has said: \"Call me crazy, but isn't it possible, just possible, that Obama's lead is being inhibited by the fact that he is, you know, black?\" </p> <p>Certainly, a closer look at the polls uncovers a stubbornly consistent racial divide. A recent Gallup poll had 91% of black voters backing Obama - indicating a nationwide trend in tune with Mississippi. Hispanics were keen on him too, with 68%. But non-Hispanic whites showed a clear preference for McCain, at 49% to Obama's 39%. When you factor in gender, the disparity is yet more glaring. White women came out evenly divided between the two candidates, but look at the findings for white men: McCain 55%, Obama 34%.</p> <p>That may not matter so much in the south, where white voters have - ever since Reagan's Philadelphia speech - tended to vote sheeplike for the Republicans anyway. But it could matter a lot in several northern states such as Ohio, Michigan or Pennsylvania where the contest is likely to be tight and where there is a preponderance of white working-class voters struggling in the economically stricken rust belt.</p> <p>That's the thing about many discussions of race in the US - they so easily overlook the north. The assumption is that the south was where the problem started with slavery and the civil war, while the north has always been a haven of enlightenment.</p> <p>But it is the north that today hosts the most segregated cities in the US. The most recent census in 2000 shows that nine out of the 10 most segregated cities are northern, including New York, Chicago, and Cleveland and Cincinnati in the crucial electoral battleground of Ohio. \"The northern system of segregation has never been about symbols of power on the streets - separate water fountains - but about segregated neighbourhoods and workplaces,\" says Kevin Boyle, a specialist in race and culture at Ohio State University. He reminds us that Obama struggled to gain support among white working-class communities in several northern states in the primary fight against Hillary Clinton, where issues of race and class are interwoven. In Ohio, almost one in five Democratic voters told exit pollsters that race had loomed large in their decision (Clinton won by 54% to 44%). \"States like Ohio are so close that just a couple of percent of voters who decide not to vote for him on grounds of race could swing the result,\" Boyle says.</p> <p>To see how the race factor is playing in these areas I fly 800 miles north from Philadelphia, to Livonia in Michigan. It was listed in the 2000 census as the whitest town in America. About 95% of its 100,000 residents are white and less than 1% black. The neighbouring town, Detroit, is more than 80% black - and the region as a whole sits at the top of the nation's segregation league table.</p> <p>So how do the residents of America's whitest town feel about a possible Obama presidency? Could they see him winning? \"I don't think he has a snowball's chance,\" says Glenn, sitting out on his front porch in one of Livonia's more affluent areas, reading the local paper. \"Not just because he's black - though that's a very good start - but because he has no experience.\"</p> <p>Livonia has acquired a reputation for racial tetchiness over the years. Plans to build two big shopping malls led to protests from some residents who feared they would attract \"Detroiters\" - a reference to the residents of Livonia's predominately black neighbour. A recent case, successfully prosecuted by federal authorities, fined a Livonia landlord more than $700,000 for refusing to rent apartments to black families. \"If blacks come in here, we really don't have anything available for them,\" the landlord told his employees, a clue perhaps to how Livonia has managed to stay so white over the years.</p> <p>A few doors down from Glenn, Eric is the only black resident in this part of town. He appears the perfect neighbour. His lawn is neatly trimmed, the brass on his gas lamp polished to mirror quality. About the only quibble one might have is that he has allowed his hostas to be nibbled by slugs.</p> <p>That hasn't stopped the grumbling. A couple of neighbours bluntly refuse to acknowledge him when passing on the street. One resident asked him if he were running a childcare scheme when some of his children's cousins stayed over. Another called the town authorities to complain he had a service vehicle in his drive, when other neighbours had much bigger trucks in theirs. He shrugs off these vexations: \"They don't hurt me or my family.\" As for Obama's chances, he says, \"Some people wonder what I'm doing here, let alone a black president of the United States.\"</p> <p>About a mile away from Eric's home is the blue-collar area of Roseland. It has the same detached houses and neatly trimmed lawns, except everything is scaled down. That's how it is in America: class as defined not by accent or breeding, but by square feet of real estate. It is in streets such as these that the economic downturn is really biting - rising food and petrol prices, job lay-offs, housing foreclosures. Jack, watering his plants in the front garden, says the hardship has to some extent led to a feeling of togetherness locally, even with his few black neighbours. But he goes on to say: \"A black president - that's a tough sell. Obama could be all right now, but come November people might say, 'Not yet'.\"</p> <p>And so to my final knock on a door. It is answered by Margaret, a grandmother who has a big sign in her window saying, \"Beware the Dog\", and a Stars and Stripes flying above the lintel. She grew up in Detroit but moved to Livonia as part of the white flight from the city in the 60s. She is proud of her Scottish parentage, and of her solid Democratic roots, but she is swift to tell me that Obama is not experienced enough for the White House. Not experienced enough. The phrase is starting to sound as widely used in Livonia as Muslim was in Philadelphia. Then she says: \"There's a lot of people who don't want a black man in the White House.\"</p> <p>It occurs to me that of all the people I have spoken to - both in Livonia and in Philadelphia, towns separated by 800 miles and a divergent history - it has always been the \"other people\" who won't vote for Obama. Not a single person has said they personally would balk at a black president.</p> <p>When she says there are a lot of people who don't want a black man in 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, does that include her?</p> <p>Pause.</p> <p>\"Not really.\"</p> <p>Does \"not really\" mean yes or no?</p> <p>\"I wouldn't want to see it in my lifetime.\"</p> <p>A black presidency?</p> <p>\"I wouldn't like to see it, OK?\"</p> <p>She gives me a look of cold steel that announces the conversation is over.</p> <p>Margaret's rare blast of honesty provides closure of a sort to this journey around race and the presidential campain. But it would be wrong to leave it on such a note. At the age of 81, she is, after all, a product of the past more than an indication of the future. Despite Obama's narrow lead, he has crucial advantages over his opponent. He is hugely more charismatic and inspiring than McCain and he has energised his following in a way that the Republicans can only dream about. He also benefits from a historically unpopular Bush presidency and a tanking economy. If an Obama victory is by no means certain, it is a very healthy possibility.</p> <p>Let's return to Dearman, former editor of Philadelphia's local paper, who has lived through some of the country's most shameful moments, including Ronald Reagan's fairground speech, to see happier times. I ask him what he thinks the sight of Obama's two daughters, Malia and Sasha, playing on the White House lawn, would mean for America. \"It will be a big, big thing,\" he says. \"It would say that we, as a country, have arrived. There's a need for redemption, there always will be. An Obama presidency will provide some of that redemption.\"</p>",
  "<p>Ken Livingstone, the former mayor of London, has found a new role as an adviser to the Venezuelan president Hugo Ch\u00e1vez and his political allies. During a surprise visit to Caracas, Livingstone said yesterday that he would act as a consultant on the capital's policing, transport and other municipal issues.</p> <p>\"I believe that Caracas will become a first-world city in 20 years. I have a very extensive network of contacts both domestically and internationally which I will be calling on to assist in this,\" he told reporters at the presidential palace after meeting Ch\u00e1vez. </p> <p>The two socialist allies forged a deal last year to swap London's management expertise for subsidised fuel for London's buses. Boris Johnson, the Tory who ousted Livingstone in May's election, cancelled the deal and repaid \u00a37m to Venezuela, an oil giant with widespread poverty.</p> <p>No one doubts Caracas needs help. Gridlocked traffic, a crumbling centre, hillside slums, horrific murder rates, corrupt police and inept local government have made it one of Latin America's most notorious cities.</p> <p>No decision had been taken about a salary, said Livingstone. \"It depends to what extent we will be tapping into our individual resources. The whole cost of this trip has been paid for by the government of Venezuela and as an unemployed citizen I would not be able to pay for my own fare otherwise.\"</p> <p>The state media presented Livingstone as an important asset to pro-Ch\u00e1vez candidates in upcoming local elections. Livingstone seemed optimistic they would win. \"We have discussed with the candidates a programme they will take forward after the November elections,\" he said.</p>",
  "<p>Ukraine's president, Viktor Yushchenko, could not have put it more starkly. Condemning Russia's decision to recognise the independence of South Ossetia and Abkhazia, Georgia's two separatist regions, Yushchenko warned yesterday: \"Any nation could be next.\" </p> <p>In fact, Yushchenko was articulating what is now a commonplace in diplomatic circles: that having successfully \"done\" Georgia, the Kremlin might now turn its attention to Ukraine - and in particular its Russian-speaking region of Crimea.</p> <p>France's foreign minister, Bernard Kouchner, said the same thing. \"It is very dangerous ... there are other objectives that one can suppose are objectives for Russia, in particular the Crimea, Ukraine and Moldova,\" Kouchner said. </p> <p>In reality, the similarities between Ukraine and Georgia, and the Crimea and South Ossetia, are largely superficial. Crimea, a Black Sea peninsula, has a strong ethnic Russian majority. It became part of Ukraine during Soviet times, when it was transferred to the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic in 1954.</p> <p>Unlike South Ossetia and Abkhazia, which launched separatist wars in the 1990s, Crimea has been a successful part of the Ukrainian state. \"It is very pro-Russian, especially in Sevastopol. But it doesn't see itself as being against Ukraine,\" Igor Shevliakov, from the International Centre for Policy Studies in Kiev, said.</p> <p>He added: \"There is no conflict between Crimea and Ukraine. Crimean politicians like to speculate on the Russian topic. But it doesn't seem they are really interested in becoming part of Russia. They are more interested in keeping their own control over the peninsula. I don't think there is a consensus in Crimea about separating from Ukraine.\"</p> <p>Clearly, this threat preoccupies Ukraine's pro-western elite. Yushchenko denounced Russia's recognition of South Ossetia and Abkhazia as \"unacceptable\". Moscow's actions would hasten Ukraine's attempts to join Nato and the EU, and force it to increase its defences, he said.</p> <p>\"What has happened is a threat to everyone, not just for one country. Any nation could be next, any country. When we allowed someone to ignore the fundamental right of territorial integrity, we put into doubt the existence of any country,\" he told Reuters.</p> <p>Ukraine's pro-Russian former prime minister Viktor Yanukovich welcomed the Kremlin's decision. And Ukraine's prime minister, Yulia Tymoshenko, has been cautious not to criticise Moscow.</p> <p>Behind these statements are hard calculations ahead of Ukraine's presidential election in 2010. Yanukovich and Tymoshenko are likely to seek some accommodation with Moscow, should they win. </p> <p>Some observers believe there are solid reasons why Russia is unlikely to initiate another military adventure in Ukraine. Russia's elite have significant financial interests in Ukraine. \"It seems Medvedev is satisfied with the outcome of the Georgian conflict. I don't think they need a new conflict,\" Shevliakov said.</p>",
  "<p>Barack Obama used the huge exposure of his historic Democratic convention speech in Denver tonight to try to persuade voters that he can lead America and help turn around the ailing economy.</p> <p>The 47-year-old senator from Illinois was yesterday formally nominated by thousands of cheering delegates to be the Democratic presidential candidate, becoming the first African-American to lead a major political party into election.</p> <p>In a symbolic gesture, his rival Hillary Clinton called a halt to the formal roll call of votes and urged delegates to close ranks behind Obama and nominate him by acclamation.</p> <p>His acceptance speech tonight coincided with the 45th anniversary of Martin Luther King's \"I have a dream\" speech. But in spite of the emotion attached to the address, Obama largely dispensed with the high-blown rhetoric that has been the trademark of his 19-month campaign, and instead concentrated on how to soften the impact of job losses, high petrol prices and repossessed homes, and address the huge US poverty gap.</p> <p>The economy has become the single issue that could determine the next occupation of the White House. Obama is to fly from Denver on Friday to take that message on a bus tour of rustbelt states, where he is hoping to win over lower income voters with a programme of tax cuts.</p> <p>Tonight's speech will be his best chance to make his case to Democrats and Americans watching on television that he represents change in contrast to John McCain.</p> <p>In an interview with the Wall Street Journal published yesterday, Obama said: \"The single most important thing I have to make clear is the choice we have in November between the same failed policy of the last eight years for the middle class and the new agenda to boost income for Americans and help families who are struggling. I will make that contrast very clearly.\"</p> <p>He desperately needs a bounce in the polls after seeing his lead over McCain evaporate over the past month. Michelle Obama's speech on Monday, with its focus on family, helped recapture a little ground, but Obama needs to consolidate that. Obama, who is to deliver the speech at the Denver Broncos' ground, wrote most of it in longhand before reworking it on computer, staff said.</p> <p>After the speech the spotlight will shift to the Republicans. There is intense speculation that McCain will announce his running mate tomorrow, which will keep his party in the headlines over a holiday weekend and into next week, when the Republicans hold their convention.</p> <p>\"In terms of his speech, Obama has got to do two things, he has to rally his base, and he has to reach out to independent voters,\" said Michael Dimock, the associate director of the Pew Research Centre.</p> <p>The difficulty for Obama is that while he is far more trusted on the economy than McCain, the Republican is seen as the stronger leader, one more capable of dealing with foreign policy.</p> <p>Dimock said Obama wanted \"to get people focused on the economy because that is the area of his strength, but he also has to reassure people in the areas where they are not as confident of him\".</p> <p>The speech will provide an opportunity to salvage a convention dominated for almost three out of four days by Hillary and Bill Clinton. Bill Clinton does not plan to stay for Obama's speech.</p> <p>The friction between the two camps has accentuated the nervousness of some Democrats about the tightening race between Obama and McCain. \"This Democratic convention has a vibe so weird and jittery, so at odds with the early thrilling, fairydust feel of the Obama revolution,\" the New York Times commentator Maureen Dowd wrote yesterday.</p> <p>The Republicans have been quick to exploit the tensions. Yesterday, Rudy Giuliani, the former Republican mayor of New York who has led a spoiler operation at the convention, accused Obama of mismanaging his convention.</p> <p>\"I couldn't understand why he would organise a convention to give the Clintons two nights and then diss Hillary as vice-president,\" Giuliani told reporters.</p> <p>Tonight, though, is Obama's chance to get the party back on course, and provide an answer to Democratic critics who say the convention has been lacking in substance and clear message.</p> <p>He will outline tax plans to provide relief for those hardest hit by the economic downturn and to address inequality. He plans to change the tax code so that families making more than $250,000 (\u00a3136,000) would pay more while everyone else pays less. This would be accompanied by moves to create jobs and tackle global warming through investment in alternative energy and rebuilding the US's long-ignored physical infrastructure.</p>",
  "<p>James Carville, the man who ran Bill Clinton's legendary 1992 presidential campaign, caused a stir in Denver after the first night of the Democratic convention when he said his party had now had five evenings in the Bush era, counting the four nights of the 2004 convention, in which to hold the Republican administration to account - and it had blown all five of them. </p> <p>He was a happier man after day two, praising his colleagues for at last throwing some punches at the Republicans and at John McCain.</p> <p>He and others had delighted as, for example, the Democratic governor of Montana, Brian Schweitzer - a new face on the national scene - urged delegates to \"get off your hind end\" and demonstrate their determination to see the back of the Republicans.</p> <p>Standing up, they thundered a loud and repeated \"No!\" as Schweitzer asked them \"Can we afford four more years of the same?\" </p> <p>That is the central theme of the Democratic attack on McCain: that he is offering nothing more than an extension of the Bush presidency, that he will be John McSame. </p> <p>One of the night's more memorable lines came from Hillary Clinton: \"It makes sense that George Bush and John McCain will be together next week in the Twin Cities [Minneapolis-St Paul], because these days they're awfully hard to tell apart.\"</p> <p>That pleased those, such as Carville, who have been itching for the Democrats to start baring their teeth, haunted as they are by the memory of 2004 when John Kerry held back from attacking the Republicans - for which he paid a heavy price. </p> <p>The trouble is all that aggressive work was overshadowed by the drama which has dominated at Denver: the reconciliation of Hillary Clinton and her supporters to the candidacy of Barack Obama. </p> <p>Day two had two objectives: first, to begin the attack on McCain and second, to unite the Democratic party, including devoted Hillaryites, behind the nominee. </p> <p>The instant consensus was that Clinton had done precisely that, in a powerful speech that urged even the most diehard Pumas - Party Unity, My Ass - to fall in line.</p> <p>She introduced herself as a \"proud supporter\" of Obama and, in a crucial passage, asked her backers \"Were you in this campaign just for me?\" - or to pursue a cause that could only be served by victory over McCain. </p> <p>Still, in the cold light of the next day, it was hard not to feel there was something pro forma about Clinton's presentation. She had not done much more than tell Democrats they were obliged to back their leader, rather than making a case for Obama in his own right.</p> <p>That gave the Republicans an immediate opening, as they noted that she had not declared Obama ready to be president or qualified to serve as commander-in-chief. </p> <p>That's especially pertinent now because McCain is on the air with TV advertisements featuring footage of Hillary Clinton declaring that she and McCain have a lifetime of experience - while Obama has a speech. She needed to disavow that statement on Tuesday and she did not. </p> <p>In some ways, these details are less important than the simple fact that, midway through a convention that was meant to launch Obama into the general election, the Democrats were still looking inward and still, yet again, talking about the Clintons. </p> <p>That problem was exacerbated once more last night as Bill Clinton was due to speak, with reporters poised to search for any coded dissent from him.</p> <p>It meant that for two of the four nights of the Obama convention, the spotlight was on the Clintons - and the media chatter focused on the storyline of Democratic disunity. </p> <p>Of course, it was inevitable that, after such a tightly fought primary contest, a segment of the convention would have to be given over to Hillary Clinton.

  "<p><em>Jay Stevens is in Denver blogging for <a href=\" http://www.leftinthewest.com/\">Left In The West</a></em></p> <p>Tuesday night was the big night for Montana Democrats at the convention. Our delegation huddled around our kiosk, our seats wedged between Guam, New Hampshire and New York. Every seat was taken, staffers and party functionaries flowed out into the aisle. Spirits were high. Brian Schweitzer, Montana's charismatic Democratic governor, was giving the speech just before Hillary Clinton.</p> <p>Montana was about to enter the national spotlight.</p> <p>Montana has a population of just under 950,000 - about the same size as Phoenix, Arizona. The state has only a single representative in the House - compared with, say, Washington state's nine, Michigan's 15, or California's 53. And in presidential elections, Montana has three electoral college votes, just a fraction of the 270 needed to win the White House.</p> <p>It's a sparsely populated state - ranking 47th in the nation - and its landscape ranges from rugged mountains to rolling dry plains. Its industry relies on natural resources, such as coal and oil and cattle. Its cities are small and mostly lumped toward the western side of the state, nestled in river valleys in the mountains. It's a relatively poor state built on industries now in decline.</p> <p>It goes without saying that it's an odd state to receive so much political attention, but this year, Montana has been in the middle of presidential politics. The Obama campaign <a href=\"http://www.helenair.com/articles/2008/07/22/top/55st_080722_obama.txt\">opened field offices</a> in nearly every major Montana city, pouring millions of television advertising dollars into Montana airwaves. Brian Schweitzer's name appeared often in vice-presidential rumours, and Obama hired Montana senator Max Baucus's chief-of-staff, Jim Messina, to run his own campaign staff. Additionally, Obama visited Montana <em>five</em> times this year, including a Fourth of July stop in Butte and <a href=\"http://www.montanasnewsstation.com/Global/story.asp?S=8904374&amp;nav=menu227_8\">a stop in Billings</a> the day before his acceptance speech at the convention in Denver.</p> <p>In Denver, our delegation has received pretty good treatment. In conventions past, the Montanans were usually seated up in the rafters, cheering on their presidential nominees from altitude. This year we're on the floor of the hall itself. We're 20 or so rows back, right next to New York with their celebrities - Spike Lee and Matthew Modine on Tuesday night - clogging the aisle with their entourage. And then this: <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKoKHCxWYM8\">governor Schweitzer's speech</a> just before senator Clinton's.</p> <p>So what gives? Why Montana?</p> <p>Some of the attention obviously derives from the fact that <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/04/us/politics/04elect.html?scp=1&amp;sq=montana+primary+obama+clinton&amp;st=nyt\">Montana's primary election</a> was the last primary in the calendar, and that this year's affair went right down to the wire. Montana's primary mattered, and its delegates mattered. Both Obama and Clinton made special trips to the state, including visits to reservations, all of which were unprecedented in state history.</p> <p>You'd expect the attention to end with the primary season, but that hasn't been the case. It could be the changing political makeup of the state, once considered solidly conservative, going for George Bush in both 2000 and 2004 by wide margins. But beginning in 2004, with Schweitzer's ascension into the governor's seat, followed in 2006 by <a href=\"http://www.billingsgazette.net/articles/2006/11/08/news/state/20-electday_z.txt\">Jon Tester's surprise, grassroots-fuelled upset</a> over incumbent senator Conrad Burns - a powerful member of the Senate appropriations committee - Montana has steadily been shedding its Republican representatives.</p> <p>The blueing of Montana has several sources. Energy deregulation, touted as a big boon for Montanans by big business conservatives, ended up disastrous for consumers as they saw their home heating bills double or triple - a big economic blow for middle-class residents during the cold winters. Additionally, state Democrats became the advocates for the preservation of public lands and access to streams and waterways in the state, as Republican allies - the extraction industry and wealthy seasonal homeowners - encroached on the open space dear to Montanans, who hunt and fish as a general rule. </p> <p>Nationally, the Iraq war and the Bush administration's anti-terror policies have gone over poorly with residents. Montana has the highest percentage of its population serving in the military, and the extended deployments and insufficient physical and mental healthcare is taking a severe toll on the state's military families. Montanans' libertarian streak recoils at the administration's civil rights abuses: the Patriot Act is wildly unpopular and was denounced almost unanimously in a 2005 state legislature resolution. Economically, the national Republicans' penchant for free trade and tax cuts for the wealthy sits poorly with the populist sensibilities of Montanans. </p> <p>Exploiting these issues, key Democrats have been able to win office in the state. The results have been positive for Montana: record-setting budget surpluses in a time when the federal government under a Republican administration has been racking up record deficits. While employment for middle- and blue-collar workers has been declining elsewhere in the country, employment was up in Montana. Likewise, Montana's housing and economy has remained relatively stable during the recent recession. Montana Democrats have governed well and overcome regional prejudices through example.</p> <p>But probably the single-most important factor in the changing face of Montana politics is a demographic: the young. Young people in Montana have become increasingly active in politics, and they are almost overwhelmingly progressive. Young voters - who in some informal polls preferred Obama to Clinton in the recent primary at a rate of two or three to one - are turning out in droves for candidates like Schweitzer and Tester.</p> <p>Tester, for example, benefited from bloggers - who raised the candidate more than a half-million dollars - a <a href=\"http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/7488391/pearl_jam_back_the_dems/print\">Pearl Jam concert</a> and a swarming army of volunteers on election day, which dwarfed the Republicans' famed \"72 hours\" get-out-the-vote strategy. Tester benefited from organisations like Missoula's <a href=\"http://www.forwardmontana.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=17&amp;Itemid=46#leaders\">Forward Montana</a>, which is dedicated to drive up political activism among the young - this year it is participating in a national \"Trick or Vote\" project, in which volunteers dress up in costumes on Halloween night and knock on doors, registering voters and targeting swing districts with progressive messaging.</p> <p>And that's the thing. For those of us Montanans on the floor of the convention on Tuesday night, what was to come was no surprise to us. When Schweitzer lit up the convention hall and got the crowd on its feet and to shake the building with its shouts, when he ripped out lines like \"Petro-dictators will never own American wind or sunshine,\" we weren't surprised. That's the Good Guv, our crowd-pleasing congenial state executive who remembers your name, wears bolo ties and is always accompanied by his dog, Jag. (Jag couldn't make it to Denver because, according to Schweitzer, \"He never flies commercial.\") There's a progressive surge in Montana centred on its young - it's a movement full of energy and passion and, above all, fun.</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/pakistan\">Pakistan</a>'s nascent democratic movement has been subverted by selfishness and naked powerplays. Waiting for an authentic democracy to \"evolve\" remains the ultimate goal, but given the way the Taliban are systematically dismantling the country one has to wonder what is in store for this most troubled nation.</p> <p>The Taliban are so emboldened that they recently attacked the army's largest <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/aug/22/pakistan.terrorism\">munitions plant</a> and killed 73 people. Two days earlier a suicide bomber <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/aug/19/pakistan.terrorism\">struck a hospital</a> and killed 29 people. Most of the victims were from the family of a man whom the Taliban had murdered earlier in the day. The second biggest city in the country, Lahore, has been hit by suicide bombings in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/jan/10/pakistan.allegrastratton\">January (22 killed)</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/mar/12/pakistan\">March (31 killed)</a>, and August (nine killed). Recently, a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/breakingnews/International/0,,7718126,00.html\">bus bombing in Peshawar</a> killed 11. Another 10 were killed when the entire family of an Awami National Party MP \u2013 wife, children, grandparents and uncles \u2013 were <a href=\"http://www.gulf-times.com/site/topics/article.asp?cu_no=2&amp;item_no=237887&amp;version=1&amp;template_id=41&amp;parent_id=23\">massacred</a> by way of rockets and grenades, leaving nothing but a smouldering house. An American public television station <a href=\"http://www.pbs.org/frontlineworld/stories/pakistan703/\">sent a reporter</a> to Taliban controlled areas and he returned with images of the bodies of old tribal leaders purposefully left in the streets to rot (against the custom of giving a proper burial to every human being). There are no legal or religious limits to Taliban terror. Last year in December they <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/dec/21/pakistan\">blew up</a> more than 50 worshippers who had gathered to celebrate the Hajj at a mosque.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/jul/10/alqaida.terrorism\">Ayman al-Zawahiri</a>, the nihilist mentor of the Taliban, is egging on this murder. He came on a private television station and gave a lecture to the Pakistani people about the supposed righteousness of his monstrosities. The talk was in English because the self-styled liberator of Pakistan doesn't speak the language of the people he aims to rule.</p> <p>Over the past decade General Musharraf was supposed to check this butchery. To that end he received $10bn in US military funding; $6bn of which was unconditional. He did nothing. In 2001, he left open passageways into the NWFP for al-Qaida members escaping the Northern Alliance in Afghanistan. He was responsible for allowing infamous terror outfits like Sipah-e-Sahaba to reorganise and even hold public rallies (as long as they <a href=\"http://www.carnegieendowment.org/files/grare_pakistan_final.pdf\">changed their name [pdf: see page 14]</a>). He <a href=\"http://www.csmonitor.com/2006/0906/dailyUpdate.html\">signed a truce</a> with the Taliban and al-Qaida in Waziristan; one so in favour of the Taliban that they had their weapons and prisoners restored. He was also responsible for the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/jul/11/pakistan.declanwalsh\">Red Mosque massacre</a> when he turned a blind eye to an extremist imam a few blocks from his own residence, all so that when he did finally use (excessive) force against the demagogue, it would distract people away from his sacking the chief justice of Pakistan. The act of killing <a href=\"http://www.chowrangi.com/nawab-akbar-bugti-killed.html\">Akbar Bugti</a>, a secular nationalist rebel in Balochistan who used to keep out the Taliban, allowed the Taliban to turn Quetta, Balochistan's capital, into their stronghold. Quetta, on the border with Iran, is where Mullah Muhammad Omar (<a href=\"http://www.afghan-web.com/bios/today/momar.html\">remember him?</a>) now lives. Meanwhile Musharraf, who was first forced to retire from the military, and then to resign from his position as president, is planning on collecting big time money on the lecture circuit. Assuredly he will make no mention of the thousands of graves his reckless neglect has created.</p> <p>The arrival of genuine democracy has not spared Pakistan a bit from terrorism. In fact, the militants have stepped up their attacks on the popularly elected government. This shows \u2013 emphatically \u2013 that the Taliban are not, and have never been, resistance fighters standing up to a dictatorship as has been their spin for the past eight years. They are cold-blooded serial killers. They will destroy any state they do not control. These days they are after Pakistan.</p> <p>The Pakistani leadership is not helping matters. The coalition government between Asif Zardari's PPP and former prime minister Nawaz Sharif's PML-N <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/aug/26/pakistan\">has broken up</a>. </p> <p>The twin issues over which they have separated are (i) Zardari's unwillingness to restore all of the judges, including Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhary, that Musharraf deposed last year; and (ii) Zardari seeking the now vacant position of president for himself, before the Pakistani legislature has had a chance to repeal the hubristic legal powers that various dictators, including Musharraf, sneakily allotted to the post. One of these excessive presidential powers is the ability to dismantle the government under article 58(2)(b); another is the entire 17th amendment which makes the president the head of state (as opposed to the prime minister as contemplated in the original 1973 constitution).</p> <p>Zardari has his reasons for waffling on the issue of judges. Bringing back Chief Justice Chaudhary could mean that certain corruption charges against him might be revived. Not only that, but a reinstated chief justice could also do something far more detrimental to the PPP. </p> <p>In the fall of 2007 a suit was filed challenging whether Musharraf had ever possessed the authority to call for the February elections. If Musharraf didn't have the authority \u2013 and Chaudhary would likely rule that way \u2013 that could mean that the PPP's win in February could be wiped away and fresh elections could be called. Although this is not likely, Zardari isn't taking chances. </p> <p>Zardari doesn't want new elections for the simple fact that Sharif's party actually did surprisingly well in February, and in a new election, would probably do even better by bringing in the fundamentalists from Jamat-e-Islami who sat out. Thus, even though Zardari previously put his hand over the Qur'an and said he'd restore all the judges within 24 hours of forming the government, he has resisted reinstating all the judges (he's willing to reinstate some). </p> <p>In principle, Sharif is not opposed to Zardari taking on the position of president, however, he (rightly) wants the excessive presidential powers curtailed. Sharif is taking that stance for one simple reason: in his first term he was thrown out of office by a President invoking 58(2)(b). He wants to get elected prime minister for a third time and be able to stay there. Pakistan's original 1973 constitution, written by Zardari's father in law, Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto, envisions a powerful prime minister. Ironically, it is Sharif, who in the 1980s collaborated with Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto's murderer, General Zia ul Haq, who is now upholding that vision.</p> <p>Sharif is also in favor of restoring all the judges. That too is a bit ironic since in the 1990's his party members actually physically assaulted supreme court judges and he was connected to a scheme to depose his own Chief Justice, Sajjad Ali Shah. Having said that, right now Sharif is doing the right thing, especially as a great majority of Pakistanis want the judges restored in full. This populist position is helping Sharif and making Zardari look bad which causes the PPP man to further drag his feet.</p> <p>Each day brings a new twist in this political soap opera. Perhaps if these two leaders took the time out to count the number of Pakistanis blown to pieces in recent days by the Taliban they would be able to put aside their incestuous power-games and take some action for the safety of a broken and beaten republic.</p> <p>The history of Pakistan's dynastic civilian rulers, however, suggests such self-reflection is unlikely.</p>",

  "<p>Barack Obama is to use the huge exposure of his historic Democratic convention speech in Denver tomorrow night to try to persuade voters that that he can lead America and help turn around the ailing economy.</p> <p>On the eve of his speech in a 75,000-seat football stadium, Obama said that he would dispense with the high-blown rhetoric that has been the trademark of his 19-month campaign, and concentrate on how to soften the impact of job losses, high petrol prices and repossessed homes and address the huge poverty gap that exists in the US.</p> <p>America's mortgage crisis and rising petrol prices have made the economy the single issue that could determine the next occupation of the White House.</p> <p>Obama is to fly from Denver on Friday to take that message on a bus tour of rustbelt states where he is hoping to win over lower-income voters with a programme of tax cuts.</p> <p>His address tomorrow night, on the 45th anniversary of Martin Luther King's I Have a Dream speech, will be a landmark: the first African American to receive the presidential nomination of a major political party.</p> <p>But more crucially for Obama, tomorrow night's speech will the most high visibility occasion of his campaign and his best chance to make his case to Democrats and Americans watching on television that he represents change - the key theme of the election campaign - in contrast to his rival, John McCain.</p> <p>In an interview with the Wall Street Journal published today, Obama said of the speech: \"The single most important thing I have to make clear is the choice we have in November between the same failed policy of the last eight years for the middle class and the new agenda to boost income for Americans and help families who are struggling. I will make that contrast very clearly.\"</p> <p>The senator, who was scheduled to arrive in Denver today after winding up a tour of the battlefield states in Missouri and Montana, desperately needs a bounce in the polls from the convention speech after seeing his lead over McCain evaporate over the last month.</p> <p>Obama, who is to deliver the speech at the Denver Broncos' ground from a specially-built platform with Greek columns, wrote most of the speech in long-hand before reworking it on computer, according to his staff.</p> <p>On the morning after the speech, the spotlight shifts to the Republicans. There is intense speculation that McCain will announce his choice of running mate on Friday, which will keep his party in the headlines over a holiday weekend and into next week when the Republicans hold their convention.</p> <p>\"In terms of his speech, Obama has got to do two things, he has to rally his base, and he has to reach out to independent voters,\" said Michael Dimock, the associate director of the Pew Research Centre.</p> <p>The difficulty for Obama is that while he is far more trusted on the economy than McCain, the Republican is seen as the stronger leader, one more capable of handling a crisis and dealing with foreign policy.</p> <p>Dimock said that Obama wants \"to get people focused on the economy because that is the area of his strength, but he also has to reassure people in the areas where they are not as confident of him\".</p> <p>The speech will provide an opportunity to salvage a convention dominated for almost three out of four days by Hillary and Bill Clinton to the frustration of the Obama campaign team.</p> <p>Bill Clinton does not plan to stick around the convention long enough to hear his speech.</p> <p>The friction between the two camps has accentuated the nervousness of some Democrats about the tightening race between Obama and McCain. \"This Democratic convention has a vibe so weird and jittery, so at odds with the early thrilling, fairy dust feel of the Obama revolution,\" the New York Times commentator, Maureen Dowd, wrote today.</p> <p>The Republicans have been quick to exploit those tensions between the old and new guards of the Democratic party, and stoke doubts about Obama's leadership. </p> <p>Today, Rudy Giuliani, the former Republican mayor of New York City who has led a spoiler operation at the convention, accused Obama of mismanaging his convention.</p> <p>\"I couldn't understand why he would organise a convention to give the Clintons two nights and then diss Hillary as vice-president,\" Giuliani told reporters.</p> <p>Tomorrow night though is Obama's chance to get the party back on course, and provide an answer to Democratic critics who say the convention has been lacking in substance and clear message.</p> <p>He is to outline tax plans to provide relief for those hardest hit by the economic downturn and to address inequality.</p> <p>He is planning to change the tax code so that families making more than $250,000 (\u00a3136,000) will pay more while everyone else pays less. This would be accompanied by moves to create jobs and tackle global warming through investment in alternative energy and the rebuilding of the US's long-ignored physical infrastructure.</p>",
  "<p>So the suspense, as the ruling UMP party commented with some irony yesterday, is finally over: Bertrand Delano\u00eb, recently (and comfortably) <a href=\"http://www.economist.com/world/europe/displaystory.cfm?story_id=10880982\">re-elected</a> mayor of Paris, will <a href=\"http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/europe/article4614091.ece\">put himself forward</a> for election as first secretary of France's shattered Socialists at their next national congress in November.</p> <p>Alarmingly, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/jan/06/france.jasonburke\">Delano\u00eb</a> is likely to be one of up to eight candidates for the top job at a deeply divided party still struggling, more than a year after the fact, to recover from S\u00e9gol\u00e8ne Royal's presidential election defeat to Nicolas Sarkozy. Despite Sarkozy's disastrous showing in the opinion polls, the Socialists are seemingly incapable of mounting any form of unified opposition.</p> <p>Might the Paris mayor be the man to rescue them, and \u2013 a long shot at present, but a distinct possibility if he emerges victorious at the Reims congress \u2013 to challenge the hyperactive but ever more unpopular president for the Elys\u00e9e in 2012 ?</p> <p>On the plus side, Delano\u00eb has been, and still is, a solid mayor. He's combined a few eye-catching and widely emulated ideas (the <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/3914649.stm\">Paris Plage</a> summer beach on the Seine; the <a href=\"http://www.paris.fr/portail/culture/portal.lut?page_id=6806\">Nuit Blanche</a> all-night culture fest; the successful <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2007/aug/16/ethicalliving.france\">Velib</a> almost-free bicycle scheme), with steady, if not inspired, management of the capital's finances.</p> <p>He recently announced plans for an even more spectacular <a href=\"http://www.paris.fr/portail/accueil/Portal.lut?page_id=95&amp;document_type_id=2&amp;document_id=55226&amp;portlet_id=10045\">Autolib</a> scheme, in which 2,000 small, eco-friendly cars will be available for short-term hire at stands around the city.</p> <p>The 58-year-old downplays his private life, but his homosexuality could well have been a factor in his popularity with the Parisian bobos, or bourgeois bohemians, who swept him to city hall. He's been a card-carrying Socialist since he was 21, and while he may appear affable (if invariably argumentative), the fact that he's flourished in the shark-infested waters of the Paris left demonstrates a ruthless political instinct.</p> <p>Delano\u00eb, even his enemies admit, has principles, but dislikes demagoguery and excessive idealism. He takes few risks; the title of his new book sounds a bit like a personal mantra: <a href=\"http://www.amazon.fr/laudace-Bertrand-Delano%C3%AB/dp/2221110609\">De l'audace!</a> (Dare!). He is said to be the one figure on the left whom Sarkozy respects.</p> <p>But he has, electorally speaking, some drawbacks. First, he has no experience in government. Second, there is his personality: try as he might, Delano\u00eb exudes a cautious, calculating, charisma-free, even aloof public aura that few French voters would define as presidential (although with Sarko in the Elys\u00e9e, what does and does not constitute \"presidential\" is under review).</p> <p>Third, sadly, is the party of which he is a member. France's political parties are rarely united, and even more rarely disciplined. The views of the vicious fraternity that heads up today's Socialist party range, roughly, from Marxist to Blairite, and the belief of each and every one of them that their own view should prevail is far more important than actually winning elections.</p> <p>Delano\u00eb may or may not be the right person to lead France's Socialists, but his ambitions will face the same obstacle as Royal's, who is likely to be his main rival for the post of leader: unless all the party's multitudinous and warring factions can converge in support of whoever they do eventually decide to back, the chances of it reoccupying the Elys\u00e9e palace anytime soon are pretty slim.</p>",
  "<p>What is it that Hillary Clinton's supporters most wanted? Was it Hillary herself? Was it a Democratic ideal? Or was it a female president?</p> <p>Today, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/27/uselections2008.television\">most pundits are championing her olive branch</a> to the Obama campaign, her heroic bowing out toward party unity. We'll say that her most important line - \"Were you in this campaign just for me?\" \u2013 was meant to gently nudge her supporters to recognise the greater good. But the problem is so-called Puma types and hardcore Hillary fans are angry, not just because their candidate didn't win, but because there are so few other viable women presidential candidates on the horizon. And Clinton didn't do enough to assuage that anger.</p> <p>Partly it's as (and today we agree) <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/michaeltomasky/2008/aug/27/hillaryclinton.democrats2008\">Mike Tomasky noted</a> last night: Clinton should have addressed some of the major issues that divide the parties even more aggressively than she did. That would have meant more about abortion (note that she didn't talk about the party's pro-choice positioning), more on embracing the country's history of immigration in positive terms, more on anti-isolationist foreign policy, more on Obama's ability to be a stellar commander-in-chief.</p> <p>And every time she said those things, and this should have held true for even what she did say last night, she needed to couple every \"I\" in the same breath as \"Obama\". As in, instead of saying \"I ran for president to renew the promise of America.\" She might have said, \"Like Obama, I ran for president to renew the promise of America, and now all of you who believe in that promise should support him, as I do.\"</p> <p>But beyond all that, Clinton missed an opportunity to link the two most important civil rights struggles in American history - civil rights and women's rights - in a mutually reinforcing way to get past the bitter pill women's rights advocates feel is being forced down their throat.</p> <p>The tension between the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_women's_suffrage_in_the_United_States\">women's movement</a> and the African-American civil rights movement is unfortunately nearly as old as both. A handshake from one side to the other, a recognition that these struggles have both needed each other and benefited from each other's successes might have gone a long way in giving the Puma democrats a reason to come around to the Obama camp.</p> <p>Some women will say they have spent too much time, their mothers spent too much time, their grandmothers and great-grandmothers spent too much time, stepping aside for other movements. But this is a mistake. This is the greater tension I think, the catharsis that goes beyond a question of Obama and Clinton themselves.</p> <p>To British readers, some of this might seem a bit ridiculous. But while our two countries <a href=\"http://www.archives.gov/exhibits/featured_documents/amendment_19/\">gave women the right to vote</a> at approximately the same moment nearly 90 years ago, since then we've diverged wildly on women's representation in government. This means the wound of Clinton's loss festers ever deeper, refusing to heal.</p> <p>In the UK you've not only had a woman lead your country (granted, most Guardian readers were and are likely not Thatcherites, but her election and 11 years in office still answers the question of a belief in women's leadership ability in a way that we Yanks have yet to prove to ourselves), you have a far greater pool of women politicians to draw from. You're no Scandinavia, but one in five members of Parliament are women.</p> <p>Contrast that to the US. In the <a href=\"http://womenincongress.house.gov/\">pipeline</a>, things aren't looking as good as they should in 2008. We've only 16 women senators out of 100, 74 female representatives out of 435 and eight women governors out of 50 (this year is an exception, normally we draw our presidential candidates from governors' mansions). </p> <p>Partly as a result of America's continued inability to create affordable childcare options for women, our parties have been unable to woo substantial numbers of women into running for higher office. Granted, groups like <a href=\"http://www.emilyslist.org/\">Emily's List</a> have done an admirable job in electing women (pro-choice women in particular), but the next viable female presidential nominee is \u2026 Hillary Clinton in 2012?</p> <p>This is a problem. And this, I suspect is why the Pumas are really angry. They saw Clinton as their only shot. But they've got their anger misplaced. They should be focused on nurturing other women, the next generation as well as Clinton's, so that they never again find the playing field so bleakly unequal, the future so blankly, uniformly male.</p>",
  "<p>Hillary Clinton had a job to do last night, and the rapidly emerging consensus was that she did it. Until she took to the podium, the convention had felt rather low-key - no surprise, since emphasising Barack and Michelle Obama's comfy familiarity had been the goal. But Clinton's message of unity - peppered with plenty of strikes against John McCain and George Bush \u2014 set the venue alight. Though self-congratulation certainly wasn't lacking, Clinton drove home the point that, <a href=\"http://www.prospect.org/csnc/blogs/ezraklein_archive?month=08&amp;year=2008&amp;base_name=hillary#108629\">in the words of the blogger Ezra Klein</a>, she was \"a Democrat, not a Hillaryite\" \u2014 an unmistakeable signal to her most hardline supporters that they had to move beyond anger at the failure of her candidacy.</p> <p>Obama is due in Denver tonight, in advance of his open-air nomination speech tomorrow. But Clinton's speech doesn't mean party unity is now a given: the other Clinton is due to speak today, and Obama campaign aides are reportedly worried about what he might say, because he'll say whatever he likes.</p> <h2>Today at the convention</h2> <p>Today's official theme is \"Securing America's Future\", and the keynote speaker today is Obama's running-mate Joe Biden, another man not averse to a bit of loose-cannon ad-libbing. Evan Bayh and John Kerry are among the others due to address the convention.

  "<video data-media-id=\"gu-video-336981660\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/bc/281851582/281851582_1755442006_gdn-for-082608-obamaplot-hs-To-Brightcove-4x3.flv\"/> </video>   <p>US officials today said a group of suspected drug users arrested in Denver over the weekend with guns and bullet-proof vests made racist threats against Barack Obama but posed no real danger to the Democratic presidential candidate.</p> <p>Obama will be in Denver this week to accept the Democratic nomination. The three men - all said to have been high on methamphetamine when arrested - are the subject of an assassination investigation, but so far, authorities say, it appears they had no capacity to carry out any attack on Obama.</p> <p>A Colorado federal prosecutor, Troy Eid, said the vague racist threats from the men would continue to be investigated. He said he did not know whether Obama had been briefed on the arrests or whether security plans would change for his acceptance speech on Thursday.</p> <p>Court documents had one man quoting another as speaking of wanting to kill Obama on his inauguration day by using a sniper rifle to shoot him from high ground. The comments amount to the \"the racist ramblings of three meth heads\", Eid insisted.</p> <p>The three men were arrested after a truck containing drugs, guns and ammunition was stopped on the outskirts of Denver. The driver was named as Tharin Gartrell. Shawn Adolf, who wore a swastika ring and was wanted on drug charges, was arrested when police came to the hotel where he was staying in a Denver suburb. He jumped from the sixth floor, landing on a flat roof and breaking his ankle. He tried to run but was arrested.</p> <p>The third man, Nathan Johnson, was arrested at an upmarket hotel in Denver. His statements to police during an eight-hour interview appeared to have raised fears of a threat to Obama. In an interview with a local CBS station while in custody, Johnson accused the other two men of making racist statements about Obama. He said they had spoken about shooting Obama on the day of his speech, saying: \"He don't belong in political office or blacks don't belong in political office.\" Johnson denied being involved in the plot.</p> <p>Concerns about the safety of Obama, who would be America's first African American president should he win in November, led the US secret service to provide round-the-clock protection from early in his bid.</p> <p>Some white supremacist groups would like to see Obama killed, according to Mark Potok, an expert in neo-Nazi groups at the Southern Poverty Law Centre in Alabama. Threats against Obama were circulating on the internet, said Potok, whose organisation monitors and opposes hate groups.</p> <p>He cited a threat posted on the law centre's website in April that read, with a misspelled word: \"ATTENTION, IF OBAMA BECOMES PRESEDANT I WILL KILL HIM MYSELF MAKE NO MISTAKE ABOUT IT.\"</p> <p>Potok said white supremacists overwhelmingly believe the Colorado case was a set-up by authorities determined to smash their groups. He based his assertion on information gleaned from neo-Nazi websites.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> This article was amended on Friday August 29 2008. In the article above we said that Barack Obama would be America's first African American president should he win in October. The US presidential election takes place in November. This has been corrected.</p>",
  "<p>Hillary Clinton's speech to the Democratic convention was a miracle of multi-tasking.</p> <p>There were three simultaneous tasks awaiting her when she walked out on stage in her tangerine pants suit. </p> <p>She had to dispel any notion that she was not now solidly with Barack Obama. Any sign of doubt would fuel efforts by the Republicans to chip away at his support and legitimacy as the Democratic nominee.</p> <p>She had to persuade her supporters that Obama would now carry forward the populist themes that had dominated her campaign, and get them fired up about taking on John McCain.</p> <p>She had to provide some sense of closure to women voters who had invested so deeply in her campaign, giving them a sense of achievement even in defeat.</p> <p>Clinton carried off all three challenges in a powerful speech that brought the hall to its feet.</p> <p>The problem though for Clinton and the Democrats was not necessarily in the conventional hall where party delegates are experienced enough to recognise the need for moving on.</p> <p>Clinton had to make sure that her message carried to a wider audience of supporters - some relative newcomers to the political process - who are now threatening to vote for McCain.</p> <p>That constituency, loosely associated with the party is going to be hard to reach. They are also unlikely to be persuaded to give up after a night of watching Clinton appear so thoroughly in command - even presidential.</p> <p>But that is not entirely her fault. Clinton, true to form, was thorough. She left no doubt that she was now supporting Obama's campaign, and made a compelling intellectual argument that he would carry forward the issues she championed.</p> <p>Of course, she could have gone farther. Clinton made no attempt to disown some of the more cutting comments of the primary campaign - now regularly cropping up in Republican attack ads - in which she said Obama was not ready to be in the White House.</p> <p>Clinton also dwelled a little too deeply on the history of her own campaign, and for a few perilous moments it seemed like she was veering off into one of her stump speeches.</p> <p>She made up for those lapses with a series of stinging critiques against McCain, making it clear that he was not a legitimate alternative for her disaffected supporters.</p> <p>But that was the relatively easy part. The real challenge for Clinton was to perform some kind of emotional alchemy on those die-hard supporters who are still unable to let go.</p> <p>Many of Clinton's women supporters had seen her as a feminist icon. They saw in her run for the White House, which ultimately saw her overtaken by a younger man, parallels with their own lives. </p> <p>Clinton, in her defeat, was the embodiment of their own personal disappointments. </p> <p>But she provided them with the validation they needed, situating her campaign in American feminist history.</p> <p>And while Clinton's run for the White House has ended, her supporters could also claim some satisfaction that the Obama campaign was utterly ungrudging in her big night.</p> <p>There was a video tribute as sentimental as the one the night before for Ted Kennedy, narrated by daughter, Chelsea. As she spoke, convention organisers distributed white signs emblazoned with her signature, allowing Clinton to look out on a convention emblazoned with her name.</p> <p>And if there was any lingering doubt that Hillary Clinton could now claim her place in US political history, the video dispelled it. The clip of Bill Clinton in the video tribute was labelled simply \"Hillary's husband\".</p>",
  "<video data-media-id=\"gu-video-336984430\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/bc/281851582/281851582_1755983351_clinton-speech3-Brightcove-4x3.flv\"/> </video>   <p>Hillary Clinton delivered an unequivocal endorsement of Barack Obama in her prime time speech at the Democratic convention in Denver tonight and called on her supporters to rally behind him.</p> <p>\"I am honoured to be here tonight. A proud mother. A proud Democrat. A proud American. And a proud supporter of Barack Obama,\" she said, opening her speech.</p> <p>Demonstrating the party discipline she has shown throughout her political career, she repeated the call for party unity at regular intervals throughout the 25-minute speech. \"We are on the same team and none of us can sit on the sidelines,\" she said.</p> <p>Die-hard Clintonites have taken comfort in her earlier pronouncements, saying they were ambiguous. But there was no ambiguity in her speech last night.</p> <p>Each of her calls for unity was greeted with loud cheers, suggesting the party was beginning the process of coming together.</p> <p>The resistance threatened by her most fervent supporters appears to be petering out. A formal roll call of her support is likely to be held at the convention today but it will only be symbolic. </p> <p>The dominance by the Clintons of the Democratic party for most of the last two decades appears to be just about over. But if Obama was to lose in November, Clinton could hope to try again in 2012.</p> <p>The convention acknowledged her tenacity in the fight with Obama for the Democratic nomination - the first woman to come so close - by giving her a three-minute standing ovation. The hall turned into a sea of white and blue Hillary placards.</p> <p>She was introduced by her daughter Chelsea who described her as her hero and husband Bill watched from the sidelines</p> <p>She paid tribute to those who had backed her campaign. \"To my supporters, my champions - my sisterhood of the travelling pantsuits - from the bottom of my heart: thank you. You never gave in. You never gave up. And together we made history.\"</p> <p>In a speech free of rancour or resentment, she loyally made the case for Obama and his vice-presidential running mate, Joe Biden.</p> <p>\"I ran to stand up for all those who have been invisible to their government for eight long years. Those are the reasons I ran for president. Those are the reasons I support Barack Obama. And those are the reasons you should too,\" she said.</p> <p>She indulged in just one jibe at Obama, over healthcare, in which she favours the speedy introduction of universal care while he prefers a phased approach. \"I can't wait to watch Barack Obama sign a healthcare plan into law that covers every single American,\" she said.</p> <p>Earlier in the day, she formally released her 1,896 supporters from pledges to vote for her at the convention, a symbolic move that frees them to vote for Obama in a show of party unity.</p> <p>The speech by the woman who has gone further than any other in US politics coincided with the 88th anniversary of the adoption of the constitutional amendment that gave women the right to vote,</p> <p>In contrast with the first day of the convention, which many delegates criticised for failing to land punches on the Republicans, Clinton rounded on both president George Bush and the Republican candidate, John McCain.</p> <p>\"John McCain says the economy is fundamentally sound. John McCain doesn't think that 47m people without health insurance is a crisis. John McCain wants to privatise social security. And in 2008, he still thinks it is okay when women don't earn equal pay for equal work,\" she said.</p> <p>It was appropriate that Bush and McCain should appear together at the Republican convention in Minneapolis-St Paul next week \"because these days they're awfully hard to tell apart\".</p> <p>Bill Clinton could prove to be less disciplined tomorrow evening. The Obama campaign team wanted to edit his speech to ensure he stuck to the theme of the day, national security.</p> <p>But Clinton, who feels Obama has failed to pay homage to the economic successes during his presidency, is intent on speaking about not only national security but the economy and his administration's achievements.</p> <p>In spite of her loyal speech, there is frustration in the Obama camp that she dominated one of only four precious convention days.</p> <p>Bill Clinton's speech and the prospect of a symbolic roll call of her supporters tomorrow will again overshadow Obama's message.</p>",
  "<p>I am honoured to be here tonight. A proud mother. A proud Democrat. A proud American. And a proud supporter of Barack Obama.</p> <p>My friends, it is time to take back the country we love.</p> <p>Whether you voted for me, or voted for Barack, the time is now to unite as a single party with a single purpose. We are on the same team, and none of us can sit on the sidelines.</p> <p>This is a fight for the future. And it's a fight we must win.</p> <p>I haven't spent the past 35 years in the trenches advocating for children, campaigning for universal healthcare, helping parents balance work and family and fighting for women's rights at home and around the world ... to see another Republican in the White House squander the promise of our country and the hopes of our people.</p> <p>And you haven't worked so hard over the last 18 months, or endured the last eight years, to suffer through more failed leadership.</p> <p>No way. No how. No McCain.</p> <p>Barack Obama is my candidate. And he must be our president.</p> <p>Tonight we need to remember what a presidential election is really about. When the polls have closed, and the ads are finally off the air, it comes down to you - the American people, your lives and your children's futures.</p> <p>For me, it's been a privilege to meet you in your homes, your workplaces, and your communities. Your stories reminded me every day that America's greatness is bound up in the lives of the American people - your hard work, your devotion to duty, your love for your children and your determination to keep going, often in the face of enormous obstacles.</p> <p>You taught me so much, you made me laugh, and ... you even made me cry. You allowed me to become part of your lives. And you became part of mine.</p> <p>I will always remember the single mom who had adopted two kids with autism, didn't have health insurance and discovered she had cancer. But she greeted me with her bald head painted with my name on it and asked me to fight for healthcare.</p> <p>I will always remember the young man in a Marine Corps t-shirt who waited months for medical care and said to me: \"Take care of my buddies; a lot of them are still over there \u2026 and then will you please help take care of me?\"</p> <p>I will always remember the boy who told me his mom worked for the minimum wage and that her employer had cut her hours. He said he just didn't know what his family was going to do.</p> <p>I will always be grateful to everyone from all 10 states, Puerto Rico and the territories, who joined our campaign on behalf of all those people left out and left behind by the Bush administration.</p> <p>To my supporters, my champions - my sisterhood of the traveling pantsuits - from the bottom of my heart: thank you.</p> <p>You never gave in. You never gave up. And together we made history.</p> <p>Along the way, America lost two great Democratic champions who would have been here with us tonight. One of our finest young leaders, Arkansas Democratic Party chair, Bill Gwatney, who believed with all his heart that America and the south could be and should be Democratic from top to bottom.</p> <p>And congresswoman Stephanie Tubbs Jones, a dear friend to many of us, a loving mother and courageous leader who never gave up her quest to make America fairer and smarter, stronger and better. Steadfast in her beliefs, a fighter of uncommon grace, she was an inspiration to me and to us all.</p> <p>Our heart goes out to Stephanie's son, Mervyn, Jr, and Bill's wife, Rebecca, who traveled to Denver to join us at our convention.</p> <p>Bill and Stephanie knew that after eight years of George Bush, people are hurting at home, and our standing has eroded around the world. We have a lot of work ahead.</p> <p>Jobs lost, houses gone, falling wages, rising prices. The supreme court in a right-wing headlock and our government in partisan gridlock. The biggest deficit in our nation's history. Money borrowed from the Chinese to buy oil from the Saudis.</p> <p>Putin and Georgia, Iraq and Iran.</p> <p>I ran for president to renew the promise of America. To rebuild the middle class and sustain the American dream, to provide the opportunity to work hard and have that work rewarded, to save for college, a home and retirement, to afford the gas and groceries and still have a little left over each month.</p> <p>To promote a clean energy economy that will create millions of green collar jobs.</p> <p>To create a healthcare system that is universal, high-quality and affordable so that parents no longer have to choose between care for themselves or their children or be stuck in dead end jobs simply to keep their insurance.</p> <p>To create a world-class education system and make college affordable again.</p> <p>To fight for an America defined by deep and meaningful equality - from civil rights to labour rights, from women's rights to gay rights, from ending discrimination to promoting unionisation to providing help for the most important job there is: caring for our families. To help every child live up to his or her God-given potential.</p> <p>To make America once again a nation of immigrants and a nation of laws.</p> <p>To bring fiscal sanity back to Washington and make our government an instrument of the public good, not of private plunder.</p> <p>To restore America's standing in the world, to end the war in Iraq, bring our troops home and honor their service by caring for our veterans.</p> <p>And to join with our allies to confront our shared challenges, from poverty and genocide to terrorism and global warming.</p> <p>Most of all, I ran to stand up for all those who have been invisible to their government for eight long years.</p> <p>Those are the reasons I ran for president. Those are the reasons I support Barack Obama. And those are the reasons you should too.</p> <p>I want you to ask yourselves: Were you in this campaign just for me? Or were you in it for that young Marine and others like him? Were you in it for that mom struggling with cancer while raising her kids? Were you in it for that boy and his mom surviving on the minimum wage? Were you in it for all the people in this country who feel invisible?</p> <p>We need leaders once again who can tap into that special blend of American confidence and optimism that has enabled generations before us to meet our toughest challenges. Leaders who can help us show ourselves and the world that with our ingenuity, creativity and innovative spirit, there are no limits to what is possible in America.</p> <p>This won't be easy. Progress never is. But it will be impossible if we don't fight to put a Democrat in the White House.</p> <p>We need to elect Barack Obama because we need a president who understands that America can't compete in a global economy by padding the pockets of energy speculators, while ignoring the workers whose jobs have been shipped overseas. We need a president who understands that we can't solve the problems of global warming by giving windfall profits to the oil companies while ignoring opportunities to invest in new technologies that will build a green economy.</p> <p>We need a president who understands that the genius of America has always depended on the strength and vitality of the middle class.</p> <p>Barack Obama began his career fighting for workers displaced by the global economy. He built his campaign on a fundamental belief that change in this country must start from the ground up, not the top down. He knows government must be about \"we the people\" not \"we the favored few\".</p> <p>And when Barack Obama is in the White House, he'll revitalise our economy, defend the working people of America, and meet the global challenges of our time. Democrats know how to do this. As I recall, President Clinton and the Democrats did it before. And President Obama and the Democrats will do it again.</p> <p>He'll transform our energy agenda by creating millions of green jobs and building a new, clean energy future. He'll make sure that middle-class families get the tax relief they deserve. And I can't wait to watch Barack Obama sign a healthcare plan into law that covers every single American.</p> <p>Barack Obama will end the war in Iraq responsibly and bring our troops home - a first step to repairing our alliances around the world.</p> <p>And he will have with him a terrific partner in Michelle Obama. Anyone who saw Michelle's speech last night knows she will be a great first lady for America.</p> <p>Americans are also fortunate that Joe Biden will be at Barack Obama's side. He is a strong leader and a good man. He understands both the economic stresses here at home and the strategic challenges abroad. He is pragmatic, tough and wise. And, of course, Joe will be supported by his wonderful wife, Jill.</p> <p>They will be a great team for our country.</p> <p>Now, John McCain is my colleague and my friend.</p> <p>He has served our country with honor and courage.</p> <p>But we don't need four more years ... of the last eight years.</p> <p>More economic stagnation \u2026 and less affordable healthcare.</p> <p>More high gas prices \u2026 and less alternative energy.</p> <p>More jobs getting shipped overseas \u2026 and fewer jobs created here.</p> <p>More skyrocketing debt ... home foreclosures \u2026 and mounting bills that are crushing our middle-class families.</p> <p>More war ... less diplomacy.</p> <p>More of a government where the privileged come first \u2026 and everyone else comes last.</p> <p>John McCain says the economy is fundamentally sound. John McCain doesn't think that 47m people without health insurance is a crisis. John McCain wants to privatise Social Security. And in 2008, he still thinks it's okay when women don't earn equal pay for equal work.</p> <p>With an agenda like that, it makes sense that George Bush and John McCain will be together next week in the Twin Cities. Because these days they're awfully hard to tell apart.</p> <p>America is still around after 232 years because we have risen to the challenge of every new time, changing to be faithful to our values of equal opportunity for all and the common good.</p> <p>And I know what that can mean for every man, woman and child in America. I'm a United States senator because in 1848 a group of courageous women and a few brave men gathered in Seneca Falls, New York, many traveling for days and nights, to participate in the first convention on women's rights in our history.</p> <p>And so dawned a struggle for the right to vote that would last 72 years, handed down by mother to daughter to granddaughter - and a few sons and grandsons along the way.</p> <p>These women and men looked into their daughters' eyes, imagined a fairer and freer world, and found the strength to fight. To rally and picket. To endure ridicule and harassment. To brave violence and jail.</p> <p>And after so many decades - 88 years ago on this very day - the 19th amendment guaranteeing women the right to vote would be forever enshrined in our Constitution.</p> <p>My mother was born before women could vote. But in this election my daughter got to vote for her mother for president.</p> <p>This is the story of America. Of women and men who defy the odds and never give up.</p> <p>How do we give this country back to them?</p> <p>By following the example of a brave New Yorker , a woman who risked her life to shepherd slaves along the Underground Railroad.</p> <p>And on that path to freedom, Harriett Tubman had one piece of advice.</p> <p>If you hear the dogs, keep going.</p> <p>If you see the torches in the woods, keep going.</p> <p>If they're shouting after you, keep going.</p> <p>Don't ever stop. Keep going.</p> <p>If you want a taste of freedom, keep going.</p> <p>Even in the darkest of moments, ordinary Americans have found the faith to keep going.</p> <p>I've seen it in you. I've seen it in our teachers and firefighters, nurses and police officers, small business owners and union workers, the men and women of our military - you always keep going.</p> <p>We are Americans. We're not big on quitting.</p> <p>But remember, before we can keep going, we have to get going by electing Barack Obama president.</p> <p>We don't have a moment to lose or a vote to spare.</p> <p>Nothing less than the fate of our nation and the future of our children hang in the balance.</p> <p>I want you to think about your children and grandchildren come election day. And think about the choices your parents and grandparents made that had such a big impact on your life and on the life of our nation.</p> <p>We've got to ensure that the choice we make in this election honours the sacrifices of all who came before us, and will fill the lives of our children with possibility and hope.</p> <p>That is our duty, to build that bright future, and to teach our children that in America there is no chasm too deep, no barrier too great - and no ceiling too high - for all who work hard, never back down, always keep going, have faith in God, in our country and in each other.</p> <p>Thank you so much. God bless America and Godspeed to you all.</p>",

There's no escaping the fact that Clinton's prime-time speech tonight will be, in part, an <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/michaeltomasky/2008/aug/26/hillaryclinton.clinton\">exercise in public therapy</a> for the failed presidential candidate and her staunchest supporters. They think, of course, that her speaking slot should have been on Thursday, accepting the nomination. Instead, the crucial question is whether she'll show sufficient enthusiasm for Obama to convey a message of party unity \u2014 and to bring back to the Democratic fold some of the 53% of Clinton supporters who aren't already solidly behind Obama. (The other question is whether she'll show that enthusiasm by deploying her ill-advised staring-and-pointing-at-someone-in-the-audience tactic.)</p> <p>On the streets of Denver today, the <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/08/26/clinton.backers/\">angry hardline Pumas</a> have been marching. Those I spoke to last night, at an entirely surreal Republican-run 'Happy Hour for Hillary' in a gloomy bar, rejected the notion that she \"has to\" do anything in particular this evening: it's Obama's responsibility, they say, to unite the party. Inside the convention bubble, though, it's impossible to overstate how precisely the Clinton-Obama detente is being choreographed in an effort to make sure such sentiments don't get expressed. That will be nowhere more true than at tomorrow's roll-call vote, the precise orchestration of which will speak volumes. According to one version <a href=\"http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5jQD-Ub1QQZgszKZ4ddpQBmVCevOQD92PVIIG3\">doing the rounds here</a>, the Obama and Clinton teams have agreed that Hillary herself will \"spontaneously\" step forward, mid-way through the voting, and urge that the nomination be awarded to Obama without completing the ballot. </p> <p>Meanwhile, the Clintons' every move is being scrutinised: Hillary will attend Thursday's speech at Invesco Field, we're told; Bill <a href=\"http://blogs.marketwatch.com/election/2008/08/26/another-sneak-attack-by-bill-clinton/\">seemed to attack</a> Barack Obama once again in Denver today; then again, Hillary <a href=\"http://blogs.abcnews.com/politicalradar/2008/08/clinton-if-we-d.html\">paid a compliment</a> to Michelle; on the other hand, Clinton's people <a href=\"http://voices.washingtonpost.com/the-trail/2008/08/25/clinton_adviser_to_skip_town_b.html\">aren't even staying in town</a> for Obama's nomination acceptance speech. </p> <p>So, yes, tonight's speech is all about ego and emotion and therapy \u2014 but how Clinton handles it tonight could really matter, come November. \"Never before,\" <a href=\"http://www.nationaljournal.com/conventions/co_20080826_2298.php\">said</a> one Clinton supporter who'll be in the convention all tonight, \"has how the loser of the convention loses been more important than how the winner wins.\" Join me here in an hour or so (around <strong>8.15pm Denver time, 10.15pm eastern, 3.15am UK</strong> -- welcome, insomniacs!) and we'll pick over every last nuance.</p> <p><strong>8.05pm:</strong> (all times local) In response to commenter Lucerne, time for an important food update, and frankly I can't believe that while liveblogging last night I forgot to mention that I was \"enjoying\" a \"delicious\" snack of <a href=\"http://allrecipes.com/Recipe/Breaded-Chicken-Fingers/Detail.aspx\">breaded chicken fingers</a> (which look way better in that linked picture). The food at the Pepsi Center all depends on who you are, and if you are me, it's burgers and hot dogs from a van like the ones I used to try to avoid as a student. But I'm not complaining. Much.</p> <p><strong>8.12pm:</strong> Last night, the convention organisers distributed Obama-branded \"Kennedy\" and \"Michelle\" banners; I'd been wondering if they'd go so far as to print \"Clinton\" ones. But I'm told the banners being handed out tonight will in fact say \"Clinton Voters For Obama\". </p> <p><strong>8.15pm:</strong> CNN reports that Clinton was consulting (of course!) <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/08/11/atlantic.clinton.staff/index.html\">Mark Penn</a> on the details of tonight's speech until as little as two hours ago. I know \u2014 why not use tonight's speech to <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/a/green-penn-3-19-07.mhtml\">accuse Obama of lacking American roots</a>? It'd certainly be unexpected...</p> <p><strong>8.20pm:</strong> Bill has arrived. He looks resplendent in his red tie and pink face.</p> <p><strong>8.28pm:</strong> ...And with minutes to go, the heavens have opened. It's pouring down. What can this signify? Meanwhile, Montana's governor, Britan Schweitzer, is giving a speech. He's wearing a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolo_tie\">bolo tie</a>. </p> <p><strong>8.37pm:</strong> Time for a Hillary Clinton tribute video, with a soundtrack by the Kinks, and some excruciating Saturday Night Live footage.</p> <p>Random thought: the last time I saw Hillary deliver a rousing call to support Barack Obama it was at her concession speech, at the National Buildings Museum, in Washington, and it was the best speech of her campaign. Then, though, she was urging her supporters to back Obama. Tonight, most of the people in the hall will already be enthusiastic backers of Obama. So won't it sound bizarre if she urges them to support him?</p> <p><strong>8.41pm</strong> Michael Tomasky, to my left, points out that there's now only 19 minutes until the traditional 9pm closing time of the convention. Surely she won't speak so briefly?</p> <p><strong>8.43pm</strong> Here's Chelsea, introducing Hillary, and here's Hillary. There <em>are</em> a whole lot of \"Hillary\" banners, it turns out. Clinton is wearing orange. She will be criticised for this. She's soaking up the applause, but she hasn't \"spotted-and-pointed-to\" anyone in the audience yet, as far as I can see. The whole top section of the massive plasma screens above the podium flash a single word: CLINTON.</p> <p><strong>8.48pm</strong> \"I'm here tonight as a proud mother, as a proud Democrat... and a proud supporter of Barack Obama.\" Wild cheers. \"It iss time to take back the country we love, and whether you voted for me or for Barack Obama, the time is right to unite as a single party with a single purpose.\" Couldn't be clearer than that. \"We are on the same team, and none of us can afford to sit on the sidelines. This is a fight for the future, and it's a fight we must win together.\"</p> <p><strong>8.52pm</strong> A quick critique of McCain, though I don't expect we'll hear too much of that tonight \u2014 it'd be a distraction from the pro-Obama stuff, and Clinton might need to get along with McCain in the Senate (or with McCain as president) for some years. \"Barack Obama is my candidate. And he must be our president.\" That said, most of what we're hearing right now is Clinton self-glorification. \"I will always remember the single mom who had adopted two kids with autism, didn't have health insurance, and discovered she had cancer. But she greeted me with her bald head painted with my name on it and asked me to fight for healthcare.\" A ringing endorsement of Hillary Clinton, there, but her supporters will love it.</p> <p><strong>8.55pm</strong> Clinton thanks her \"sisterhood of the travelling pantsuits.\" OK. A New Zealand journalist is recording a radio report in my right ear. Very distracting. Meanwhile, tributes from Clinton to Bill Gwatney, the Arkansas Democratic party chair shot dead recently, and Congresswoman Stephanie Tubbs Jones, who also died.</p> <p>...By the way, Michelle Obama and Joe Biden are both watching and applauding vigorously. Barack's not in Denver yet, conveniently.</p> <p>A long section now about why Clinton ran for president. (Healthcare, education, a clean energy economy.) Still no Obama-love. Until now: \"... those are the reasons I ran for president, and those are the reasons I support Barack Obama for president. I want you to ask yourselves: were you in this campaign just for me? Or were you in it for that young Marine and others like him.\" (I didn't tell you about the young Marine \u2014 sorry.) Clinton does selflessness in a rather egotistical way, I guess, but this is good stuff.</p> <p><strong>8.58pm:</strong> The Tomasky judgment is in! \"It's fine,\" he says. \"It's probably going to get rave reviews. I don't like it very much, but it's probably going to get rave reviews. I've heard too many of her speeches.\"</p> <p><strong>9.00pm:</strong> \"When Barack Obama is in the White House, he'll revitalize our economy, defend the working people of America, and meet the global challenges of our time. Democrats know how to do this. As I recall, President Clinton and the Democrats did it before. And president Obama and the Democrats will do it again.\" Love for Michelle, for Joe Biden, and for Jill Biden. </p> <p><strong>9.03pm:</strong>\"Now, John McCain is my colleague and friend...\" \u2014 a silence in the hall \u2014 but no, it's OK, she's slagging him off aplenty now. He's complacent about healthcare, she says, \"and in 2008, he still thinks it's OK when women don't earn equal pay for equal work.\"</p> <p><strong>9.05pm:</strong> And <em>here's</em> the zinger! \"With an agenda like that, it makes sense that George Bush and John McCain will be together next week in the Twin Cities. Because these days they're awfully hard to tell apart.\" Fantastic line, and it's striking how little we've heard George Bush's name so far during this convention and the build-up to it. </p> <p><strong>9.08pm:</strong> A rousing section about Harriet Tubman and the Underground Railroad. \"If you hear the dogs, keep going. If you see torches in the woods, keep going. If they're shouting after you, keep going. Don't ever stop. Keep going... but remember, before we can keep going, we have to get going by electing Barack Obama president.\"</p> <p><strong>9.10pm:</strong> And it's over, with a big final pro-Obama rallying cry. I'll be very surprised if this speech doesn't get wildly enthusiastic reviews tomorrow, but first I'm going to (try to) mingle with some of the delegates and see if I can reach any Significant Conclusions.</p> <p><strong>9.30pm:</strong> James Carville, on CNN, can't resist pointing out that \"this is what a major league fastballer sounds like.\"</p> <p><strong>9.40pm:</strong>Well, that's one elated crowd, Overheard:</p> <p>\"She stepped up to the moment. She stepped up.\"<br>\"She did everything she could have done.\"<br>\"These people -- they have HEALED!\" \u2014 actually that was the Daily Show's John Oliver, recording a piece to camera.</p> <p>Diane Wood, a Kentucky delegate and Hillary supporter turned Obama backer, told me Hillary \"said exactly what needed to be said. I think people are really united here. I guess there'll be some holdouts, but I don't think there are any in my delegation \u2014 not that I know of, anyway.\"</p> <p>My colleague Elana Schor is questioning the crowd in a rather less hasty fashion \u2014 read it later <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uselections\">here</a>!</p> <p><strong>9.45pm:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.reason.com/convention2008/show/128315.html\">Hit and Run</a> has a quick roundup of medialand opinions on the speech. They're all positive.</p> <p>(...As someone will inevitably point out tomorrow, a lot of Hillary Clinton's enthusiasm for Barack Obama \u2014 like that of many of her supporters in the hall \u2014 almost certainly isn't \"genuine\"; nobody believes that she and Bill sit around the dinner table raving endlessly about the man who beat her to the nomination. Sure. But I never understand why that's considered a criticism. Saying what Clinton said tonight, for the sake of electing a Democrat, is surely principled politics, isn't it? Even if it took her many months to start saying it, and even if plenty of tonight's speech was Clinton-focused. What tonight's speech emphatically wasn't was an exercise in helping her supporters wallow in resentment, which she's been all too prone to doing in the fairly recent past. \"I want you to ask yourselves: Were you in this campaign just for me?\" \u2014 that's not public therapy, that's a rejection of any further public therapy...)</p> <p><strong>9.50pm:</strong> Oh, and look who's just issued a statement \u2014 the McCain campaign. They're pointing out that Clinton's enthusiasm for Obama is questionable because of all the times she attacked him. See paragraph above.</p> <p><strong>9.58pm:</strong> That's all from me. I'm going to step out into the streets of Denver and breathe in the sweet, clear scent of UNITY. Thanks for reading and commenting...</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/oliverburkemanblog/2008/aug/27/uselections2008.barackobama#start-of-comments\">Comment</a></p>",
  "<p><em>Hugh Jackson is reporting from Denver for the Nevada political blog <a href=\"http://www.lasvegasgleaner.com/\">Las Vegas Gleaner</a></em></p> <p>Gambling, drinking, prostitution - sure, at first blush it looks like Nevada is something special.</p> <p>But beneath that respectable veneer of reckless behaviour and general carrying on, the state is actually not unlike the rest of America. People work hard, love their kids, and struggle to get by and keep up.</p> <p>And just like Democratic leaders the nation over, Nevadans at the Democratic National Convention in Denver are contending - and hoping - that the swath Hillary Clinton and her former president of a husband have cut through the convention is not going to compromise Barack Obama's chances of winning the presidency.</p> <p>Clinton <a href=\"http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/21229219/\">won Nevada's caucus</a> - the third contest in the country following Iowa and New Hampshire - in January (although in a reflection of Byzantine caucus rules, Obama won more delegates). Her campaign chairman in the state was Rory Reid, a Clark County (Las Vegas) commissioner whose father, <a href=\"http://reid.senate.gov/\">US Senate majority leader Harry Reid</a>, was officially neutral in the presidential contest until it had been decided in June.</p> <p>Rory son of Harry, now fully behind Obama, is quick to play down reports of Clinton family reluctance to embrace the nominee. And he dismisses the suggestion that by looming over the first days of the convention and her decision to put her name in nomination in pursuit of \"catharsis,\" Clinton threw the convention off its main message: introducing Barack Obama.</p> <p>What Clinton termed a catharsis, Reid the Younger described as \"just procedural motions that are relevant to nobody but a few people who are interested in process.\"</p> <p>A Nevada Obama champion is also keen to play down stories suggesting that the Clintons are less than wildly enthusiastic about Obama's nomination. \"I don't know how much of that is really the Clintons and how much is media spin,\" said Barbara Buckley, the first woman to become the speaker of the lower house in the state Legislature.</p> <p>But Buckley hoped Clinton's address on Tuesday would \"put all the chatter to rest.\" Well, Madame Speaker, one can hope.</p> <p>Nevada will be a true battleground state in November. Thanks to its large Latino population and strong union presence, Nevada was thought to be a microcosm of key portions of the Democratic party nationwide. That's why it was selected to play an early role in the nominating process.</p> <p>If Nevada is at all a reflection of Democrats nationwide, it is possible that latent Clinton passions among the electorate are being overstated by the political-media-industrial complex. While Clinton enjoys strong support within the Nevada delegation and among Democrats statewide, Nevadans at the Denver convention insist that they are all firmly behind Obama and will work for his election.</p> <p>As Congresswoman Shelley Berkley, an ardent Clinton supporter, put it: \"There's too much at stake.\"</p> <p>At the same time, the convention is carefully stage-crafted - in theory, anyway - not only to inspire the party faithful but also to introduce and sing the praises of Barack Obama to the all-important independent and swing voters nationwide. And yet much of the convention's first couple days were consumed with All Things Clinton instead of All Obama All the Time.</p> <p>And when the Republicans meet at their convention in St. Paul next week, ostensibly to officially nominate John McCain but primarily to mount concerted, methodical and relentless attacks designed to destroy the public image of Barack Obama, they won't be so easily distracted.</p>"

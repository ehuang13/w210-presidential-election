His cousins play ice hockey. Now, aged just five and a half, Raymond is being initiated into the sport too - which gives his mother, Susan, instant membership of the group that could well decide this election: \"hockey moms\".<br><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/sarahpalin\"><br>Sarah Palin's</a> arrival as Republican vice-presidential candidate - and self-described pitbull-in-lipstick hockey mom - has redefined the politics of identity in an election dominated by race, gender and age.</p> <p>Hillary Clinton's run for the Democratic presidential nomination produced widespread excitement about women candidates. Now Palin - white, middle class, and non-metropolitan - could be the deciding factor in determining whether white working- and middle-class suburban mothers vote for Barack Obama or John McCain.</p> <p>In its narrowest sense Palin, as hockey mom, can claim a personal connection to the mothers of America's 350,000 hockey-playing children and youth, concentrated in northern battleground states such as Michigan.</p> <p>The McCain camp claims though that any mother shuttling her children between school and sport or music classes can identify with Palin.</p> <p>\"It means she is down to earth and involved on that deep level with her family,\" says Wejroch, who gave up her job as a market researcher to stay home with her three sons.</p> <p>Wejroch, who says she will vote for the Republican ticket in November, does not think that Palin's career as Alaska governor and vice-presidential candidate makes McCain's running mate any less focused on her traditional role. \"Even though she is involved in such a high position in her state, she makes sure she has got time for her family,\" says Wejroch.</p> <p>Others at the rink in Livonia, a Detroit commuter town, agree that Palin seems more approachable than an earlier generation of female politician including Clinton or even Nancy Pelosi, the first woman speaker of the house and, like Palin, a mother of five.</p> <p>Clinton, with her suits and her pride in her profession as a lawyer and senator, was off-putting to those women who still place importance in traditional roles. \"[Palin] just seems like someone you can relate to. Hillary Clinton doesn't seem like you could sit down and have a cup of coffee with her,\" says Vicky Rokas, a solid Republican voter who counts herself a Palin fan.</p> <p>For Rokas, who has spent years shuttling three hockey-playing children to practice and out-of-state tournaments, Palin's hockey mom experience is just as valid as her professional credentials.</p> <p>Rokas argues that hockey moms, who must supervise homework and dinner ice-side, are by necessity focused and disciplined. They must be: it costs about $1,500 (\u00a3815) a season for a child to play the sport. They are also tough when the situation warrants. Rokas admits to her share of confrontations with parents of children on opposing teams.</p> <p>And while Palin's son, Track, is now in the US military and has not played hockey for more than a year, Rokas says the Republican politician is still entitled to call herself a hockey mom.</p> <p>But the positive image is far from universal. Many women admit a visceral dislike of McCain's running mate.</p> <p>\"She scares the hell out of me. Every time I see her I go home and open my wallet, and write another cheque for Obama,\" says Pilar Herrera-Fierro, looking up from her copy of the New York Times to watch her daughter's practice.</p> <p>The immediate burst of enthusiasm about Palin's candidacy has faded. The comedian Tina Fey has turned Palin's gaffes on foreign policy - such as the line about seeing Russia from Alaska - into a spoof on the TV show Saturday Night Live. </p> <p>Women voters have also become more conscious of Palin's retrograde views on global warming and others issues. </p> <p>\"It is this narrative of working mom that has really captured the imagination of women right now, and it has not yet really touched on policy issues,\" said Debbie Walsh, the director of the Centre of Women and American Politics at Rutgers University in New Jersey.</p> <p>Even so, Palin has eroded Obama's early advantage among women voters. A Lifetime poll last week showed he and McCain almost tied in support among women, 47% and 45% respectively. The poll also showed married white women favoured McCain as the candidate who could bring \"real\" change and who understood their concerns.</p> <p>That could cost Obama. Women voters have determined the outcome of every US election for the last 40 years.</p> <p>Since the early 1980s more women have turned out to vote than men and they have tilted towards the Democrats. The 1996 contest saw Bill Clinton re-elected with strong support from so-called \"soccer moms\". Although in 2004 women swing voters - dubbed \"security moms\" that year - generally favoured John Kerry, enough voted for George Bush for the incumbent to win.</p> <p>They are also crucial in Livonia and the other predominantly white suburbs around Detroit. Obama cannot win Michigan without a strong showing in the suburbs, and he cannot win the White House without Michigan. </p> <p>While he has moved ahead of McCain in the polls in the state in the last few days, the Democrat needs to hang on to women voters. Unfortunately for Obama, there are signs they have been undergoing a shift to the right.</p> <p>Michigan, the home of America's dying car industry, has the country's highest unemployment rate at 8.9%. Ed Sarpolus, a prominent Michigan pollster, argues that economic uncertainty - heightened by the collapse on Wall Street, the housing crisis and higher petrol prices - has made women voters in Michigan especially nervous about the prospect of further upheaval.</p> <p>Even the most fanatical hockey families are economising. Livonia, which runs the most popular youth hockey programme in the greater Detroit area, has seen enrolment drop this year. </p> <p>The cutbacks and uncertainty make women less receptive to Obama's message of change. </p> <p>\"What has been happening in Michigan is that younger women, especially those under 40, are becoming more conservative - although not so much more church-going,\" Sarpolus says. \"They are fearful, because of the economy, for their kids and worried about their husband's jobs.\"</p> <p>The McCain campaign is also mining that economic discontent, and hoping to deflect resentment against the Bush administration - which could help Obama - on to Michigan's Democratic governor, Jennifer Granholm.</p> <p>However, the Obama camp believes that their man stands to do better in a poor economic climate, and that \"bread and butter\" issues will eventually outweigh Palin's emotional appeal to more conservative women voters. </p> <p>\"What we found here on the ground is that economic issues trump everything else,\" said Amy Chapman, Obama's Michigan campaign director. \"The economy is the number one issue.\"</p>",
  "<p>We're getting a new deal from politicians in their dealings with the media. They have stopped complaining that journalists are too interested in personality. Instead they are working up their life stories and satisfying the demand for it. But in turning their activities into another branch of celebrity culture, they are beginning to understand that they must offer constant drama.</p> <p>Last week, as a result, we saw most papers happily reduce coverage of the Labour party conference to the level of the X Factor final, the only story being the rivalry and performances of the prime minister and his foreign secretary. Now the entertainment moves on: this week it is all about David Cameron and his photogenic wife.</p> <p>The press have been picking over the Brown speech from early summer. It wasn't any longer politics, but human drama: we were left in no doubt that Brown had to give the performance of his life. But who can blame papers for treating politics as showbusiness when we see the prime minister's wife - a professional PR woman - jumping on stage to introduce his speech?</p> <p>I wasn't surprised to hear politicians thrown into the discussion when the PR and journalism networking club Editorial Intelligence talked about the treatment of celebrities a couple of days later. The PR man Mark Borkowski suggested that politicians were now part of celebrity culture and, as a consequence, would experience the short life cycle of their showbusiness counterparts. </p> <p>Boris Johnson exemplifies the politician as celebrity: a journalist who is a politician, a politician whose political success depends on a celebrity conferred by television appearances. No wonder Ken Livingstone was perplexed: his misfortune was to develop a big personality that played in newspapers - until the press discovered a personality that played even better.</p> <p>Dean Godson, research director of the thinktank Policy Exchange, identified the 1983 election as marking a crucial development in the trend for politicians to be given the celebrity treatment. That was when the Conservatives realised that a presidential approach would benefit their candidate Margaret Thatcher in the fight against Michael Foot. Now, he explained, we had a politics that responded to a public interested in political figures only at the moment they were either powerful or about to be powerful.</p> <p>That would explain the failure of Nick Clegg, a nice looking man with a happy family story who has failed to gain real purchase with the newspapers other than for those ill-advised reminiscences about his sexual history. \"It's PGL,\" explained a magazine editor I spoke to. \"Pointless good looks.\" So, until he gets a whiff of power about him, Clegg cannot attain the star quality that makes a newspaper story.</p> <p>Naturally, playing on personality takes you away from political content. It is an approach that culminated last week with the Labour leader addressing conference with the words: \"I want to talk about who I am.\" Is anyone in Labour known better than Brown? As Keith Waterhouse observed in the Mail: \"And so to the Big Me of the act, the Me-Me-Me. Most prime ministers occupy this role. They are self-obsessional like all star turns.\"</p> <p>But the great thing about newspapers, blunt instruments as they may be, is that the truth keeps leaching out, confounding all attempts to manage personalities. Party officials cannot control the press in the manner of the old Hollywood agents. Bit by bit, we construct a pretty clear idea of the people we read about in our newspapers.</p> <p>That is how we understood quickly that Tony Blair looked comfortable on holidays - although we did not like his habit of taking free ones - and Brown did not. The Suffolk holiday shots made him look uncomfortable. In Blair's case, the press's presentation of the friendly guy initially enthralled us and ultimately irritated us. In Brown's, even those newspapers that have remained friendly to him - the Mail, the Sun and to some extent the Telegraph - have largely abandoned attempts to sell us something he isn't.</p> <p>But now that the Browns have got the hang of the cameras, the papers are giving it one last go. There was Sarah Brown, rapidly becoming the starrier of the two, alongside Sarah Palin on that flying visit to the United States. I talked to a couple of newsmen who thought she had been foolish to put herself on stage. Now she was public property. But what, actually, does that mean? A little more interest in her clothes, closer scrutiny of everything she does? She can surely wear that.</p> <p>As for other politicians, they are relegated to supporting roles, bit players in the greater drama. David Miliband had his moment, but failed the test because the media began to realise power was not going to be his. His team had worked hard to build his platform, but then came that disastrous banana picture. If he had any chance of seizing the crown, it disappeared then. If anything, the poor man looked even more contorted in the pictures that showed him congratulating Brown on his speech.</p> <p>The old aphorism was that politics was showbusiness for ugly people. Now it is all about personality, the papers are reluctant to let a man who looks a little nerdy become prime minister.</p> <p><strong>Homage to the real family with power</strong></p> <p>Gordon Brown has not entirely repudiated the ways of his predecessor. At least he seems to love the Murdoch family just as much even though a previous appointment prevented his attending Elisabeth Murdoch's birthday party in Oxfordshire. </p> <p>When her father appeared on stage, the guests, who included Tony Blair, David Cameron, George Osborne and a several newspaper editors, very much enjoyed his reading of a note of apology from the prime minister: \"There are only two important Elizabeths and the only Elizabeth who could keep me from Elisabeth M's 40th birthday party is Elizabeth W.\" The Sun's generous coverage of Brown last week suggests that Rupert Murdoch has overlooked the prime minister's outrageous act of lese majeste in choosing to attend on the queen.</p> <p><strong>Opportunity knocks</strong></p> <p>The great Ann Leslie played hostess at a glittering party at the Reform Club, launching her biography on a sea of champagne. Having noted her hatred of speeches, she made a good one, identifying the particular felicity of her career: \"I have been fortunate to work for two generations of proprietor who not only love journalism but actually love journalists.\"</p> <p>We all drank more and agreed the great days were over for journalism. What young woman could look at journalism now with such hopes? Except that, slightly hungover, I met one the next day, a beneficiary of the Journalism Diversity Fund - a bursary to fund trainee journalists - who had found her first job, on the Newcastle Journal. \"It's brilliant,\" she said. \"And I have done my first death knock.\" There is a lot of gloom about, but the peculiar magic of journalism still exerts a pull.</p> <p>\u00b7 Peter Wilby is away</p>",
  "<p>'I didn't pick on the Pope,\" Sabina Guzzanti insists as she stirs her coffee. \"That was the only remark they hit upon in a 20-minute address. It made it look as if I delivered a speech to say the Pope's a poof.\" We are sitting at a table outside a cafe in the graffiti-covered San Lorenzo district of Rome, home to students and immigrants. Guzzanti is wrapped in an overcoat and scarf against the onset of autumn. The temperature has plunged to 22C.</p> <p>If ever there were someone who reaffirmed Dario Fo's vision of the comedian as heir to the deeply subversive medieval giullare, or jester, then it is this 45-year-old satirist with the face and air of a naughty, knowing elf. In Italy, she has been in and out of headline-grabbing controversies for at least 10 years.</p> <p>But this month she went global. On September 10, prosecutors in Rome asked for leave from the government to put her on trial, charged with \"contempt of the Pope\". Addressing a big leftwing rally in the Italian capital, the comedian had said: \"In 20 years [the former Cardinal Joseph] Ratzinger will be dead and will end up in hell, tormented by queer demons - not passive ones, but very active ones.\"</p> <p>Within 48 hours, her case had even worked its way into the US presidential election. Sitting alongside John McCain on Barbara Walters' morning talkshow, The View, the actor Whoopi Goldberg asked: \"Did you know that in Italy a comedian called Guzzanti risks five years in jail for a joke about the Pope?\" It brought howls of dismay from the live audience.</p> <p>Quite a few Italians, too, were shocked to discover that it was an offence in their country to poke fun at the pontiff. The offence was introduced in 1929 by a treaty between the papacy and Italy's then fascist dictator, Benito Mussolini. The treaty was revised in the 1980s and one of the changes was to remove the offence of which Guzzanti was accused.</p> <p>\"But in Italy there is this habit of passing lots of new laws and only seldom remembering to cancel the old ones,\" says Guzzanti. \"So the new ones and the old co-exist.\"</p> <p>On September 18, Silvio Berlusconi's justice minister decided the case should be dropped. By then, as Guzzanti observed, her critics and the Italian right in general had \"made a bloody awful spectacle of themselves to the rest of the world\". The affair gave outsiders a rare glimpse of the wackiness rife in the Italian legal system.</p> <p>But the fact that anyone should try to use a 79-year-old law of dubious validity to nail Guzzanti gives an inkling of the apoplectic rage she can inspire in her conservative compatriots. It may not be a coincidence that Guzzanti used the same rally to voice, in characteristically blunt fashion, a claim that had been hinted at in newspaper reports and talked about in bars across Italy. This was that Berlusconi had had an affair with his equal opportunities minister, a 32-year-old former topless model, Mara Carfagna, and that explicit evidence of their relationship had come to light in a telephone conversation recorded during an investigation into other matters. Berlusconi has denied the allegation and Carfagna threatened to sue Guzzanti, but has never done so.</p> <p>\"She didn't do so because I could have asked to read and bring to court the [transcripts] of the [telephone] intercepts,\" she says.</p> <p>Like many a giullare, the price of her jibes at the rich and powerful has been exile - not from the realms of an affronted prince, but from the kingdom of the mighty Silvio, Il cavaliere (\"the knight\"), as he likes to be called.</p> <p>Though most Italians have long come to accept it, his control of what they see on their television sets is flagrantly, and perilously, abnormal. Since being sworn in again this year as prime minister, he has had direct or indirect control of six of the seven channels from which the vast majority of Italians get their news and the other information on which they base their opinions. </p> <p>Not the least important thing about Guzzanti is that she embodies what this means. In practice, it is forbidden in Italy to give Berlusconi anything more than a gentle ribbing, or ask the really hard questions about how he obtained his wealth and power. That is precisely what she did on her TV programme five years ago when Berlusconi was last in power. It was taken off the air by the state-owned RAI after only two episodes. Lawyers for one of Berlusconi's companies then sued Guzzanti for \u20ac20m in damages. They did not win because the judge ruled that the things she had said about him on air were true. But she has never been allowed back onto RAI, except for the very occasional guest performance.</p> <p>The frustration that this must engender in a talented performer is sometimes given by others, particularly on the Italian centre-left, as an explanation for what are regarded as her vulgar excesses, such as her quip about the Pope. Understandably enough, the theory generally goes, she is trying to force herself back into the public eye.</p> <p>If you want to really wind up Guzzanti - if you want to see a glint appear in her eyes like a struck match - then all you have to do is set out this view. \"This is defamatory,\" she says. \"This is said by people who are very much against me and are the worst enemies of any sort of change. I can have visibility whenever it suits. I'm very popular, certainly a lot more popular than they are. If I take part in these rallies, it's not to get visibility. It's a complete bore going to rallies. It's always the same four of us from the arts who go. So really they ought to thank us because we have the courage to say what others don't, including those who write these shitty articles. Anyway, what I say is not outrageous. It's true.\"</p> <p>It is clear that Guzzanti holds the Pope in low esteem. Referring to his role as former head of a Vatican department in the sex abuse scandals that have rocked the Catholic church, she argues he had \"besmirched himself with several very serious offences\".</p> <p>But the reason, she says, that she had brought him into her speech to the rally in Rome was that she sees some aspects of the Vatican's conservative teaching as underpinning a \"rapid authoritarian escalation\" in Italy. She cites a string of recent incidents in which suspected far-right-wingers have beaten up gay people. \"The discrimination [in Catholic doctrine] against homosexuals - now that really ought to be an offence, especially if it provokes behaviour that is homophobic and violent.\"</p> <p>The row over her speech - and this is why Goldberg picked up on it - goes to the heart of a topical debate. Though issues of faith are becoming increasingly entangled with politics, many people of faith want religious institutions and their leaders to be accorded a special respect that is not conceded to, say, politicians. The prosecutors' application to indict Guzzanti can be seen as an attempt to establish that principle - one she absolutely refuses to honour.</p> <p>\"First of all,\" she says, \"what I was speaking about were the politics of the Pope. It's not as if I'd shot off my mouth on theological issues. It is the Pope who should have respect for our political institutions. At the point at which he gets involved in politics I have every right to criticise him for his political activity. Second, I am not even in agreement with the general principle. I believe that in a democracy there is no right not to be offended. I think that anyone ought to be free to say whatever he or she likes at any moment.</p> <p>\"If someone says things that are offensive, gratuitous and stupid, one has to assume there will be others able to demonstrate that what you said was offensive, gratuitous and stupid.\"</p> <p>For that reason, she is against the limitations on Holocaust denial. And the Danish cartoonists who ridiculed Mohammed? An instant's hesitation, then she says: \"I'm on their side.\"</p> <p>Rather than respect for religion, she says, what is increasingly evident is \"submission, fear\". Pussyfooting around someone else's ideas is tantamount to \"treating him like an idiot who can't bear to hear an opinion different from his own. That is not necessarily respect.\"</p>",
  "<p>There is common sense; and there is good sense. Common sense represents the received wisdom of years and the widespread opinion of the day. It may be rooted in fact, fiction, rumour or reality. On one level it doesn't matter. So long as it is commonly held, then, in essence, common sense becomes a fact of life. </p> <p>Good sense, on the other hand, represents those durable truths and stubborn facts that outlive their unpopularity. The fact that it is right does not necessarily mean that it is not marginal. It persists for the simple reason that prevailing conditions underpin its relevance even when prevailing opinion ignores it. </p> <p>At times the two coincide, at others they collide. At different moments in different places, burning witches, a flat earth, eugenics, slavery, smoking in restaurants and corporal punishment in schools were all common sense. But they were never good sense. </p> <p>\"Common sense is not something rigid and stationary,\" wrote the late Italian Marxist Antonio Gramsci, who crafted the distinction from Mussolini's prison. \"It creates the folklore of the future, a relatively rigidified phase of popular knowledge in a given time and place.\" Good sense, he argued, was often concealed in common sense, but emerged primarily in times of crisis and transformation. </p> <p>We find ourselves in one such crisis now. As markets plunge, banks fail and traders panic, the core principles that have underpinned western economic and political culture for a generation have been thoroughly discredited. Less than a month ago the invulnerability and inviolability of unregulated global capitalism was common sense. The system that leaves half of the world living on less than a dollar a day, with some so impoverished that they are eating mud cakes and selling their children into bondage, was apparently working well. To suggest otherwise was to be dismissed as extreme. </p> <p>But such orthodoxies can collapse even faster than markets. By the end of last week the US treasury secretary Henry Paulson was literally on one knee before Nancy Pelosi, Democratic speaker of the House, begging her to save the bailout deal. Later George W Bush warned of the entire American economy: \"This sucker could go down.\" Suddenly, government intervention in markets, reining in executive pay and placing controls on the flow of capital are good sense. </p> <p>While the gravity of the crisis is clear, the prospects for transformation remain remote. The fact that this meltdown took place during a presidential election should be fortuitous. It ought to provide the two candidates with an opportunity to lay out different visions of how they would tackle the situation at a moment when the nation is intently focused on politics. If ever the country needed leadership, it is right now. And here are two men vying for it. </p> <p>Yet the financial crisis has, for the most part, made the presidential campaign seem less relevant, not more. The credit crunch and the election are taking place as though on a split screen. There is a connection between the two - Barack Obama has bounced back as a result of people's attention being refocused away from lipstick and pigs and back on to their mortgages, retirement accounts and jobs. But it is not a substantive one. For while the crisis has changed the electoral conversation, nobody is seriously looking to this conversation for new ideas, let alone a solution. </p> <p>The notion that there might be alternatives to rapacious capitalism have been all but banished from the public square. That limited discourse leaves us with limited options. Those who claimed that the government was the problem now cast it as not just the ultimate, but the sole solution. Good sense demands a thoroughgoing reappraisal of a system that's in a state of collapse; common sense requires we subsidise it in perpetuity for fear that it breaks down. That sounds like nonsense. </p> <p>\"If you beat your head against the wall,\" Gramsci once wrote, \"it is your head which breaks, and not the wall.\" Right now the American public has a terrible headache. And it doesn't seem as if this presidential race is going to cure it. </p> <p>For this election to make any sense at this juncture it must challenge the assumptions of the past 30 years that have led America to this place. They are assumptions that have been aggressively promoted by the Republicans in general, and George Bush in particular. But to gain traction they had to be first conceded and then embraced by the Democrats. The result is an American self-image rooted in unrivalled military superiority and economic might now stands in stark contradiction to a more tawdry and tattered reality. Add the credit crisis to defeat in Iraq and problems in Afghanistan and what you are left with is a sub-prime nation - overextended both militarily and economically, living large and beyond its means. </p> <p>It will be the task of whoever wins on November 4 to manage America's decline in status and power and a consequent further deterioration in Americans' standard of living. This process will be painful and could be protracted. Little wonder, then, that nobody wants to talk about it. Instead they keep talking of America as the shining city on the hill, without realising that the city they are referring to is bankrupt and the lights are about to be cut off. </p> <p>It was clear from Friday night's debate that neither John McCain nor Obama really know what to do. The little that they will commit to are things they agree on. Both stand at the mercy of events and the market. </p> <p>That does not mean it is irrelevant who wins. The difference between them on this issue may be marginal, but for now they are the margins within which we live, and in which many will have to survive. Back in 1932, in the midst of the Great Depression, many commentators lamented the lack of difference between Herbert Hoover and Franklin Roosevelt. One satirist wrote a searing piece about an imaginary match-up between Franklin Hoover and Herbert Roosevelt. \"Given later developments, the campaign speeches often read like a giant misprint, in which Roosevelt and Hoover speak each other's lines,\" wrote Federal Reserve chair, Marriner Eccles. Whatever slight difference there was rhetorically would prove to make a huge difference in reality during a vital period. It makes as much sense to elect McCain as it would have done to re-elect Hoover. </p> <p>McCain's response to government coffers depleted by the bailout isn't to rescind his tax cut but to freeze spending on everything but defence, veterans and entitlements - a military financial complex. Obama has conceded that his plans to expand access to healthcare, education and to make America energy-independent will have to be trimmed. Finally, the American political class has embraced a redistributive agenda. The trouble is they are about to divert public money from the poor to the bankers and financiers. </p> <p>\"Capitalists can buy themselves out of any crisis, so long as they make the workers pay,\" said Lenin. It is rarely regarded as common sense to quote him in polite company. Yet as a description of what is taking place right now, it is the most sense I've heard in a long time.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:g.younge@theguardian.com\">g.younge@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>President George Bush is due to address the American people this morning to build support in Congress and the public for a deal authorising the government to purchase $700bn troubled debt.</p> <p>Congressional leaders said <a href=\"http://financialservices.house.gov/\">the 106-page bill</a>, reached yesterday after several days of intense bargaining, could be put to a vote in the House of Representatives as early as today. The Senate is expected to schedule a vote on Wednesday.</p> <p>Nancy Pelosi, the house speaker, and other leaders claimed to have made the economic rescue package far more accountable than the plan first put forward by the White House. </p> <p>In a major concession, the bill will set limits on salary packages for Wall Street executives whose companies benefit from the bill. \"The party is over. The era of golden parachutes for high-flying Wall Street operators is over,\" Pelosi told a press conference.</p> <p>The Democrats realise that there is public resentment at the idea of a rescue package for Wall Street, and were at pains to argue yesterday that the bail-out would benefit ordinary Americans.</p> <p>But the bailout passed its first major hurdle last night when the house Republican leadership, which had sunk an earlier rescue plan, gave its support.</p> <p>\"I'm encouraging every member of Congress whose conscience will allow them to support this bill,\" said the house minority leader, John Baehner.</p> <p>The endorsement from Baehner should help ensure passage of the bill with support from a sizeable number of Republicans as well as Democrats.</p> <p>The Democrats have the votes to push the measure through Congress, but that could be political suicide in an election year. It could also undermine economic confidence, Barney Frank, a leading house negotiator for the Democrats, said.</p> <p>The proposal would allow the treasury department to buy up distressed mortgage-backed securities held by financial institutions. The government would later resell the assets after they had recovered much of their value. Pelosi said the treasury would post details of all transactions on the internet within 48 hours.</p> <p>But the potentially toxic nature of the rescue in an election year was underlined by the extreme secrecy surrounding the negotiations and the occasionally stormy exchanges inside. At one point documents were passed around by hand to prevent leaks. Pelosi even confiscated BlackBerries. There were reports of a shouting match on Saturday with the Democratic senator, Max Baucus.</p> <p>In the last fortnight, it has become clear that the rescue is unpopular among ordinary Americans who see it as a handout for Wall Street, and Democrats, as well as Republicans, were nervous yesterday about a payback in the November election. </p> <p>On Saturday George Bush used his weekly radio address to try to reframe the plan as a measure that would benefit all Americans. </p> <p>\"If it were possible to let every irresponsible firm on Wall Street fail without affecting your family, I would do it,\" he said. \"But that is not possible. The failure of the financial system would mean financial hardship for many of you.\"</p> <p>The potential political difficulty of embracing the deal was underlined by the guarded reaction of the two presidential candidates yesterday. </p> <p>\"This is something that all of us will swallow hard and go forward with. The option of doing nothing is simply not an acceptable option,\" John McCain told ABC television.</p> <p>Barack Obama told CBS he wanted to review the language of the deal. But he was inclined to back it because: \"I think Main Street is now at stake.\"</p> <p>Senators also consulted with the billionaire investor Warren Buffett, Kent Conrad, a Democratic senator from North Dakota, told reporters. </p> <p>Buffett warned that if they failed to reach an agreement they risked the \"biggest financial meltdown in American history\", CNN reported yesterday.</p> <p>Under the compromise plan, the treasury would only get an immediate $250bn to buy up troubled securities and other bad debt held by financial institutions.</p> <p>Congress would have to approve further spending and there would be stricter oversight of the programme by four government agencies and an independent Inspector General.</p> <p>The government would also receive an equity stake in some of the companies that seek aid, which could pass on a benefit to taxpayers should the rescue plan work and the companies recover. The deal would also set what were described yesterday as \"reasonable\" limits on severance packages to executives of companies which will benefit from the government plan.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Read the full details of the bail-out bill at <a href=\"http://financialservices.house.gov/\">http://financialservices.house.gov/</a></p>",
  "<p>John Adams worried that future generations would forget him and only Washington, Jefferson and Franklin would be remembered. As I sat at the Emmy awards last Sunday in Los Angeles I hoped, somewhere, that John Adams was smiling. He'd won best actor while those three great men were competing only for the best supporting role. And he would appreciate the irony: an English filmmaker directed his story.</p> <p>Yet, when I arrived at the Emmys two years ago, I had not forgotten John Adams. I didn't know about him. I stepped off the plane to find HBO asking me to direct all seven episodes of John Adams. Nine hours, $100m (\u00a354m).</p> <p>I talked to the writer Joan Didion (Year of Magical Thinking). We were working on a script together set to go into production. Why should I switch?</p> <p>\"John Adams,\" said Joan, \"is tabula rasa for the American people.\" The American Revolution, it turned out, was neglected treasure in terms of popular history and screen storytelling. People tend to date their engagement in American history back to when their families first arrived. As Gore Vidal puts it: \"The United States of Amnesia\". </p> <p>Even during his own lifetime John Adams felt that the process of forgetting had begun. David McCullough, in his Pulitzer-winning biography on which the HBO mini-series is based, quotes Adams late in life mourning that \"the true history of the American Revolution is lost ... forever\". This idea of a lost version began to take hold and fascinate me.</p> <p>When I met Tom Hanks - producer of the mini-series - Tom was fired up with the excitement of discovering this hidden history. At school he remembers being taught about the \"outrage\" of the Boston Massacre (episode 1), when British soldiers occupying the city opened fire unprovoked on a peaceful crowd. </p> <p>It would have \"blown his tiny little mind\", he said, to know that a Boston lawyer defended the British soldiers, that the court found them not guilty, and that the man was Adams, who became the second president of the United States. We were intrigued by the idea that England in John Adams was a near equivalent to superpower America today. The British were an occupying military force in Boston, hated by many of the locals. In turn, the local \"Sons of Liberty\" were distrusted as insurrectionists by the English.</p> <p>McCullough explained deeper layers: Adams joins the revolutionary war fighting not for independence but for his rights as a \"natural born Englishman\" - he doesn't want to be a second-class English citizen. As an English director, I was intrigued to discover that I was tracking the birth of American identity from its English base. John Adams is so fascinating for an English audience because it is the first chapter of our special relationship with the US. </p> <p>It is also an epic of ideas, showing through Adams and Jefferson the two themes of American government. Adams, politicised in Boston, a town of violent unrest, sees what the mob is capable of and is distrustful of human beings - they are \"weak, evil, and vicious\". This leads him to believe in strong government, strong laws, a strong executive. Jefferson, growing up in aristocratic isolation in Virginia, is optimistic about the perfectibility of man and believes in giving power back to the people. These themes of less versus more government, states versus federal power, remain central fault lines in American politics - debate about government intervention in the credit crunch being the latest example. </p> <p>John Adams moves from the east coast of America to pre-revolutionary France to bankers in Amsterdam to the court of George III in London to the newly built White House in Washington. As I directed the wonderful cast through seven epic episodes - John and Abigail Adams, played by Paul Giamatti and Laura Linney, the English actors Tom Wilkinson, Stephen Dillane, Rufus Sewell, Tom Hollander - it was fascinating to see how the revolution was driven by a group of exceptional individuals who were an elite if ever there was one, a group of radical, highly articulate Enlightenment intellectuals. Now the American mainstream uses elite as a dirty word, and can distrust \"intellectual\" leadership.</p> <p>At the same time, the series shows how there was no golden age in American presidential politics. Adams was profoundly anti-slavery, but the slave issue was not resolved. Many historians consider the 1800 election, when Jefferson fought and beat Adams, to be one of the dirtiest in American history. </p> <p>John Adams won 13 Emmys, the highest for a programme in one year. </p> <p>\u00b7 Independence, episode 2 of John Adams, is on More4 on Saturday at 5.30pm.</p>",
  "<p>The focus of the presidential race shifted to the economy yesterday with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/barackobama\">Barack Obama</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/johnmccain\">John McCain</a> claiming credit for bringing greater accountability to the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/wallstreet\">Wall Street bail-out</a>.</p> <p>The test of their commander-in-chief capabilities now behind them after Friday night's foreign policy debate in Oxford, Mississippi, the candidates spent yesterday trying to appeal to working and middle-class voters on the economy.</p> <p>The Obama camp wants to fight the election on the economy, where the Democrats are stronger, rather than issues of national security or culture which play to Republican advantage.</p> <p>Polls suggest that two weeks of turmoil on Wall Street have led to a small shift towards Obama in battleground states.</p> <p>The Democratic candidate tried to build on that advantage yesterday, tapping into public anger over the cost of the rescue package and claiming credit for oversight measures.</p> <p>\"It is an outrage - an outrage - that we are now being forced to clean up their mess. But we have no choice,\" Obama told a rally in Detroit. \"This administration started off by asking for a blank cheque to solve this problem. I said absolutely not. That's why I laid out a few a conditions for Washington when this began.\"</p> <p>Earlier, the Democrat told CBS television he had daily phone conversations with Hank Paulson, the treasury secretary, as well as congressional leaders. Obama also took credit for proposals by fellow Democrats that added protection for families in danger of losing their homes and limited pay packages for Wall Street executives to the plan. </p> <p>\"None of those were in the president's provisions. They are identical to the things I called for,\" he told CBS. \"That I think is an indication of the degree to which when it comes to protecting taxpayers, I was pushing very hard and involved in shaping those provisions.\" He went on to attack McCain, who suspended his campaign last week ostensibly to help steer through a bail-out deal. Asked whether the Republican had been helpful, Obama replied: \"No\".</p> <p>After last week's drama , which saw the deal unravelling with McCain's arrival in Washington on Thursday, the Republican has been on the defensive against charges that he tried to exploit the crisis for political gain. He has also been trying to distance himself from his record in the Senate as a supporter of deregulation of the financial industry.</p> <p>His camp pushed back hard against those charges yesterday, with Senator Lindsey Graham, a Republican from South Carolina, telling Fox TV that McCain had been crucial in engaging House Republicans on the bail-out. \"I think it was decisive in regards to the house getting involved,\" said Graham. </p> <p>McCain, in his TV interview, did not claim credit for the deal. But he denied charges that he was a spoiler, telling ABC television: \"It wasn't because of me that the Republicans in the House of Representatives got into the negotiating and bargaining. They did it themselves.\"</p> <p>In a speech delivered by satellite to a hunters' convention in Ohio, he also turned the tables on the Democrats, accusing Obama of trying to use the credit crisis for political gain.</p> <p>While Obama went back on the campaign trail the morning after Friday's debate, McCain returned to Washington. But the Republican did not go to his office at the Senate, reports said. While other congressional leaders hunkered down for the marathon negotiating session over the Wall Street bail-out, McCain was spotted having dinner with his friend Senator Joe Lieberman. \"I was working on all the other stuff that I was working on and telephoning people,\" he told ABC yesterday.</p> <p>McCain, who is due to return to the campaign trail today, also fended off criticism of his running mate, Sarah Palin. She is regularly lampooned on late-night television for her awkward interviews and insistence that Alaska's proximity to Russia gives her an insight on foreign policy.</p> <p>Palin is due to take on Biden in a debate in St Louis, Missouri, on Thursday night. The match-up has caused trepidation in Republican circles because Biden is seen as the Democrats' authority on foreign policy - Palin's weakest suit.</p> <p>Yesterday, the conservative commentator Kathleen Parker dismissed Palin as \"clearly out of her league\" and called on her to make a graceful exit from the race. \"She can bow out for personal reasons, perhaps because she wants to spend more time with her newborn. No one would criticise a mother who puts her family first,\" Parker wrote in the Washington Post. But McCain remains unfazed. \"They can complain all they want to,\" he told ABC. \"I'm so happy that she is part of the team.\"</p>"

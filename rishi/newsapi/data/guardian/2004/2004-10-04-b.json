  "From the outside, the local community association on the west side of Chicago doesn't look much. The only sign on the shabby one-storey building is a piece of paper stuffed inside a clear plastic jacket on the front door. The building was supposed to be a temporary home but somehow years have gone by and the organisation is still there. <p>The South Austin coalition community council, run for 26 years by Bob Vondrasek, is in one of Chicago's grittiest neighbourhoods. It has taken on slum landlords, insurance companies, utilities firms, the board of education and the big banks over predatory lending policies. In recent months, though, the coalition and other community leaders in the city have confronted an opponent of an altogether different magnitude; Wal-Mart, the biggest company in the world, which is looking to open its first store within the city limits. </p> <p>Its plans have provoked an emotionally charged response from politicians, civic leaders and the church. Supporters argue that local people in the rundown neighbourhoods where it plans to open are in desperate need of cheap goods as well as jobs. Those against protest that Wal-Mart represents the very worst in American business and that it destroys small businesses and pushes down labour standards. The low prices, they argue, come at too high a cost. </p> <p>\"People ask why are we targeting Wal-Mart?\" says Vondrasek. \"The reason is because they are so influential and once you knock out the big bully the others tend to fall in line.\" </p> <p>At the last count, Wal-Mart employed 1.3 million workers in the United States. This month alone, it is opening 12 stores across the country. It also owns businesses in Europe and Japan, including Asda in Britain. </p> <p>Last year it had sales of $256bn, accounting for 2% of US gross domestic product. If it were an independent nation, Wal-Mart would be the eighth biggest trading partner with China. </p> <p>The ramifications of the company's spread have even made the presidential election campaign. John Kerry recently called its health care benefits \"disgraceful\". Consumer advocate Ralph Nader, running an independent campaign for the White House, described it as \"a cancer on the economy\". Vice-president Dick Cheney, however, praised Wal-Mart during a visit to its head office in Bentonville, Arkansas. </p> <p>The Chicago case is not isolated. Local resistance in Inglewood, California, earlier this year prevented Wal-Mart from opening there. Local groups are also preparing for battle in Washington DC as the company looks for its first location in the capital. </p> <p>The argument for Wal-Mart is compellingly simple - it creates jobs and provides low prices to consumers. Its store in Forest Park, just outside Chicago, is selling Wrangler jeans for $14.94 (\u00a38), a flat screen TV for $96.94 (\u00a355) and a microwave oven for $29.87 (\u00a316). Economists believe Wal-Mart has played a significant role in keeping US inflation down. </p> <p>On the west side of Chicago low prices and jobs are both welcome. The predominately black and Hispanic neighbourhood of Austin was once a vibrant manufacturing community but has fallen into decline as the factories have closed and the service industry moved out. The community wrestles with poverty and is rife with drugs and gangs. </p> <p>Wal-Mart had planned for two stores in the city; the other, in the equally rundown south, was blocked. It hired local public relations and legal firms, including the law firm of Michael Daley, the mayor's brother, and won approval for the Austin store only after heated hearings. </p> <p>Alderwoman Emma Mitts was a key supporter. \"All of my community pretty much wanted to have the Wal-Mart,\" she says. \"The low prices are good for my community. They help keep food on the table. Because Chicago is a union town, they say Wal-Mart shouldn't be here. That's what the fight was really about. Well, some job to me is better than no job at all.\" </p> <p>Opponents question the long-term impact of a Wal-Mart store. They quote numerous studies that claim to prove its deleterious effect. A report by the University of Illinois suggests the store on Chicago's west side would create 200 local jobs but lead to the loss of 265 jobs as smaller shops were forced to close. </p> <p>\"Any city that allows a Wal-Mart in under the guise of creating jobs and economic development should be wary,\" says Nik Theodore, director at the university's centre for urban economic development. \"A new store doesn't add new jobs - it is redistributing consumer spend and jobs from other local retailers.\" </p> <p>A recent report from the University of California claimed that the company's employees in the state received an annual $86m in public assistance including public health insurance and subsidised housing because they earned so little. \"We keep telling people, 'You are getting cheap product but you are having to subsidise this enormously profitable company in other ways,\" says James Thindwa at Jobs for Justice in Chicago, a nationwide organisation that campaigns for workers rights. \"There is a disconnect in people's minds.\" </p> <p>The irony that Wal-Mart is building on the site of a closed factory on the west side of Chicago is painfully clear to many local residents. \"Wal-Mart wraps itself in the American flag, but even the flags they sell are made in China,\" Thindwa says. \"It is complex. You look at an area where adults are on the corner unemployed and Wal-Mart is promising jobs. There is an immediacy about it, which is quite compelling until you start getting into the arguments.\" </p> <p>Wal-Mart's response to growing criticism has been a public relations blitz. It has been running advertising campaigns featuring female and ethnic minority workers talking about how great it is to work there. It is sponsoring public radio and set up bursaries for journalists. It has commissioned its own economic studies that claim it benefits the economy. It claimed that if Wal-Mart could take 20% of the market in Los Angeles, it would save shoppers $3.6bn and create 36,400 jobs. It recently announced that senior management bonuses would be tied to achieving certain diversity targets, to ensure the fair promotion of women and minorities. </p> <p>\"There is a lot of disinformation out there,\" says Wal-Mart community affairs manager Mia Masten. \"We offer competitive wages and benefits.\" There was no diktat ordering suppliers to shop for parts overseas - \"our mantra is everyday low prices and to achieve that we just want the best price possible from suppliers\"; the low percentage of workers covered by health benefits is due to the high number of \"seniors and students\" doing part-time work; and people already covered by their partner's health benefits from other companies. </p> <p>Opposition to the company continues to grow, however. The National Trust in the US has put the state of Vermont on its list of most endangered historic places because of plans to build more mammoth stores there. Its president, Richard Moe, says there are \"communities all over America whose downtowns have been devastated by the arrival of big-box retailers\". </p> <p>Campaigners are preparing a national plan to engage Wal-Mart. Community groups in Chicago put together a series of demands to put to the company, including guarantees that it would pay a living wage, not take public subsidy, allow unions and use local contractors to build the store. They had hoped the local council would present them to Wal-Mart before granting approval, but it didn't. The hope now is for ongoing hearings into a similar \"big box ordinance\" that could yet derail Wal-Mart's plans. It would force guarantees from stores over 75,000 square feet including a minimum wage of $10.50 (\u00a36) an hour, $3 (\u00a31.70) an hour in benefits and freedom of speech. </p> <p>\"I think we all feel good that a tremendous amount of awareness has been created about Wal-Mart,\" Vondrasek says. \"We're not telling people not to shop there, but let's push them to be better corporate citizens.\" </p> <p>For every victory, though, there continue to be other defeats. People living in Contra Costa County in the San Francisco Bay area recently voted to repeal a council-passed rule banning the construction of \"big-box\" stores. Wal-Mart is planning to build 40 stores in California. </p> <p>The difficulty unions face is overcoming the short-term fix for poor urban areas that Wal-Mart appears to promise with what is essentially a macro-economic argument. \"Its strategy is to take the path of least resistance,\" Theodore says. \"It targets African-American neighbourhoods. The west side of Chicago has been hard hit by plant closures and you reach a point where you start to take it personally. It's a community that feels the growth elsewhere in the city has passed them by and it's kind of unfair for that community to be told 'no' again.\"</p>",
  "Cobbled and quaint, Louisburg Square perches on fashionable and flush Beacon Hill, home to Boston's elite. In one corner stands a mansion as stately, tall and imposing as its owner, Democratic presidential candidate John Kerry. <p>If you are looking for clues to why Mr Kerry's campaign has struggled and why he should not be counted out yet, there are few better places to start than his own front door. </p> <p>Twice in the last eight years - in his 1996 senatorial bid and last year before the Democratic primaries - he has had to borrow hundreds of thousands of dollars against this prime piece of real estate to inject cash into flagging campaigns. Both times he started as favourite, dropped behind and then clinched victory with a late spurt. </p> <p>Outside the house is a space where a fire hydrant used to be. In 1997, after his wife, Teresa, racked up huge parking fines for blocking the hydrant, they had it moved, prompting citywide fury. </p> <p>\"You're talking about two of the most sensitive issues in the city,\" says Susan Orlean, a New Yorker writer who lives in Boston. \"Parking and anything to do with the fire department, which is revered only second to the church. It could only have been worse if she'd asked a priest to bless it.\" </p> <p>\"The whole incident resonated as a sense of their entitlement and arrogance,\" says Jon Keller, political analyst for the local television station, WB56. \"He's the least liked political figure in the state. Nobody around here has ever warmed up to him.\" </p> <p>President George Bush once said: \"I would say people, if they want to understand me, need to understand Midland [Texas].\" If you want to know Mr Kerry, you need to know Boston. </p> <p>And in the 2,147 miles and huge cultural and political gulf between Boston and Midland lies a large swath of the swing states that will decide which of these two men will have to win if they are going to become president. That is the journey I am making to gauge the mood of Middle America. </p> <p>\"The America I live in is the America of the cities,\" said New York-based intellectual Susan Sontag. \"The rest is just drive through.\" So, with petrol at just over \u00a31 a gallon making front page news, I am driving through. Heading from New England, over the Alleghenies, into the Midwest, around the Ozarks and into the heart of Tex-Mex, in the run up to what pollster John Zogby has termed the Armageddon election: \"Each side predicts the end is near if the other side wins.\" </p> <p>Boston is punctuated with evidence of Kerry's character, caste and past. There are the toilets of the plush Copley Plaza hotel where his grandfather went shortly before lunchtime on November 23 1912 and shot himself in the head after losing his third fortune; the Klivert and Forbes cookie stand in Quincy market, set up by Mr Kerry and his socialite friend, Dun Gifford, using their mothers' maiden names and secret recipes; and the North Station where Mr Kerry joined 100,000 other Bostonians on November 7 1960 to greet John Kennedy as he went to deliver his last speech before the 1960 election. </p> <p>But none of that emotional energy and enthusiasm, with which Boston embraced Kennedy, is evident today. Go to Hope, Arkansas (ancestral home of Bill Clinton) in 1992, or Russell, Kansas, in 1996 where the huge grain silo announced \"Home of Bob Dole\" (the Republican candidate of that year), and you could witness the civic pride borne from a native son who had become a presidential contender. </p> <p>Come to Boston now, however, and you are struck by the blend of ennui and indifference that the local boy is up for the big prize. </p> <p>As a three-term senator who has won the Democratic nomination they clearly respect him. \"He's been elected and then reelected, so he obviously must be doing something right,\" says Mr Keller. \"He's a smart liberal in a state with a lot of smart liberals.\" </p> <p>The trouble is they don't really like him. \"The main thing I like about John Kerry is that he's not George Bush,\" says Jo-Anne Granger, a retired schoolteacher, who lives in the Boston area. \"He hasn't always done things the right way but he's thoughtful and very bright and I was impressed by the things he said when he came back from Vietnam.\" </p> <p>But in a city that is both clannish and clubby, he remains an outsider in almost every sense. This is not entirely his fault. He did not grow up in Boston. Thanks to his diplomat father, he went to private school in Switzerland and then to St Paul's prep school in New Hampshire. </p> <p>In 2001, at a testimonial for the late Congressman Joe Moakley, who represented a tight-knit community in South Boston, Mr Kerry said: \"I felt a pang as I listened to him talk about the lessons learned in that community. Because one of my regrets is that I didn't share that kind of neighbourhood ... We moved around a lot.\" </p> <p>Despite his high birth he did not inherit great means, which placed him outside the Boston upper class crowd. And his senatorial career has been dwarfed by the dynastic reputation and bold style of Edward Kennedy, who has been representing Massachusetts in the senate for more than 40 years. \"It's like living in the shadow of the Hapsburgs in Vienna,\" says Richard Parker, a lecturer in public policy at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government. </p> <p>\"The one thing he did have in his favour was that everyone thought he was Irish,\" says Mr Parker. That was dashed last year when Mr Kerry learned from reporters that his grandfather's real name was Fritz Kohn, an Austrian Jew who changed it to avoid anti-semitism. He picked Kerry by sticking a pin in a map. </p> <p>In the US, this is not necessarily a problem. Mr Bush has refashioned himself from a north eastern blueblood to a Texan everyman. With few established roots, Mr Kerry has also had to craft his own narrative as he goes along. </p> <p>The trouble is that few people in Boston know what he has reinvented himself as, and very few of those who think they do understand actually like it. Mr Bush is a brush cutter; Mr Kerry a windsurfer. A poll this year revealed that while most would rather have Mr Kerry teach their children, they would prefer Mr Bush at their barbecue. In presidential elections, these perceptions count. \"I know those things shouldn't matter, but they really do,\" says Melissa Enright, who lives in the city's Brookline area. \"This is someone you're stuck with for the next four years and you want to feel good about it.\" </p> <p>\"He's not their boy in the way Ted Kennedy is,\" says Ms Orlean. \"Politics here is very in-bred, and he's a solitary figure with the determination of leadership and without any of the human instincts to connect to people.\" </p> <p>Indeed, for the rest of America, Boston, Massachusetts, represents not just a city in a state but a cluster of cultural and political symbols in much the same way as Islington and Hampstead do in Britain. On his first trip to China, former secretary of state James Baker was asked whether he had been to a communist country before. No, he replied, only Massachusetts. </p> <p>This is the stuff of caricature. The last four Massachusetts governors have been Republicans, and the current one, Mitt Romney, is a Mormon. And while Boston may have its fair share of Brahmins, it is primarily a gritty, working class city where African Americans, Hispanics and Asians outnumber whites. </p> <p>But the caricature works. Bush's father pinned the \"Massachusetts liberal\" label on his Democratic challenger, Michael Dukakis, a former governor of the state, in 1988 to great effect. Now his son's team are out to do the same thing. </p> <p>Mr Kerry is used to be being lampooned. Derided as \"gorgeous preppie\" by leftwing cartoonist Doonesbury, he was branded \"a phoney\" by ex-president Richard Nixon on previously classified tapes and taunted as \"Live shot\" around Boston for always hogging the cameras. </p> <p>Back in 1972, shortly after Mr Kerry's anti-Vietnam protests had made him a national figure, such attacks helped to derail his bid to represent the mainly blue collar constituency of Lowell. </p> <p>\"People here saw him as a carpetbagger and an opportunist back then,\" says Kendall Wallace, who covered the campaign for the Lowell Sun at the time. And in troubling echoes of the current race Lowell adds: \"And when he was attacked he didn't fight back.\" Mr Kerry went from a 54% to 21% lead in the polls to defeat. It was the last election he would ever lose. </p> <p>In 1982 he was elected Massachusetts lieutenant governor and in 1984 he entered the Senate. His stiff, aloof manner almost lost him the seat in 1996 against the garrulous blueblood Republican, William Weld, who led Mr Kerry in the polls up to 10 days before voting day. The same thing happened in January, when two weeks before the caucuses in Iowa he was all but written off. \"I'm a good closer,\" says Mr Kerry. </p> <p>The question is: can he do it again? \"A lot of people want to see a pattern here but those cases were very specific,\" says Mr Parker. \"You're left wondering whether this is his eighth life or if he has used up all nine.\" </p> <p>\"People are hard wired differently and John doesn't seem to really focus until the final stages of the campaign,\" says Robert Reich, former secretary of labour in the Clinton administration and a lecturer at Brandeis university, who has known Mr Kerry for 25 years. \"But I don't know that he has been in a race where the opponent will do almost anything and say almost anything to win. The issue now is, when faced with this kind of opponent, how ruthless can Kerry be?\" </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Next stop: Derry, New Hampshire</p>",
  "The United Nations organisers of Afghanistan's first democratic presidential election admitted at the weekend that they expect next Saturday's polling to be be marred by fraud, intimidation and violence. <p>David Avery, chief of operations for the joint electoral management body, predicted that with more than 100,000 staff who had not seen an election before, it \"will not look pretty\".</p> <p>But he insisted that the irregularities would not be enough to deny the election legitimacy, or affect the final outcome.</p> <p>\"Not every box is going to make it? That is probably true. In the end, you count what you have got,\" he said at his headquarters in Kabul, heavily fortified against the threat of attack by the Taliban and al-Qaida.</p> <p>The Taliban have posted \"night letters\" - overnight posters - on mosque and other walls in southern Afghanistan threatening retribution against anyone taking part.</p> <p>Aid and other international organisations have reduced their staff and operations for the election campaign period; the US and other Nato countries have sent in reinforcements, increased patrols and arrested suspects.</p> <p>Although there have been intelligence reports of hundreds of Taliban fighters moving about the country, the election has so far been relatively quiet.</p> <p>The transitional president, Hamid Karzai, who is expected to win, has seldom been seen outside his compound in Kabul since coming under fire on a helicopter trip to Gardez on September 16.</p> <p>The other 17 candidates include warlords with long records of human rights abuses, a solitary woman and a poet. The latter, probably the most liberal, is Latif Pedram.</p> <p>His movements too have been hampered by death threats.</p> <p>\"I can no longer enter Seelo and Baghbal [two Kabul districts] after a warlord delegated 20 men to kill me on sight,\" he said.</p> <p>A kidnapping threat forced him to cut short a visit to his home province.</p> <p>One of his main offences was to advocate that women should enjoy the same right to divorce as men.</p> <p>Another candidate, Professor Satar Sirrat, who is threatening to boycott the election as unconstitutional, accused Mr Karzai of misspending the $3bn donated so far from the international community for reconstruction.</p> <p>\"The only visible project is the road from Kabul to Kandahar,\" he said. \"You could have built a road of silk with this kind of money.\"</p> <p>As well as coping with the Taliban and the warlords, the election organisers have to ensure that 22,000 polling stations are working on the day in a country with little infrastructure and communications: the ballot box at one polling station in the Hindu Kush will take two weeks to deliver to the counting post, by donkey.</p> <p>Mr Avery, an Australian who has been involved in postwar elections in Cambodia, Sierra Leone and East Timor, regards Afghanistan as his toughest yet.</p> <p>He has hired 5,000 mobile phones, 1,150 Russian jeeps, 300 donkeys, and 114,000 local staff. </p> <p>There will be a polling station in every district except Mandol, in Nuristan, which even by Afghan standards is thought extremely dangerous.</p> <p>\"No one goes there. Not even the Taliban,\" Mr Avery said.</p> <p>He has smuggled election material into some of the most hostile areas in the gaudily painted traditional trucks seen all over this part of Asia.</p> <p>Each had a strip painted on the roof so that they could be tracked from the air.</p> <p>The UN estimated that 9.5 million people were eligible to vote, but 10.5 million have registered, suggesting multiple registration.</p> <p>Those voting will have a finger marked in indelible ink to try to prevent a second visit to the polling station.</p> <p>Telibert Luoc, the senior programme officer with the National Democratic Institute, which is responsible for monitoring, has had problems finding international monitors because of the insecurity.</p> <p>He has found only 385, most of them recruited from the embassies.</p> <p>Unusually, there will be no monitors' report.</p> <p>Although concerned about Taliban attacks on election day, Afghans appear intent on enjoying the novelty of voting.</p> <p>Zahal Mahbuby, 20, a social science student sitting in the shade of the campus at the University of Afghanistan in Kabul, said: \"We have a lot of fear the Taliban will attack. We expect them to attack.\"</p> <p>She said she would vote for Mr Karzai because, she said, she regarded him as honest.</p> <p>She is rare in that she does not intend to vote on ethnic lines: a Tajik, she was prepared to vote for a Pashtun.</p> <p>Although it will take two weeks to collect all the ballots, the organisers will count the votes as they come in and they expect that the trend will be obvious within a few days of the election.</p>",
  "Welcome to the Wrap, Guardian Unlimited's round-up of the best of the day's papers. <p><b>TORIES HAVE 'NEVER BEEN IN SUCH DESPAIR'</b></p> <p>The phone calls a convalescing Tony Blair is reported to have made to newspaper editors over the weekend appear to have done the trick. The Blair-Brown rift is off the front pages - with the exception of the FT, which runs a tactful \"Brown leads call for unity\" splash.</p> <p>Mr Blair may have been ailing, but the Tories - if the papers are to be believed - are on their deathbeds. \"The Conservative party is dying. Why would you want to give it the kiss of life?\" Robert Kilroy-Silk, who has now made his ambition to lead Ukip public, said at the Ukip conference over the weekend. \"What we have to do is to kill it and replace it.\" And the papers, it would seem, agree.</p> <p>\"Despite all the bad times the Conservative party has had in the last decade or so, it has never been in such despair as it is today,\" writes Simon Heffer in the Mail. \"Its challenge this week is not to convince anyone that it can win the next election - for that is a pipe dream - but to convince the millions fed up with Tony Blair and Labour that the Tory party can, at last, be an effective opposition.\"</p> <p>The Telegraph is more optimistic, begging the party to bite the bullet and pledge to cut taxes - something the Guardian predicts Michael Howard will do this week, although not as emphatically as the Telegraph would wish. The line, the Tories' co-chairman Liam Fox tells the Guardian, will be similar to Margaret Thatcher's in 1979 - no specific promises, but a \"very clear direction that the government intended to reduce taxes\".</p> <p>The Times' revelation that Michael Howard is even less popular than Iain Duncan Smith was will come as a blow to the party, as will a Populus poll putting Labour on 35% of the vote and the Conservatives seven points behind. There is further embarrassment in the Mirror: \"Nightclub boss Peter Stringfellow delighted a crowd of 200 young Tories when he shouted 'Die, Tony, die!' hours after the prime minister's heart operation,\" splashes the paper.</p> <p>\"Nihil desperandum\", consoles the Telegraph, which says it would be a \"profound error\" for Mr Howard to try to win back Ukip supporters by stealing the party's policies: \"Elections are won on the middle ground, not the extremes\".

  "It must have seemed like a terrific stroke of luck: Dick Cheney, the man who for the past five years had been the chief executive of Halliburton, became the vice-president in 2000. The oil services and engineering company was given a direct line to the White House. <p>But Halliburton's relationship with the Bush administration is beginning to prove more problematic than it is worth. </p> <p>The company admitted 10 days ago that it was considering selling Kellogg Brown &amp; Root (KBR), the division carrying out billions of dollars worth of work for the US government in Iraq, in a desperate attempt to get out of the spotlight. It is considering a sale, spin-off or a separate listing for the business on the stock exchange.</p> <p>The company's shares have fallen from $50 (\u00a328) when Mr Cheney first took office in the White House to the low $30s.</p> <p>Halliburton's business with the federal government has grown considerably since the current administration took office. According to the New York Times, the business went from being the 22nd biggest military contractor in 2000 to the seventh largest in 2003.</p> <p>Prior to the invasion of Iraq, without being asked to tender, Halliburton was handed a contract worth up to $7bn to repair the nation's oilfields. It was also given a contract to provide logistical support to US troops, handling everything from food to transport and laundry services. That deal, awarded under an existing long-term contract to provide emergency services, was worth a potential $13bn.</p> <p>When the first secretive contract came to light, shortly after the March 2003 invasion, Democrats rounded on the company, arguing that it was evidence of an old boy network in the White House. Mr Cheney, who walked away from Halliburton with a $36m package, continued to receive deferred income from the firm.</p> <p>The oilfields contract was eventually put out to tender, with KBR retaining part of the business. The higher profile of Halliburton has ensured that the company has remained on the front pages throughout a series of controversies that might otherwise have gone unreported.</p> <p>This year the firm agreed to pay $7.5m to settle allegations that it failed to disclose a key accounting change in 1998 that allowed it to inflate profits and meet Wall Street targets while Mr Cheney was still in charge. </p> <p>The accounting change, concerning the booking of disputed cost overruns on projects, allowed it to increase its profits by more than $200m. A class action lawsuit brought on behalf of shareholders has accused the firm of systemic accounting fraud - allegations the company denies.</p> <p>Investigations are still under way into claims that a consortium KBR now leads paid bribes to Nigerian officials to secure the contract to build a natural gas plant. The company has admitted uncovering discussions of bribes, though it has no evidence they were actually paid. A treasury department inquiry has also been reopened into dealings the company may have had with Iran.</p> <p>Military officials, meanwhile, have accused KBR of routinely overcharging for work carried out as part of its logistics contract in Iraq and threatened to withhold payment on 15% of bills. </p> <p>A Pentagon auditors' report said the company had failed to account for at least $1.8bn worth of work done. In a little-covered development the defence contract management agency said last month that the company's billing methods were adequate but that had no effect on the other investigations and audits still pending.</p> <p>The Pentagon is now considering breaking the contract up into six pieces and inviting new tenders. Tired of the onslaught of invective, Halliburton has said it is not certain if it will bid for any of the smaller pieces.</p> <p>In a meeting with investors in Houston toward the end of September, Halliburton's chief executive, David Lesar, said the company had become the target of a \"vicious campaign\" of political attacks ahead of the presidential election. The company's workers, he added, \"don't deserve to have their jobs threatened for political gain\". Another reason for wanting to quit Iraq is that 45 of the company's workers have died there.</p> <p>As the presidential election has heated up, so has the temperature surrounding Halliburton. The company has become a useful piece of shorthand for the newly aggressive democratic nominee, John Kerry.</p> <p>He told an audience in Albuquerque on a campaign trip last month: \"Dick Cheney's old company, Halliburton, has profited from the mess in Iraq at the expense of American troops and taxpayers. While Halliburton has been engaging in massive overcharging and wasteful practices under this no-bid contract, Dick Cheney has continued to receive compensation from his former company.\"</p> <p>In last week's presidential debate, the Democratic nominee assailed Halliburton again on national television. He said the administration had deliberately limited overseas participation in Iraqi reconstruction to save the \"spoils of war\" for the company.</p> <p>Mr Cheney, it turns out, may have been of little real help to Halliburton at all: KBR filed for bankruptcy earlier this year, weighed down by asbestos litigation it inherited from an acquisition the vice-president made while he was still running the firm.</p>",

  "If you're interested in who's going to be the next US president then forget the precedents. If history is anything to go by, both John Kerry and George Bush will win. No candidate who lost the popular vote but won the presidency (John Quincy Adams, 1824; Rutherford B Hayes 1876; Benjamin Harrison, 1888; George Bush, 2000) has ever been re-elected. But then no president has failed to be re-elected during a major war. <p>Since 1964, every incumbent with approval ratings below 50% in the spring of the year when they are running for re-election, which would include Bush, has lost. But then every incumbent who has had an approval rating above 50% at this stage, which would include Bush, has won. The truth is that nobody can predict the outcome of the presidential election. The polls are too volatile, the margins too close and the context in which they are being conducted too precarious. Anything from a large mortar attack in Iraq that kills several US soldiers (Iraqi casualties appear to have little impact on US public opinion) to a plant closure in Ohio could tip the balance either way. </p> <p>Kerry has started to bounce back, helped in part by a strong debate performance. But for now, Bush is the narrow favourite. That forces the rest of us to wrestle with the prospect of four more years of the most rightwing administration most can remember. What should the world make of America and Americans if Bush wins? </p> <p>In 2000, such a prospect was unpleasant but far less alarming. If anything, the world was more concerned by his unilateral withdrawal from the global arena (reneging on treaties like Kyoto) than his unilateral intervention into it. Moreover, the manner in which Bush assumed power - selected by judges rather than elected by people - denied him absolute legitimacy in the world's eyes and helped us differentiate him from the people he claimed to represent. </p> <p>This time things are different. Since September 11 2001, Americans have been forced to take a closer look at the world around them. Over the past two years they have seen their government prosecute an illegal war in a nation where they are unwelcome occupiers and flout the will of the UN, and their soldiers torture Iraqis in Abu Ghraib prison. In short, they have seen loathing for their country grow around the globe - even among those they once counted as allies - and more than a thousand of their countrymen killed in combat. If they lost their innocence on September 11 - never a particularly convincing assertion - then they cannot have it back now. </p> <p>If Bush wins fair and square on November 2, then what conclusions can we draw about a nation that consciously decides this is the course it wants to take? We might start by ruling out a few. First, it will not mean that Americans are stupid. They aren't. Compared with the rest of the world, they are pretty well educated and certainly no more stupid than Britons, French or Portuguese were when they had an empire. Nor will it mean they have been duped. They haven't. They have been lied to constantly and their mainstream media has served them poorly, particularly over weapons of mass destruction, the connection between al-Qaida and Saddam Hussein, and the Middle East. </p> <p>But in a nation where the internet is widely available, and films, books and radio stations present other opinions, Americans have had access to a wide range of viewpoints, including Howard Dean and Michael Moore. True, dissident voices have been marginalised. But they have not been extinguished - and, if anything, have grown more mainstream in the past year. So if Americans come away from the plurality of opinions with which they have been presented to back Bush, it will not be because they did not know that other views were out there, but because they chose to believe one set of views over others. </p> <p>The question is, why? Partly because they have not been presented with much of an electoral alternative. The choice, come November 2, is between a man who prosecuted the war and a man who voted for him to do so. Indeed, Kerry's polling numbers have only started climbing since he began putting a distance between himself and Bush on the war, as he did during the debate. </p> <p>The US is not exceptional in this regard. Across the western world people are facing unpalatable electoral choices. In the French presidential election run-off between Chirac and Le Pen, opponents of the incumbent urged voters to support \"the crook, not the fascist\". In Germany, recent regional elections show a huge increase in support for neo-Nazis and former communists, and a slump in backing for the two main parties. In Britain, we have Tony Blair or Michael Howard - two men who supported the war while most of the country did not. But given America's huge military capability and the administration's trigger-happy instincts, the stakes for the rest of the world - even with such a poor choice - are far higher than elsewhere. </p> <p>Then there is fear - Bush's invisible running mate. Republicans have explicitly claimed that the US will get hit again if Kerry wins. \"Weakness invites those who would do us harm,\" says one radio ad, broadcast last week in the swing states. The Democrats are now at it too. In the past few weeks, they have argued that a second Bush term could cause more casualties, another Vietnam in Iraq, a military draft, a secret call-up of reservists and even a nuclear attack against the US. </p> <p>More than anything else, though, a Bush victory would suggest that when given a choice between leading the world through force or through consensus (the notion that America should not lead the world has not arisen), most of those who expressed a preference preferred force. It will indicate a desire to preserve the nation's military, economic and diplomatic hegemony and the cheap oil and protected industries it brings. In short, given a choice between being powerful and being safe, the Americans will have chosen power. They will have decided that global supremacy is more important to them than being either liked or respected. </p> <p>But at the same time, it is important to remember that, given the relatively low turnouts and slim margins, a majority of those who expressed a preference will still be a minority of American people. The Bush agenda has also energised a huge section of the country which opposes him and that is every bit as vocal as those who back him </p> <p>The country is riven on almost every axis possible - between red states (for Bush) and blue states (for Kerry), between the religious and the secular, the metro and the retro. \"Not since the civil war has the country been so divided,\" argues John White, professor of politics at the Catholic University of America. Whether Bush wins or loses, these rifts will endure. America is not just a nation at war with the world; it is a nation at war with itself. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:g.younge@theguardian.com\">g.younge@theguardian.com</a></p>"

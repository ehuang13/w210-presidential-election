  "George Bush stepped into the row over his presidential opponent's war record yesterday, declaring John Kerry had served \"admirably\" in Vietnam and calling for an end to all political attack advertisements sponsored by non-party groups. <p>The president made clear that his appeal included a rightwing group calling itself Swift Boat Veterans for Truth, which has broadcast adverts accusing Senator Kerry of lying about his combat experience and falsifying his medal citations. </p> <p>But the Kerry campaign said the president's intervention fell short of the clear denunciation it had demanded. Democrats said the president's remarks treated the veterans' claims as no worse than other attack ads by supposedly independent groups, questioning the group's source of finance rather than the substance of the ads, which they reject as a smear. </p> <p>Mr Kerry's running mate, John Edwards, said: \"The moment of truth came and went, and the president still couldn't bring himself to do the right thing. Instead of hiding behind a front group, George Bush needs to take responsibility and demand that the ad come off the air.\" </p> <p>At the weekend, Bob Dole, a former senator and Republican presidential candidate, suggested Mr Kerry had escaped the war by securing three Purple Heart medals for \"superficial wounds\". </p> <p>As polls began to suggest that the charges were beginning to damage Mr Kerry's presidential chances, his campaign headquarters hit back, screening an advertisement accusing the Bush campaign of masterminding the veterans' campaign. </p> <p>The Kerry camp also organised for other veterans who had served with him to give their accounts. \"He deserved every one of his medals,\" said Del Sandusky, who piloted Mr Kerry's Swift boat (a 50-foot aluminium patrol craft) for nearly three months in the Mekong delta. </p> <p>Another former navy veteran, Jim Baker, told journalists: \"He was the most aggressive officer in charge of Swift boats.\" </p> <p>Mr Bush was intensively questioned by reporters on the issue as he emerged from a military strategy meeting at his Texas holiday home in Crawford. \"I think Senator Kerry served admirably and he ought to be proud of his record,\" he said. </p> <p>\"But the question is who is best to lead the country in the war on terror?\" </p> <p>He said the real issue at stake was the role of groups who are allowed to spend unlimited sums of money on advertising as long as they do not coordinate their efforts with the political parties. They are known as \"527 groups\", after a loophole clause in the campaign finance laws. </p> <p>Liberal groups were the first to take advantage of the loophole, in an attempt to make up for the Republican party's edge in raising funds. </p> <p>The president challenged Mr Kerry to join him in denouncing all adverts by 527 groups. \"I thought we were going to once and for all get rid of a system where people could just pour tons of money and not be held to account,\" Mr Bush said. </p> <p>Asked specifically if he included the Swift Boat Veterans advertisement in his condemnation, the president replied: \"That means that ad, every other ad.\" </p> <p>The Kerry campaign has taken its claims that the Bush camp is behind the Swift Boat Veterans to the federal election commission, arguing that the Republicans are illegally coordinating the veterans' efforts. It claims that Bush campaign workers were found handing out flyers about the veterans.</p>",
  "North Korea yesterday called President Bush an \"imbecile\" and \"a tyrant that puts Hitler into the shade\" in a stream of insults that seemed to rule out any progress on nuclear disarmament talks before the US presidential elections. <p>\"The meeting of the working group for the six-party talks cannot be opened because the US has become more undisguised in pursuing its hostile policy toward North Korea,\" a foreign ministry spokesman told the state-controlled news agency. </p> <p>New talks are due to be held in Beijing in September or October, as North Korea's neighbours and the US seek to per suade it to stop making nuclear weapons. </p> <p>Yesterday's tirade was apparently set off by a campaign stop remark last week by President Bush, who referred to the North Korean leader, Kim Jong Il, as a \"tyrant\". </p> <p>Pyongyang's diplomatic spokesman called Mr Bush \"an idiot, an ignorant, a tyrant and a man-killer\". </p> <p>He added: \"Bush's assumption of office turned a peaceful world into a pandemonium unprecedented in history as it is plagued with a vicious circle of terrorism and war. The president's aides and allies are \"a typical gang of political gangsters\". </p> <p>John Kerry, the Democrat presidential candidate, has indicated that, if elected president, he would pursue direct bilateral talks with North Korea within the existing six-country framework. He has criticised President Bush for promising to pull out a third of the 36,000 US troops in South Korea without any reciprocal military concession from Pyongyang. </p> <p>\"The North Koreans made it very clear, politely, that they want Kerry to win the election,\" said C Kenneth Quinones, a former US diplomat who was in Pyongyang earlier this month for a Korean studies conference. \"Nobody wants to move. North Koreans are going to play wait and see.\" </p> <p>Mr Quinones, who worked on talks in 1994 that led to a first nuclear control accord with North Korea, added: \"The six-party talks have stabilised the situation. But the process will require the US to sit down with the North Koreans in a smoke-filled room for three months and bring out an agreement.\" </p> <p>In Pyongyang, official irritation with the US has increased with the passage last month by the House of Representatives of the North Korean human rights act, a bill that seeks to support North Korean refugees in China. </p> <p>Increasingly nervous over the defector issue, North Korea has criticised South Korea for taking 460 North Korean refugees to Seoul last month.</p>",
  "<b> Lit crit</b> <br> <b> Gained in translation</b> <br> South of the equator, according to a well-known Brazilian phrase, sin does not exist. But this doesn't mean it can't be imported: one of Latin America's most eminent journalists has accused one of Australia's foremost writers of behaving like \"a rude thief, a colonial predator, a privateer sure of his own impunity\". <p>The allegations about Peter Robb arise from his latest book, A Death in Brazil, published earlier this year to great critical acclaim. The book examines the sleazy 1990-92 administration of Brazilian president Fernando Collor. (The title refers to Collor's roguish money-man, PC Farias, who was mysteriously murdered years later.) Instead of being commended for bringing this corruption to a wide audience, Robb is being cast as a villain. His accuser-in-chief is Mario Sergio Conti, who was editor of Brazil's largest news weekly, Veja, during Collor's 1992 impeachment proceedings. Conti won an international award for his magazine's coverage and wrote the book Noticias do Planalto (News from the Presidential Palace) about the episode. Conti claims that Robb has plagiarised more than a dozen sections of his book, asserting that \"[he has used] systematically, not just the research but also [my] individual mode of expression\". </p> <p>The case is blurred since the sections, while similar, are not identical, and because Robb mentioned Conti's book in his appendix. Conti counters that the mention is inadequate. \"He just copied [my book] because it is written in a language that no one in the rich countries understands.\" </p> <p>Robb isn't talking, but an editor at Bloomsbury, his UK publisher, says she doesn't believe it's plagiarism since Conti's book is listed as a source. She describes Robb's use of the book as \"accepted practice in non-academic non-fiction\". Bloomsbury has nevertheless offered Conti fuller credit in the paperback edition. </p> <p>This is not the first time a well-known English-speaking author has been accused of plagiarising a Brazilian text. Booker winner Yann Martel admitted that Max and the Cats by Moacyr Scliar - about a boy adrift with a panther - was the \"spark of life\" that generated The Life of Pi, about a boy adrift with a tiger. Once Scliar read Martel's book, he decided it wasn't plagiarism. \"It was interesting to see my idea in another way. Up to a point it was an acknowledgment,\" wrote Scliar later. \"But I was disturbed by the controversy - which could have been avoided by a friendliness that is lacking even in the world of literature.\" <br> <b>Alex Bellos</b> </p> <p><b> Innovations</b><br> <b> Thirty miles to the pippin</b><br> Seasoned drinkers have long regarded scrumpy as \"rocket fuel\". One day, if environmentalists in Herefordshire have their way, the humble cider apple may also produce tractor fuel, lorry fuel and even car fuel. </p> <p>There should be no shortage of apples on which to experiment. The 2004 harvest promises to be a bumper one. And, says Katie Eastaugh of the Herefordshire Sustain Project, \"It looks as though there will be about 40,000 tonnes in this county alone that will not be required for the production of cider.\" And something has to be done with them. </p> <p>The Herefordshire Sustain Project is also battling to protect the 14,000 remaining acres of trees within the county's borders. More than 80% of ancient orchards have been lost over the past century, largely because of the introduction of trees and bushes which produce more fruit while occupying less space. </p> <p>A further threat emerged when the old family firm of HP Bulmer, which had strong roots in the area, was taken over last year by the brewing conglomerate Scottish and Newcastle, which has honoured existing contracts with apple-growers but not renewed those that have run their course. \"As contracts come to an end,\" Eastaugh points out, \"more and more orchards become vulnerable. If we don't find a market for them, they'll be grubbed up.\" </p> <p>HSP is convinced that that market can come from fuel. \"Two tonnes of cider apples will provide enough refined alcohol to process one tonne of bio-diesel,\" says Michael Wood, who also works for the Environment Directorate in Hereford. Wood, Eastaugh and colleagues are hoping to set up a small plant to produce ethanol from the fermented juice. \"The processing company will be able to use it instead of methanol, which is from a petro-chemical source,\" Wood explains. \"New legislative directives mean that, by the end of next year, just under 3% of all diesel must be bio-diesel. By 2007 the figure will have to be 6%. Our calculation is that there is enough surplus fruit to satisfy 60% of the demand for bio-diesel in the West Midlands.\" </p> <p>Fuel made from apples is carbon-neutral, he points out. \"It absorbs exactly the same amount of carbon that it releases into the atmosphere.\" It is also around 95% alcohol. Which raises the intriguing possibility of the vehicle rather than the driver being over the limit. <br> <b>Chris Arnot</b> </p> <p><b> Foreign affairs</b><br> <b> All the president's gaffes</b><br> With the current vogue for Bush-bashing, it wouldn't come as much of a surprise if an enterprising group of Democrats got together to build a museum as a testament to Dubya's ineptitude.

Not so, say Counter-Clinton library founders Dick Erickson and John Leboutlier. \"We're just trying to stop Bill and Hillary getting back into the White House,\" adds Leboutlier, a reformer Republican senator from New York. \"[Bill] intends to pull the strings of government with her in office.

  "Lida Rodriguez-Taseff, a corporate lawyer and a former president of the Miami chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union, vividly remembers the moment she became an election reform activist. It was on September 10 2002, when she saw yet another election in south Florida go unfathomably awry - this time a primary election, the first vote in which her county, Miami-Dade, and several neighbouring counties would use electronic voting machines at the polls. <p>\"It was jarring,\" she recalls. The poll workers didn't know how to run the new touch-screen machines. The voters didn't know how to vote on the machines. Some of the systems didn't work at all; they displayed incorrect selections, froze up, acted generally odd. \"What moved me to action was seeing all these people - elderly black folks standing in line for hours without being able to vote, fanning themselves in the hot sun, waiting for the machines to start working so they could get their chance,\" Rodriguez-Taseff says. \"And then, seeing the people coming out of the polls with their eyes dazed over, shocked and amazed by what had happened. They couldn't understand why when they pressed a button next to one candidate, the machine brought up another candidate's name.\" </p> <p>Accounts of the perils of electronic voting systems are nothing new. In the last couple of years, it seems we've all heard stories like Rodriguez-Taseff's - tales of machines breaking down during elections, of systems displaying erroneous selections, of machines behaving badly. When computer security experts have examined some of the voting machines now widely in use, they've discovered enormous security problems. In January, for instance, a team at RABA Technologies, a computer consulting firm in Maryland, managed to devise a half-dozen ways of compromising the votes in touch-screen machines manufactured by Diebold, which produces the systems to be used in Maryland and Georgia this year. (A PDF file of their report can be found <a href=\"http://www.raba.com/press/TA_Report_AccuVote.pdf\">here</a>.) Voter confidence cannot be helped by the suspicion that some voting machine firms have close relationships with certain politicians. Diebold's CEO is famous online for declaring, in his role as a major Bush-Cheney fundraiser, that he's \"committed to helping Ohio deliver its electoral votes to the president next year\". </p> <p>According to the political consulting firm Election Data Services, on election day this year about 29% of the registered voters in the nation - more than 45 million people - will find electronic touch-screen systems at their polling places. To computer scientists, the only way to secure these machines is to have them print out \"verifiable\" paper ballots - a paper ballot that a voter accepts or rejects as his accurate vote, and which is then counted in the case of a contested election. Such a system will only be available this year for the one-half of 1% of voters in Nevada. The rest of us will cast our electronic votes with a kind of leap of faith. We'll have no way of knowing what the machine has actually recorded, and we'll be forced to trust that the system (the officials, the voting company, the procedures, everyone and everything involved in the race) has done everything fairly. We have no choice, really, but to trust the system. </p> <p>Still, two years after witnessing that Florida debacle, Rodriguez-Taseff, who founded and now heads the Miami-Dade Reform Coalition, a non-partisan citizen's group dedicated to fixing elections in a county where elections seem eternally unfixable, remains deeply worried about the electronic systems that will be used at her polls this year. But she says that it's too late, too costly and probably not even technically feasible to configure voting machines to print the kind of verifiable ballots that computer scientists have called for, at least for this election. That kind of system, untested and unproven in any real race, \"lives in outer space\", Rodriguez-Taseff says bluntly. </p> <p>Rodriguez-Taseff chief worries surround the far more pragmatic issues of voting procedures and voting practices we'll have to deal with in electronic polling places this year. She fears that polls won't open on time, and that voters won't know how to use the machines, and that officials won't know how to help voters when the machines (inevitably) screw up. She's also concerned that, in the event of irregularities, elections laws in Florida won't allow a thorough examination of the machines to see what's gone wrong. The machines in her state are capable of printing out paper \"ballot images\" of each vote after the election; these ballot images aren't quite the same thing as the voter-verified paper trail that computer scientists have been calling for, but they would constitute some kind of paper record of every voter's choices, and Rodriguez-Taseff believes they could prove useful if there are questions about an election's accuracy. Florida's election rules, however, specifically prohibit manually recounting these ballot images, a situation that Rodriguez-Taseff says will cast even more doubt on election results. </p> <p>She is also concerned that voters who've heard about the problems with electronic voting machines will disenfranchise themselves. In a recent poll of Florida voters conducted by Quinnipiac University, more than half of the people surveyed reported being less than fully confident that their votes would be counted at all during the upcoming election. The numbers were higher when broken out for minorities and Democrats in the state. About 16% of those surveyed said they planned to vote by absentee ballot, and half of them said they were choosing the absentee route because they didn't trust the voting machines. </p> <p>Rodriguez-Taseff blames political parties - specifically Democrats trying to court minority voters in Florida - for this scepticism. She says the parties aren't doing enough to educate voters about what they'll see at the polls this year. Instead of being honest with voters about both the advantages and disadvantages of electronic voting, politicians are trying to paper over the problems, or to urge a quick-fix - not especially good - alternative: absentee voting. </p> <p>But other voting experts charge that it's not the Democrats' or the Republicans' fault that people don't trust the election system - it is, instead, the fault of activists who've been constantly criticising the voting machines for the past two years. \"The conversation the way they've been framing it is all going to make people believe that they shouldn't vote,\" says Ted Selker, a professor at MIT who co-directs the Caltech/MIT Voting Technology Project, which produced a landmark study examining how voting technology performed in the 2000 election. He says that electronic voting critics have forced the electorate to become much more cynical and jaded about elections and especially about the integrity of elections officials. </p> <p>And in an election this tight, is such scepticism something that political parties - especially Democrats - want or need? Most touch-screen machines in south Florida were introduced, after all, by Democratic officials who were horrified at the rate of disenfranchisement of minorities in the 2000 presidential vote; the machines were supposed to make voters come back to the polls, not keep them away. Clearly, though, either the machines, or the controversy surrounding the machines, is making people scared. </p> <p>What if all the activism only succeeds in keeping people away from the polls on election day? Just a few weeks after Florida's 2002 primary, when Salon first reported on the flawed machines and on some computer experts' concerns about the security and accuracy of electronic voting systems, just about everyone we spoke to in the election community told us not to worry. What happened in Florida's primary was caused by ill-prepared poll workers, not buggy machines, elections officials and voting companies said, and they maintained (and still maintain) that no votes were lost. It was said that computer scientists who fretted about electronic voting machines that aren't backed up by a \"paper trail\" were naive, and they didn't understand the rigorous security procedures that occur in real elections; people who suggested that we shouldn't trust our democracy to private firms were scoffed at, labelled conspiracy theorists. </p> <p>Over the course of a couple of years, though, calls by elections officials and voting companies for us to remain unworried became almost comically blind to the problems at hand. There have been enough voting machine failures, scandals and expos\u00e9s in that time to make any concerned citizen weep. These days, nobody can seriously call the critics of such systems naive conspiracy theorists. Thanks to their efforts, we now know that at voting firms such as Diebold, employees don't seem to take security very seriously, as internal documents from the firm seem to suggest; that executives at some companies have suspiciously close relationships with elected officials; and that, despite assurances from elections officials, when you vote on an electronic machine, you might never know what the system has done with your choice. </p> <p>No longer are the activists considered kooks and paranoids, and their fears, backed up by numerous studies pointing out flaws in some electronic voting machines, have thoroughly permeated the mainstream media. Magazines as diverse as the Nation, Vanity Fair and Hustler have devoted considerable space to the issue. In January, the New York Times inaugurated a special editorial page section aimed at Making Votes Count, and Paul Krugman routinely uses his column to warn of the dangers of paperless electronic voting. When Rodriguez-Taseff's Miami-Dade Reform Coalition recently discovered that the county had lost all of its electronic records from the 2002 election, the news didn't break online, in a techie blog or underground discussion site, as it might have a year or two ago. Instead, the story landed on the front page of the Times. </p> <p>The coverage has certainly helped convince the public, as well as elections officials, of the dangers of electronic systems. Officials in California, for instance, have mandated that electronic systems include verifiable paper ballots by 2006, and Congress is mulling over legislation to require such machines nationally. David Dill, the Stanford computer scientist who's done much to line up technologists against paperless electronic voting systems, says that he's exceedingly pleased with what critics of electronic voting machines have accomplished so far. When, in early 2003, Dill began asking computer scientists to sign a petition calling for verifiable voting systems - that is, systems that produce some kind of human-readable physical evidence of a person's vote - he didn't think he'd be able to convince entire states to change their rules. </p> <p>But, in the face of so much anti-e-voting rhetoric, are voters becoming unreasonably scared or suspicious of elections? They might be. While it's undeniable that Dill and other critics of electronic voting systems have sparked much-needed discussion and action to fix some of the glaring problems with electronic machines, experts like Selker worry the hype is unnecessarily scaring voters. Selker points out that in 2000, most of the votes that were lost because of equipment malfunction were caused by faulty ballot design (remember the \"butterfly ballot\"?), not faulty machines, and that by far the largest number of votes (several million) lost could be blamed on bad voter registration procedures. These problems should be fixed before we spend money on paper trails for touch-screen machines, Selker says. </p> <p>While he understands people's trepidation about voting on a system that doesn't have a paper trail, Selker insists that rigorous testing can detect malicious code in paperless voting systems. He recommends, for instance, that elections officials conduct \"parallel testing\" on voting machines - on election day, they would randomly visit precincts and pull certain machines out of service for the day, then subject those machines to a battery of tests. If those randomly selected machines are found to record and tabulate votes accurately, you can be reasonably sure that the other machines are doing the same thing. (Officials in California are expected to conduct parallel testing on election day, as will some officials in electronic voting counties scattered all over the nation. In Maryland, where the choice to go to Diebold machines has sparked several security reviews and a lawsuit calling on a court to prevent the state from using the system, officials are considering using the parallel testing, said Linda Lamone, the administrator of Maryland's board of elections.) With such measures in place, Selker says, people can be confident that the electronic machines are working properly. \"It'd be terrible if the reason we didn't have a great election is because Americans acted like voters in a third world country\" and didn't trust what happened at the polling place, he says. </p> <p>David Dill, for his part, insists that it was never his intention to cause people to stay away from the polls, and he says he always tries to let people know that the problems with voting machines are no excuse not to vote. \"People have to vote,\" he says. \"I'm not sure how to get that message across. I wouldn't be going to all this trouble to make sure we have a trustworthy election system if I didn't respect the importance of voting.\" He also emphasises that \"we're not talking about a proven conspiracy to steal the election with electronic voting. I'm sure that there'll be some people saying such things, but what I've been saying all along is we should pick the best technology we have available and use that\". </p> <p>There is something of an inconsistency to what Dill says, however. On the one hand, he's insisting that elections can't be trusted unless they're conducted on equipment that produces some kind of verifiable paper trail. At the same time, he's telling voters that they should probably go ahead and vote on machines that don't produce such a trail, machines that he says can't be trusted. Now, most people will probably disregard this inconsistency and, even if they agree with Dill that the machines are flawed, they'll still go ahead and vote. As Dill says, this year's election is far too important to miss out on. But there are probably a fair number of people who are on the fence about voting to begin with - young people, say, or certain minorities, or members of other groups that tend to vote in low numbers, possibly because they don't think voting will make any real difference to their lives. Dill's suggestion that the voting system is not trustworthy just adds another reason for them to doubt the importance of voting - and for how many people will it be the deciding factor, the final straw keeping them home on election day? </p> <p>Some Democrats are, understandably, nervous about this idea. Dill says that he's heard from party officials who tell him privately that they support him, but that they couldn't support the cause publicly for fear that it will turn voters away. In Florida, the party is giving voters mixed signals about what they should do. It won't say that the machines are buggy, or that people shouldn't trust them. Yet it has also supported a call for a paper trail. When asked about the party's position, Allie Merzer, a spokeswoman for the Florida Democratic party, says, \"We advocate for any system that increases voter confidence. All voters should have the right to have their vote counted.\" Merzer says that \"in some instances\" people have \"valid\" concerns about electronic voting machines. People who are concerned should vote using other methods, she suggests - absentee ballots or early voting. In light of people's concerns, the party is \"ramping up\" its effort to sign people up for absentee ballots, Merzer says. </p> <p>\"Stupid Democrats - with Democrats as dumb as this who needs Republicans?\" counters Lida Rodriguez-Taseff. \"They're running around afraid of their own shadows, not talking about the problems with the voting machines, thinking they can lie and manipulate the African-American community into voting for them.\" </p> <p>Instead of being mealy-mouthed about the situation, Rodriguez-Taseff would like the Democrats to directly acknowledge and make clear to voters the problems associated with electronic machines. Only when it does this will the party be able to fix the problems, she says. And she thinks that a direct approach will bring more voters to the polls: \"They should reach deep into the history of this situation,\" she says. \"They really should be saying, 'Look, the lynch mob didn't scare you away from voting. Poll taxes didn't scare you away. Literacy tests didn't scare you away. Are you going to let a little voting machine scare you away?' Voting is a sign of defiance and courage. Voting at a voting machine even when the voting machine doesn't work is a sign of courage. But instead, they're choosing to lie to people. 'No, the lynch mob is not outside.' 'Oh yeah, your vote will be counted - just vote for us.' People aren't stupid. And that's why people aren't going to go to the polls, because they're being lied to.\" </p> <p>Rodriguez-Taseff also takes issue with the Democrats' suggestion that people should vote using absentee ballots instead of going to the polls. Absentee ballots are not known to be any safer than electronic voting systems. Yes, there's a paper ballot - but it can easily be thrown away, lost, misfiled, damaged, never counted, or be subjected to any number of other harms, whether intentional or accidental. Of course, there are security precautions to prevent these things; but if you're the sort of person who is wary about the security precautions meant to prevent electronic vote fraud, why wouldn't you be similarly wary of the precautions meant to prevent absentee-ballot vote fraud? </p> <p>Rodriguez-Taseff says that she doesn't intend to vote absentee. With all that can go wrong with such a ballot, she'd prefer to take her chances with the computer. Ted Selker of MIT says the same thing. Indeed, Selker recounts a time he witnessed an incident of absentee ballot tampering in his own voting precinct in Massachusetts. After he cast his vote on one election day, he noticed a woman (probably an elections official or poll worker) sitting to the side, looking over a stack of ballots. He asked her what she was doing. \"I'm checking the absentee ballots,\" the woman said, explaining that she was making sure that they were in good enough condition to be filed into the ballot reader. Selker asked her if she'd found any problems. \"So she tells me, 'One of them couldn't be read, so I looked at it and I found a mark that wasn't right and I erased it,'\" Selker says. \"So you see, she changed somebody's ballot without anyone else's permission, on her own. And she admitted it to me. That's what I think about absentee ballots.\"</p> <p>David Dill's home precinct in California uses a paper-based optical scan voting system, not an electronic touch-screen. If it did use a touch-screen, would he vote absentee? Dill is aware of the problems with absentee ballots, and choosing between absentee voting and paperless touch-screen voting would be especially difficult, he says. In the end, though, Dill says that he would probably take his chances with the absentee ballot. Rebecca Mercuri, the computer scientist who first developed the idea of a verified paper ballot and is quite sceptical of any machines that lack such a system, says that she, too, would vote absentee instead of on a touch-screen. </p> <p>One of the few political groups that seems to have no deep division or concern about how people should vote in the upcoming election is the Republican party. At both national and local levels, the GOP is consistent about what people should do - they should go to the polls and vote, and they should trust their touch-screens. It is true that in July, the Florida Republicans sent some voters a flier urging them to register for absentee ballots. \"The liberal Democrats have already begun their attacks and the new electronic voting machines do not have a paper ballot to verify your vote in case of a recount,\" said the flier, which featured a picture of President Bush. \"Make sure your vote counts. Order your absentee ballot today.\" But the party immediately repudiated that message. Everything else that Republican officials - including Florida Governor Jeb Bush and Glenda Hood, the Republican secretary of state - have said indicates a deep trust in the elections systems as they are. </p> <p>\"That flier most definitely caused confusion,\" says Joseph Agostini, a spokesman for the Republican party of Florida. He says that the person responsible for that confusion has \"learned the hard way\" what the Florida Republicans actually think about electronic voting. \"It's something we regret that went out, and we've taken steps to make sure that this misunderstanding doesn't occur again,\" Agostini says. \"Let me say without any uncertainty that we the Republican party have complete confidence in the Florida election system and its accuracy. Whether it's opti-scan or touch-screen by Diebold, we have no doubts that the election will run smoothly.\" </p> <p>If you're concerned with the security of electronic voting systems but you decide to vote on such a machine anyway, you can perhaps rest a bit easier this year, as the controversy surrounding the machines has already led to many extra security safeguards protecting the systems. In large part due to the activists' complaints over the lack of a paper trail, some of the most ill-regarded machines and manufacturers have been subjected to punishing scrutiny. Diebold's machines, for instance, have been thoroughly inspected by several computer researchers, and while many of the researchers found significant problems with the machines, it is at least comforting to know that elections officials and the company made some improvements to the systems. In Maryland, for example, the state and Diebold have implemented many of the safeguards proposed by RABA, a computer firm that found significant vulnerabilities in the Diebold system earlier this year. Lamone says that while she has not enjoyed being the subject of intense criticism over her decision to use Diebold's machines, \"I like the opportunity to make things better.\" </p> <p>Facing similar pressures from critics of electronic voting systems, Nevada secretary of state Dean Heller decided last December to make his state the first in the nation to use paper-equipped touch-screen systems. The machines he chose are manufactured by Sequoia Voting Systems, and for the most part they work exactly how proponents of such systems have said all touch-screen systems should work: when a voter steps up to the system and casts a ballot on the touch-screen machine, a printer attached to the machine produces a ballot for the voter to review. (The ballot is printed under a glass screen in order to prevent the voter from walking off with it.) After the voter reviews this paper ballot, he or she can either accept or reject it on the touch-screen; either way, the ballot scrolls away into a locked compartment, and it's then considered the voter's official ballot, trumping whatever electronic ballot the touch-screen machine has stored. In the event that a recount is needed, the paper ballot tape would be counted by hand, and that count would become the ultimate election result, according to Alfie Charles, a spokesman for Sequoia. </p> <p>David Dill and Rebecca Mercuri say they're hopeful that the Nevada test will go well, but both say they think there'll probably be some mishaps in the state, as there always are in such things. \"I do not want the future of the paper-trail movement to be judged on how the machines do in Nevada,\" Dill says, though he concedes that this will probably happen. If the election in Nevada goes badly, people on the other side of the paper-trail debate will surely point to the race as proof that paper-trail systems can't work. </p> <p>And, who knows, maybe they'd be right. Indeed, Mercuri says that she's been thinking for some time that even electronic machines equipped with a paper trail \"are probably not the best way to vote,\" because \"the touch-screen puts something between the voter and the actual construction of their ballots\". For most able-bodied voters, both Mercuri and Dill say, fill-in-the-bubble optical-scan paper ballots are probably the best way to vote. </p> <p>Many groups and both political parties plan to monitor polling places this year, and, given the scrutiny they'll face, you can be sure that any irregularity, no matter how small, will be taken very seriously by officials. Verified Voting, David Dill's group, is calling for technically inclined people to volunteer to monitor precincts across the nation. Verified Voting is also creating a web-based national error-reporting system, a central clearinghouse for people to report everything that goes wrong on election day; this will allow the group to spot when similar problems occur in different locations, say, or to keep track of a specific sort of glitch, giving activists a fuller picture of what happens on election day. </p> <p>In Maryland, Linda Schade, the activist who has sued the state to prevent the Diebold machines from being used in November, says that in the event her suit is unsuccessful, she and her fellow Diebold critics will closely scrutinise what happens on November 2. \"I want to have a handful of people at every precinct dedicated to helping people, making sure they know what's going on, that all races are on the ballots, that voters go in with the information they need, and that there are people on hand when there are problems,\" she says. </p> <p>Schade says she hopes everything goes well. But what if it doesn't? What if, for example, there's an unexpected result - what if Maryland, which looks sure to choose Kerry, goes for Bush? Will anyone trust the machines? </p> <p>In the end, that's the only real test of a voting system. Do people believe what it says, even when what it says seems unbelievable? \"If we wake up the next day and Maryland has gone for Bush ... \" Schade says, and her voice trails off. There's nothing more to say. The truth is, nobody really knows what will happen then. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Farhad Manjoo is a staff writer for Salon Technology &amp; Business.</p> <p>This article has been provided by Salon through a special arrangement with Guardian Newspapers Limited.<br> \u00a9 Salon.com 2004<br> Visit the Salon site at <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/\">salon.com</a></p>",
  "<p>A couple of weeks ago I posted a <a href=\"http://blogs.theguardian.com/games/archives/mobile/2004/07/mobile_gaming_gets_political.html#more\">story</a> about the faintly satirical mobile game Bush vs Kerry Boxing, currently available over in the States. The game cashes in on the short development times and high concept-driven nature of mobile titles to get a few laughs out of the US election battle, and I wondered if we'd see any similar titles over in the UK. Well, developer Mobobo has just announced Big Boss Bash, a very simple puzzler where you lob water balloons at a series of world leaders including Tony Blair and George Bush. It works like a cross between Breakout and Bust-A-Move: you have to get the trajectory and power of your shot just right to make the balloon bounce around the obstacles and finally smack the offending caricature.</p> <p> </p> <p>It's highly amusing and works as a quick puzzle game. But it's hardly biting satire. We'd like to see something with sharper teeth, a mobile game that takes a currently popular title or genre and subverts it for genuine topical effect. Something along the lines of:</p> <p><strong>Tony Blair's Underhand</strong> It's the ultimate skating (the issues) sim! Pull a series of neat tricks to extricate yourself from blame on the gnarly Hutton Report level. Then attempt the ultimate special move \u2013 taming the awesome Butler Enquiry!</p> <p><strong>The Price of Persia: Sands of Crime</strong> Our athletic presidential hero must twist and turn through a gigantic moral maze as he attempts to seize control of the mysterious gulf and its magical treasure: black gold!</p> <p><strong>Conflict: Vietnam Record</strong> As a Democratic hopeful you must dodge bullets of doubt and missiles of accusation as you attempt to exploit your military past in this tense elect-'em-up.

  "<p>Fahrenheit 9/11 is astounding. Not so much as a film - although it is cunning and moving - but as an event. Most commentators try to dismiss the event and disparage the film. We will see why later. </p> <p>The artists on the Cannes film festival jury apparently voted unanimously to award Michael Moore's film the Palme d'Or. Since then it has touched many millions across the world. In the US, its box-office takings for the first six weeks amounted to more than $100m, which is, astoundingly, about half of what Harry Potter made during a comparable period. Only the so-called opinion-makers in the media appear to have been put out by it. </p> <p>The film, considered as a political act, may be a historical landmark. Yet to have a sense of this, a certain perspective for the future is required. Living only close-up to the latest news, as most opinion-makers do, reduces one's perspectives. The film is trying to make a small contribution towards the changing of world history. It is a work inspired by hope. </p> <p>What makes it an event is the fact that it is an effective and independent intervention into immediate world politics. Today it is rare for an artist to succeed in making such an intervention, and in interrupting the prepared, prevaricating statements of politicians. Its immediate aim is to make it less likely that President Bush will be re-elected next November. </p> <p>To denigrate this as propaganda is either naive or perverse, forgetting (deliberately?) what the last century taught us. Propaganda requires a permanent network of communication so that it can systematically stifle reflection with emotive or utopian slogans. Its pace is usually fast. Propaganda invariably serves the long-term interests of some elite. </p> <p>This single maverick movie is often reflectively slow and is not afraid of silence. It appeals to people to think for themselves and make connections. And it identifies with, and pleads for, those who are normally unlistened to. Making a strong case is not the same thing as saturating with propaganda. Fox TV does the latter; Michael Moore the former. </p> <p>Ever since the Greek tragedies, artists have, from time to time, asked themselves how they might influence ongoing political events. It's a tricky question because two very different types of power are involved. Many theories of aesthetics and ethics revolve round this question. For those living under political tyrannies, art has frequently been a form of hidden resistance, and tyrants habitually look for ways to control art. All this, however, is in general terms and over a large terrain. Fahrenheit 9/11 is something different. It has succeeded in intervening in a political programme on the programme's own ground. </p> <p>For this to happen a convergence of factors were needed. The Cannes award and the misjudged attempt to prevent the film being distributed played a significant part in creating the event. </p> <p>To point this out in no way implies that the film as such doesn't deserve the attention it is receiving. It's simply to remind ourselves that within the realm of the mass media, a breakthrough (a smashing down of the daily wall of lies and half-truths) is bound to be rare. And it is this rarity which has made the film exemplary. It is setting an example to millions - as if they'd been waiting for it. </p> <p>The film proposes that the White House and Pentagon were taken over in the first year of the millennium by a gang of thugs so that US power should henceforth serve the global interests of the corporations: a stark scenario which is closer to the truth than most nuanced editorials. Yet more important than the scenario is the way the movie speaks out. It demonstrates that - despite all the manipulative power of communications experts, lying presidential speeches and vapid press conferences - a single independent voice, pointing out certain home truths which countless Americans are already discovering for themselves, can break through the conspiracy of silence, the atmosphere of fear and the solitude of feeling politically impotent. </p> <p>It's a movie that speaks of obstinate faraway desires in a period of disillusion. A movie that tells jokes while the band plays the apocalypse. A movie in which millions of Americans recognise themselves and the precise ways in which they are being cheated. A movie about surprises, mostly bad but some good, being discussed together. Fahrenheit 9/11 reminds the spectator that when courage is shared one can fight against the odds. </p> <p>In more than a thousand cinemas across the country, Michael Moore becomes with this film a people's tribune. And what do we see? Bush is visibly a political cretin, as ignorant of the world as he is indifferent to it; while the tribune, informed by popular experience, acquires political credibility, not as a politician himself, but as the voice of the anger of a multitude and its will to resist. </p> <p>There is something else which is astounding. The aim of Fahrenheit 9/11 is to stop Bush fixing the next election as he fixed the last. Its focus is on the totally unjustified war in Iraq. Yet its conclusion is larger than either of these issues. It declares that a political economy which creates colossally increasing wealth surrounded by disastrously increasing poverty, needs - in order to survive - a continual war with some invented foreign enemy to maintain its own internal order and security. It requires ceaseless war. </p> <p>Thus, 15 years after the fall of communism, a decade after the declared end of history, one of the main theses of Marx's interpretation of history again becomes a debating point and a possible explanation of the catastrophes being lived. </p> <p>It is always the poor who make the most sacrifices, Fahrenheit 9/11 announces quietly during its last minutes. For how much longer? </p> <p>There is no future for any civilisation anywhere in the world today which ignores this question. And this is why the film was made and became what it became. It's a film that deeply wants America to survive. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> John Berger is a novelist and critic</p>"

  "An informal poll of Guardian Unlimited users shows huge support for the Democratic presidential nominee, John Kerry, but considerable pessimism over his chances of entering the White House in November's election. <p>With George Bush riding high in the opinion polls after last week's Republican national convention in New York, a growing uncertainty over the Kerry campaign is reflected in our self-selecting internet survey, with nearly 40% of users conceding that Mr Bush's end-of-convention speech was likely to bring wavering voters out in support of the Republicans. </p> <p>While an overwhelming 78% of respondents would like to see Mr Kerry become America's 44th president, only 64% believe he actually will do so.</p> <p>The findings came after we asked Guardian Unlimited users around the world to participate in a \"world college\" to provide a snapshot of your views on the US elections. </p> <p>Only 6% of the 1,000 users who took part in our online survey admitted supporting, or having voted for, Mr Bush, while a sizeable 16% said their preferred candidate in the 2000 election was the independent Ralph Nader. </p> <p>Mr Nader, a radical leftwinger by US standards, was blamed by many for undermining Al Gore's presidential bid in 2000 by splitting the liberal vote. Fear of this happening again seems to have had an effect: fewer users say they would support Mr Nader this time round.</p> <p>A more detailed breakdown of the vote reveals some interesting trends among our users. Half of the respondents lived in the US, and showed themselves to be considerably more optimistic about Mr Kerry's chances than those from the rest of the world, with 71% of US users doubting the efficacy of Mr Bush's speech and the same number expressing a belief that Mr Kerry would make it to the White House. </p> <p>Non-US respondents were more circumspect, with only 54% believing that Mr Kerry would win the election, despite 75% wanting him to.</p> <p>In gender terms, both sexes were strongly supportive of the Democratic candidate. However, male respondents tended to be more pessimistic, with 75% of women anticipating a Kerry victory compared with 59% of men.</p> <p>Women were less likely to vote for other candidates, too, with Mr Nader more than twice as popular among men than women.</p> <p>The poll also dispels the myth of optimistic youth. Support for Mr Kerry was consistently high - more than 75% - across the ages, but whereas that support translated directly into electoral optimism among the older voters, the under-35s were almost evenly split on whether Mr Bush would be ousted from the White House.</p> <p>But while the younger respondents may not be hopeful of Mr Kerry beating Mr Bush, they are certainly more idealistic, with the highest percentage of Nader votes (20%) coming from the 18-24 age group.</p> <p>Of course, our poll is neither comprehensive nor statistically significant as it was compiled by canvassing the views of visitors to Guardian Unlimited who chose to answer the questions. However, the scepticism it indicates among Mr Kerry's supporters about his chances of success does mirror the findings of two recent polls carried out in the US. Surveys carried out for Time and Newsweek show the Democratic candidate trailing 11 points behind Mr Bush, the largest poll deficit yet in what has so far been a neck-and-neck race.</p> <p>Having established that there is a problem, the next question is what Mr Kerry should do to reinvigorate his campaign. And that's what we're asking you in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uselections2004/worldcollege/poll/0,15002,-137,00.html\">the next Guardian Unlimited world college poll</a>. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Click <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uselections2004/worldcollege/results/0,15003,1296810,00.html\">here</a> for the full results of the Guardian Unlimited world college poll.

  "<b>Rachel Valladores, Democrats Abroad</b> <br> The campaign's not dead yet, folks. I know the media is going on and on in this campaign because of the polling right now which has Bush ahead by about 10 points. [But] we are not lying down and dying yet - far from it, actually. <p>I was on the BBC World Service this morning with John Zogby, who is one of the great American pollsters, and John's point of view on it is that this bounce is a temporary thing - this is the convention bounce, and there's still going to be one heck of a pitched battle. </p> <p>To me that was pretty obvious when I read in the Washington Post this morning that we had changed the entirety of the campaign staff around. Clinton decided to tell Kerry what to do about his staff, and ... they've moved John Sasso out of the Democratic National Committee and put him on the aeroplane, which means things are going to work very differently now. </p> <p>The mood of this campaign is really going to be markedly different. Reorganisation is a normal thing at this point in the campaign because we are changing phases, which means different stage management, different directions, and that's a good thing. It's going to be a meaner and leaner campaign. We have already seen that our hope is still the great message of this campaign - that was the message that came out of the convention. We spent a lot of time talking about hope being around the corner.</p> <p>Kerry is a strong finisher, so we are not giving up hope yet. To me it's really important to stress the fact that this is not an election that is going to be won or lost only on international issues. They are important - particularly Iraq and oil and the war on terror - but the truth of the matter is that the economy, which drives all those other things, is what is going to finally drive this. What's left right now is the swing voters, the voters who are going to worry about what's gonna happen to them; they don't really care what happens to other people.</p> <p><b>Clive Soley MP</b><br> There is an interest for us in what the US does, and that is for the US to be a team player, and that is what it is not likely to be under George Bush and the Republicans as they are at present. Let me say that since he first emerged on the scene, Kerry has struck me as being strong in personality and being strong in policies, so I have a positive approach to it. People ought to vote for him because he comes over as a good guy with also the right sort of policies and saying the right sort of things for today's world. It's a positive message. I don't think the Democrats could come up with someone better.</p> <p>His problem is partly about the economy. People tend to turn to rightwing parties when the economy gets a little bit rocky. Leftwing parties do best when things are getting better, which is why Kerry is having a bit of a problem with that issue. </p> <p>Kerry and the Democrats winning is very important to the rest of the world because the US, being the sole remaining superpower, does need to be on board on a lot of issues. The two most important challenges facing this planet in the 21st century are global warming and failing states. The two will dominate the politics, and economics, and social stability of this world I would say for the next hundred years, and we really have to work on that. We can only do that together. </p> <p>Europe and the US being close is very important, and that's important to Britain. Britain can have a unique bridging role between Europe and the US. There are problems in that relationship, big problems, but in a way we are better able to face that.</p> <p>The last point is that if there is a Kerry presidency, he has got take on board the Palestine-Israel issue. It is central and it is one that, although Bill Clinton did an awful lot on it, has not always been the strength of the Democratic party.</p> <p><b>David Aaronovitch, Guardian columnist</b><br> I think it is the right thing to support Kerry, but it won't make the slightest bit of a difference. First, there is absolutely nothing that we can do about this election. It is not up to British prime ministers to attempt to influence American presidential elections, for two reasons. First, it doesn't work. What do you do when you end up with the president you have campaigned so hard against? That's not how international politics work. Second, whatever the consequence, whatever the result is, we have somehow to manage it, we have to work with whatever it is, we have to think about how from that other position we try to get the things out of the situation that we decide we want. </p> <p>The third point is that it is the American presidential election, and consequently the result, is exceptionally important for us. I am going to add something which is very unpopular here. I think that the polls are probably the first major indication we have about how this election is going to go. We now know probably what are the issues that are going to define the results. The economic assault on George Bush has not yet, and probably will not, sufficiently convince a large number of people that they ought to drop a president that they see as strong in security in what they would regard as midstream. I too would like to see a Kerry victory but I think as at this moment it is very unlikely.</p>"

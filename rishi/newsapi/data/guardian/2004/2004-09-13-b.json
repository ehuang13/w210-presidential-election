  "John Kerry has fallen behind in the three biggest swing states - Florida, Pennsylvania and Ohio - which pollsters from both parties believe will be the key to the US presidential election, it emerged yesterday. <p>Polling figures suggest that George Bush's surge in support after the Republican convention has settled into a significant lead, confronting John Kerry with difficult tactical choices as he battles to regain the initiative. </p> <p>A poll by Time magazine showed the president on 52%, with the Democratic challenger on 41%. This is as wide a lead as Mr Bush enjoyed in the immediate aftermath of the New York convention. Newsweek magazine, however, found the Bush margin had diminished to six percentage points in the past week. </p> <p>To some extent, the varying results reflect differing polling methods. Time based its results on likely voters, identified by a number of questions on their voting background and intentions. The Newsweek survey looked at all registered voters. </p> <p>But the common theme is that the president's advantage has outlasted the hoopla of the Republican rally. The trend is also moving against Mr Kerry in the most closely-contested swing states. </p> <p>The conventional wisdom among pollsters in both camps has been that whoever wins two out of the three biggest swing states - Florida, Pennsylvania and Ohio - will win the election. Mr Kerry is currently behind in all three: Ohio by eight percentage points, Florida by four points, and Pennsylvania by one point. </p> <p>\"It's clear this is more than a 'bounce',\" said Andrew Kohut, the head of the Pew Research Centre, an independent polling organisation in Washington. </p> <p>\"Kerry has clearly underperformed. He's lost the first round, but the question becomes, how stable is the Bush lead - and we don't know that yet. There are still a lot of variables, like what happens in Iraq and the candidates' performance in the debates, so there are still opportunities for Kerry.\" </p> <p>However, over the past two weeks, there has been a shift in voters' perceptions of both candidates. More than half of the US electorate now has a favourable opinion of Mr Bush, according to the Newsweek survey. Meanwhile, Mr Kerry's favourable ratings, at 48%, have yet to recover from the battering he suffered from Republican speakers at the convention. </p> <p>The polling results have also shown that the Republican convention \"reset\" the election agenda, at least for now. Terrorism has become the top issue for voters, displacing concerns about the economy and healthcare, which took precedence until August. </p> <p>The nationwide shift in public opinion has been reflected in the roughly 20 swing states where the daily battle is being fought. </p> <p>States like Virginia, Arizona and Missouri, where Mr Kerry believed he had a serious chance a month ago, now appear to be solidly behind the president, potentially gaining Mr Bush crucial votes in the 538-seat electoral college that formally picks the president after the election. </p> <p>In the light of all the latest state polls, the bloc of states backing the president accounted for 168 electoral college votes, and the states solidly behind Mr Kerry carried 146, with 224 votes up for grabs - from states that were either tied or where the margin between the candidates was less than the margin of error. A total of 270 votes is required to win. </p> <p>The Kerry campaign is focusing its advertising expenditure on a smaller and smaller group of states, and has committed itself to regaining the initiative in Ohio, where it believes high unemployment should make it open to Mr Kerry's job creation ideas and other social spending programmes. </p> <p>However, that takes money away from the defence of traditionally Democratic states such as Wisconsin, Iowa, Washington and Oregon, where the president is making a serious challenge, and which are too close to call. </p> <p>The Kerry camp insists that the battle is far from over. Much bigger leads have been overturned in the last 50 days of a campaign, and the debates can be decisive in a tight race. The Kerry campaign has agreed to all three presidential debates suggested by a public commission, starting at the end of this month. The Bush negotiating team is arguing for just two. </p> <p>For Democrats, the persistently hopeful sign to emerge from all the polling data is that America remains a disgruntled country. In the Newsweek survey, 53% of voters said they were dissatisfied with \"the way things are going\" in the US. Only 39% said they were satisfied. </p> <p>Faced with that widespread discontent, both candidates are marketing themselves as agents of change - a normal strategy for a challenger, but a harder task for an incumbent with four years in office behind him. Nevertheless, Mr Bush is attempting the gambit, repeatedly describing his agenda as a response to \"changing times\" - and his opponent's platform as \"more of the same\".</p>",
  "Weekend violence in the western city of Herat is a reminder of how volatile the situation in Afghanistan remains, three years after the US overthrew the Taliban and less than four weeks before presidential elections there. <p>George Bush described Afghanistan last June as \"the first victory in the war on terror\". A year ago, the US defence secretary Donald Rumsfeld declared that major combat operations were over and an era of stabilisation and reconstruction had begun. </p> <p>But despite some progress in education, health and infrastructure, Afghanistan remains far more unstable than western leaders care to admit. Afghanistan is a nation-building challenge to which even Iraq pales in comparison. </p> <p>Attacks attributed to a resurgent Taliban and its al-Qaida allies have claimed more than 1,000 lives in the past 12 months. Low-level conflict in the south and east has become the norm. Foreign aid workers have been repeatedly targeted, as in Herat on Sunday. Much of the country beyond Kabul is considered insecure. </p> <p>Major General Eric Olson, the operational commander of US forces, admitted at the weekend that his troops were \"not even close\" to defeating the insurgents. The 14,000-strong Afghan national army, prone to high levels of desertion, is struggling to make an impact. </p> <p>Parallel efforts to disarm Afghanistan's more numerous mujahideen militias - a precondition for elections, according to the 2001 Bonn accords - have stalled. </p> <p>US forces in Afghanistan total 18,000, compared with 130,000 in Iraq. Up to 10,000 Nato troops are attached to the separate international security force, Isaf. For some, that disparity suggests a lack of US commitment. </p> <p>The previously delayed elections, due on October 9, are beset by similar concerns. </p> <p>Afghans have shown considerable enthusiasm for the polls, registering in large numbers. About 4 million women are expected to cast a ballot - a revolution in the Afghan context. If they wish, they can even vote for a female candidate, Massouda Jalal. </p> <p>But security will be a big worry, with the Taliban already assassinating election workers and vowing to wreck the process if they can. Over-stretched western forces cannot possibly guarantee a safe and fair poll nationwide. </p> <p>Fraud and intimidation are also potential problems. Only a few hundred foreign observers will be on hand to monitor 25,000 polling stations. </p> <p>Western governments are nevertheless keenly anticipating a democratic triumph in Afghanistan next month - and are likely to declare one, almost whatever happens. </p> <p>Mr Bush and Tony Blair, facing their own elections, draw from the Afghan electoral process a powerful vindication of their policies. Similar considerations apply to polls planned for January in Iraq. </p> <p>Western leaders are also counting on a victory for Hamid Karzai, Afghanistan's pro-western ethnic Pashtun leader and the man they installed after 9/11. That remains the most likely result, possibly after a second round of voting. </p> <p>But Mr Karzai must first see off 17 challengers, the foremost of whom is Yunus Qanuni, an ethnic Tajik who has become, in effect, the candidate of the Northern Alliance warlords who seized Kabul with US backing in 2001. </p> <p>Mr Karzai is a nationalist in a country where nationhood and national unity are still novel concepts. Should he win, his main task will be to extend his power beyond Kabul by curbing the mujahideen. </p> <p>This is the key to stamping out corruption and the multi-billion dollar trade in opium poppies; and to moving on successfully to parliamentary elections next spring. </p> <p>And this, in a symbolic way, is what Mr Karzai's weekend removal of Ismail Khan, the warlord governor of Herat, was all about. The violent reaction there may be a sign of things to come. </p> <p>Since 2001, the US has followed an improvised political strategy in Afghanistan, ostensibly promoting national self-determination while maintaining ad hoc alliances with the mujahideen. </p> <p>The challenge facing Mr Karzai is thus how to wrest control of his country not only from warlords and insurgents, but also, ultimately, from the American puppet-masters who have manipulated both them and him. </p> <p>The penalty for failure is a descent into renewed Islamism; or what into what one analyst, Kathy Gannon, calls a failed \"narco-state\", spinning rapidly out of control.</p>",
  "Saya's agony was nearly over. Cheeks charred, fingers blackened and with 70% of her body burned, the 18-year-old woman lay prone on the hospital bed, racked with unimaginable pain. <p>Whimpering her mother's name, she jerked her bandaged arms in small, staccato movements, desperately seeking relief. There was none. Her eyes fluttered open, then closed. \"Another day, maybe two,\" predicted the doctor. </p> <p>A stony-faced relative stood over Saya, whisking away flies with a black shawl. It was all a terrible mistake, she said, an unfortunate cooking accident. No it wasn't, said nurse Afifa Hariar, standing behind. </p> <p>\"It's another suicide case,\" she tutted quietly, arms folded. \"They always try to keep it a secret.\" </p> <p>Self-immolation is the terrible choice of hundreds of Afghan women every year. Trapped in unhappy marriages or hemmed in by a conservative Islamic society, they take an appalling escape route: dousing themselves in household fuel, closing their eyes, and striking a match. Most are between 16 and 20 years old, say doctors. </p> <p>The gruesome consequences are to be found in the burns unit at Herat hospital, a severely under-equipped facility in one of Afghanistan's most prosperous provinces. </p> <p>Last Saturday 15 bandage-swaddled women lay on beds crammed into the tiny ward, groaning softly. </p> <p>Many were genuine accidents but at least four had attempted suicide, staff estimated - about the average for a city that registered 80 self-immolations in the first seven months of this year. </p> <p>Shame and stigma mean few women admit what has happened, but the staff have a keen eye for the telltale signs. </p> <p>\"When we see the depth of the burns, or smell the fuel on their clothes, we know it is no accident,\" said the unit's head, Homayon Azizi. </p> <p>The reasons behind the suicides are complex but closely intertwined with women's subordinate position in Afghan society. Forced marriage is the predominant factor, say medics and human rights workers. </p> <p>Parents marry their daughter off to older men, sometimes in exchange for a dowry as high as \u00a34,000. The unions are intolerable to some women, because of either a violent husband or an interfering mother-in-law. </p> <p>Zarah, 19, set herself on fire at the climax of an argument with her husband, just three months into their marriage. After she moved to his rural home, he started to beat her for \"disobedience\". </p> <p>\"I believed I would die. I wanted to prove to my husband that I didn't want to live with him,\" said Zarah, who has now returned to her parents' home. </p> <p>She has divorced her 22-year-old husband, but will pay a high price for the rest of her life. The blaze melted the skin on the upper half of her body, in effect welding her chin to her chest and webbing her arms to her torso. Disfigured and disabled, she cannot work and may never remarry. </p> <p>\"Every day we take her to hospital for treatment, and every night she is suffering and crying,\" said her mother, Sharifa. </p> <p>Although self-immolation occurs across Afghanistan, its incidence is highest in Herat, a western province where a degree of sophistication clashes with social conservatism. </p> <p>The now ousted warlord-cum-governor, Ismail Khan, built libraries and actively encouraged female education. But he also imposed a strict social code which starves women of opportunities to leave the home and work. </p> <p>Herat's proximity to Iran, 75 miles to the west, was also a factor, said Palwasha Kakar of the Afghanistan Independent Human Rights Commission. Many Afghans have lived as refugees in Iran, and are aware of the relative freedoms enjoyed by women there. </p> <p>\"Women in Herat are a little bit more sensitive. They see suicide as the only way to solve their problem,\" said Ms Kakar. </p> <p>The idea of death by burning may come from Iranian television, which can be received in Herat and sometimes broadcasts images of female suicides. Or it may be simply that household fuel is the only available weapon of self-destruction. </p> <p>Dr Azizi is not only battling a disturbing trend. His staff treat about 700 patients a year - three times as many as a similar burns unit in Europe - but work on a pitiful budget. Staff are regularly overwhelmed, patients' relatives have to buy their own medicine, and there is no proper plastic surgery equipment. </p> <p>International donors have promised Afghanistan aid this year. But in Herat, there is not even enough to pay for surgical gloves. </p> <p>There is one hope. HumaniTerra, a French aid agency, flew Dr Azizi to Marseille earlier this year for specialist burns training. It intends to do the same for other Afghan doctors this December. </p> <p>\"This phenomenon is not just about the drama of suicides. Don't forget there is a new generation of young Afghans who are working hard to improve their country,\" said the programme director, Philippe Leroy. </p> <p>Moreover, HumaniTerra has plans to invest $500,000 (\u00a3330,000) in a new burns unit in Herat. But first, says the agency, the Afghan health ministry must honour its commitment to put up the building, which will cost about the same amount. </p> <p>As with much in Afghanistan, that depends on the outcome of the October 9 presidential election. \"We're very confident it will happen,\" said Dr Leroy. \"But you can only believe it when you see it.\" </p>",
  "Riots erupted yesterday in the western Afghan capital, Herat, killing at least seven people, after the interim president, Hamid Karzai, moved to wrest the city from its warlord ruler. <p>Afghan soldiers opened fire on a stone-throwing mob that stormed UN offices in protest at Ismail Khan's dismissal as the city's governor, destroying vehicles and burning offices. </p> <p>US helicopters hovered over the city, which was under curfew last night, as plumes of smoke rose from the burning UN buildings. The announcement followed an appeal by Mr Khan for restraint. A hospital doctor said seven people died, while the interior ministry confirmed that there were 12 injuries. </p> <p>Some protesters said they were shot at by US troops supporting the newly trained Afghan national army. </p> <p>The violence was ignited by a bold gambit by Mr Karzai, a month before the October 9 presidential election. On Saturday he dismissed Mr Khan as governor of Herat by announcing his \"promotion\" to minister of mines - an offer the warlord spurned, saying that he preferred to remain a \"private citizen\". </p> <p>The atmosphere in the city heated rapidly. Two American soldiers had to be rescued from a stone-throwing mob. </p> <p>The manoeuvring is part of a long-running tussle between Mr Khan, a legendary mujahideen leader, and the central government in Kabul. </p> <p>The warlord has frustrated several attempts to woo him from his personal fiefdom to a ministerial position in Kabul. He prefers to remain in Herat, where he controls a considerable personal army as well as the multimillion-pound border trade with Iran. </p> <p>However, a number of defeats this year appear to signal his growing military weakness. His son, the civil aviation minister, Mirwais Sadi, died in a clash with government troops in April, and last month forces loyal to his bitter rival, Amanullah Khan, fought to within 20 miles of Herat. </p> <p>The governor was embarrassed into accepting the intervention of Afghan army and US troops to save the city - a force now being used to enforce the political coup against him. </p> <p>Yesterday US helicopters hovered over Herat, days after Mr Karzai vowed to rein in renegade warlords as part of his manifesto for the presidential election. </p> <p>About 10 UN staff scrambled into a bunker on their compound and were later evacuated to a small US military base in the city. The offices of a Danish aid agency were also ransacked by the rioters. </p> <p>The US ambassador, Zalmay Khalilzad, said he had spoken to Mr Khan, urging him not to threaten security. Meanwhile, Herat's newly appointed governor, Sayed Muhammad Khairkhwa, formerly Afghan ambassador to Ukraine, flew into the city's airport. </p> <p>The UN special envoy, Jean Arnault, said Mr Khairkhwa's appointment would ensure the \"peaceful preparation of the elections\". The city was under curfew last night. </p> <p>State-run Herat TV broadcast an announcement from the army commander warning that \"any disorder will face military action\" and gatherings were forbidden, Reuters reported. </p> <p>The announcement was preceded by a statement from Mr Khan calling for restraint by protesters and the army.</p>",
  "The United States and Britain were last night trying to discover the cause of a huge mushroom cloud spotted over North Korea. <p>US officials played down fears that it might have come from a nuclear test. However, the White House was reported to have received an intelligence briefing that Pyongyang could be preparing to carry out a test. Such a move would throw the region and US foreign policy into crisis at the climax of the election campaign. </p> <p>Bush administration officials have still to establish whether the 2.5-mile-wide cloud, seen in satellite pictures four days ago, was the result of an explosion or natural disaster. </p> <p>\"There are all kinds of reports and there are all kinds of assessments that are going on,\" Condoleezza Rice, the national security adviser, told CNN yesterday. \"Maybe it was a forest fire of some kind. But we don't believe at this point that it was a nuclear event.\" </p> <p>However, according to the South Korean media, the cloud was caused by a blast that rocked an area in the north-eastern county Kimhyungjik, near the Chinese border, last Thursday, the 56th anniversary of communist North Korea's foundation. </p> <p>It appeared to be much more powerful than the accidental explosion at Ryongchon railway station in April, which killed at least 170 people. A spokesman in the South Korean presidential office was quoted as saying: \"We are trying to find out in detail the exact character, cause and size of the accident, but we don't think North Korea conducted a nuclear test.\" </p> <p>Nuclear experts said such a test would have been very easy to detect, adding that it was unlikely North Korea would have let off an above-ground atomic blast so close to China. </p> <p>Several other explanations have been offered, including a failed test of a conventional missile. It happened in a highland area known to house ballistic missile launch sites. </p> <p>But last night Colin Powell, the US secretary of state, said: \"There was no indication that it was a nuclear event of any kind. Exactly what it was, we're not sure.\" </p> <p>News of the explosion came as Bill Rammell, a junior Foreign Office minister, arrived in North Korea to discuss its nuclear weapons programme. He demanded an \"immediate explanation\" for the blast and will raise the issue at a meeting with Pyongyang's foreign minister today. </p> <p>North Korea said at the weekend that last week's admission by the South that it had secretly produced small quantities of uranium and plutonium had made it even more determined to continue its own nuclear arms programme. </p> <p>The news of the mushroom cloud coincided with a report in the New York Times yesterday that President George Bush had received recent intelligence reports indicating unusual activity around suspected North Korean test sites. </p> <p>Some observers interpreted the activity as a prelude to a nuclear test. </p> <p>The newspaper quoted an unnamed US administration official as saying the likelihood of a test had risen significantly in the past month. </p> <p>Responding to the reports, Ms Rice said: \"We're certainly watching certain indicators to see whether it looks like a routine activity or whether something more is going on, but it would obviously not be smart for the North Koreans to test.\" </p> <p>Ms Rice added that if the North Korean leadership were \"somehow trying to gain negotiating leverage, or their own October surprise ... they would simply isolate themselves even further\". </p> <p>An \"October surprise\" is the term used in US politics for a shock event deliberately timed to have an impact on the November presidential election. </p> <p>The US, along with South Korea, China, Japan and Russia, is trying to persuade Pyongyang to give up its nuclear ambitions. North Korea has threatened to stay away from a fourth round of multiparty talks later this year. </p> <p>In October 2002, US officials alleged that the North had admitted secretly developing a uranium-based nuclear programme, in breach of a 1994 agreement to freeze nuclear-related activities. </p> <p>Pyongyang denied the charge, but last year claimed to have reprocessed 8,000 spent fuel rods for plutonium-based weapons.</p>"

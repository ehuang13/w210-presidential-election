  "The ballot or the bullet - that's the choice. This simple maxim has become one of the favourite soundbites of our nation-building times. It is being trotted out again as Afghans prepare to vote in presidential elections today, and is already much in use in official circles as the countdown starts for polls in Iraq. <p>On the one side are the insurgents, terrorists, men of violence, or whatever the current label is, who fear democracy and will do all they can to stop it. On the other is a people who have never had a chance to choose their leaders and want nothing more than to exercise it at last. </p> <p>The contrast is comforting, but rarely conforms to reality in any but the remotest way. Elections can be manipulated and misused. They are only one part of a long process of enabling people to speak, organise and hold their rulers to account. </p> <p>If they take place too early, they can be counterproductive and delay a society's transition to a culture of genuine debate and competition. That was the lesson of the Balkans in the 1990s, in particular in Bosnia, where the rush to vote (pressed mainly by the Clinton administration) entrenched hardline nationalists in power. Last week's local elections in Bosnia confirmed how hard it is to loosen the grip they acquired then. </p> <p>In Afghanistan and Iraq, the issue is whether elections that are meant to offer an alternative to violence are actually promoting it. That certainly seems to be the case in Afghanistan. With its requirement to have polling stations and registrars around the country, the election process becomes the softest of targets. </p> <p>In recent weeks, attacks by a resurgent Taliban have increased. The United Nations has urged staff not involved in running the elections to go on leave. Aid agencies are imposing curfews and telling staff to restrict their movements or go abroad. </p> <p>Some aid workers query the huge amount of money allocated for what they say is mainly a propaganda exercise, and say it would have been better spent on education and health. They point to the fact that high insecurity has deterred independent monitors, thereby raising the risk of fraud. </p> <p>It is not just anti-government forces who are behind the violence. Local and regional warlords may not be rocketing polling stations or ambushing registrars, but they are making threats to opposition candidates and their supporters. Women voters are particular targets. </p> <p>Several of the 18 presidential candidates are thought to have entered the race merely to strengthen their bargaining power in the closed-door meetings which have already got underway among Afghanistan's strongmen to discuss ministerial portfolios and the post-polling pace of reform. What was meant as an expression of democracy becomes a device to resist, rather than promote, change. </p> <p>In Iraq, the black and white image of a government that wants elections, and insurgents who are ready to use violence to stop it, is even less accurate. The greatest risk of pre-election violence in today's Iraq comes from the United States, not from the various groups of insurgents. </p> <p>In the name of recapturing Iraqi cities so that polling can take place, US forces have already started - and are planning to widen - a campaign of air strikes which will probably cause more civilian casualties than last year's invasion. </p> <p>Iraq's health ministry recently compiled a chilling set of statistics, which were obtained and exclusively published by the American news organisation, Knight-Ridder. The ministry took reports from hospitals in 15 of Iraq's 18 provinces. It did not have data from the three Kurdish provinces where political violence is minimal. </p> <p>The death tolls may include some Iraqi police and national guardsmen, but mainly count civilians. They are unlikely to include insurgents, since their families usually fear taking seriously wounded resistance fighters to government hospitals. They bury their dead without registration at the morgue. </p> <p>The findings were that out of 3,487 Iraqi deaths since April 5, two-thirds were killed by US and multinational forces or Iraqi police. In other words, the footage of car-bombs and suicide attacks set off by insurgents, which TV cameras are able to film in central Baghdad and which we see on our screens, may give the false impression that anti-government forces are the biggest killers. </p> <p>In fact, a greater toll is mounting up, unfilmed, in Sadr City, Falluja, Samarra and other cities where the US uses airstrikes. According to the health ministry, two Iraqis are being killed by the government side for each one killed by insurgents. </p> <p>As for giving Iraqis a choice in the upcoming elections which will pick a constituent assembly and government, the danger that they will be disappointed is coming from backroom deals similar to the Afghan ones. A recent poll by the Iraqi Centre for Research and Strategic Studies shows that 61% believe suitable candidates will be prevented from campaigning. </p> <p>One reason for scepticism is that Prime minister Ayad Allawi, supported by Washington, is trying to put together a \"consensus list\" of himself and the formerly exiled parties in the current government, including Kurds, Shias and Sunnis. Voters would be presented with a take-it-or-leave-it offer. For Allawi, who has little chance of retaining power if his party stands alone, the combined list is the only hope. For the Kurds who want to enshrine their right to autonomy in the constitution which will be drafted next year, it also makes sense to do a pre-election deal with the largest Shia parties. </p> <p>The jokers in the pack are Grand Ayatollah Ali al Sistani, the respected Shia leader who has already criticised the concept of a government list, and Moqtada al Sadr, the radical cleric. </p> <p>If al Sadr decided to take part in the poll and create his own \"national patriotic list\", with the central demand that foreign forces leave Iraq immediately, Allawi and his allies would be in serious trouble. It is not inconceivable that al Sadr could entice the leading Sunni organisation, the Council of Islamic Scholars, and the Iraqi Islamic party to his list. The grand ayatollah might even endorse it. Given the occupation's unpopularity, this would make the \"patriotic list\" unstoppable. </p> <p>Although peace talks for Falluja and Sadr city are sputtering on, some Iraqis fear the looming US air offensive has unacknowledged aims. One is to provoke such resistance in the nationalist Sunni and al Sadr strongholds that elections can be cancelled in those areas. Another is to make it impossible for al Sadr to disband his militia and join the election without seeming to have been defeated on the battlefield. </p> <p>It is a high-stakes game in which the US is working hard to prevent a government emerging that would ask it to go home. One early result is to expose how phoney the bombs-or-ballots alternative really is. Iraqis are going to get a lot of the former, whatever happens with the latter. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:j.steele@theguardian.com\">j.steele@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>George Bush yesterday became the first US president since Herbert Hoover in the Depression to preside over a loss of jobs when the last set of employment figures published before next month's election showed only a modest improvement in September. </p> <p>On the day that President Bush was preparing for his second televised debate with his Democrat challenger, John Kerry, he was given the unwelcome news that more than 800,000 jobs had been shed in the past four years. </p> <p>The bureau of labour statistics (BLS) said that non-farm payrolls rose by 96,000 in September - weaker than the 148,000 increase predicted by the financial markets and not enough to compensate for the employment losses suffered during the recession that accompanied the beginning of Mr Bush's presidency. </p> <p>With opinion polls suggesting that Mr Bush lost the first of the three debates, analysts said the eagerly anticipated employment report would allow Mr Kerry to say that the war in Iraq had resulted in the president neglecting problems at home. </p> <p>Steven Andrew, an economist at ISIS Asset Management, said: \"The September non-farm payroll data represented the final opportunity for the labour market report to help President Bush keep his own job. Unfortunately for the president, the report played into the hands of John Kerry in confirming Bush as having presided over an economy which has cut 821,000 jobs over his tenure.\" </p> <p>Paul Ashworth of Capital Economics said the only good news for the president from yesterday's data was that the bureau of labour statistics said it would be revising upwards the level of payrolls by 236,000 in January. </p> <p>\"Unfortunately, even allowing for that upward revision, Bush is now confirmed as the first president since Hoover to have overseen a net loss of jobs during his presidential term,\" Mr Ashworth added. </p> <p>Wall Street believes that the lack of vigorous job creation from the stuttering US economy may persuade the Federal Reserve Board to postpone an expected increase in American interest rates next month. </p> <p>Analysts said the \"soft spot\" in the economy was persisting, with high oil prices helping to put the brake on growth. Crude futures remained just below $53 a barrel in New York yesterday, despite the end of a strike by oil workers in Nigeria. </p> <p>The dollar fell sharply on the foreign exchanges following the release of the jobs data in Washington. It lost more than 1% against the euro, lost ground against the Swiss franc and suffered its biggest one-day fall against the yen in more than a year, posting a \u00a51.8 drop. Sterling, which hit an eight-month low against the euro at 69.23 pence, gained three-quarters of a cent against the American currency to just over $1.79. </p> <p>The Bush camp put a brave face on the employment statistics numbers. John Snow, the US treasury secretary, said: \"Clearly we are on the right path. I am confident we will see that continue.\" </p> <p>Officials at the BLS said the four hurricanes last month could not be blamed for the weakness of job creation, saying the impact on the labour market was minor. </p> <p>The service sector saw the strongest employment gains last month, adding 109,000 positions, of which 33,000 were part-time. The manufacturing sector - important in the swing states of America's industrial heartland - shed 18,000 jobs in September.</p>",
  "<b>\u00b7</b> The past week in Bournemouth was prettily punctuated by frenetic attempts to demonstrate that those who now lead the Conservative party are human beings, just like the rest of us. Well, most of the rest of us, anyway. When did they get their first kiss? Which was their favourite liquorice allsort? (Mine, since we're all so confessional nowadays, was the one that was shaped like a log.) Which of the works of Gian Carlo Menotti would they want to take to a desert island? That kind of thing. I think I know where this is leading. The shadow international development secretary, Alan Duncan, emphasising the importance of political parties fielding those who looked good on TV, suggested that Boris Johnson was \"probably the most popular person in Conservative politics\" because he was so well known, and even urged his colleagues, the Guardian tells us, \"to undergo image overhauls\". And a YouGov poll in the Telegraph found that Johnson, a mere shadow arts minister, was better recognised than apparently more eminent figures such as Oliver Letwin and David Davis. The conclusion is inescapable. Unless there's some sensational boost to the party's fortunes within the next month or so, its principal figures are all going to have to rebrand themselves in the image of Boris Johnson. <p>A makeover artiste writes: That is easily done. The essential steps are as follows: 1) The hair. Buy an outsize mop - they're available in all good hardware stores and most bad ones - and dye it the appropriate shade of blond. It may be stiff after dyeing, so practise shaking your head about in some windy spot on a nearby heath, while chortling uncontrollably. Don't forget to remove the handle before putting your mop on your head. 2) The language. Read one of the Greyfriars stories before starting your day. But try not to say Yarooh, for fear of revealing your source. 3) Buy a bicycle, and ride it with brave impetuosity. Curse loudly if balked. If you stop alongside a senior Blair adviser at the traffic lights in Whitehall, don't let him move on until he's said something unfriendly about Gordon Brown. 4) When appearing as chairman of Have I Got News For You, mix things up and forget things, apologising sweetly the while. Stick at it until you hear somebody in the audience describing you as \"a loveable muppet\". </p> <p>A contrarian writes: Those who savour independently minded people such as myself might like to note the table setting out the responses in the same YouGov poll when they asked: \"Which four or five of the following policies would make you most likely to vote Conservative at the next election - or would you not vote Conservative whatever they promised?\" One per cent of those who classed themselves as Conservative voters said they wouldn't vote for the party whatever it said. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> I don't know what to make of the US elections. I've assumed all along that George Bush was likely to win, though there's one overwhelming indicator pointing to Kerry: the Telegraph/Spectator pundit Mark Steyn is certain that Bush will triumph. If, even in spite of that, Kerry does lose, I shall wonder whether part of the reason is that he had the wrong grandfather. His grandfather's name, it is said, was originally Cohen. Deciding to change it, he stuck a pin in the map, and it hit the word Kerry. Nothing wrong with Kerry, of course; but was not this a rash and irresponsible step for the grandfather of a possible presidential contender to take? I haven't yet discovered where grandfather Cohen was when he wielded his pin. We are told it had nothing to do with Ireland. Some say it preceded his arrival in the US, but I doubt if you'd find a Kerry on the map of Austria. The only Kerrys my spies in the US are able to trace are inconspicuous spots in Oregon and North Dakota, but these may not even have existed in the year of the pin. You can get some indication of the hazards of the procedure, though, if you look at a map of Powys, where there's a Kerry just east of Newtown. If you close your eyes and take a stab at this Kerry, you will find you may just as easily hit Abermule, Bettws Cedewain, Bwlch-y-ffridd or, most likely of all, Llanllwchaiarn. Schwarzenegger one day perhaps, but no self-respecting American would vote for a president sporting a name like these. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> My thanks to those who have written in about porchlights, mostly making the point that when the former FBI man I quoted last week talked of keeping the emotional porchlight burning during hostage negotiations, he was alluding to the practice prevalent in US homesteads of keeping the porchlight on till all are home and the family is complete. Years of investigative journalism had in fact enabled me to deduce that: what interested me was the suspicion that this might be one of those moments where a tasty new formulation begins the journey that will make it one day a much loved cliche. The porchlight is, I suppose, the equivalent of the home fire, as in the first world war song Keep the Home Fires Burning - a precaution householders were told they ought to take so long as their hearts were yearning and their lads were far way, in the knowledge that there was a silver lining which through the dark cloud was shining; a dark cloud, moreover, which ought to be turned inside out till the boys came home. The words were by Lena Ford, the music by Ivor Novello, though some believe that the words in the opening line were Novello's too. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> More next week, I hope, on Deritend, mumpokers and the right of Plato to a place in an all-time Great Greeks football XI. (He was out, he was in, he was out, and now he's back in again.) In the meantime please watch out for the word bouncebackability, as deployed by Amicus leader Derek Simpson on Sky TV after hearing Tony Blair's conference speech. This was not, says a source within Sky, as original as it might sound. Its first use, it's suggested, was in an interview, also on Sky, with Iain Dowie, manager of soaraway Crystal Palace. Evidence of even earlier usages, by Boris Johnson, Grandfather Cohen, or even Plato perhaps, will be joyfully received and may even get printed. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:MrSmallweed@aol.com\">MrSmallweed@aol.com</a></p>",
  "A giant American database, which is being used by the Tories to root out swing voters, is being hailed by Michael Howard as the party's secret \"tool\" which could transform next year's general election. <p>Senior Tories told the Guardian that the Voter Vault system, which identifies 400 social characteristics, is proving a great success in identifying voters who have abandoned the party in the past decade. </p> <p>The Tory high command believes it is on the verge of finally identifying its own \"Mondeo Man\" or \"Worcester Woman\", the sort of upwardly mobile voters who flocked to New Labour in the mid-90s. </p> <p>\"We have a new tool,\" one senior Tory said proudly. \"It is something we have borrowed from the US. The notion is that if you know what people's social characteristics are, it is not too difficult to identify how they will vote.\" </p> <p>Voter Vault, which is being used by the Bush campaign, looks at people's shopping, eating and lifestyle habits. This is based on the Mosaic system which is used by supermarkets to work out which products to target at shoppers. </p> <p>The new system \"vaults\" this commercial information to predict how people will vote. That in turn allows party workers to focus their efforts most efficiently on those individuals most likely to respond to canvassing. </p> <p>An example of a key finding in the US is that Volvo drivers rarely vote Republican. </p> <p>At the heart of Voter Vault is a graph that places the tendency of people to vote against their tendency to vote Conservative. The Tories identify potential voters by taking a list of people who vote - this is publicly available - and setting this against certain pieces of information about them from the national census. They then identify Tory voters by examining the characteristics of 20,000 of their party members to work out what sort of people vote Tory. </p> <p>The two groups are then placed together to identify swing voters - people who vote and who have Tory tendencies. In one study of 340,000 people the Tories achieved an 82% success rate in predicting who would vote for them. </p> <p>Liam Fox, the Tory co-chairman who imported the system, said yesterday: \"This is potentially very significant. In the 2002 mid-term elections in the US, Voter Vault helped the Republicans increase their vote by 4%. This is politics of the margins but this is where elections are won.\" </p> <p>Dr Fox added that Voter Vault gave the Tories a useful advantage over Labour, which was using outdated systems to identify voters by areas. \"Politics is now becoming very fragmented. The days when you could say this is a Labour street or this is a Tory street have gone. You can't even say this is a Tory or a Labour house. Voter Vault allows us to get round that and do 'virtual' canvassing of constituencies.\" </p> <p>Next month's US presidential election will pit the Republicans' Voter Vault technology against the Democrats' equivalent, DataMart, in the first duel between the rival databases. The Republicans have a head start. They used Voter Vault to devastating effect in congressional elections two years ago, focusing their time and resources on voters who were most likely to be persuaded to vote for them. </p> <p>Before 2002, candidates would purchase databases state by state and district by district from a specialist company called Aristotle. Voter Vault was the first true national voter database. </p> <p>It was built by Seattle-based Advanced Custom Software, which - according to PC World magazine - contracted much of the work out to Compulink Systems of Maharashtra in India, leading to questions over whether the data could be stolen while being shipped around the world, and inevitable accusations of \"outsourcing\". The Republicans say all the work on Voter Vault since 2002 has been done in the US. </p> <p>For the 2002 elections, the database sucked in state voter information, census data and membership information from scores of clubs and interest groups. It allowed the Republicans to shape their message to reflect the leanings and concerns of each voter, and to fly President Bush to areas where he would be most effective. </p> <p>\"In the old days people walked and knocked on every door,\" said Michael Cornfield, at the Pew Internet and American Life Project in Washington. \"Now they just knock on the doors where they have reason to believe they'll get a favourable response.\" </p> <p>Partly as a result of their advantage in getting their supporters to the polls, the Republicans won back control of the Senate in 2002 and consolidated their hold on the House of Representatives. </p> <p>Rattled, the Democratic party scrambled to catch up, and has since built up its version of the technology, DataMart, into a list of 166 million voters, just 2 million smaller than Voter Vault. The party has a second electronic contacts book known as Demzilla, of donors and activists. But unlike Voter Vault, neither system has been road tested.</p>",
  "<p><strong> Cuba: A New History</strong> by Richard Gott<br> 384pp, Yale, <strong>\u00a318.99 </strong><br> </p> <p>All too often, Cuba conjures up images of a last communist stronghold, Fidel Castro's beard and an American military base holding Afghan prisoners. Richard Gott's invaluable Cuba: A New History dispels many convenient myths. Gott, a frequent visitor to the island, guides us through its troubled history, from the first colonisation by the Spanish in 1511 to the present day. </p> <p>It is a savage story. Even Diego de Vel\u00e1squez, who began with the intention of treating the Indians well, became brutal when they refused to work for foreign invaders. By the early 17th century, Africans brought in as slaves formed half the total population. Racism was always endemic. </p> <p>With the brief British occupation of Havana in 1762, however, the city suddenly became an international port, and North American tradesmen set up business there. Initially, the struggle for Cuban independence involved war with Spain, in which Jos\u00e9 Marti, the great 19th-century poet, was a notable fighter. The United States began to take an interest in the Cuban-Spanish conflict only after the US battleship Maine - which had not been on a war footing - exploded in Havana in 1898, with the loss of 258 American lives. After the ensuing war, the US occupied Cuba for four years. </p> <p>When a new Cuban party, the Independent Party of Colour, was formed in 1907 and launched an armed protest movement five years later, US Marines arrived to protect American sugar cane estates, and in the repression that followed, some 3,000 black Cubans were killed. </p> <p>The influence of Communism, as Gott skilfully explains, now became pervasive. Cuban Socialists were impressed by the Russian Revolution and formed an embryonic Communist Party in 1925. Several of its members were Jewish immigrants from eastern Europe. Significantly, the Communists had no prejudice against blacks taking a leadership role in the party. A revolutionary junta was set up in September 1933, led by a mulatto typist named Fulgencio Batista. A university professor, Dr Ram\u00f3n Grau San Mart\u00edn, was chosen as Cuba's new president. He refused to service the debt on American loans and nationalised the Cuban American sugar mills. However, Fidel Castro, in a highly significant 1985 comment aptly cited by Gott, sniped at Grau's - and, by implication, Batista's - claim to be revolutionary in character. </p> <p>The fact is that Communists were allowed to operate legally under Batista and even to launch their own newspaper, Hoy. In return, the Communists promised Batista the political support he lacked. During the second world war, Batista himself became President of Cuba and ruled as a social democrat, welcoming Communists into his government. </p> <p>On July 26 1953, Fidel Castro led an armed attack on the Moncada fortress barracks in Santiago - Cuba's second city. He was arrested after the assault failed and served less than two years in jail before being amnestied by Batista. I would have welcomed more details to explain why Castro was already so convinced that armed insurrection was the only way forward. After all, the author points out that Batista, on winning the November 1954 presidential election, announced the return of constitutional rule and guaranteed a free press. Nevertheless, Castro was proved right: in Batista's second term in power, he became cruelly repressive. </p> <p>In Mexico City, Castro's brother, Ra\u00fal, introduced Fidel to Che Guevara and Gott describes this first meeting wonderfully. The two men initially got on very well. Che badly needed a political cause, while Che gave Fidel valuable insights into other revolutionary experiments around Latin America. </p> <p>Batista fled Cuba on New Year's Eve, 1958, and Castro arrived in Havana as Cuba's new leader on January 8, 1959. Gott might usefully have included at this point a remarkable quotation from a speech Fidel made on May 21 1959, in which he declared: \"Our revolution is neither capitalist nor Communist ... Capitalism sacrifices the human being; Communism, with its totalitarian conceptions, sacrifices human rights.\" </p> <p>Castro's energy was to inspire some of the greatest Latin American novelists of the 20th century, including Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez, Mario Vargas Llosa and Carlos Fuentes. He charmed not only Russian politicians like Nikita Khrushchev and African revolutionaries such as Ahmed Ben Bella, but also French intellectuals such as Jean-Paul Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir. </p> <p>It would have been helpful for Gott to throw some light on the sources of Castro's antagonism towards the great Chilean Communist poet, Pablo Neruda, who wrote the first book of praise for the Cuban revolution, Canci\u00f3n de gesta, in 1960. Perhaps Neruda's relationship with Fidel became prickly because a poem in that book dared to remind Castro that the revolution ought to be like a bottle of wine: the work of many men, not just one. The degree of control Fidel exerted over his country's intellectuals was demonstrated in 1966, when more than 100 Cuban writers - apparently on Castro's direct orders - published an open letter in the Cuban government daily, Granma, condemning Neruda for taking part in a PEN congress in New York that year. A wounded Neruda never returned to the island. </p> <p>However, Gott is superb on Castro's political skills and on the Che-Fidel estrangement. Guevara, who saw himself as a 20th-century Don Quixote, had, in Castro's eyes, become a loose cannon, an unstable visionary. Even before Che's assassination in 1967, Fidel had been seeking an opportunity to abandon the armed struggle. (Gott was on hand himself to identify Che's body after the murder.) </p> <p>Gott explores Castro's cautious attitude to the Sandinista overthrow of the Somoza dictatorship in Nicaragua in 1979. Fascinatingly, Fidel even suggested that the Sandinistas should establish a mixed economy and a pluralistic political system. </p> <p>In some ways, Gott saves the greatest surprise until the last. He writes that he expects little change in Cuba in the years ahead, even after Fidel Castro dies, because \"Cuba has already been governed for several years by a post-Castro government ... Castro himself is now largely absent from the scene ... He remains a figure from all our yesterdays, grey-bearded but eternally youthfully, like an ageing rock star.\" This is one of the many unexpected insights which make it likely that Gott's book will remain the standard work on Cuba for many years to come.</p>"

  "<p>The Manchurian Candidate of 1962, directed by John Frankenheimer from Richard Condon's thriller, is a chunk of America's psycho-history - as much oracle as movie - steeped in what Norman Mailer called \"that concentration of ecstasy and violence which is the dream life of the nation\". Not surprisingly, Jonathan Demme's remake, conceived in the aftermath of 9/11 and opening in the midst of the 2004 presidential campaign, has been received as an intervention, a desecration, a revision and an all-purpose metaphor. </p> <p>Condon's 1959 bestseller featured a Korean war hero created and programmed by the Chinese communists to serve as the \"sleeper\" assassin who will allow anti-communist triple agents to stage an election year coup d'etat. In essence, Condon suggested the cold war was a Soviet-American co-production. US electoral politics were represented as the province of communist dupes and zombie secret agents, while the novel's demagogic Joseph McCarthy figure himself turned out to be a Soviet creation. One brain washed the other; left- and right-wing paranoia merged. The scenario was nothing less than a satiric version of the John Birch Society's Black Book, which held President Dwight D Eisenhower to be a dedicated servant of the international communist conspiracy. </p> <p>Produced by its star Frank Sinatra's company and released by United Artists, The Manchurian Candidate became the quintessential Kennedy-era thriller. Indeed, there's a sense in which the movie is the Kennedy era - the epitome of glamour and anxiety, an anthology of cold- war anxieties ranging from TV image-building to communist infiltration of the government, which materialised at the height of the Cuban missile crisis to startle audiences with a baroque tale of mind-control, assassination and conspiracy. </p> <p>Sinatra was known to be a presidential pal and, when the Democratic honchos who then ran UA deemed The Manchurian Candidate too controversial to touch, Kennedy proved instrumental in getting the movie made. (Although JFK previewed The Manchurian Candidate at the White House in late August 1962, history does not record his response. Perhaps he was distracted - that day a U-2 spy plane had reported eight missile installations in Cuba that were only weeks away from being operational.) Two months later, The Manchurian Candidate had its premiere as Soviet ships steamed towards the US quarantine line surrounding Cuba, and Under-Secretary of State George Ball warned UN Ambassador Adlai Stevenson that there could be a \"shooting war\" by the following afternoon. </p> <p> The Manchurian Candidate opened at the climax of the cold war and fulfilled its prophetic mission 13 months later when Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas. One researcher recently proposed The Manchurian Candidate as the \"trigger film\" for the ex-marine, returned defector, sniper-or-patsy Lee Harvey Oswald. There's no proof that Oswald ever saw or even heard of The Manchurian Candidate but, even so, the circuit is complete: the movie Kennedy inspired also served as his death warrant. </p> <p>That the Manchurian candidate is a myth may be gauged by two seemingly indestructible misapprehensions, both regularly reiterated in reviews of Demme's remake. The first is the stubborn insistence that the 1962 movie had been a commercial failure and was thus an arcane message or a missed prophecy. In fact, having supplanted Darryl Zanuck's D-Day epic The Longest Day, The Manchurian Candidate reigned as national box-office champ (just in time for Kennedy's mid-term elections). The second misapprehension is that, following the Kennedy assassination, a remorseful Sinatra withdrew the movie from circulation. On the contrary: The Manchurian Candidate was re-released in early 1964 and, revived in the 1970s, it was used to \"explain\" the election-altering shootings of Martin Luther King, Robert Kennedy and George Wallace. (Truman Capote made waves in 1968 when he proposed on The Tonight Show that RFK assassin Sirhan Sirhan was a programmed \"Manchurian candidate\".) </p> <p>Six months after the Wallace shooting in 1972, and a decade after The Manchurian Candidate's initial release, Sinatra reasserted his rights in a contractual dispute with UA and the movie disappeared from cinemas, if not television or popular consciousness. The Manchurian Candidate 's extremely literal and highly fanciful view of behavioural modification remained topical, particularly after revelations of CIA mind-control experiments became public in the mid-1970s. Some 25 years after its release, a network television documentary based on John Marks' 1980 CIA expos\u00e9, The Search for the Manchurian Candidate, used clips from the Frankenheimer film to illustrate its thesis. </p> <p>Slick and sombre, Demme's new Candidate lacks the giddy insolence of its predecessor. The tale of a programmed \"sleeper\" assassin, a high-level political conspiracy, and an election-year coup isn't played for gleeful dark comedy; the update recalls Alan Pakula's post-Watergate, crypto- Manchurian remake The Parallax View as much as Frankenheimer's original. Gone is Frankenheimer's svelte Resnais-influenced integration of dreams, flashbacks and daylight reality. The cold war is no longer the nightmare from which Frank Sinatra is trying to awake. Rather, it's the new world order. The bogus military hero Raymond Shaw (Liev Schreiber) and his commanding officer (Denzel Washington in the Sinatra role) have their brains washed during Operation Desert Storm; the title now refers to the mega- corporate Manchurian Global, part Halliburton, part Carlyle Group. Coup d'\u00e9tat has been reformulated as \"regime change\" and there's a red-meat evocation of \"the first privately owned and operated vice president of the United States\". </p> <p>Sinatra's daughter Tina had long been interested in a Manchurian remake, but the project was only given the go-ahead in September 2001. The new version was co-produced by Democratic activist Scott Rudin for Paramount Pictures, whose head of production, Sherry Lansing, is a contributor to the Kerry campaign - as is Sumner Redstone, CEO of Paramount's corporate parent, Viacom. (Paramount has also released Hollywood's most scurrilous contribution to the political season, the raunchy puppet animation Team America: World Police.) Several writers were involved but, according to Rudin, once he and Daniel Pyne (who previously adapted The Sum of All Fears) shifted the emphasis to corporate chicanery, \"You could feel the script start to be alive.\" </p> <p>The second Manchurian Candidate belongs to Bush II nearly as much as the original did to JFK. The movie was in production during the run-up to and early months of the Iraq war, with dialogue rewritten in the light of unfolding events. And, from the opening theme, Wyclef Jean's cover of the anti-Bush anthem Fortunate Son , through the references to \"no-bid contracts\", computerised voting and constant terror alerts, to the elaboration of a corporate conspiracy to install a \"sleeper\" as president, the remake is an unambiguous attack on the current American administration. Despite the internet-fuelled rumour that Meryl Streep was evoking Hillary Clinton for her character, her portrayal of the candidate's mother is far more evocative of Bush aide Karen Hughes - or perhaps even Bush's own mother who, according to Kevin Phillips's American Dynasty, had spoken of becoming First Lady as early as the late 1940s. </p> <p>A week before the second Candidate opened, the New York Times economics columnist Paul Krugman, a relentless Bush critic, imagined a scenario for \"The Arabian Candidate\" in which Islamic fanatics installed a puppet US president who presented himself as the leader in a war against terrorism. Opening in the US less than 24 hours after the Democratic National Convention ended, the movie struck Krugman's colleague, the cultural pundit Frank Rich, as being so blatantly partisan that it \"could pass for the de facto fifth day of the convention itself\". </p> <p>Of course, rightwing websites were already attacking John Kerry as a Manchurian candidate - a bogus war hero under the control of billionaire George Soros - just as Bush's one-time Republican rival, Senator John McCain, had been smeared four years ago as another such \"candidate\", brainwashed in a North Vietnam POW camp. All of the candidates had their Manchurian aspect - not least the third-party perennial, Ralph Nader, who, as several commentators pointed out, seemed determined to ensure Bush's victory and thus a pro-corporate agenda he ostensibly opposes, in a second consecutive election. </p> <p>Demme's movie, too, has been attacked as a \"Naderite yelp against Democratic backsliding\" (The New Republic ), as well as characterised, more approvingly, \"the most extravagantly Chomskyite movie Hollywood has ever made\" (In These Times). Significantly, its release coincides with the remarkable success, at least in New York's alt-film world, of the Canadian horror-doc The Corporation, which applies the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders to demonstrate that corporations are by nature psychopathic - self-absorbed, irresponsible, manipulative and unable to empathise or feel remorse. </p> <p>There's no need for a Joe McCarthy-like demagogue in the new Manchurian Candidate . Demagoguery has been dispersed, institutionalised and built into the workings of the national entertainment state that has rationalised, if not replaced, the old American dream life. Paranoia, in the Manchurian remake, is blatantly orchestrated, with a steady background of terrorist and counter-terrorist chatter and a sense of constant surveillance. Patriotic pageantry is even more hysterical and Pavlovian than in the original - and, in the deployment of heroic New York City firefighters and Mount Rushmore, makes a reasonably accurate prediction of Republican campaign ads. </p> <p>These days, regime change through the strategic elimination of political leaders is no longer an issue, at least in the US. Nor is the construction of history's secret agent. A mysterious squarish bulge visible beneath President Bush's suit jacket during his first debate with John Kerry led to much media speculation that he was wired with some sort of radio receiver. Still, the most retrograde aspect of the new Candidate is the use of the old-fashioned Jos\u00e9 Delgado-type brain implants. </p> <p>As demonstrated by the terror alerts that have figured in the current presidential campaign, along with the new Department of Homeland Security's blandly issued threat of a cancelled election, it's not the assassins who are being programmed with sinister microchips - it is America's body politic. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> The Manchurian Candidate is released on November 19.

  "<p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Election fever has gripped the US book industry, with New York publishers heading for swing states to persuade wavering voters and get out the (mainly Democratic) vote. No longer can editors complain that \"politics doesn't sell\": the New York Times bestsellers are dominated by political titles, from partisan tracts to autobiographies of former presidents.</p> <p>The biggest surprise of the year has been the million-plus sales of the 9/11 Commission report. Written in a gripping narrative style - a stark contrast to Lord Hutton's effort - it has now been shortlisted in the influential National Book Awards alongside Stephen Greenblatt's Shakespeare biography. Voters can also see the funny side, with one and a half million copies in shops of the satirical America (The Book) by Jon Stewart. Even literary fiction has been politicised; witness Philip Roth's magisterial The Plot Against America and Nicholson Baker's Checkpoint.</p> <p>Some of this fever has crossed the Atlantic-the runaway success of Michael Moore for Penguin reflects the UK book-buying public's presidential preferences. But a desire for deeper political and cultural context has also helped smaller presses, from Gibson Square with the controversial House of Bush, House of Saud by Craig Unger, to IB Tauris with Resurrecting Empire by Rashid Khalidi.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Amazon's dominance of internet bookselling was confirmed this week by the news that it is to run the UK websites of Borders and Books Etc. Amazon already operates a site for Waterstone's: the high street players have accepted that, while they need an online presence, they cannot compete with Amazon's marketing and technical clout. About 85% of people looking to buy books online in September went to Amazon.co.uk, with its nearest rival, WHSmith.co.uk, getting just 3% of visits. In the buildup to Christmas the site has run a series of tailored promotions, dropped its minimum order for free delivery to \u00a319, and discounted by 40% on new titles and 30% on backlist priced over \u00a310. High street chains will hope that most customers are too disorganised to plan their gift shopping online in advance.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> The BBC's publishing arm, BBC Books, has had a tough few years. Once dominant in the bestseller charts, it has suffered from a decline in the TV tie-in market, while rivals have poached some of its biggest names. Attempts to push into general publishing backfired when a Michael Barrymore autobiography became embroiled in the scandal of the death of a man at the star's home; moves to partner with commercial publishers faltered. Now BBC Books has gone back to basics, cutting its staff and its lists to focus on \"classic\" illustrated BBC titles.</p> <p>Its Christmas catalogue has some strong contenders: Alan Titchmarsh's British Isles: A Natural History has started well despite poor reviews of the TV series, and there are new offerings from Delia and Ainsley Harriott. The trade wants the BBC simply to publish and market its obvious bestsellers, and keep them in print when demand surges.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Any lingering doubts over the wisdom of Transworld's \u00a31.6m advance for the autobiography of John Peel were swept aside this week, as the torrent of tributes to the BBC broadcaster showed the vast potential audience for his life story. Peel had been regularly updating his Home Truths listeners on the progress of the book, which had been due for publication next autumn. He had so far written about 50,000 words, which may yet see the light of day.

  "<p>Tomorrow's People, by Susan Greenfield (Penguin, \u00a37.99) </p> <p> Neuroscientist Susan Greenfield thinks \"life as we know it\" is about to end. Like the writers of the great dystopias of the past century, Greenfield fears that the very essence of human nature will be destroyed in tomorrow's brave new world. The \"private ego is the most precious thing we each have\", she says, but this is threatened by science, principally \"biotech, infotech and nanotech\". Greenfield depicts a frightening future in which people are cocooned in technologies that respond to their every mood swing and where the only reality is virtual. She predicts we will return to a childhood of the mind, devolving to a \"prehistoric state\" of passivity and hedonism. These are classic Frankenstein fears - humankind destroyed by its own creations - but Greenfield argues her case passionately and with skill. All that can save us from the \"excesses of the gadget-obsessed, dysfunctional nerd\" is the uniquely human ability to declare \"enough is enough\".<strong> PD Smith</strong> </p> <p> <strong> The Breaking of Nations: Order and Chaos in the 21st Century, by Robert Cooper (Atlantic, \u00a38.99)</strong> </p> <p> Apparently this was Blair's bedtime reading. Senior diplomat Robert Cooper, once a foreign policy adviser to No 10 and now a big cheese at the EU, sets out his vision of the state of the world and the key challenges for international diplomacy. He divides the world into pre-modern, modern and postmodern states, from chaotic states like Afghanistan to the \"ordered openness\" of Europe. In this narrative, force and legitimacy together create peace. Most interesting as a rationale of New Labour's foreign policy, Cooper's lucid book treads a profoundly conservative middle ground - indeed, there are plaudits from Conservatives such as Malcolm Rifkind on the back cover. The neo-imperialism of the \"developing state\" narrative, any hint that western capitalism might have flaws, and the role of transnational corporations in breaking down state borders are all ignored. <strong> Jo Littler</strong> </p> <p><strong> The Bubble of American Supremacy, by George Soros (Phoenix, \u00a37.99)</strong> </p> <p>This election manifesto and repudiation of the Bush doctrine makes sharper sense if you start at chapter 11, in which Soros explains why the actions of the current US administration have operated like a stock market boom - the bubble bursts when the \"gap between reality and its false interpretation becomes unsustainable\". Elsewhere he pleads that the \"government of the most successful open society in the world has fallen into the hands of ideologues who ignore the first principles of open society\" - and you can hear the justified fear of a man who knows personally, from his memories of wartime Hungary, what happens when big business, the military and an unaccountable political cabal in power consort in arrogance and ignorance without a care for the rest of humanity. So forgive him his slight pomposity. <strong> Vera Rule</strong> </p> <p><strong> The Sense of Being Stared At, by Rupert Sheldrake (Arrow, \u00a37.99)</strong> </p> <p>Have you ever had that prickling feeling on the back of your neck and turned to find that someone is staring right at you? Nearly eight out of 10 people have, says Rupert Sheldrake. What's more, 55% have experienced this with animals: I certainly wouldn't like to get the evil eye from an iguana. Sheldrake tells how he was looking out of a window at two women walking on a path \"when one of them stopped, turned and looked straight up at me\". Spooky. He believes that \"we are interconnected\", that minds are not just brains but \"mental fields\" that \"stretch out into the world around bodies\". If true, the science textbooks will have to be rewritten. Despite Sheldrake's impressive evidence of \"perceptive parrots\" and \"dogs that know when their owners are coming home\" (his last book), my guess is that he's barking up the wrong tree. And curiously enough, paranoia isn't even listed in the index. <strong> PDS</strong> </p> <p><strong> Other Septembers, Many Americas: Selected Provocations 1980-2004, by Ariel Dorfman (Pluto, \u00a312.99)</strong> </p> <p> September 11 2001 was not the first political plane crash in the Americas. In 1973 US planes bombed the Chilean presidential palace, facilitating Pinochet's dictatorship and ousting the first democratically elected, pacifist socialist government on the planet. Novelist and playwright Ariel Dorfman - perhaps most famous for his play Death and the Maiden - grew up in both Chile and the US, and this collection tells of the interwoven politics of the \"many Americas\" he has experienced (not just the one that \"immediately sweeps so many other Americans from sight just by appropriating that term\"). This mixed bag of non-fiction and a few poems is most riveting for its analysis of culture through its bifocal frame - such as its Latin American reading of ET, musings on the cosmopolitan appeal of Che Guevera and fascinating comparisons between Salvador Allende and Martin Luther King. <strong> JL</strong> </p> <p><strong> Against All Enemies, by Richard A Clarke (Free Press, \u00a38.99)</strong> </p> <p> These are the memoirs of the former boss of US national security, with polemic intent - starting with the 1979 Iranian revolution and ending with the exit of Clarke and his slowly recruited team in desperate exasperation. A decade of efforts to establish the basis of US security at home and abroad was finally derailed by the diversion of the neocon Iraqi adventure and dissipated in bureaucratic wrangles. The 20 years of cock-ups detailed here are more frightening even than the conspiracies - the lack of preparation for deliberate disasters is awesome - and all are described in a skilled thriller-writer's style. It's terrific on operational bathos, such as the missile strike on Iraq's intelligence headquarters in 1993 that Bill Clinton confirmed by contacting CNN, who called a cameraman in Jordan, who phoned his cousin in Baghdad. Ah, real life. VR</p>",
  "<p>The American economy has failed to give George Bush a pre-election boost as figures out yesterday showed slower than expected growth in the third quarter of the year. </p> <p>Separate data showed consumer confidence wilting under the effect of high oil prices, which have pushed the price of petrol at the pumps above the $2 a gallon level. </p> <p>The economy has featured heavily in the election campaign as Democratic presidential challenger John Kerry has tried to make political capital out of weak jobs growth in the US this year in spite of the economic recovery. </p> <p>The US economy expanded at an annualised rate of 3.7% in the June to September period, up from the 3.3% of the second quarter but well below the average economist forecast of 4.2% and considerably slower than growth over the previous year. </p> <p>The slight pick up was driven by strong consumer spending, particularly on cars, as car makers again enticed motorists with tempting financing deals in an effort to shift bloated stocks. </p> <p>The latest growth rate is still respectable and in line with the long-run average for the world's largest economy, but many economists expect the 70% increase in the price of oil this year to slow growth sharply in the fourth quarter. </p> <p>\"I think it shows, as the Fed indicated, that the economy regained some traction in the third quarter, but the growth is not robust,\" economist Gary Thayer of A.G. Edwards and Sons in St. Louis said. \"I think it means the Fed can take its time raising rates.\" </p> <p>The US Federal Reserve has raised interest rates three times this year to 1.75% and there is much debate about how fast and how far it will raise borrowing further, especially as many pundits think rising oil and the fading impact of tax cuts are going to slow the US economy. </p> <p>Another quarter-point increase, which would take rates to 2%, is widely expected at the next Fed meeting on November 10 but the Fed is expected to hold off at its December meeting. </p> <p>The gross domestic product data showed the lowest core inflation reading for decades, something that will cheer the inflation-conscious central bank. </p> <p>Paul Ashworth, an analyst at Capital Economics in London, said overall the figures were not too bad. </p> <p>\"However, the real bad news will come in the fourth quarter, when we expect higher oil prices to cut growth to 1.5%.\" </p> <p>Oil prices have risen more than 70% this year and earlier this week US light crude set a record high of $55.67 a barrel, although it had fallen back towards $51 by yesterday. </p> <p>Economists blamed the rise in oil prices and persistent worries about jobs for a drop in a measure of US consumer sentiment. The University of Michigan's confidence index dropped to 91.7 in October, down from 94.2 in September.</p>",
  "Lisa Johnson made the same trip I did. But while it has taken me a month to get from Boston she and her husband drove down in just three days. It was 1980, she was 28 and he had landed a job in the booming oil industry in Midland. <p>\"I thought I was coming for one year,\" she says. \"That was the agreement. All the way through Texas I was fine. But when I came into town and saw all the oil tanks I just started crying. It was pretty ugly and you could smell the oil.\" </p> <p>If you cannot find a way to love oil - the industry that produces it, the environment that it scars and the money that it makes - then you will probably never find a way to love Midland. </p> <p>Rising from the West Texas desert like a small Gulf state, your entrance to the town is flanked by restless, bobbing, pumping jacks and vast shrubland pockmarked with derricks. </p> <p>Along with Odessa, it's poorer, even uglier sister city 16 miles away, Midland sits in the heart of the Permian Basin - a 1000-mile platform of sediment and salt with a slab of rock on top that is home to one fifth of the country's oil reserves. Between them they boast more than 2,000 firms involved in the oil and gas industry. </p> <p>And according to United States president, George Bush, if you don't find a way to appreciate Midland then you will struggle to find a way to appreciate him. </p> <p>\"I don't know what percentage of me is Midland,\" he once said in an interview, \"but I would say people, if they want to understand me, need to understand Midland and the attitude of Midland.\" </p> <p>The percentage matters. Mr Bush was not born here but in New Haven, Connecticut. Nor does he live here now. When he is not in Washington DC, his home is 330 miles away on a ranch in Crawford, also in Texas. </p> <p>In fact, his relationship to Midland is quite episodic. He came here as a two-year-old, attended the Sam Houston elementary school and then San Jacinto junior high (both state schools). He returned 16 years later in 1975 and married a local woman, Laura Welch. In 1987 he left to help his father on his presidential campaign and has only returned to campaign and visit friends and in-laws. </p> <p>\"He was viewed as an outsider,\" says Jim Brown, a geologist who did business with Mr Bush in the 80s. \"Midland has embraced him as a native son now because he was governor of Texas and now he's president. But back then, to the few people who knew who he was, he was just a rich Yankee kid.\" </p> <p>His Democratic challenger, John Kerry, has a stronger claim to Boston, where he has lived and worked since he returned from the Vietnam war. But while Mr Kerry holds Boston at arms length, lamenting the fact that he \"moved around a lot\" as a child, Mr Bush holds Midland in a bear hug. </p> <p>He has written the city into his personal story as though its mores were seared into his soul. \"There's a West Texas populist streak in me and it irritates me when people come out to Midland and look at my friends with the utmost disdain,\" he told Texas Monthly. When he dies, he says, he wants to be buried in Midland. </p> <p>To his critics these are just more examples of Mr Bush's bid to shed his blueblood background. In 1978 the Democrat Kent Hance inflicted the only electoral defeat Mr Bush has ever suffered, largely by portraying him as a carpet-bagging, Ivy League Yankee. </p> <p>Mr Bush learned his lesson well. But Mr Bush certainly has an emotional claim to the place. Midland is where Mr Bush found a wife, God and gave up the bottle. </p> <p>In 1969 the cultural geographer DW Meinig described Midland as \"the purest example of white Anglo Saxon Protestant culture in Texas\". One of the last cities in the country to desegregate its elementary schools, today it is almost 40% black and Hispanic. </p> <p>But while the colour of the inhabitants may have changed, many of its customs have not. On Friday nights thousands pack the local Grande stadium for high school football. On Sunday mornings they go to church. It's a no-nonsense place where, during the 80s, business was often concluded on a handshake. \"People here are generally friendly,\" says John Nute, who runs a cafe in Wall Street. \"But there's an edge to that. One of the first questions you're asked when you come here is, what church do you go to? If you're answer is one they don't like then you never see them again.\" </p> <p>Oil and money may dominate, but one in eight of the city lives in poverty, most of them quite literally on the wrong side of the rail tracks. \"I doubt he even knew those places existed,\" says Midge Erskine, who knew Laura Bush's mother. \"It's a very segregated town. Over the years the town's ambivalent self-regard has been reflected in its changing slogans. They have included: \"Midland: In the Middle of Somewhere\"; \"Midland: Most Ambitious City Between the Oceans\"; and recently, \"The Sky's The Limit\" - a slogan from the 70s when the oil prices were so high that loan officers needed permission to turn you down - has been revived after Mr Bush said it encapsulated the Midland he knew. It's not difficult to see why Mr Bush would want to mythologise both the town and himself in this way. </p> <p>What is more baffling is that he has managed to get away with it, given that Midland was the site of his most conspicuous failures to date. </p> <p>He set up an oil business, Arbusto, which failed. He ran to represent the area in Congress and lost. By all accounts he had plenty of chances, did not work hard and never succeeded at anything much. \"He used to come into meetings still hung over and you'd see him fall asleep,\" says Mr Brown. \"Then when it was over he'd kind of jolt up and walk out with his team.\" </p> <p>But the nature of each setback and the manner in which he recovered are themselves revealing. Mr Bush is no self-made man. His father arrived in the early 50s and used the finance capital from his family to make millions. </p> <p>When Mr Bush arrived as a young man, 20 years later, his father was a former Congressman and ambassador, soon to become the vice-president. And in Midland connections are everything. \"If a Harvard MBA came to Midland without connections he wouldn't be able to raise the kind of money Bush did,\" says Mr Rosen. </p> <p>But while connections could provide Mr Bush with the money he needed it was not enough to guarantee him success. His father's picture hangs in the Petroleum Museum's hall of fame, but his will not be there any time soon. </p> <p>Mr Brown says Mr Bush's plans were flawed because they were based on \"poor science\". But the firm Mr Brown worked for invested in the projects anyway. </p> <p>\"It was a way of funnelling money to the Bushes without looking like it. His expertise was socialising.\" </p> <p>What is most remarkable about Mr Bush's relationship with Midland is that, despite the fact the he achieved so little, drank so much, lost an election and a lot of other people's money, pretty much everybody liked him. </p> <p>\"You never walked away from George Bush thinking he was a rotten individual,\" says Mr Brown. \"You thought he was your friend, your pal, your chum.\" </p> <p>In other words Midlanders liked him, not because of what he had achieved, but regardless of what he had not achieved. On Tuesday we will see if America will feel the same way.</p>",
  "Plenty of Americans believe it is none of our business whom they elect as their leader on Tuesday. But there are two underlying reasons why any presidential election matters to the rest of the world. The first concerns America's power. There is no nation in the history of the planet whose strength and actions more directly affect the whole human race than the United States. To an unprecedented degree, America makes the world's weather. Its economic, military and cultural might shapes our lives. If America goes to war, we are all embroiled, as the events of the past three years have certainly shown. If the American economy booms or busts, then ours follows suit. If America spurns global agreements on climate change, the whole planet is more vulnerable. Even our domestic politics are shaped by theirs, as the last three years have again dramatically proved. We may not have a vote, but our interests are at stake on November 2, as surely as if we lived in Ohio, Oklahoma or Oregon ourselves. <p>The second reason, more controversially for some, concerns America's example. There has never been a nation like the United States. Its creation was, at least arguably, the single greatest constitutional achievement of mankind in the last millennium. From the earliest days until now, the eyes of all people have indeed been upon America, just as John Winthrop claimed four centuries ago. We can debate whether the greatest of all US presidents was right to see America as \"the last best hope of mankind\". But it is a matter of fact that successive generations on every continent have shared Abraham Lincoln's optimism about his homeland, that they have been inspired by American opportunity and freedom, and that new generations continue to be so. Few nations may have been so fundamentally shaped by racial injustice as the US was, but none in the history of the world has ultimately made a greater success of mass migration and of multi-cultural life either. Anti-Americanism may be more rife than ever in many parts of our world, but even where it is strongest it is a matter of record that millions of people in these very same societies admire America above all other nations. </p> <p>Since at least 1945, when the United States played the decisive role in creating the United Nations, an American presidential election has always been the single most influential event in the global political cycle. No such election, though, has mattered as overwhelmingly and urgently as this one. Four years ago, George Bush was beaten in the popular vote nationwide, yet captured the presidency because of electoral abuse in Florida and a shoddy legal judgment by the nation's highest court. Ever since, far from governing in the unifying manner that would have been appropriate in the circumstances (and that he briefly promised), he has done the opposite. But if Mr Bush has been partisan and confrontational at home - over the federal budget, education, race, civil liberty, the environment and a host of other social and cultural issues - he has been every bit as partisan and confrontational abroad. The attack of September 11 2001, an event of historic seriousness, created an unprecedented outpouring of solidarity worldwide. Three years later, much of that solidarity has been squandered. This has happened largely as a result of a war on Iraq that was not just ill-prepared and ill-executed in its own terms but that also exemplified the administration's aggressive contempt towards other nations, with disastrous consequences that continue to this day. </p> <p>To adapt the words of Talleyrand, the Bush presidency has been not merely a crime but a mistake. Mr Bush has proved a terrifying failure in the world's most powerful office. He has made the world more angry, more dangerous and more divided - not less. This, above all, is why it matters to us, as it should to Americans, that John Kerry is elected on Tuesday. A safer world requires not just the example of American power but the power of American example. Mr Bush has done more to destroy America's good name in the world than any president in memory. Mr Kerry provides an opportunity to begin to repair the damage. It is as simple - and as important - as that.</p>",
  "Al-Jazeera tonight aired a video of Osama bin Laden directly admitting for the first time that he carried out the September 11 attacks and criticising George Bush. <p>It was the first footage of the al-Qaida leader to surface in more than a year. </p> <p>The video, in which Bin Laden referred to next week's US presidential election, showed Bin Laden in traditional white robes, a turban and a cloak reading from papers and standing in front of a plain, brown cloth background.</p> <p>Bin Laden said: \"We decided to destroy towers in America\" out of frustration over what many Arabs see as America's pro-Israeli Middle East policies.</p> <p>He said the attack was carried out because \"we are a free people ... and we want to regain the freedom of our nation.\"</p> <p>He accused Mr Bush of \"misleading\" the American people in the years since the 2001 suicide airline hijackings that hit New York's World Trade Center and the Pentagon.</p> <p>Addressing the American people, he said: \"Your security is not in the hands of (Democratic candidate John) Kerry or (President George ) Bush or al-Qaida. Your security is in your own hands ....\" </p> <p>He said \"best way to avoid another disaster\" was to avoid provoking Arab anger. </p> <p>\"Liberals do not neglect their security, contradicting Bush, who says that we hate freedom,\" Bin Laden said.</p> <p>Al-Jazeera, based in Qatar, did not say how it had received the tape. The channel has previously broadcast audio and video tapes from members of al-Qaida. It aired about a minute of Bin Laden's comments, but did not say if that was the entire tape.</p>",
  "The group that claimed responsibility for the abduction of three UN workers in Afghanistan threatened today to kill the captives unless Nato and Afghan troops call off their search. <p>The development came after police investigating the kidnapping set up roadblocks around the capital, Kabul, and arrested seven people, including three armed men wearing military-style uniforms. </p> <p>They were seized along with a black pickup truck bearing defence ministry number plates - matching descriptions of the vehicle used in yesterday's kidnapping - according to sources quoted by Reuters. </p> <p>The hunt for the kidnap gang was centred on the Paghman valley, west of Kabul, where the arrests were made. </p> <p>But a spokesman for the Jaish-e-Muslimeen (Army of Muslims), the breakaway Taliban faction that claims to be holding the foreigners, today warned government forces to stop hunting for the kidnap gang and the hostages.</p> <p>\"We demand the search is stopped,\" he told Reuters. \"If the US and Afghan forces find our Mujahideen (holy warriors) during operations, we will kill them.\" The group did not make any demands for the release of the hostages and offered no proof to verify its claims.</p> <p>The victims were working for a joint UN-Afghan commission overseeing the landmark presidential elections that took place earlier this month. </p> <p>The final results of the historic October 9 poll, due in the coming days, are expected to confirm US-backed interim leader Hamid Karzai as the nation's first elected president.

  "Chuck Broerman does not expect to get much sleep between now and November 2. His Republican party election office has even printed a t-shirt that sums up their 96-hour final push for George Bush and Colorado Senate hopeful Pete Coors: \"No sleep... I'm Bushed and I need a Coors.\" <p>Broerman operates out of a busy, ramshackle office in downtown Colorado Springs, 60 miles south of Denver. Today he is juggling a last-minute trip by school children, who are being introduced to the democratic process by watching the volunteers in action. They wander happily around the office, munching orange slices and learning about the importance of phone banking.</p> <p>As the vice chairman of the Colorado Republican party, Broerman and his team have been charged with turning out the vote in the Springs and surrounding El Paso county, one of the largest Republican counties in the US. Even Colorado's major north-south corridor, I-25, is known as the Ronald Reagan highway for the duration of El Paso county. </p> <p>Broerman confidently predicts that Bush will take between 65% and 70% of El Paso county's vote, but winning here is not his concern, it's raising the numbers. Every Republican he can persuade, nag or drag into the polls by Tuesday will cancel out a vote in the next county south, the heavily Democratic Pueblo county. </p> <p>Colorado Springs is staggeringly beautiful, snuggled up to the Rocky Mountains and dominated by the imposing, 14,000-ft presence of Pikes Peak. The view from the top in 1893 inspired Katharine Lee Bates to write America the Beautiful, and today, with a clear sky and unseasonably warm t-shirt weather, it's easy to see her point. </p> <p>Maybe it was the patriotism inspired by the view that first brought the military to Colorado Springs. By now, 40% of the local economy is tied to the five military bases that surround the town, including the air force academy and the hollowed-out Cheyenne Mountain complex that houses the North American aerospace defence command (Norad). In addition, the Springs is one of the largest military retiree communities in the US.</p> <p>Unsurprisingly then, Broerman says the town has been preoccupied with the war on terror and Iraq. Jobs and healthcare have not played so big here, he says, as the area has seen the economy improving.</p> <p>Colorado Springs has a second major demographic that makes it a Republican stronghold: evangelical Christians. A gleaming complex beneath Pikes Peak houses the worldwide headquarters and 1300 employees of focus on the family, a ministry founded by former paediatrician James Dobson. </p> <p>Ronald Reagan, George Bush Snr and the current president all feature in the introductory video screened at the ministry's visitor centre. Without directly endorsing Bush, the message from the centre is very much one of opposition to abortion, gay marriage and stem cell research. </p> <p>Driving south towards Pueblo later in the day, I hear a focus on the family programme on local radio, encouraging voters to pay special attention to their local elections. The show makes the important and often overlooked point that local choices will directly impact families by determining the direction of schools, libraries and other civic institutions. It is easy to forget about the school board race in the presidential fervour, the show says, but even John Kerry got where he is today by first winning a local election. </p> <p>Forty miles south of the Springs, things are decidedly less buzzy at the Pueblo office of the Bush campaign. In fact, the place is near deserted. But just around the block, the Kerry office is humming, with volunteers bustling in and out hauling huge campaign signs. </p> <p>Pueblo is a steel town in transition, a city still finding its feet now that the mill has slipped far down the list of major employers. Where downtown Colorado Springs is a renovated area of new shop fronts, downtown Pueblo struggles with empty office buildings and deserted shops. But the town also feels confident and proud in the run up to the election - this, you see, is Salazar country. Ken and John, that is, two brothers from a Colorado farming and ranching family who are running for US Senate and Congress, respectively. </p> <p>Ken Salazar, the man in the white cowboy hat, could well deliver a critical senate seat to the Democrats this election, in a state where registered Republicans well outnumber Democrats. He has been running fairly even with Pete Coors in the polls, but while Coors may command the respect of voters, Salazar seems to inspire something akin to a cult following. He is spoken of with great affection, and even Republicans admit he is enormously well-liked. </p> <p>Jobs, the economy, healthcare and social security matter to Pueblo, where the Democratic office has heard relatively little about the war on terror and Iraq. </p> <p>Thirty eight percent of Pueblo residents are Hispanic, and there is a tendency to put Salazar's support down to ethnic identification, and Kerry's support down to Salazar's popularity. But Judy Madrid, a volunteer at the Democrat office in Pueblo, dismisses that.</p> <p>\"People support the Salazars because they're always here, they've not forgotten their roots. It's because they care about the people,\" she says. \"And I believe Colorado will go for Kerry.\"</p>",
  "If you aren't already addicted, take a look at the electoral college vote tracker featured on the <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com\"> LA Times</a> website. Forget Doom or Grand Theft Auto, this is where it's at when it comes to interactive computer fun. <p>This vote tracker offers the mildly obsessed hours of fun and the seriously compulsive politics-watcher a simple way to avoid all other avenues of their life. </p> <p>Barely a week before D-Day, the presidential contest is so deadlocked that only a fool would predict victory or defeat. However, Vote Tracker allows you to process the outcome.</p> <p>Once you get past the irksome registration process you'll find the vote tracker map on the bottom right of the home page. </p> <p>Shut the blinds, disconnect the phone; re-loadable drama and intrigue are but a mouse click away. The map opens up to show the 50 states, colour-coded to match their current allegiance, or left white if still up for grabs. Graze the cursor over any state on the map, and (here's what makes this site different from lesser models out there) the very latest state - wide polling data appears. </p> <p>Then, armed with nothing but this data and your gut feeling, you get to decide how the game will end. The map creators have been generous in allocating toss-up states, leaving 19 states blank for you to play with. </p> <p>So you may very quickly give Washington and Oregon to Kerry, Nevada, Arizona and Missouri to Bush. Head east and you'll have no problem calling New Hampshire (in play until a few days ago) for Kerry, West Virginia for Bush.</p> <p>The electoral college vote tracker calculator automatically updates the vote tally on the right of your screen. Bush now has 212 to Kerry's 175.</p> <p>You may be quite proud of yourself, having whittled down the focus to a dozen states, but this is where the fun really begins; figuring out the last 12 is what separates the men from the boys.</p> <p>At this point it's best to step away from the keyboard, crack your knuckles, blow on your fingertips and perform any other good luck rituals before resuming play. </p> <p>Let's start in the industrial Midwest. Michigan was veering towards Bush a couple of weeks ago, then moved back into the Kerry column and is now a dead heat again. On recent voting history Michigan should go Kerry's way. Pennsylvania has tightened up after leaning to Kerry in the last few days, but Nader is not on the ballot, so we'll give it to Kerry. Neighbouring Ohio should go to Kerry, where he's holding a slim lead.</p> <p>Bush and Kerry keep swapping positions in Wisconsin, a state that hasn't gone for a Republican President since Ronald Reagan. Traditional urban centres have depopulated to form new \"exurban\" townlets with new voting patterns that will have political scientists reassessing their assumptions there.</p> <p>To play this game, however, you can't be afraid of making a few assumptions. Let's assume Wisconsin breaks precedent and goes to Bush. Let's give New Mexico - where Kerry has a two point edge and a friendly governor - to Kerry. Let's assume Iowa - despite voting Democrat in the last 4 elections, but where the candidates are neck and neck - finally breaks Bush's way. </p> <p>Let's give Minnesota - deadlocked until this week, but now leaning to Kerry and a solidly Democratic state for over 30 years - to the Democrat. Lets predict New Jersey - dead even, but historically Democratic - finally sides with Kerry. And let's call Colorado - also dead even - but trending Republican in recent elections - for Bush.</p> <p>Now take a well deserved break and head to Hawaii. Hawaii is hopelessly tied with 12% undecided. 12%! What are they smoking in Hawaii to make 12% of the electorate incapable of making up their mind? Lets take a flyer with Hawaii, where Republicans haven't tasted victory since 1956, and give Hawaii's four votes to Bush.</p> <p>Checking our vote tally, we now stand at Kerry 263, Bush 242. Both candidates are looking for the magic minimum of 270 to go over the top. There are 33 votes still to be had: 27 in Florida and six in Arkansas.</p> <p>Remember to keep breathing. OK, here goes, we're going for broke now. The latest Arkansas polls have Kerry and Bush tied. Surely Bubba - looking a bit pasty after heart surgery - can still nudge his home state over to Kerry. </p> <p>So now it's down to Florida. If Jeb Bush can't make sure his state votes right for his big brother, it's going to be an uncomfortable turkey dinner for him at the Bush family Thanksgiving get-together. Recent polls have given the state to both candidates.</p> <p>If Bush holds Florida the candidates are tied at 269 apiece; a stunning turn of events, the like of which has not happened since 1800, but certainly not out of the question. A helpful pop-up box appears on the screen explaining how the election is now thrown into the hands of a Republican-led Congress. Bottom line, in this scenario, Kerry must take Florida to win. </p> <p>Or you can reload the map and start again, making for hours more harmless fun until November 2, if the outcome weren't so momentous, that is.</p> <p><b>\u00b7</b>Philip James is a former senior Democratic party strategist.</p>",

  "Eminem has become the latest music star to weigh in on this year's presidential election. In a video for his new single, Mosh, the singer takes George Bush to task for raising taxes and waging the war in Iraq. <p>\"Strap him with AK-47, let him go/Fight his own war, let him impress daddy that way,\" a cartoon version of the rapper sings of the president, as he mobilises a mob of young voters. </p> <p>The video is Eminem's most directly political work. It comes as other stars, from Bruce Springsteen to Leonardo DiCaprio, take to the stump - almost exclusively for Mr Kerry. </p> <p>The video was first aired on MTV on Wednesday and immediately went to the top of the channel's \"hot video\" charts. </p> <p>In it, the rapper leads a crowd of hooded people, including a mother with an eviction notice and a soldier given orders to return to Iraq, in a march to storm a government building. Once inside, the mob remove their hoods and stand in an orderly queue to vote. </p> <p>Eminem, now wearing a smart suit and red tie, declaims in a style reminiscent of Martin Luther King:</p> <p> \"In these closing statements, if they should argue, let us beg to differ, as we set aside our differences, and assemble our own army, to disarm this weapon of mass destruction that we call our president, for the present.\" </p> <p>The video was made by the Guerrilla News Network, a small independent company that has produced other music videos as well as a documentary about the dangers of depleted uranium in Iraq after the US-led invasion. </p> <p>\"We're responsible for this monster, this coward, that we have empowered,\" Eminem sings over a monotonous, stirring beat. \"How could we allow something like this, without pumping our fist?/Now this is our final hour.\" </p> <p>The climax to the video comes as the crowd faces riot police. As images of Mr Bush and Osama bin Laden flicker on a giant screen, the rapper sings: \"No more blood for oil, we got our own battles to fight on our soil/No more psychological warfare to trick us to think that we ain't loyal/If we don't serve our own country we're patronising a hero/Look in his eyes, it's all lies, the stars and stripes/They've been swiped, washed out and wiped, And replaced with his own face.\" </p> <p>The video ends with a black screen and the words \"Vote November 2\".</p>",
  "<p>George Bush's campaign team has been forced to pull a television advert after admitting a picture of the president addressing the troops in Iraq had been digitally enhanced.</p> <p>The election ad showed President Bush addressing the Republican National Convention before cutting to a photograph of a group of soldiers at a rally in New York.</p> <p>But the liberal weblog, DailyKos, showed that the same faces appeared several times in several different places within the same crowd shot.</p> <p>A spokesman for the Bush campaign said the original photograph had been altered because the president and his podium obscured part of the crowd of soldiers.

  "President Bush's election campaign received support from an unusual quarter last week when Hasan Rowhani, head of the Iranian Supreme National Security Council, said that four more years of George W would be good for Iran. Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian leader, was asked about the Bush-Kerry contest at a meeting with journalists a couple of weeks ago (before he was taken ill) and replied: \"It makes no difference.\" <p>In London, the consensus among Arab ambassadors - though they don't say so publicly - is that keeping Bush in the White House would be preferable to starting afresh with Kerry.</p> <p>Such views are probably not what most people would expect to hear. Bush denounced Iran in his famous \"axis of evil\" speech and has been making hostile noises about it ever since. He has cold-shouldered Arafat and more or less washed his hands of the Israeli-Palestinian peace process. More generally, as far as the Arab world is concerned, he has spared no effort to make himself the most unpopular American president ever.</p> <p>Disliking Bush is one thing, but working up enthusiasm for Kerry is another - and there's little sign of that in the Middle East. What interests Arabs most is America's attitude towards the Palestinian people. Although the US under a President Kerry might be expected to re-engage in the peace process, Kerry's emphatically-declared support for Israel does not inspire Arabs with hopes of an even-handed approach.</p> <p>Also pointing in Bush's favour is the popular Arab view that second-term American presidents are better placed to take a firm line with Israel than first-term presidents. The theory is that in their second term they no longer need to please the Israeli lobby in the US because they cannot seek re-election again. Although the examples of Jimmy Carter and George Bush Sr tend to disprove this theory, it's widely believed nevertheless. Bush gains, too, from the argument that says it's best to stay with the devil you know. Arab politicians and diplomats are fond of the status quo (look how long most of them have had their jobs) and, after four years adjusting to life under Bush, they would rather not embark on a new learning curve now with Kerry.</p> <p>In any case, the influential Egyptian daily, al-Ahram, sees no substantial difference between Bush and Kerry, and has declared its support for Ralph Nader (of Lebanese descent), describing him as the only candidate who \"responds to Arab-American interests and positions on Palestine, Iraq, civil liberties and world-wide respect for international law\".</p> <p>While agreeing that there may be little difference between Bush and Kerry on Israeli-Palestinian policy, Albert Aghazerian, a Palestinian-Armenian historian, detects a difference in their general attitude. </p> <p>\"It's a difference regarding people who have taken it upon themselves to act as if they are the liberators of the world,\" he said in an interview with the web magazine Bitter Lemons. \"For all his faults, I don't think Kerry will ignore the lessons that we have learnt throughout history. The Bush people think they have a self-righteous justification to go and change the course of things. This messianic spirit, I think, is less in Kerry than it is in Bush ... I believe that Bush has broken the basic rules of common sense ... it has to do with this messianic approach.\"</p> <p>Bush's messianic view, some argue, will bring more polarisation in the Middle East if he gets a second term, simultaneously benefiting the most impatient reformers and the Islamist militants: the reformers will be encouraged by continuing US pressure on Arab regimes, while al-Qaida and its likes will look to Bush for further help with their recruiting.</p> <p>There are various other sectional interests that could gain from keeping Bush in the White House. Bush's relaxed environmental policies benefit the oil-producing countries (as do the current high oil prices). Bush is less likely than Kerry to trouble Arab governments with complaints about human rights, so long as they continue to fight terrorism, and there are many Lebanese who welcome American efforts to stop Syria interfering in Lebanon's affairs.</p> <p>As far as Iraq and the presidential election is concerned, the most Machiavellian view was set out recently in the Jordan Times. On the assumption that the war is unwinnable, the writer suggested that electing Kerry now will allow the neoconservatives to blame him for American failure in Iraq and to insist that everything would have worked out fine if only Bush had been given a bit longer:</p> <p>\"Many on the American right still believe that the Vietnam war could have been won if only the spineless traitors of the left had not weakened American 'resolve' - and they say this even though Richard Nixon, who was elected on a promise to end the Vietnam war and presided over the whole latter phase of it, was a Republican. What could they do with a lost war on a Democratic president's watch?\"</p> <p>Far better, then, to keep Bush in power and make him reap the whirlwind. The Iraq quagmire may also explain why Hasan Rowhani and some other Iranian officials (though not, by any means, all of them) would like Bush to have a second term. So long as the US is bogged down in Iraq, it cannot seriously contemplate toppling the regime in Iran - or, for that matter, in Syria. Prospects for the US remaining bogged down look rather better under Bush than Kerry.</p> <p>Some in the Iranian government also think Bush has begun to realise that his hostile policies towards Iran are unlikely to succeed and is therefore likely to adopt a more realistic approach if elected for a second term. If the dominant view of the Bush-Kerry contest in the Middle East is one of overwhelming cynicism, the picture among Arab-Americans - who do, after all, have a say in the outcome - is rather different.</p> <p>Despite Bush's effort to woo them with a with a message of greetings for Ramadan (\"Americans who practise the Islamic faith enrich our society ... Laura joins me in sending our best wishes\"), they overwhelmingly support Kerry.</p> <p>A recent poll of Arab-American voters in four of the states where they are most numerous - Michigan, Florida, Ohio and Pennsylvania - showed 54% backing Kerry and only 28% backing Bush, with the rest undecided or supporting Nader.</p> <p>Arab Americans, though, have different priorities from Arabs in the Middle East. For them, the most important factor in deciding who to vote for is the American economy, followed by terrorism/national security, according to the poll. Iraq came fourth in their list of important issues, and Israeli-Palestinian issues only eighth.</p> <p>The poll was conducted by Zogby International, a Washington-based firm whose boss, John Zogby, is from a prominent Arab-American family. Last week John Zogby's brother, James, who is president of the Arab American Institute, wrote an article for al-Ahram Weekly explaining why he would be voting for Kerry.</p> <p>\"The last four years have had a devastating effect on our nation,\" he wrote. \"They have tested our national unity and our sense of mission. The Bush administration has pursued domestic and foreign policies that have been both neglectful and reckless. Because of reckless tax cuts a record surplus was turned into record deficits.\"</p> <p>Turning to the benefits of electing Kerry and his running-mate John Edwards, he continued: \"Whatever differences I may have with them, I know that they will pursue diplomacy over unilateral military pre-emption. They can be better trusted to find a way out of Iraq than the arrogant crew that got us into that mess in the first place.</p> <p>\"They will protect our civil liberties ... and they will make the pursuit of an Israeli-Palestinian peace a priority rather than a neglected afterthought.\"</p> <p>Optimistic words. But we shall have to wait a few more days to see if Kerry gets a chance to prove them wrong or right.</p>",
  "<p>Has there ever been a more sombre political moment on American campuses as the one seen in the run-up to their country's closely fought presidential election? An <a href=\"http://www.indystar.com/articles/4/189741-4604-098.html\" target_new\">article</a> in the Indianapolis Star sums the mood up well, reporting on the unprecedented activity among students gathering together and debating the issues at institutions of higher learning like Butler, Indiana State and Purdue universities.</p> <p>The same report draws on a fascinating <a href=\"http://technicianonline.com/story.php?id=\" 010420\"\" target_new\">study</a> by <a href=\"http://www.harvard.edu\" target_new\">Harvard University</a>, which shows interest among young voters nationwide has soared to its highest point since 1972, when 18-year-olds first won the right to vote in the US. As many as 80% definitely plan on voting, the study says. Signs of that commitment have surfaced at campuses, with many reporting strong registration drives.</p> <p>Still, the short answer to the initial question appears to be - no. At least not at <a href=\"http://www.msu.edu\" target_new\">Michigan State University</a>, where the relative fortunes of Mr Kerry and President Bush took a back seat this week to another momentous altercation, according to the <a href=\"http://www.statenews.com\" target_new\">State News</a>.</p> <p>The paper reports that an 18-year-old male student was arrested for a domestic assault after a fracas occurred involving a hamster and two campus roommates. The two went home last weekend, leaving a room key with a mutual friend to take care of a pet hamster.</p> <p>When they returned, however, the hamster was missing, and one roommate told police the second roommate was upset and left the room. The other roommate later returned and \"allegedly sprinkled hamster faeces and cage droppings on the first roommate's bed, refusing to clean it off\".</p> <p>The first roommate responded by doing the same to the second bed.</p> <p>Upon finding his bed soiled, the second roommate reportedly threw a chair at the first roommate, hitting him on his right leg. The first roommate told police he pushed the second man to prevent being hit again, and other students entered the room to stop the fight.</p> <p>The second roommate has been arrested for domestic assault. Sadly, there is still no word on the hamster's whereabouts, condition or even the creature's name. </p> <p><strong>Just fancy that</strong><br> \"Theory of Relativity Evidence Found\" - headline, <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A52713-2004Oct21.html\" target_new\">Washington Post</a>, October 22. </p> <p><strong>Great moments in research (1)</strong><br> In Australia, a ground-watering study has found that western women are unable to urinate properly.</p> <p>The study, reported in the <a href=\"http://www.news.com.au/common/story_page/0,4057,11202529%255E1702,00.html\" target_new\">Australian newspaper</a> compares western toilets with what its authors at <a href=\"http://www.jcu.edu.au\" target_new\">James Cook University</a> deemed to be the third world experience. It found that westerners could not hold the squat position for more than 30 seconds without falling over.</p> <p>Ajay Rane, the university's head of obstetrics and gynaecology, oversaw the study, conducted over two years using 100 women. It compared urinating styles using the squatting position and the \"perfect\" position on the conventional toilet, which involved volunteers putting their feet flat on the floor and leaning forward.</p> <p>\"We were quite sure squatting would be far superior to the western toilet position,\" he told the paper. However, \"we have a problem now - one third of the population is unable to squat.\"</p> <p>Also on the investigative front, in Russia, a research chief at the Centre of Ecological Safety and Survival, in Yekaterinburg, claims to have found a scientific basis for his argument that foul language has a pernicious impact on all <a href=\"http://www.123bharath.com/health-india-news/index.php?action=fullnews&amp;id=\" 32792\"\" target_new\">life</a>.</p> <p>According to the report, a scientific team has been investigating the way swearing affects water, which according to the head researcher, Gennady Cheurin, possesses \"memory\".

Among those seeds that have been watered with \"mild foul language\", however, 53% sprouted. And among \"those seeds that have been watered with holy water, 93% sprouted.\"</p> <p>The good news, for non-Russian speakers at least, is that swearing in no other language than Russian \"is capable of doing so much harm to one's body\", according to Dr Cheurin.<br></p> <p><strong>You pays your money...</strong><br> \"College Costs Spike Again\" - headline, <a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/2004/10/18/pf/college/college_costs/?cnn=\" yes\"\" target_new\">CNN/Money</a>, October 19.<br> </p> <p>\"College Costs Level Off - a Little\" - headline, <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2004/10/19/national/main650128.shtml\" target_new\">CBSNews.com</a> October 19.<br> </p> <p>\"Studies: Pace of College Costs on Decline\" - headline, <a href=\"http://news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&amp;u=\" ap 20041019 ap_on_re_us college_costs_3\"\" target_new\">Associated Press</a>, October 19.<br></p> <p>Whatever.

  "Nato troops are hunting for three UN workers, one of them British-Irish, kidnapped in Afghanistan's first Iraqi-style abduction yesterday. <p>Two Islamist groups, one a Taliban faction, claimed responsibility for the midday snatch, which involved up to seven armed men stopping a marked UN vehicle in Kabul and bundling the trio into a Jeep, witnesses said. </p> <p>The armed men, said to be wearing military uniforms, drove towards a semi-lawless area west of Kabul. </p> <p>The victims were identified as Annette Flanagan, from Richhill, Co Armagh, who has dual British-Irish citizenship, Angelito Nayan, a junior Filipina diplomat seconded to the UN, and a woman from the Balkans. All three helped train Afghan election officials for the October 9 presidential poll. </p> <p>The foreign secretary, Jack Straw, said he was in touch with Ms Flanagan's family. He said he he did not think the kidnapping marked the start of a trend in Afghanistan. </p> <p>The news coincided with reports that two cameramen, one an award-winning documentary-maker based in London, had also been reported missing in the country. </p> <p>Najibullah Quraishi, the winner of the 2002 Rory Peck international journalism award for his coverage of the conflict, was last heard of 10 days ago. Mr Quraishi, who works for the British company Probe TV, was thought to have crossed the Pakistan-Afghanistan border en route to Jalalabad last week but has not made contact with his colleagues or his family. </p> <p>\"We have not heard from him now for 10 days and he has always previously kept in touch with his wife,\" said Jamie Doran of Probe TV, who made the documentary, Afghan Massacre: the Convoy of Death, with Quraishi. </p> <p>Mr Quraishi, who lives in Isleworth, west London, with his wife and three children, is understood to have been planning to meet another cameraman, Aslamouddin Mael. </p> <p>Mr Mael is also missing and his home in Mazar-i-Sharif has been ransacked. His family have fled. The two men are understood to have been examining fresh evidence about the massacre of Taliban prisoners in Mazar-i-Sharif at the end of the 2001 conflict. </p> <p>The professionally executed kidnapping of the UN workers has caused jitters in the capital less than a week after a suicide bombing in a busy shopping precinct killed two. </p> <p>A spokesman for the unknown Islamic Army Group told an al-Jazeera reporter in Kabul it had taken the hostages and would issue demands. But a Taliban splinter group, Jaish-e-Muslimeen, also claimed responsibility. </p> <p>A British official said yesterday the capabilities of the Taliban had been eroded, as seen in its failure to disrupt the recent election. He put its membership \"in the high hundreds or very low thousands\". </p> <p>He said the group's failure to mount a serious attack during the election may have pushed it to carry out the kidnappings to make its presence felt. </p> <p>Meanwhile, new US and UN statistics show a big rise in the amount of land under cultivation for drug production. </p>",
  "Today in Rome the prime ministers of 25 European nations gather to sign up to a common constitution and to commit themselves to the same standards of human rights and democratic values. <p>Pause a while to contemplate the remarkable transformation of European politics which has made this event possible. Most of the countries sitting together in the same council chamber have been at war with each other in living memory, and repeatedly in the century that preceded it. A third of the states affirming the new charter of fundamental rights were satellites of the Soviet Union within the past generation, and denied both individual rights and national self-determination. </p> <p>Another two were victims of the last fascist dictatorships in Europe, and a third was ruled by a military junta. The evolution of our continent into a partnership of nations which guarantees human rights and banishes war is an extraordinary achievement, which previous generations would have regarded with envy. </p> <p>Yet how many voices will be heard in Britain hailing today's event as a triumph? Any brave soul murmuring that there may be something positive to be said for a Europe of peace and democracy will be drowned out by the blast of amplified heckling from the Daily Mail, the Murdoch press, and the post-Hollinger Telegraph. The Mail has dubbed the European constitution as the greatest threat to confront us for a thousand years. It takes a high degree of perversity to regard a charter of human rights as a greater threat to our country than the Norman Conquest, the Spanish Armada or the London Blitz. </p> <p>But their appeal to a past millennium betrays what drives their resistance to European integration - a misplaced nostalgia for the outdated world of freestanding nations. It is an era that has vanished. We are all interdependent now. The Eurosceptics bitterly complain that membership of the European Union requires us to compromise with others and to give up going our own way, but those are necessary conditions of life in an interdependent world. In truth it is not the rules of the EU that the Eurosceptics dislike, but the reality of that modern world. </p> <p>It is a paradox that the European constitution should have become the target for attack by those who complain most volubly about a slide into a federal Europe. They should be welcoming a constitution that delivers a hard knock to federalism and tilts the balance of power towards member states. The biggest innovation to the institutions of Europe will be a full-time president of the council of ministers based in Brussels, in place of the rotation of the presidency every six months between prime ministers based in the distant capital of their country. The new animal in the Brussels jungle will produce a further shift of initiative away from the commission and to the council, which represents the member states. In the argot of Brussels, the future direction of the EU will be less supranational and more intergovernmental. </p> <p>It is that kind of impenetrable language that has helped create the barriers between the European project and the people it is supposed to serve. Electorates across the continent do not feel they have ownership of the EU, and the scenes on television bulletins tonight may only serve to confirm their suspicion that it is the property of top politicians meeting in exclusive venues. Europe's leaders need to spend less time revising the rules under which they hold meetings, and put an awful lot more energy into convincing their voters that the outcome of those meetings is in their interest. </p> <p>Holding a referendum on the European constitution is not necessarily the smartest way of setting about that task. It runs the risk of confirming the stereotype of the EU as a remote body whose primary purpose is extruding lengthy texts rather than a valuable organisation to promote trade and jobs, protect the environment and raise standards of employee rights. </p> <p>However, defeat in the referendum would be a dire reverse in the long march to persuade Britain to be comfortable with its place at the European table. Most of the European constitution is not new at all. Three-quarters of it is a consolidation of all the European treaties going back over half a century. Vote no to the European constitution and you reject everything we have signed up to over a generation. A focus of the Mail assault has been the provision that European law takes primacy over domestic legislation, but that has been the rule ever since we joined in 1975. If Britain votes no on those grounds we are rejecting the very basis on which we became members. </p> <p>It is a chimera to imagine that we could then merrily continue to trade the great majority of our exports to the rest of Europe, while sidestepping any political cooperation. Telling the continent \"Get lost, but keep buying British\" is unlikely to work with our European neighbours. Nor should the Murdoch attempt to design a business Europe shorn of its social dimension have any appeal to the British left. </p> <p>This brings us to the positive reason why the left should welcome today's adoption of the European constitution. The progressive case for supporting the constitution is that it expresses values and goals of the European social model. It defines the values of the EU as \"respect for human dignity, liberty, democracy, equality, the rule of law and human rights\". It sets full employment as a goal of the EU and commits it to \"combat social exclusion and discrimination\" and to \"promote social justice\". </p> <p>Its charter of fundamental rights embraces economic and social rights, such as limitations on working time, the right to consultation at work and the right to social security out of work. Indeed, one of the most bitter complaints of the right about the constitution is that it explicitly enshrines the right to strike. </p> <p>The strategic case for reaffirming those European social values is that for the past four years they have been under siege by a US administration which has demonstrated an evangelical zeal for reshaping the world in the image of Texas. The lesson of the recent past is that when Europe is divided its views can be ignored and its values can be undermined. The left, more than anyone else, should support a constitution for a strong Europe that can offer a multilateral partnership in place of Bush's unilateralism, and our social model as an alternative to his version of feral capitalism. </p> <p>Europeans have no vote in next week's presidential election. But we can at least vote on today's constitution, and if the US result goes wrong, it will be all the more important that we affirm our right to different European values. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:r.cook@theguardian.com\">r.cook@theguardian.com</a></p>"

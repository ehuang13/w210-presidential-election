  "When President George Bush landed on the deck of the Abraham Lincoln last May in full battle regalia, under the banner Mission Accomplished, the election looked like a done deal and commentators moved on to the aesthetics. <p>This display of hypermasculinity in the midst of wartime, some concluded, would have a particular appeal for women voters. Republican speechwriter Peggy Noonan said that she half expected Bush to \"tear open his shirt and reveal the big S on his chest\". One Wall Street Journal columnist pronounced him \"a hottie\". Rightwing talkshow host G Gordon Liddy proclaimed that the president \"has just won every woman's vote in the United States of America\". </p> <p>Paradoxically, it seems that the women he appealed to most are those who are already hitched. The women most likely to be on the lookout for a \"hottie\", namely single women, are increasingly devoted to his Democratic rival John Kerry. </p> <p>With six weeks to go before the presidential election, one of the best ways to find out how a woman is likely to vote is to check her ring finger. A recent poll shows Bush ahead of Kerry among married women by 13%, while Kerry has a 25% lead among unmarried women. Indeed, the difference in voting intentions between single and married women - 38% - is far greater than that between men and women, which stands at 5%. </p> <p>What has been described as the \"marriage gap\" could prove crucial, particularly for the Democrats. Women settle on their presidential choice later than men, and so comprise most of the small number of coveted undecided voters that remain. In a race this close, the party that can identify the women who are most likely to identify with the party could make the difference between victory and defeat - so much so that pundits have invented a new political construct just for the occasion. After \"angry white men\" (1994), \"soccer moms\" (1996), the post 9/11 \"security moms\" (2002), and the drag-racing-fanatic \"NASCAR dads\" (2003), there is now the \"Sex and the City voter\". The term may jar, but the phenomenon could provide a jolt. Single women represent at least 24% of the voting-age population and a massive 46% of voting-age women. </p> <p>But if the Democrats are going to win, say the pollsters, they are going to have to woo single women relentlessly. To that end, they launched a programme called Take Five last month, which encourages the faithful to convince five single women who don't usually vote to go to the polls. </p> <p>The marriage gap is not new. But each election year it has grown increasingly huge, more than doubling over the past 20 years. Views differ on why this should be. Some of it can be explained by other demographic factors that are related to, but not defined by, either marital status or gender. According to the census, more than half of unmarried women earn less than $30,000 (\u00a316,800) a year, while more than half of married women have annual household incomes of more than $50,000 (\u00a328,000). And the wealthier you are, the greater the likelihood that you will vote Republican. </p> <p>Personal factors also play a role. Married women often vote the way their husband does. \"I registered Republican when I got married,\" Ginny Savopoulos told USA Today. \"But after I was divorced I was thinking more about, what's out there for me as a single woman?\" After struggling to find work as a paralegal, she was laid off two years ago and remains disenchanted with the war in Iraq. Still registered as a Republican, she plans to vote Democrat. </p> <p>The experience of having children further deepens the divide. Married women with children are even more heavily Republican than those without, while childless single women are even more sympathetic to the Democrats than unmarried mothers. Of the 10 states with the highest birthrates, all but one voted for Bush in 2000. \"Conservative, religious-minded Americans are putting far more of their genes into the future than their liberal and secular counterparts,\" wrote Phillip Longman, a senior fellow at the New America Foundation, in a recent article for the Washington Post. \"If Metros don't start having more children, America's future is Retro.\" </p> <p>But policy issues related to the current political climate also play a role. Married women place a higher priority on the war on terror and are more likely to value Bush's leadership, while single women are more concerned with such issues as health insurance and policing. \"It's not that single women aren't worried about security,\" says Kellyanne Conway, president of WomenTrend, a woman-centred polling organisation. \"But they are more likely to be concerned with job security and whether it's safe to get home than the war on terror. </p> <p>\"They're not so interested in small government because to them, the government is a partner and a safety net. For those women without husbands, Uncle Sam and Big Brother are the greatest protectors.\" </p> <p>The Republicans have adapted their message accordingly. As supporters in Madison Square Garden waved signs declaring \"W is for Women\", Laura Bush's prime-time convention speech was aimed squarely at parents: \"I want to talk about the issue that I believe is most important for my own daughters, for all of our families, and for our future,\" she said. \"George's work to protect our country and defeat terror so that all children can grow up in a more peaceful world.\" </p> <p>But the Republican approach also repels many singles. \"Republicans have this programme of trickle-down dignity,\" says Bella DePaulo, who studies singles' behaviour at the University of California at Santa Barbara and is currently writing a book called Singled Out. \"They portray a woman's life as in a family with mum, dad and the kids and have shut the door on anyone who doesn't fit into that.\" </p> <p>Claudia Bernett, a single, 32-year-old digital designer in New York, plans to vote against Bush. \"I'm not a great fan of Kerry but the Democrats at least say their intentions are to generally take care of people, while the Republicans are so brutal. Abortion is crucially important, but there are other agendas that even exceed that one - we seem to be at a very dangerous moment in time.\" Such views should present an opportunity and a challenge to the Democrats. The main reason the gender gap opened up in the first place, in the 80s, was not because they were doing so well among women but because they were losing so much support among white men, just over a third of whom backed Al Gore at the last election. </p> <p>For while single women are currently much more likely to vote Democrat, they are much less likely to vote at all. In 2000, Gore won the single women's vote by 31%, while Bush had just a 1% lead over married women. The trouble is, that while 62% of married women voted, only 43% of singles did. </p> <p>\"If unmarried women in Florida had turned out in the same percentage as married women, Al Gore would have won the state easily,\" Democrat pollster Celinda Lake said earlier this year. Indeed, if they had turned out at just the statewide average, then Gore would have won by a relatively comfortable 63,000. </p> <p>So why didn't they? Because nobody asks, says DePaulo. \"Just listen to the rhetoric of the politicians,\" she says. \"It's so much family values - it's as though single people don't exist.\" </p> <p>But the Democrats have been slow to grasp the existence, let alone the potential, of this enormous untapped resource. During the Democratic convention Kerry did not emphasise issues such as the economy or health care, which would have appealed to undecided women voters, but instead tried to outmacho Bush with his war record. Since this backfired he has returned to the kind of domestic issues that could well galvanise single women into making up their minds - not between Kerry and Bush, but between Kerry and not bothering. Whether he succeeds or not will largely depend on whether he has anything more to offer them than the chance to put two more men in the White House. </p> <p>\"The trouble with going after single women, those fans of progressive change, is that one has to offer them something progressive,\" wrote Katha Pollitt, a columnist for the leftwing magazine the Nation. </p> <p>\"It will be interesting to see if the Democratic campaign to sign up these voters involves offering them things they want.\"</p>",

  "<p>The US Federal Reserve last night raised interest rates for the third time this year in spite of a renewed surge in oil prices. </p> <p>The widely expected move took the Fed funds' rate up a quarter-point to 1.75%, following similar moves in August and June. </p> <p>The Fed had cut rates last year to a 46-year low of just 1% in an attempt to boost an economy suffering the aftermath of the bursting of the dotcom bubble and the war in Iraq which had dented consumer confidence. </p> <p>This was the last Fed meeting ahead of the November 2 presidential election but is thought unlikely to damage George Bush's chances of re-election, especially as interest rates remain low in historical terms and the economy appears to be recovering from its summer \"soft patch\", as Fed chairman Alan Greenspan described it. </p> <p>The federal open market committee, in a statement accompanying its decision, repeated Mr Greenspan's statement earlier this month that the US economy had \"regained some traction\" and that interest rates were still low and therefore boosting the economy. It repeated its usual statement that it would continue to raise interest rates at a \"measured pace\". It also said its vote for higher rates had been unanimous. </p> <p>Economists were not surprised. \"Greenspan, along with many of his FOMC colleagues, obviously feels that with rates still so low, the Fed should not be swayed by short-term economic fluctuations from its policy of returning rates to more appropriate levels at a measured pace,\" said Paul Ashworth of consultants Capital Economics. </p> <p>The danger to the US economy from rising oil prices was accentuated yesterday as US light crude futures rose nearly $1 a barrel to $47.30, driven by strong Chinese demand, fears over exports from Russian oil group Yukos and damage to offshore US oil rigs from Hurricane Ivan. </p> <p>Greenspan had previously blamed rising oil prices, up 40% this year on strong global demand and tight supply, for the summer slowdown in the US economy. </p> <p>A month ago US light crude set an all-time high of $49.40 a barrel before dropping back towards $40 a barrel. That fall has proved short-lived and oil prices have headed higher again. </p> <p>There was some good news from the US economy, yesterday as the number of new houses being built unexpectedly rose 0.6% to a five-month high of 2m on an annualised basis. Economists said this showed the housing market appeared to be robust in spite of the Fed's rate rises. </p> <p>Economists are divided as to how far and how fast the Fed will raise interest rates. Most see the Fed rate up to 2% by the end of the year and 3% or higher by the end of 2005, depending on the economy, with the big question being consumer spending. </p> <p>\"Consumers continue to suffer under the combined weight of high oil prices, rising interest rates, the fading of the boost from past tax cuts and a faltering labour market,\" said Mr Ashworth. </p> <p>Merrill Lynch economists predict that the Fed will raise rates to 2% on November 10 and then stop. </p> <p>\"Our big-picture analysis is that we think the economic soft patch is turning out to be more than just a patch and that the economy is more vulnerable than the Fed had perceived,\" said Merrill's Kathleen Bostjancic.</p>",
  "Call it Howard Dean's revenge. For when White House hopeful John Kerry finally took the gloves off over Iraq this week, the US presidential campaign came full circle. <p>A year ago, Mr Dean was emerging as the Democratic frontrunner, tapping into grassroots anger over the war. Yet it was Mr Kerry who eventually won the nomination as primary voters opted for the safer, conventional, less confrontational man. </p> <p>The picture looks different now. Mr Kerry's furious, all-out assault on the Bush administration's honesty and competence over Iraq on Monday amounts to a belated endorsement of Mr Dean's main line of attack and is reminiscent of Mr Dean himself. It marks a strategic shift by a Kerry campaign that has so far failed to find a \"killer\" issue and has lost its way - and its poll lead - since the Boston convention in July. </p> <p>Mr Kerry's change of tack - and tone - means Iraq is sure to dominate the closing weeks of the presidential race. And what happens or does not happen in Iraq between now and November 2 may have a decisive impact on the election outcome. </p> <p>The Kerry speech was a total demolition job. George Bush, he said, had \"misled, miscalculated and mismanaged every aspect of this undertaking\". The president's lack of candour, arrogance and outright incompetence - Mr Kerry's own words - has \"created a crisis of historic proportions and the prospect of war with no end\". </p> <p>Mr Kerry's unusually personal attack is certain to provoke a similarly robust Republican response. </p> <p>But after the vice-president, Dick Cheney, claimed that a Kerry victory would result in \"devastating\" new terror attacks on the US, many Democrats will be pleased their man is hitting back. </p> <p>More problematic for Mr Kerry is the perception that, despite his sharpened rhetoric, his ideas about what to do next in Iraq remain dependent on events. Unlike Mr Dean, or Richard Nixon at the height of Vietnam in 1968, Mr Kerry has not promised to end the war or set a date for withdrawal. If his four-point plan worked well, he said cautiously, \"we could begin to withdraw US forces starting next summer and realistically aim to bring all our troops home within the next four years\". </p> <p>Whether this is enough to mobilise the Democratic base remains to be seen. </p> <p>Mr Bush tends to take a more for us or against us view. He consistently claims that \"we are making good progress\" in Iraq, while caricaturing Mr Kerry as a ditherer who prefers Saddam Hussein's dictatorship to freedom and democracy. </p> <p>Events in Iraq will take on even greater importance in this febrile political context, making such simplifications harder to sustain. If ruthless killers such as Abu Musab al-Zarqawi and his gang murder more US hostages, or if US army casualties rise sharply, Americans may turn their anger on the president. Equally, they may rally round the flag and Mr Bush. </p> <p>This divide potentially gives Iraqi insurgents tremendous power to influence the presidential race - and some of them seem sophisticated enough to know how to use it. </p> <p>Nor should the electoral impact of next month's expected trial of Saddam be underestimated. Iraq's interim prime minister, Ayad Allawi, predicts the court case will not last long. A guilty verdict seems certain, after which Saddam could be executed. How will that play in the swing states?</p>",
  "There were few pleasures to be had following Bob Dole's doomed presidential campaign in 1996, but one was the unique brand of anti-charm adopted by the candidate. I was once on the receiving end of it myself, during a stop in New Hampshire. Dole had just inspected a factory and a huddle of reporters gathered to ask some questions. I was only three words into mine when the would-be president cut me off. He'd heard my accent and decided there was no point giving me the time of day. \"No votes in Liverpool,\" he snapped, before calling on the man from the Kansas City Star. <p>I later heard a reporter from Finnish TV dismissed with a crisp \"No votes in Leipzig\". Dole's familiarity with both British accents and European geography may have been slightly off, but the point was clear enough. He was running in an American election: he needed to speak to Americans and Americans alone. No one else mattered. </p> <p>At the time, that logic seemed fair enough. Americans were choosing their own leader to run their own government. Americans would pay the taxes and live with the consequences of their decision. It was up to them. </p> <p>But now I'm not so sure. For who could honestly describe the 2004 contest of George Bush and John Kerry as a domestic affair? There's a reason why every newspaper in the world will have the same story on its front page on November 3. This election will be decisive not just for the United States but for the future of the world. </p> <p>Anyone who doubts it need only look at the last four years. The war against Iraq, the introduction of the new doctrine of pre-emption, the direct challenge to multilateral institutions - chances are, not one of these world-changing developments would have happened under a President Al Gore. It is no exaggeration to say that the actions of a few hundred voters in Florida changed the world. </p> <p>So perhaps it's time to make a modest proposal. If everyone in the world will be affected by this election, shouldn't everyone in the world have a vote? Despite Bob Dole, shouldn't the men who want to be president win the support of Liverpool and Leipzig as well as Louisville and Lexington? </p> <p>It may sound wacky, but the idea could not be more American. After all, the country was founded on the notion that human beings must have a say in the decisions that govern their lives. The rebels' slogan of \"No taxation without representation\" endures two centuries later because it speaks about something larger than the narrow business of raising taxes. It says that those who pay for a government's actions must have a right to choose the government that takes them. </p> <p>Today, people far from America's shores do indeed pay for the consequences of US actions. The citizens of Iraq are the obvious example, living in a land where a vile dictatorship was removed only for a military occupation and unspeakable violence to be unleashed in its place. The would-be voters of downtown Baghdad might like a say in whether their country would be better off with US forces gone. Perhaps John Kerry's Monday promise to start bringing the troops home, beginning next summer, would appeal to them. But they have no voice. </p> <p>It's not just those who live under US military rule who might wish to choose the commander-in-chief. Everyone from Madrid to Bali is now drawn into the \"war on terror\" declared by President Bush. We might believe that war is being badly mishandled - that US actions are aggravating the threat rather than reducing it - and that we or our neighbours will eventually pay the price for those errors. We might fear that the Bush policy is inflaming al-Qaida, making it more not less likely to strike in our towns and cities, but right now we cannot do anything to change that policy. Instead we have to watch the US campaign on TV, with our fingers crossed - impotent spectators of a contest that could shake up our lives. (Those who feel the same way about Tony Blair should remember: at least we will get a vote.) </p> <p>So we ought to hold America to its word. When George Bush spoke to the UN yesterday, he invoked democracy in almost every paragraph, citing America's declaration of independence which insists on the equal worth of every human being. Well, surely equal worth means an equal say in the decisions that affect the entire human race. </p> <p> That 1776 declaration is worth rereading. Its very first sentence demands \"a decent respect to the opinions of mankind\": isn't that exactly what the world would like from America today? The document goes on to excoriate the distant emperor George for his recklessness, insisting that authority is only legitimate when it enjoys \"the consent of the governed\". As the world's sole superpower, the US now has global authority. But where is the consent? </p> <p>By this logic, it is not a declaration of independence the world would be making. On the contrary, in seeking a say in US elections, the human race would be making a declaration of dependence - acknowledging that Washington's decisions affect us more than those taken in our own capitals. In contrast with those founding Americans, the new declaration would argue that, in order to take charge of our destiny, we do not need to break free from the imperial power - we need to tame it. </p> <p>Such a request would also represent a recognition of an uncomfortable fact. It would be an admission that the old, postwar multilateral arrangements have broken down. In the past, America's allies could hope to influence the behemoth via treaties, agreements and the UN. The Bush era - not just Iraq, but Washington's disdain for Kyoto, the test ban treaty, the international criminal court and the rest - suggests that the US will no longer listen to those on the outside. As candidate Dole understood, only those with votes get a hearing. </p> <p>Will this modest proposal fly? Will it hell. Despite Bush's smooth talk in New York yesterday, his position remains that America does not need a \"permission slip\" from anybody to do anything. If Washington won't listen to the security council, it's hardly likely to submit itself to the voters of Paris and Pretoria. </p> <p>Besides, every good Republican knows the world is solid Kerry territory. A survey by pollsters HI Europe earlier this month found that, if Europeans had a vote, they would back Kerry over Bush by a 6 to 1 margin. Bush would win just 6% in Germany, 5% in Spain and a measly 4% in France. No Republican is going to cede turf like that to the enemy. </p> <p>You would think those numbers would hurt Bush, making clear how unpopular he is in the world. But they don't. If anything they hurt Kerry, suggesting he is the candidate of limp-wristed foreigners and therefore somehow less American. We may find that a sorry state of affairs. But there is little we can do about it. In the democratic contest that matters most to the world, the world is disenfranchised. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:freedland@theguardian.com\">freedland@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "Welcome to the Backbencher, Guardian Unlimited's weekly insider's guide to Westminster. <p><b> FROM BOURNEMOUTH</b></p> <p>The Backbencher bumped into Guardian sketchwriter Simon Hoggart on the Bournemouth seafront and asked him how he found this year's Lib Dem conference.</p> <p>\"To say a Liberal Democrat conference has been exciting is a gross exaggeration in any year. But this year it's certainly had a lot more going for it and there's been a lot more zip and pizzazz than we normally get. And that's because it's almost certainly the last conference before the coming general election, and the Lib Dems feel that they're in with a real chance of doing very well indeed. A few decades ago, the party was down to just six seats, but this time it could well reach 60, 70 or even 100.</p> <p>\"The party leadership has been trying to dampen down that kind of speculation. They know that in politics, discounting is everything - if you claim you are about to become second and then you don't, you look like an abject failure. So they want to predict a fairly normal, humdrum, run-of-the-mill result, which in reality will look dazzlingly successful. But they haven't been entirely successful - because these people really do believe that they're in with a chance of destroying the Conservatives as a fighting force in British politics.</p> <p>\"The problem for the leadership is that to do that, they have to win more Tory-held seats than Labour ones. And that seems likely too. In spite of their great success recently in inner city seats, the fact is that it is Tory seats which are most vulnerable to the Lib Dems. Almost all their top 10 target seats are presently held by Tories, so what they're having to do is to move to the right.</p> <p>\"Now everyone says that rightwing and leftwing are meaningless terms these days, which may be true, but what they want to do is become tougher on law and order than the Tories. They want to be more free-market and less geared towards social engineering than Labour. In other words, much more like a safe, cuddly, ameliorative version of the Conservatives. And that will offend a lot of their people. </p> <p>\"They've always been traditionally rather to the left and quite radical, very keen on the environment and certainly extremely sympathetic on law and order. So it's going to be quite a difficult struggle for the leadership to send wild signals to the electorate that the party is just a nicer version of the Tories - while keeping on board their army of loyal people who stuff envelopes, knock on doors and do the hard work of an election campaign.</p> <p>\"People have always had their doubts about Charles Kennedy, and they were exacerbated around a year ago when he seemed to have that health wobble and there were stories of him - not being an alcoholic, exactly, but there was the sense that it was rather like Mastermind - \"once I've started, now I'll finish\" - that once he'd decided to have a few drinks, he had quite a few. But he seems to have reined that in pretty well and he now has a tradition of opening the party conference with a drinks party for journalists at which he's the only one who doesn't drink.</p> <p>\"In any case, in the run-up to an election, party leaders are in a blissful position. No one can get rid of them as the last thing anyone wants is a leadership contest. If they do disappointingly next time - I'd say if they don't get an increase in the order of 20-30 seats - then Charlie is safe. If, heaven forbid, they actually lose seats, I think he'd go quietly, while if they did better than hoped (getting 100+ seats) then you'd see him absolutely set - there for as long as he wants the job.\"</p> <p><b> LAST WEEK'S COMPETITION</b></p> <p>There were almost as many different answers to this question as there were entries, with readers suggesting that MPs have voted on foxhunting as few as two or as many as 11 times. However, the most comprehensive summary came from Stephen Bowden. \"Not counting today's session, MPs have voted on hunting in connection with six Bills since world war two,\" he writes, before going on to list all six occasions. \"Of course the total number of individual votes is much greater than this, what with second readings and the odd third reading, and amendments at report stage, and occasional outbreaks of Bicameral Ping-Pong.\" Let's all be grateful Tony is trying to outlaw that sort of thing and simplify parliamentary democracy for us.</p> <p><b> THIS WEEK'S COMPETITION</b></p> <p>The 38-year-old Lib Dem \"young Turk\" and Niles Crane look-alike David \"Making\" Laws seems to have taken a vow of silence since his suggestion that the NHS be replaced by a compulsory insurance scheme so infuriated party activists. But he hasn't always been so quiet.

Indeed not. The Backbencher certainly hopes Bill's hospital facilities don't include a laptop. The shock of seeing Scott Ritcher's poster, with its radiant heart, might undo the good work of the doctors at New York Presbyterian. \"His timeless, sympathetic words, 'I feel your pain', echo in his reassuring expression,\" explains the site. As for the coaster (USD6) and the lunchbox (USD18) - well, frankly the Backbencher was hoping for a humidor with the ex-president's image, but the best the site can offer is a coffee mug showing US budget deficits since 1901 in graphical format (USD14). Still, the I Love Abortion thong might just give Dick Cheney another heart attack.</p> <p><b> EYES, RIGHT?</b></p> <p>\"I require your help to settle a debate,\" emails a young reader from Heriot-Watt university. \"On <a href=\"http://www2.harrow.gov.uk/mgUserInfo.asp?UID=70\">Harrow council's website</a>, is Eileen Kinnear, Conservative councillor for Harrow on the Hill, wearing glasses or not?\" James, the Backbencher is sure there's a perfectly good explanation for this photograph, but she is currently unable to supply it.</p> <p><b> WISH YOU WERE HERE</b></p> <p>There is nothing the Backbencher enjoys more than kicking off her kitten heels, slipping on a comfy pair of sandals and heading down to the Liberal Democrat conference in Bournemouth. Who would miss this lunchtime's fringe meetings? Hot topics include: how to defuse the obesity time bomb; the public health priority of positive parenting; and encouraging public involvement in the lottery.</p> <p><b> BEYOND OUR KEN</b></p> <p>She was disappointed, however by Ken Livingstone's cancellation of his fringe meeting today, with Lib Dems muttering darkly that he is \"running scared\" of defending his 20% hike in bus fares. After defeating Simon Hughes by a mere 400,000 votes in June's mayoral elections, the Backbencher can understand why Ken would be so nervous.</p> <p><b> THE BOURNEMOUTH IDENTITY</b></p> <p>Conference security has also not met with her satisfaction. A cursory glance into your handbag by a pensioner is hardly adequate defence against Osama bin Laden, let alone Otis Ferry. Don't these people know that Charles Kennedy is going to be our next prime minister? As one hack was heard to observe while being waved through the entrance, \"this really feels like a party on the brink of power\".</p> <p><b> INDY MEDIA?</b></p> <p>As a devout Guardian reader, the Backbencher has found it hard to escape the Independent's sponsorship of the conference. Its logo is plastered everywhere - on stewards' sweatshirts, delegates' bags and, she assumes, a large cheque made payable to the Lib Dems. What's more, readers of the newspaper have been treated to an unusually thorough analysis of the Lib Dems' prospects. It's good to see the paper living up to its title.</p> <p><b> STOKOE'D UP</b></p> <p>After a prolonged period of silence, Simon Hughes' right-hand man during his failed mayoral bid gets in touch. \"Hope all is well and you enjoyed the break,\" the hapless Richard Stokoe emails. Not really, Richard, but the Backbencher can be a bit of a workaholic. \"Just when you thought it was safe to escape from me, you will be pleased to hear (possible anyhow) that I am now back from my gardening leave and now working over at City Hall for the delightful yellows. If you need any insights into workings in the great glass monolith then please feel free to drop me a line or a bell.\" Right now, Richard, there's nothing that springs to mind - although the Backbencher has been wondering exactly who was responsible for the soothing beige carpet and glowing Lib Dem bird at this year's conference: they really should be accompanied by the slogan \"Bringing Politics Home\" - but if any readers have any Lib Dems-in-London related queries, she urges them to get in touch with her. Richard's waiting for her call.</p> <p><b> SURPRISE, SURPRISE</b></p> <p>Finally, the Backbencher's attention was drawn to the Name The October Surprise website, which invites readers to come up with the most plausible treat Dubya will pull out of the electoral hat before the presidential election.

Tonight, Kirsty experiences an all-over mudpack in Hungary.</p> <p>Saturday 25th, BBC2, 7.25pm: Do You Still Believe in Tony?/Friends and Neighbours<br> A double bill of documentaries by Michael Cockerell to mark Tony Blair's 10 years as Labour leader. \"Elegantly made and editorially brave,\" said Mark Lawson in the Guardian on Monday. The first documentary charts Tony's relationship with arts and media luminaries - such as Rory Bremner, Antonia Fraser, Richard Eyre, Harry Enfield and the indiscreet Melvyn Bragg - and finds out whether they still believe in him. The second tells the story of the Blair-Brown relationship: we learn that Tony's favourite programme is The West Wing, while Gordon's is Friends.</p> <p>Tuesday 28th, 10pm, BBC4: Dinner with Portillo<br> Michael discusses marriage, divorce and parenting with Ann Atkins, Alain de Botton and Fiona Millar, Alastair Campbell's partner and Cherie's former helper.</p> <p><b> FINAL READING</b></p> <p>Europe is about complexity, cooperation and consensus - not tabloid headlines.

  "<p>After the huge controversy (and the equally huge profits) entailed in distributing Fahrenheit 9/11, Miramax is reported to have agreed to finance and distribute Michael Moore's follow-up - a caustic study of the US healthcare system, provisionally titled Sicko. </p> <p>Moore is expected to begin work on the film some time next year, Variety magazine reports.</p> <p>Yet although Miramax heads Harvey and Bob Weinstein are committed to Moore's next project, the involvement of parent company Disney is less certain. </p> <p>The two outfits famously clashed over Fahrenheit 9/11, with the Weinsteins eventually releasing the film outside the Disney umbrella. </p> <p>While Sicko may not be quite as incendiary as its predecessor, Disney CEO Michael Eisner - due to step down in 2006 - is apparently far from enthusiastic about becoming involved with the project.</p> <p>Having made over $120m (\u00a367m) during its American theatrical release, Fahrenheit 9/11 is to be released on DVD by Miramax in October - just in time for the following month's presidential election.</p>",
  "It has not been John Kerry's campaigning style to heap personal ridicule on George Bush, let alone to mock his own haircut. <p>But in this election possessing the common touch has become a central issue so, when invited to appear on David Letterman's late-night talkshow on Monday, the Democratic candidate could hardly refuse. </p> <p>He beamed his way through the interview with Mr Letterman, a well-known Democrat whose show is not, in any case, a forum in which guests expect a tough grilling. </p> <p>His best line was an account of negotiations for forthcoming election debates, when he claimed that his vice-presidential candidate, John Edwards, wanted the debaters to stand, while Dick Cheney wanted them to sit. </p> <p>\"We compromised,\" Mr Kerry said, \"and now George Bush is going to sit on Dick Cheney's lap.\" </p> <p>Following a Letterman tradition, Mr Kerry read out a list. His was called \"Top 10 Bush Tax Proposals\" and included a tax exemption for families containing \"at least two US presidents\". </p> <p>One tax credit, he said, \"is so unfair it just makes me want to tear out my lustrous, finely groomed hair\". </p> <p>Yesterday he told talkshow host Regis Philbin that negotiations on the debates had been held up because Mr Bush wanted the option of phoning a friend.</p>"

  "On the morning of polling day in the 1983 general election, I had a conversation in the local Labour committee rooms in Hackney. What do you think the result is going to be tonight, the ward secretary asked. I think the Tories will win by more than 100 seats, I replied. The ward secretary seemed taken aback. That wasn't the mood on the doorstep, he countered. In his view Labour would win by about 20. <p>Well, when the polls closed, it soon became clear that I was right and that the Labour ward secretary was wrong. Mrs Thatcher came back with a majority of 144, Labour slumped to 28% nationwide and just escaped falling into third place. </p> <p>Fast forward 14 years to the 1997 election. Another election-day conversation with another Labour official, only this time with the leader of the party. The subject was the same as before, only this time it was my turn to ask the question. What do you think the result will be? We might win by 50, he replied. More like 150, I retorted. </p> <p>The purpose of retelling these anecdotes is not to boast. The truth is that my powers of prediction are no better than anyone else's. My secret on both occasions was a simple one. Unlike the people I was talking to, I consistently believed the opinion polls. The polls said Thatcher would win by a landslide in 1983, and they said the same about Blair in 1997. I merely repeated what the polls were saying. </p> <p>I believed the polls then, and I believe the polls now. That is why, for example, when people ask me what I think will happen in the US presidential election, my answer is that John Kerry is winning. I say this, my abusive rightwing American email correspondents may like to note, not because I am a jerk or a pinko or because I come from a country that has lost its manhood, nor even because I want it to happen, but simply because that is currently the conclusion of most of the polls, especially in the battleground states. </p> <p>Which is not, I stress, the same thing as saying that Kerry will win. Maybe he will and maybe he won't. No opinion poll is foolproof. All of them have margins of error. And none of them is ever a prediction. They are merely a necessarily approximate snapshot of the state of opinion at a point in time. And since the US election is not until November 2, and the nuances and momentum of the polls change all the time, no prediction made in August can be anything but a more or less informed guess. All you can say, right now, is that it is a close election and that Kerry is narrowly in the lead. Calling me a jerk doesn't change that, you bigots. </p> <p>I accept, though, that those of us who believe the polls currently have some explaining to do on the domestic political front. This is particularly true in the combined wake of last week's Guardian-ICM poll, which found Iraq at the bottom of a list of prospective election issues, and Friday's Financial Times-Mori poll, which concluded that defence and foreign affairs were the most important issues facing the country. </p> <p>Shurely shome mishtake, even good observers have said on seeing these results, among them Peter Preston, who confessed to \"plain confusion\" on these pages 24 hours ago. But I think the confusion is more apparent than real, and I also think it is important to be able to show that this is so, not solely for reasons of amour-propre , but also even for reasons of the civic good. It would be good for our collective politics if we could stamp out the lazy conceits that the polls can't be trusted and that they can be made to support anything you want them to say.</p> <p>There are many variables between different polls - date, size of sample, method of contact, weighting and the rest. More than anything else, though, the results of different opinion polls depend on the questions that the pollsters ask. Confusion in; confusion out. Clarity in; clarity out. That is why the key to unravelling the ICM/Mori \"confusion\" is to be clear that they asked very different - not contradictory, just different - questions.</p> <p>In its poll for the Guardian, for example, ICM asked its sample: \"Now, thinking about the next election and the issues that will be important in your own decision on how to vote, which two or three of the following will be most important in your own decision on which party you will vote for?\" Respondents were offered 10 subjects, of which \"Iraq\" - that one word alone, note, not some other formulation like \"the Iraq war\" or \"Tony Blair's imperialist lies about Iraq\" or any of the almost infinite number of possible permutations - was one. Just 12% of all voters selected \"Iraq\", which came bottom of the pile topped by the NHS on 59%. </p> <p> Meanwhile, going into the field that same weekend for the FT, Mori was asking its sample: \"What would you say is the most important issue facing Britain today?\", before asking them to add \"other important issues facing Britain today\". Mori's sample were not prompted with a list of issues - unlike the ICM sample - and their unprompted replies were then allocated by the pollsters into Mori's regular categories. In this latest FT poll, \"defence/foreign affairs/international terrorism\" came top for \"most important\" single issue (24%) and retained that place when \"other important issues\" were added in (38%).</p> <p>Does this mean that the polls are saying contradictory things? It is possible - rogue polls can happen - but very unlikely. It certainly is not happening in this instance. The key thing to notice is that the two polling organisations were simply asking different questions: ICM about the issues that would influence the way you voted at the election, but Mori about the most important issue facing the country.</p> <p>These two polls, far from being contradictory, are in fact compatible. It is perfectly possible to see a subject as the most important facing the country while simultaneously not giving it great importance in your decision on which way to vote. In the 80s, polls regularly showed that unemployment was deemed the most important issue facing the country, and even that Labour had the best policies for dealing with it. But that didn't mean that people voted Labour. They voted Conservative because, when it came to voting, issues like taxes and economic competence - on which the Tories had the advantage - mattered more.</p> <p>A similar dynamic is at work today. Foreign affairs, defence and international terrorism may indeed be the most important issue facing the nation - a pretty capacious bag that category is, by the way, containing many other issues besides Iraq. A party which could find something compelling to say about that bunch of issues would certainly have an advantage - as the Lib Dems have discovered. Even so, when it comes to the election, as ICM found, it's the same old story. Next year, most people will cast their votes because of the things that make a difference to themselves and their families - health, education and the rest of it. Which is why Labour will win. Just as the polls say they will.</p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> <a href=\"mailto:martin.kettle@theguardian.com\">martin.kettle@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "John Kerry is on track to win the upcoming US presidential election in November, if giant Madagascar hissing roaches are to be trusted.

  "President George Bush stood accused of appropriating the Olympic movement for political means last night, amid reports he was planning to visit Athens later this week to watch some sporting events, including a potential gold-medal winning bid by the Iraqi football team. <p>According to unconfirmed reports in the US, the White House is examining the logistical and security implications of Mr Bush travelling to the Greek capital in time for Saturday's football final. Iraq, whose progress to the semi-finals of the tournament has been one of the games' most captivating stories, will meet Paraguay tomorrow night for a possible place in the finals. </p> <p>The Greek foreign ministry confirmed last night that the US secretary of state, Colin Powell, will be in Athens for the closing ceremony. </p> <p>But it is the potential presidential visit to the games that will fuel a dispute between the election campaign of Mr Bush and his running mate, Dick Cheney, and the US Olympic Committee over an advert which links Iraq's and Afghanistan's participation in the games with the US administration's \"war on terror\". </p> <p>The advert, which has been broadcast in the US for the past week, begins with footage from the 1972 Olympic games in Munich, during which 13 Israeli athletes were killed by terrorists, and continues with a narrator saying: \"Freedom is spreading through the world like a sunrise. And this Olympics there will be two more free nations and two less terrorist regimes.\" </p> <p>As the flags of Afghanistan and Iraq flutter in the breeze, it concludes: \"With strength, resolve and courage, democracy will triumph over terror and hope will defeat hatred.\" </p> <p>Under American copyright law, only the US Olympic Com mittee has the right to use the Olympic insignia, images and trademarks for marketing purposes. </p> <p>Initially, the committee reportedly called for the advert to be withdrawn, but its spokesman retreated from that last night. </p> <p>\"We have contacted the president's election campaign team and asked them to forward us a copy of the advert. Once we have reviewed it and determined the type and extent of the use of the Olympic name, we will decide how to progress,\" a spokesman, Darryl Seibel, said. </p> <p>The committee might want to avoid a confrontation with Mr Bush, but it appears that the objects of his affections have no such qualms. </p> <p>To the embarrassment of their media handlers in Athens, members of the Iraqi football team have reacted furiously to the news that their efforts are being used to aid Mr Bush's efforts to win a second term in the White House. </p> <p>The team's coach, Adnan Hamd, told Sports Illustrated magazine: \"My problem is not with the American people. They are with what America has done; destroyed everything. The American army has killed so many people in Iraq. What is freedom when I go to the stadium and there are shootings on the road?\" </p> <p>One of the team's midfield players, Ahmad Manajid, accused Mr Bush of \"slaughtering\" Iraqi men and women. \"How will he meet his God having slaughtered so many? I want to defend my home. If a stranger invades America and the people resist, does that make them a terrorist?\" he said. </p> <p>Mark Clark, the spokesman for the Iraqi Olympic squad in Athens, accused journalists of taking advantage of the players. \"They are not very sophisticated politically. Whoever posed these questions knew the answers would be negative. It is possible something was lost in translation. The players are entitled to their opinions but we are disappointed,\" he said. </p> <p>Mr Bush, not hitherto known as a keen football fan, has made repeated references to the performances of the Iraqi football team in his campaign speeches. </p> <p>After its unexpected 4-2 victory over Portugal, he told a crowd in Oregon that the fact the team was in Athens was fantastic, adding: \"It wouldn't have been free if the United States hadn't acted.\"</p>",
  "\"A true war story is never moral. It does not instruct, nor encourage virtue, nor suggest models of proper human behaviour, nor restrain men from doing the things men have always done. If at the end of a war story you feel that some small bit of rectitude has been salvaged from the larger waste, then you have been made the victim of a very old and terrible lie.\" <br> <b>\u00b7 </b>Tim O'Brien, The Things They Carried <p>Vietnam war veteran and Democratic presidential hopeful John Kerry has been ambushed and, for the moment, remains caught in enemy fire. Having made his five-month stint of decorated service in Vietnam the heart of his platform, it is now emerging as his achilles heel. </p> <p>A group of veterans financed by Republicans from Texas and close to President George Bush are airing ads calling him a liar for the claims he has made about his service and suggesting that he did not come by his military medals honestly. Their case is shoddy, given that none of the Swift-boat Veterans for Truth were with Kerry at the time and their claims have been refuted by those who were. Their motivation is shabby, as most of them are piqued by the fact that Kerry returned home to campaign against the war. All of which makes the fact that their attacks have had such a huge impact that much more revealing. </p> <p>For since the ads began screening, Kerry's slight lead in the polls has been shaved away. Two weeks ago, before the ads appeared, he was running even with Bush among the nation's 26 million veterans. Now Bush has a 24-point lead. The issue dominating the news cycle is not what is happening in Najaf today but what happened in the Mekong delta 35 years ago. </p> <p>There are three things we can learn from this. First, there is no level to which Republicans will not stoop to besmirch a character, belittle an issue or befuddle the electorate. Second, there is no level to which the Democrats will not stoop to attempt to neutralise these attacks. And third, that the Republicans will always win in this race to the bottom because so much less is expected of them and, when it comes to muck-slinging, they have no qualms about getting their hands dirty. </p> <p>Take Vietnam. At first sight this is an issue you would think the Bush administration would want to keep away from. Thanks to family connections, the president served his war in the Texas National Guard - and even then it is debatable whether he showed up. The vice-president, Dick Cheney, managed to defer being drafted five times, until the war was over, claiming he had \"other priorities\". Nine months and two days after the army changed the regulations so that married men with no children were no longer exempt, Cheney had his first child, Elizabeth, bringing a whole new meaning to the term family planning. </p> <p>Nobody is questioning their record in Vietnam for the simple reason that, unlike Kerry, neither them ever served there. For them to raise Kerry's service is a mixture of chutzpah and desperation that could backfire. Bush has tried to distance himself from the ads, saying they were put out by an independent group. But since the money trail leads back to his friends in Texas, this won't wash. </p> <p>The trouble for Kerry is that, in all likelihood, none of this will matter. The Bush campaign knows the attention span of the public is short and that few will sweat the details. Their hope is that by the time the claims of the Swift-boat Veterans have been discredited, a stubborn question mark will remain hanging over Kerry's military record. If you spread enough dung, goes the logic, then some seeds of doubt will grow. </p> <p>There is nothing new in this. The Bush team employed the same strategy in 2000 against Al Gore, forcing him to refute claims he never made about inventing the internet and being the basis for Love Story. In 2002, Republicans managed to unseat senator Max Cleland of Georgia by branding him unpatriotic because he opposed the creation of the homeland security department. Cleland lost three limbs in Vietnam and is a former head of the Veterans' Administration. </p> <p>But if the method of attack by Republicans is underhand, the issue they have chosen for this attack is understandable. For it was Kerry, not Bush, who placed his military service centre stage in this election campaign. The logic of doing so was clear enough. Clips of Kerry striding through the delta carrying a gun while his band of brothers (those who served with him) offered testimony of his heroics, served as a double whammy. They established Kerry in the public mind as a strong leader in wartime while providing a contrast with Bush, who stayed at home. </p> <p>But by the time of the Democratic convention, the party had elevated his service 35 years ago from one aspect of his personal history to his principle selling point in his campaign for the presidency. Refusing to spell out what plans he had for the future in Iraq or the war on terror, he was forced to exploit this one moment in his past for all it was worth. </p> <p>\"If we do not speak of it others will surely rewrite the script,\" said Vietnam veteran George Swiers shortly after returning. \"Each of the body bags, all of the mass graves will be reopened and their contents abracadabraed into a noble cause.\" </p> <p>And so it was that Kerry referred to his military service alone to qualify him for the presidency. He delivered a string of nationalist non sequiturs: \"As president, I will wage this war with the lessons I learned in war\"; \"I defended this country as a young man and I will defend it as president\"; and \"I learned a lot about these values on that gunboat patrolling the Mekong delta\". </p> <p>Then towards the end he reached for the stars and stripes. \"That flag flew from the turret right behind my head. And it was shot through and through and tattered, but it never ceased to wave in the wind. It draped the caskets of men that I served with and friends I grew up with.\" </p> <p>In so doing, Kerry may have neutralised charges that he will be weak on defence. But he also made his war record fair game and set the ground work for one of the most nationalistic elections in living memory: a campaign that offers the choice between a Republican candidate who wants America to be obeyed and a Democrat who wants it to be \"looked up to\" and become \"once again a beacon in the world\". </p> <p>Kerry is not only running for president, but in flight from a history he knows only too well. When he returned from Vietnam he testified before the Senate foreign relations committee that American troops had \"raped, cut off ears, cut off heads, taped wires from portable telephones to genitals and turned up the power, blown up bodies, randomly shot at civilians [and] razed villages in fashion reminiscent of Ganghis Khan.\" Just a few reasons why that beacon has burned so dimly for so long, and why Americans deserve a better choice. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:g.younge@theguardian.com\">g.younge@theguardian.com</a></p>"

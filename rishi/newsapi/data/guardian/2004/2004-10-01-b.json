  "When I watched Charles Kennedy on television as he addressed the Liberal Democrat conference in Bournemouth last week, I found myself agreeing with most people that he doesn't really look like a leader. And then I thought, \"Good. Let's have him as prime minister.\" <p>For aren't you sick of leadership? In the American presidential election, they talk of little else. All the arguments are about whether John Kerry or George Bush is the stronger, bolder, more decisive leader. But why is everyone so eager to be led? </p> <p>In Britain, we have had two prime ministers since Winston Churchill who have fancied themselves as leaders: Margaret Thatcher and Tony Blair. They have done some good things, both of them, but at a heavy price to our tranquillity and contentment. </p> <p>Both have continually paraded before us their leadership qualities and their \"convictions\", causing us much mental and emotional fatigue. I am still not at all clear what Tony Blair's convictions are, but the important thing is that he knows he has them and wants us to admire him for having them. </p> <p>Without either of these leaders, we would have been at war much less often than we have been, and under Blair in particular there has been spectacular loss of life among not merely humans, such as Iraqis, but also among animals - mainly cows. </p> <p>And soon, after the passage of the bill to ban foxhunting, there will be a massacre of foxhounds. In fact, the only creature Blair seems particularly eager to save is the fox, which is a savage animal that enjoys killing for killing's sake - that kills 10 chickens just for the fun of it when one would suffice to satisfy its hunger. Even rats are of a more amiable disposition. </p> <p>I admired Mrs Thatcher for some things she did, and I still think she was one of the great comic figures of the century, whom we should cherish for that if for nothing else. But I remember the great relief I felt when she was succeeded by grey, modest John Major, however inadequate a prime minister he turned out to be. </p> <p>We would no longer be hectored or harangued. We would no longer be exalted and uplifted. We would be allowed to get on quietly with our lives while Mr Major did the housekeeping. He may not have been a very good housekeeper, but that is by the way. </p> <p>Sometimes a leader is needed, principally in time of war. But it is a very unsatisfactory state of affairs if we have to invent wars in order to satisfy some prime minister's craving to lead. </p> <p>The happiest times are those in which we can potter along calmly together, enjoying ourselves as best we can, without crises or dramas. The prime ministers that best suit the British temperament are those who share this belief and try to soothe us when we are anxious rather than get us even more wound up. Harold Macmillan and Jim Callaghan were both good at this. </p> <p>Well into Macmillan's premiership, there was an opinion poll showing that a vast percentage of the population had no idea who he was. This was generally greeted with dismay, as a sign of a democracy in trouble. But I thought it showed that things were working rather well. Unfortunately, there is nobody today who hasn't heard of Tony Blair. </p> <p>We used to despise Italy for its rotating coalition governments and constantly changing, weak prime ministers whose names nobody could remember. There was little to admire in the way Italy was governed, but it didn't seem to matter terribly. The country has steadily grown in prosperity and contentment. Now it has a \"leader\" in the preposterous figure of Silvio Berlusconi, it is much more jittery. </p> <p>As soon as I finish this, I will be flying off to New York where I will doubtless witness the babyish competition between the rival candidates to show who is the most patriotic and who possesses the finest leadership qualities. </p> <p>It would be nice to think that in Britain we are more grown-up than the Americans, that we take every politician's patriotism for granted and don't yearn to be led. It would be even nicer to think that we support our civilised system of parliamentary democracy and cabinet government that is designed to keep a prime minister in his place. </p> <p>If this is really how we are, and we don't want to go any further down the American route, the best way for us to show it is to go out at the next general election and vote for Charles Kennedy.</p>",
  "John Kerry was yesterday widely declared the winner of the first presidential debate, after an aggressive performance left a scowling President George Bush sometimes groping for words. <p>It was, however, too early to tell whether the debate, at Miami University, would be enough for Senator Kerry to close the president's five to 10 percentage point lead in time for the election a month today. </p> <p>Polls by three networks, CNN, ABC and CBS, showed that viewers declared the Democrat candidate the winner by clear majorities of between nine and 16%. But the surveys also suggested the debate had so far done little to change voting intentions. </p> <p>Last night Mr Bush attempted to recover lost ground, attacking Mr Kerry's pledge in the debate that, if elected, he would call a summit to seek more international help on Iraq. </p> <p>\"I've been to a lot of summits. I've never seen a meeting that would depose a tyrant or bring a terrorist to justice,\" Mr Bush said. With him at a campaign rally in Allentown, Pennsylvania, was Republican senator John McCain, who told the rally: \"My friends, a summit is not a plan.\" </p> <p>Presidential debates have historically taken days to work their way through the electorate as they are replayed and analysed in the media, but snap surveys entirely of undecided voters did show that a shift in Mr Kerry's favour was possible. </p> <p>Democrats capitalised on the event by circulating pictures of a sour-faced Mr Bush, scowling while he listened to his adversary. The image appeared on split screens in the homes of tens of millions Americans, as broadcasters defied guidelines banning the use of such reaction shots. </p> <p>\"What you saw was a president who was annoyed, angry and aloof. He clearly didn't want to be there, and he was slouched over his podium,\" Terry McCauliffe, the Democratic party chairman, said. </p> <p>Arguably, Mr Bush should have known better. The broadcast of similar reaction shots of Al Gore in the first presidential debate four years ago dominated coverage in the days after, sapping the Gore campaign and helping put Mr Bush in the White House. </p> <p>Mr Bush's facial antics aside, there were no fatal gaffes on either side in the course of the 90-minute duel, nor were there any outright winning lines. However, it was widely praised as one of the best presidential debates in recent history, vividly showcasing the divide between the candidates. </p> <p>They differed sharply on whether the Iraq invasion had been justified - Mr Kerry declared it a \"colossal error of judgment\" - and on whether the US should do more to assure international support for pre-emptive military action. The Democratic senator said such action would have to pass \"a global test\" in which \"you can prove to the world that you did it for legitimate reasons\". </p> <p>Mr Bush declared himself baffled by the phrase \"global test\" and said: \"My attitude is you take pre-emptive action in order to protect the American people, that you act in order to make this country secure.\" </p> <p>His strongest moments came on the attack, when he argued that Mr Kerry did not have the determination to project US leadership abroad. </p> <p>But perhaps the biggest point scored against the senator came from the moderator, journalist Jim Lehrer. Echoing a famous Kerry remark from the Vietnam era, Mr Lehrer asked if he thought US soldiers were dying for a mistake in Iraq. Mr Kerry said they were not, and Republicans pounced on the apparent inconsistency. </p> <p>\"He said the war was a mistake, but he also said he was not asking American soldiers to die for a mistake,\" Karl Rove, the president's chief political adviser, said afterwards. \"How can you go to the allies and ask them to go in there, if you're saying it's the 'wrong war'?\"</p>",
  "There were no gimmicks, no gaffes, no problems with five-o'clock shadow, and few laughs. But the first of three presidential debates between George Bush and John Kerry was refreshingly substantive, drew some clear lines between incumbent and challenger, and gave the Massachusetts Democrat a mostly convincing win - even in the candid view of some Bush supporters. Not surprisingly, it was Iraq and \"the war on terror\" that occupied the largest part of the 90-minute contest. Mr Kerry scored a direct hit with his insistence that Iraq had been the \"wrong war in the wrong place at the wrong time\", while accusing the president of letting Osama Bin Laden off the hook. Many of the millions of people watching are likely to remember the exchange in which the president said of September 11: \"The enemy attacked us,\" and Mr Kerry retorted, though not quite as smartly as he might have, \"Saddam Hussein didn't attack us\" - still as succinct an encapsulation of this sorry story as any copywriter could dream up. <p>The Democrat's reputation for polished debating was confirmed by his deflection of criticism about his \"flip-flop\" on the war with the response that consistency is not the same as good leadership or judgment. Mr Bush's sarcasm about Mr Kerry's plan to win international support over Iraq was ineffective and misleading: his British and Polish allies have their own postwar troubles. And indiscreet camera shots (in breach of the strict protocol for the debate) showed the president looking unpresidentially tetchy as Mr Kerry spoke of how he would behave as commander-in-chief. Beyond Iraq, viewers heard of the challenger's sense of urgency about nuclear proliferation in general and North Korea in particular. Mr Bush's contempt for the \"foreign judges\" of the International Criminal Court was a reminder of a highly sensitive issue which heralded a more unilateralist America well before 9/11. </p> <p>Instant verdicts emerging from overheated party \"spin rooms\" should be treated with caution, while the relationship between these debates and the remainder of the election campaign is unclear. But the balance of more considered views is that Mr Kerry was the victor of round one in Florida, even though the president was a tough and confident sparring partner. The challenger will find it harder to win the next round, a question-and-answer session in the more informal setting of a town hall meeting in Missouri, where Mr Bush can better employ his folksy skills. But the choice for Americans, as well as the preference of a watching world, is getting clearer.</p>",
  "\"You're a nonentity in this country unless you have a militia,\" says Fakir Mohammed Mohmodzai, the new governor of Baghlan province, 200km to the north of the Afghan capital, Kabul. He knows what he is talking about: he has already had brushes with three military units based in Pul-i-Khumri, the capital of Baghlan province. <p>They are Commander Mustapha's 20th division, Commander Jalal Bushka's 902nd battalion and Commander Amir Gul's 733rd battalion. Although they enjoy official army status, these units are little more than militias. In addition to them, Mohmodzai, who spent most of his career in the Afghan education ministry, says he has to cope with several second-rank commanders in remote areas and with the police, whose recent standoff with soldiers from the 20th division brought tensions to a head in Pul-i-Khumri for several days. When the deputy police chief, Gul Mohammed Mangal, tried to intervene, he was badly beaten up by soldiers. </p> <p>Two and a half years after the establishment of President Hamid Karzai's first government, the Afghans' dream of seeing law and order restored seems remote. The former warlords' militias, which have been promoted to the status of regular army units and placed under the control of the defence ministry, headed by the former commander of the Northern Alliance, \"Marshal\" Mohammed Fahim, are still very much in business - and have lost none of their bad habits. </p> <p>The units are scheduled eventually to be disarmed or, in some cases, reintegrated into the Afghan National Army (ANA) now being formed. But for the time being the ANA has a mere 15,000 men and has not been widely deployed. </p> <p>A portrait of the late Commander Ahmad Shah Massoud still greets visitors from the top of the triumphal arch that marks the entrance to the dusty northeastern city of Kunduz. Here the militias of Jamiat-e-Islami call the shots. The strong man of the region is \"General\" Daud Khan, a former bodyguard of Massoud now in his early 30s, who is the official commander-in-chief of the 6th corps. He rules over four provinces in northeastern Afghanistan. </p> <p>As an ethnic Tajik, he has been running into problems in the province of Thakkar, where Uzbek commanders who were once Massoud's allies have rallied to the Uzbek general, Abdul Rashid Dostum. </p> <p>Karzai has more than once argued that private militias have become the greatest danger facing the country: \"Since persuasion hasn't worked, we'll have to use force.\" In August he again warned the warlords that those who disrupted the disarmament process and imperilled security would be regarded as rebels and severely punished. </p> <p>The warning carried no punch given that Karzai did not direct his threats at those warlords under the formal authority of the defence ministry, which is more than 90% of the militias. The sudden sacking on September 11 of Ismail Khan, the powerful governor of Herat, could, however, mark a turning point in the government's attitude. </p> <p>To have any hope of success in his confrontation with the warlords, Karzai needs concrete and effective support from the international community. </p> <p>\"President Karzai told me that the warlords are not the mujahideen who fought the Soviets and then resisted Taliban and Arab terrorists,\" says General Mohammed Atta, an ethnic Tajik who was recently appointed governor of Mazar-i-Sharif province. And yet those are the men, whose anti-Soviet jihad ended 15 years ago, the people detest because of their constant abuse of power and the unpleasant memories left by their government of 1992-96. </p> <p>\"It's up to the international community to put pressure on the warlords,\" says Mohmodzai. \"It should ask them, for example, where they get their money from. They all own several Land Cruisers worth $45,000 each, but no one asks them how they can afford them.\" </p> <p>In his vast mansion in the centre of Mazar-i-Sharif, Atta is no doubt savouring his latest victory. A former commander of the army's 7th division, he was promoted to the rank of governor after having placed Mohammed Akram, a Pashtun from Kandahar who is the police chief in Mazar-i-Sharif, under house arrest for 18 days. </p> <p>Akram's men had made the mistake of stopping a car driven by men answering to Atta, which was carrying a large quantity of drugs. In the course of the incident, 40% of the newly recruited policemen, who had been trained by foreign instructors, either fled or were kicked out. The remaining 60%, who are in charge of security in Mazar-i-Sharif, \"belong\" to Atta. Atta does not like the term \"belong\". He prefers to say: \"They trust me, like everyone here.\" </p> <p>\"The interior ministry's spokesman said I had authority over the whole province,\" Akram says. \"We'll have to see about that. The militias need to be disarmed. Only then will it be possible to talk of peace and of a central government. Here, 97% of people want a central government, but the militias call the tune.\" </p> <p>Disarmament of the militias is one of the United Nations' principal objectives. To achieve that, it is banking on the cooperation of the defence ministry, which has so far been dragging its feet. The \"commanders\" concerned all agree that they should disarm, but only on condition that the neighbours do so first. </p> <p>Some 12,000 officers and soldiers, out of a total initially put at 100,000, then at 50,000, have so far been disarmed. But to judge from the case of General Mir Alam Khan, the reality is more complex. Alam Khan, who used to head a division of 5,000 men in Kunduz, which has now been slimmed down to 675 soldiers, is not too worried about his future. \u00ecI keep in contact with my men, and I still have a stock of 4,000 heavy weapons. </p> <p>\"They're my property, and the defence ministry has not ruled that we should turn in such weapons. Our conditions for doing so are that the mujahideen should be given jobs and that the situation should have been clarified, which it has not been.\" </p> <p>The almost total failure of the disarmament, demobilisation and rehabilitation (DDR) programme can be put down to the Tajik domination of the Jamiat-e-Islami within central government - something that discourages chiefs of other ethnic groups from handing over their weapons - and by the fact that demobilised officers and soldiers cannot find jobs. </p> <p>Uzbek militias are still powerful in the region of Kunduz, and there is great rivalry between the Tajiks of Jamiat-e-Islami and Dostum\u00eds Uzbeks. \"Dostum ought to treat me with respect as I have more weapons than he does,\" says Alam Khan. </p> <p>The equation is more complicated in Mazar-i-Sharif, where there are not only Uzbeks and Tajiks, but Hazara Shia Muslims, who also have a militia. \"Karzai didn't keep his promises, and the DDR hasn't done much. Soldiers just turn in their old weapons,\" says Ghulam Khan, a pharmacist in Mazar-i-Sharif. \"Human rights are hardly respected at all here, and there's been a total breakdown of law and order. The most shocking thing is that people are killed in the streets, and no one even asks why or by whom.\" </p> <p>The warlords' main aim would seem to be to hang on to power and to the money that goes hand in hand with it. Most chiefs are involved in trafficking of all kinds, especially drug trafficking. </p> <p>\"In Pul-i-Khumri my men recently seized 390kg of opium hidden in three cars belonging to the 20th military division in the province,\" says Mohmodzai. \"I can prove that the provinces of Thakkar and Kunduz are used as a route for exporting drugs to Tajikistan.\" </p> <p>Mangal says: \"Of course Atta, Daud, Alam Khan and Dostum are involved in heroin trafficking and the European market\", which gets 90% of Afghan-produced heroin. According to Mohmodzai, \"Second-rank commanders encourage farmers to plant opium poppies, and they give them money for that purpose.\" </p> <p>Karzai recently urged that government employees involved in the growing and trafficking of drugs should be identified by the interior ministry, the defence ministry and the national security bureau. Not only is that akin to asking a mafia godfather to denounce his family, but there are so many officials involved that there would be a serious risk of depleting the civil service. Reports suggesting that \"General\" Daud will shortly be appointed deputy interior minister in charge of eradicating drugs trafficking are hardly reassuring. </p> <p>\"We get lots of complaints about people using guns\" says Shamsuddin Hamedi, the Afghan Human Rights Commission representative in Kunduz. \"One man will seize some land, another a house. In one village a commander collected all the inhabitants' voting cards and promised them he would vote on their behalf.\" </p> <p>Hamedi's bureau tries to intervene in such cases, but with no guarantee of success. \"If you have a gun, you can run a private prison - and there are a lot of private prisons in the region,\" says Rassul Ehsan, its programme director. \"The beginning of disarmament in Kunduz didn't change anything, and the presence of a Provincial Reconstruction Team [PRT] didn't affect the situation either.\" </p> <p>Germany operates a 200-strong military-cum-civilian PRT in Kunduz whose job is both to do humanitarian work and to train the police. The British PRT in Mazar-i-Sharif has stepped in to take the heat out of local disputes, but its presence alone is not enough to reassure a population that has lost confidence. </p> <p>It is in that context of gun democracy that a presidential election is scheduled for October 9. In theory it will be followed by a general election six months later. Many fear that any postponement of the general election will allow the warlords to bolster their position. </p> <p>\"The commanders are certainly not prepared to hand over their weapons before the elections,\" says Ehsan. \"It would have been a better idea to organise both elections at the same time, because people here need a strong government as soon as possible.\" </p> <p>What the Afghans most want is a government capable of providing them with security and jobs. They are beginning to despair of getting help from the international community, most of whose promises have so far proved fruitless. And with each new day they feel their future is getting bleaker.</p>",

  "Welcome to the Wrap, Guardian Unlimited's round-up of the best of the day's papers. <p><b>BREAKING NEWS:</b> <a href=\"http://politics.theguardian.com/labour/story/0,9061,1317500,00.html\">Tony Blair arrived at a west London hospital today for treatment to correct his recurring heart condition</a>.</p> <p><b>PLUS:</b> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uselections2004/story/0,13918,1317491,00.html\">Julian Borger gives his verdict on last night's presidential debate</a>.</p> <p><b>'ABSOLUTELY VOLCANIC'</b></p> <p>Just when it seemed safe to mull over the result of the Hartlepool byelection (a 2,033 majority for Labour, cut from 14,571 and the Tories lying fourth behind Ukip), Tony Blair made what the Guardian describes as an \"absolutely volcanic\" announcement. The PM is going into hospital today for an operation to treat his recurring heart problem.</p> <p>Naturally, this news prompts a renewed flurry of speculation about Gordon Brown's future. Mr Blair sought to pre-empt it by stating that he intended to serve a third term as PM - but not a fourth. It also emerged that has just bought a Georgian house in Bayswater, west London, for GBP3.6m.</p> <p>The papers are knocked for six. (As, presumably, was the chancellor, who learnt the news as he arrived in Washington last night for an IMF meeting.) \"No prime minister has ever announced his plans for his own future the way Tony Blair did yesterday,\" writes Jonathan Freedland in the Guardian. \"For one thing, Mr Blair risks becoming an instant lame duck\" - indeed, today's Telegraph calls him just that - \"an outgoing prime minister, even if he might not be gone until 2010. In theory, that needn't be the case: after all, if George Bush is re-elected on November 2, he too will only be able to serve one more full term and no one will call him a lame duck. But British politics is not like that.\" </p> <p>The FT's James Blitz agrees that few prime ministers have ever been able to choose the manner of their departure. \"Even the PM's closest acolytes believe he does not really intend to do such a thing - but fear it may smack of a certain arrogance.\"</p> <p>\"My hunch is that, even if today's operation goes as well as predicted, Mr Blair has only bought time,\" says the Times' Peter Riddell portentously. \"It may be a long goodbye, but it will be goodbye, nonetheless.\"</p> <p>Asked whether his intention to serve a full third term ruled out Gordon Brown's succession, Mr Blair said there were \"lots of people who want to do the job ... I don't think it rules Gordon out in any shape or form at all\". That, say a couple of the papers, amounted to a snub to the chancellor's ambitions. </p> <p>The Times commissions resident GP Dr Thomas Stuttaford for an expert opinion on Mr Blair's health. \"The normal heart beats 60-90 times a minute. When it beats more than 100 times a minute, it is called tachycardia,\" Dr Stuttaford explains. \"The heart beats so fast that the heart muscles cannot relax between contractions, and the heart does not receive adequate blood for pumping.\"</p> <p>The nature of Mr Blair's treatment is succinctly summed up in a Sun headline: \"DOC: WE'LL ZAP NERVES\". The procedure, which can take a few hours, takes place under local anaesthetic and involves inserting a long, thin wire called a catheter \"into a vein and then into the heart\". Radio waves are used to destroy the \"aberrant conducting system\" causing the problem.</p> <p>\"There is every likelihood that the PM will be back in No 10 within a week or two,\" Dr Stuttaford adds. But there is the slight possibility that he will need a pacemaker, and \"serious complications do occur\", warns the Times' health editor.</p> <p>* <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/leaders/story/0,,1317469,00.html\">Term limit?</a><br> * <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/Politics/labour/comment/0,9236,1317468,00.html\">A long-term strategy fraught with risk</a><br> * <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/opinion/main.jhtml?xml=/opinion/2004/10/01/dl0101.xml\">Telegraph: Mr Blair has now become a lame duck</a><br> * <a href=\"http://news.ft.com/cms/s/79206fe6-1345-11d9-b869-00000e2511c8.html\">FT: Operation puts more pressure on Blair</a><br> * <a href=\"http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2-1289543,00.html\">Times: Long goodbye starts here</a><br>* <a href=\"http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2-1289453,00.html\">Times: Attacks leave a patient lethargic, breathless and faint</a><br> * <a href=\"http://www.thesun.co.uk/article/0,,2-2004453071,,00.html\">Sun: Doc - we'll zap nerves</a></p> <p><b>A BLOODY DAY IN BAGHDAD</b></p> <p>Yesterday was also one of the bloodiest days in Iraq since hostilities officially ended, with at least 41 civilians - 34 of them children - killed in car bombings in Baghdad.</p> <p>The Herald Tribune is unflinching. \"The bombs exploded seconds apart, creating a chaotic scene of dying children and grieving parents, some of them holding up the blood-soaked clothes of their young and howling in lament.

It may take awhile,\" headlines the paper. \"If past presidential election debates are a guide, public reaction to the debate ... will not be fixed in people's minds in the hours immediately after the 90-minute encounter, but instead will evolve for days, in possibly unexpected ways.\" The subtext? Wait for our verdict.</p> <p>At the time of writing, US commentators remain fairly even-handed, noting that neither candidate made the kind of verbal gaffe which could scupper their campaign. Mr Kerry talked of the need for strong alliances in the world; Mr Bush said: \"We've climbed the mighty mountain.

  "<p>I can hardly call it spam because it was not unsolicited \u2013 I had gone to some effort to get on the mailing lists \u2013 but sheer number of emails from the Bush and Kerry campaigns that greeted me on my arrival at work this morning would not have shamed the sons of all the dictators in Africa.</p> <p>And all because the spin never stops.

  "My colleague Ian Gibson MP rang me at 6.30am from his hotel in Ramallah on the West Bank. Our visit to study healthcare in occupied Palestine was about to take a personal and frightening turn. Ian had been taken ill with a suspected minor stroke. The specialist came quickly and Ian was dispatched to hospital in Jerusalem in a Palestinian Red Crescent ambulance. <p>But at the al-Ram checkpoint, Ian's ambulance was stopped by Israeli border police. Despite his obvious ill-health - he was dry retching - and representations from the British consulate, the ambulance was refused permission to go any further. For 70 minutes Ian was left in the ambulance before he was allowed to proceed in a different ambulance, needlessly called. </p> <p>The callousness of his treatment was a clear breach of Israel's promise to the UN that ambulances should never be held up for more than 30 minutes. A Palestinian voluntary organisation, HDIP, has logged 83 deaths when access to emergency carehas been denied; 52 women have given birth at checkpoints after being refused access to hospital. </p> <p>Road closures and checkpoints are a part of the systematic occupation of Palestine that goes well beyond the securing of borders. According to the UN , there are more than 700 checkpoints, blockages and closures throughout the West Bank, controlling the movement of every Palestinian inside their own country. While we were there, most Palestinians were forbidden to move outside the major towns. Palestine is increasingly de facto divided into a series of isolated communities under military control. </p> <p>Meanwhile, the West Bank security wall goes up apace, as does the encroachment of settlements. It was extraordinary to stand in the village of Saffa, on the Palestinian side of the 1967 border, and see the new towns spreading like Spanish timeshare developments. The new townships will be ringed by the new wall, while Saffa will be on the \"wrong\" side. Its residents will have no clear right to leave their village, and will be subject to arbitrary removal of their residence permits. Israelis will have every opportunity to settle the same land. </p> <p>Whatever security function the wall may have, its real effect, snaking deep into Palestine, is clear. Before long, too little Palestinian land and freedom will remain to make an independent state a viable proposition. </p> <p>What happens if the two-state solution founders in a failed Palestinian state or the simpler brutality of continued Israeli occupation? We and other EU taxpayers will carry on picking up the aid bill - already higher per head than any other country in the world - for mitigating the worst consequences of Israel's illegal occupation. Meanwhile our own security, and the credibility of British foreign policy, will suffer. </p> <p>The hope of a two-state solution has united those whose sympathies have been with either side, and those who take no side but simply recognise that our own security depends on a just solution in the Middle East. Supporters and opponents of the Iraq war agreed that peace in the Middle East was essential to undercut the emotive appeal of al-Qaida to alienated Muslims. Speaking in March 2003, Tony Blair said: \"All of us are now signed up to ... a state of Israel, recognised and accepted by all the world, and a viable Palestinian state. That is what this country should strive for, and we will.\" </p> <p>Again this week, Tony Blair said: \"Two states, Israel and Palestine, living side by side in peace, would do more to defeat terrorism than bullets can ever do.\" He promised he would make it a personal priority after the US presidential election. So how should that priority be demonstrated? </p> <p>Now is the time to be braver and bolder about the pressure we can apply. Our government did not want the case against the wall to be heard in the international court of justice, arguing that it would not help the peace process. But external pressure does work. The clear condemnation by the court has shocked Israelis and their government and forced some rethink on the line of the wall. </p> <p>Israeli policy can be influenced by a clear external challenge. Many people are already questioning whether Israel's preferential trade agreement with the EU, which depends on that country's human rights record, can still be justified. Such options should not be lightly dismissed. </p> <p>Of course, every obscene suicide bomb obliterates the wider picture; ordinary Israelis have a right to security too. But current Israeli policy won't bring long-term security for them and it casually threatens our own. If it takes external pressure to bring that message home, we should be prepared to use it. </p> <p>As the situation in Iraq deteriorates, the moment for Tony Blair to give real force to his promises has come. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> John Denham is Labour MP for Southampton Itchen; he was a Home Office minister until he resigned in March 2003 over the Iraq war</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:denhamj@parliament.uk\">denhamj@parliament.uk</a></p>",

  "John Kerry regained the initiative in the US presidential race last night with a forceful performance in his first debate with George Bush, occasionally leaving the president scowling and at a loss for words. <p>Instant-response polls by three major television networks all showed that a large majority of their viewers thought the challenger had won the 90-minute verbal contest at the University of Miami - the first of three debates in the last month of the campaign.</p> <p>Perhaps even more seriously for President Bush, the networks ignored broadcasting guidelines agreed beforehand and showed both candidates at the same time. On several occasions, Mr Bush could be seen sour-faced and nervous in reaction to some of Mr Kerry's remarks. Similar \"cut-away\" shots of Al Gore in the first presidential debate four years ago sapped his campaign and helped put Mr Bush into office.</p> <p>After last night's debate, senior Democrats made it clear that they would make maximum use of the pictures of a disgruntled President Bush.</p> <p>\"What you saw was a president who was annoyed, angry and aloof. He clearly didn't want to be there, and he was slouched over his podium,\" said Terry McCauliffe, the Democratic party chairman, in an interview in \"spin alley\", a university basketball court where partisans of each side strove frenetically to influence media coverage of the event.</p> <p>Mr McCauliffe's Republican counterpart, Ed Gillespie, laughed off the description, saying: \"I don't know what Terry thought he saw, but the president was obviously very engaged and very clear about his policies.\"</p> <p>However, several conservative commentators awarded the encounter to Senator Kerry on points. Morton Kondracke, an outspoken hawk on Fox News, said he did not think the president \"had dominated\" and argued \"Kerry looked like a commander-in-chief\".</p> <p>The Democratic challenger lived up to his reputation for hitting his best form in the closing stages of an election race, answering his critics by delivering a string of short, declarative statements, with relatively few of the verbal meanderings for which he has become famous on the campaign trail.</p> <p>He rejected Mr Bush's central claim that Iraq was a central front in the \"global war on terror\". \"Iraq was not even close to the centre of the war on terror before the president invaded it,\" he said</p> <p>As he has done in the past, the president took Mr Kerry to task for inconsistency in criticising the Iraq invasion. He pointed out that the senator had voted to approve the use of force in 2002, and had declared Saddam's Iraq to be a \"grave threat\".</p> <p>\"It was a threat. That's not the issue. The issue is what you do about it,\" Senator Kerry replied. \"The president said he was going to build a true coalition, exhaust the remedies of the UN and go to war as a last resort. Those words really have to mean something. And, unfortunately, he didn't go to war as a last resort.\"</p> <p>Throughout the debate, Mr Kerry pounded the president for the US military's failure to capture Osama bin Laden at Tora Bora in Afghanistan, and for diverting resources from the battle against al-Qaida to Iraq. </p> <p>In return, Mr Bush hit back repeatedly with the argument that Mr Kerry's wavering position on the Iraq war and his description of the invasion as a \"diversion\" sent \"mixed messages\" to US troops and allies.</p> <p>That was also the main message driven home by Bush aides afterwards in \"spin alley\". Karl Rove, the president's chief political adviser, pointed to what he said was a new contradiction in the Kerry position. </p> <p>\"He said the war was a mistake, but he also said he was not asking American soldiers to die for a mistake,\" Mr Rove said. \"Here's a guy who voted for the war and then says it's the wrong war at the wrong time. How can you go to the allies and ask them to go in there, if you're saying it's the 'wrong war'?\"</p> <p>Mr Bush did appear to score some points, hitting back at Senator Kerry for a longwinded explanation of his position on \"pre-emptive strikes\" in which the Democrat said he would only consider such an action if it passed a \"global test\" and gathered international support.</p> <p>The president said he did not know what \"a global test\" was but added: \"My attitude is you take pre-emptive action in order to protect the American people, that you act in order to make this country secure.\" </p> <p>But at other moments in the contest, Mr Bush seemed to lose track of his point between sentences and seemed to struggle to fill his allotted time for each response. Challenged by Mr Kerry for awarding tax cuts to wealthy Americans while the money could have been used to improve America's counter-terrorist defences, the president reply was vague and hesitant.</p> <p>\"Of course, we're doing everything we can to protect America. I wake up every day thinking about how best to protect America. That's my job,\" Mr Bush said. \"I work with Director Mueller of the FBI; comes in my office when I'm in Washington every morning, talking about how best to protect us. There's a lot of really good people working hard to do so. It's hard work.\"</p>",
  "Doris Clark was driving through the reservation listening to the radio when she heard the news about the hurricane battering the coast hundreds of miles away. \"There was a state of emergency declared in Florida and President Bush said he'd give $2m to help people with no water and no electricity. And I thought, OK, we have that on the reservation. There are places where we have no running water and no electricity, no phone. Why doesn't anybody say there's a state of emergency at the reservation?\" <p>This is the Navajo Nation, an area the size of France in Arizona, New Mexico and Utah. More than half its population live below the poverty level. With an average annual income of $6,000, (\u00a33,470) the Navajo constitute not only a nation within a nation, but a developing nation within a developed country. </p> <p>It is a state of affairs the federal establishment has been reluctant to acknowledge, which may explain why the Navajo have never been much interested in national politics. But in a presidential election in which every vote is cherished, the candidates have been trying to change that, paying more attention than ever before to Native Americans. </p> <p>George Bush held a private meeting with the vice-president of the Navajo Nation, Frank Dayish Jnr, before a campaign event in New Mexico in August. And John Kerry became the first presidential candidate to campaign on Native American land when he appeared at a meeting of Navajo and Zuni Indians in Gallup, New Mexico, 20 miles from Window Rock, Arizona. </p> <p>Although American Indians make up only 1.5% of the US population, many of them live in swing states. Their reservations contain the bulk of America's casinos and the income from gambling has turned the tribes into potential donors: they have given $36,000 (\u00a320,809) to the Bush campaign and $17,000 to Kerry's. </p> <p>And as with any poor ethnic minority in the US, the war in Iraq is a potent issue: proportionately more American Indians are serving in Iraq than any other ethnic group. When the Navajo do vote in federal elections they tend to be overwhelmingly Democrat. </p> <p>\"It's kind of comical,\" said Edison Wauneka, executive director of the Navajo election administration, who says that 95% of registered Navajo voters are Democrats. \"The Navajo people say we're more familiar with a donkey [the Democratic party's symbol], we're not familiar with an elephant [the Republican symbol]. But really our culture is more similar to the Republicans. It is more in our culture to be self sufficient.\" </p> <p>Poverty is probably the greatest factor in shaping the political attitudes of the Navajo: 56% of the 180,000 people living as part of the Navajo nation are below the official poverty level. </p> <p>But apathy has been a core reason why the Navajo, who vote in numbers for their own internal government, have been luke-warm at best towards presidential campaigns. That might change if they felt they had more clout. Although they were granted sovereign nation status by the federal government in 1868 in exchange for giving up land rights, the Navajo vote in the three states that contain the reservation, reducing their impact. </p> <p>Some Navajo leaders would prefer it if they could have their own electoral college voting en bloc. </p> <p>There are 2.5m Native Americans in the US, and the Navajo is the largest tribe. \"When we vote for the president of the United States I wish we could vote as a nation,\" Mr Wauneka said. \"We say we're a sovereign nation but we don't own our lands. The Indian nations don't even have a voting bloc. If they were to come together they would become strong and make a difference.\" </p> <p>But Robert Black Jnr, another election authority official, believes the Navajo can be more influential voting in their respective states, particularly in potential swing states where their votes can have a disproportionate influence. </p> <p>\"We have the possibility of swinging electoral votes in Arizona, New Mexico and Utah. It could be less effective if it was a Navajo nation with its own electoral college,\" he said. </p> <p>The priority this November is to get the Navajo to vote, and so officials have moved the Navajo's own government elections to coincide with the presidential election. </p> <p>The apathy is not helped by language and tradition. The Navajo language is dying out, but many of the older generations do not speak English and have previously relied on picture cards and translators to help them vote. </p> <p>\"We're very proud of our picture ballots,\" said Mr Wauneka, holding up a yellow sample ballot card, with mugshots of the candidates alongside name and party allegiance listings. \"A lot of states have problems with language barriers and we think picture ballots can help.\" </p>"

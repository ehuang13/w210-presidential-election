  "Australia and Afghanistan don't have much in common, other than a vast, arid interior. But as voters in both countries cast their ballots over the weekend, their respective elections will have had an impact on political landscapes around the world. In the case of Afghanistan, the very fact of its holding democratic presidential elections is the most optimistic sign to come from that country for some time. Despite last-minute turmoil when 15 presidential rivals to the interim president, Hamid Karzai, called for a boycott over possible voting fraud, election observers declared the election to be fairly conducted. The sight of long queues patiently waiting outside polling stations on Saturday is some vindication of the international efforts to reconstruct Afghanistan, as is the absence of serious reprisals and violent attempts at disruption that had been threatened by supporters of the Taliban. <p>The long queues in Australia, meanwhile, were more a reflection of the country's legal requirement on its citizens to vote than a celebration of the flowering of democracy. John Howard's victory as leader of Australia's conservative coalition was a surprisingly strong one, after opinion polls had predicted a tight race. Instead, Mr Howard's coalition increased its majority in the lower house of parliament and looks likely to take control of the senate, making it the first time in 20 years that a government has dominated both houses. This will allow Mr Howard to push through unpopular measures on employment deregulation and loosening the country's media ownership laws in favour of global goliaths such as Rupert Murdoch's News International. </p> <p>Mr Howard's victory will be closely studied by the incumbents in Downing Street and Pennsylvania Avenue. Mr Howard and his government had been a staunch member of the \"coalition of the willing\" that invaded Iraq last year, with Australia having 850 troops on the ground. The Labor opposition had boldly pledged to withdraw them by the end of the year, capitalising on winning support from those opposed to the war. But it is Australia's strong economy, with low unemployment and rising house prices, that appears to have had a greater influence on the election outcome. </p> <p>From the perspective of Tony Blair, the result is encouraging, a reminder that voters will choose domestic priorities over international affairs. The latest set of opinion polls bears this out, with Labour widening its lead over the Conservatives. Mr Blair's opponents would be unwise to rely on using Iraq as the sole fulcrum to lever him out of office.</p>",
  "From a distance, the people standing around a town square table in red jackets look like a marketing team giving away free orange juice, but get a little closer and it is clear that they are pushing a quite different product. The mixed-race, mixed-age team are political activists who represent the great unknown quantity in next month's presidential election: the 527s. <p>The catchy umbrella title refers to the tax code for a group of organisations that has mainly come into being since campaign finance law made it illegal two years ago for parties to accept large contributions from corporations, unions or individuals. </p> <p>What it means on the ground in the swing states that will decide the presidency is impossible to judge now; what is clear is that they have already changed the character of the race and will continue to do so until November 2. </p> <p>The red jackets standing around in the main square of Wilkes-Barre, in eastern Pennsylvania, are from <a href=\" http://www.act4victory.org \" target=\"_new\"> America Coming Together</a>, a multimillion-dollar donor network with offices in 17 states. Technically, the organisation is non-partisan, but it is openly dedicated to overthrowing the Bush administration. </p> <p>The orange juice is just a way of illustrating one criticism: that the last two rounds of tax cuts have squeezed the middle class, which is now left with a huge deficit to pay off while the rich enjoy a windfall. </p> <p>This is campaigning in all but name. The obvious beneficiary of the group's imaginative public awareness exercise is the Kerry-Edwards campaign - but 527 status means that any coordination with political parties is strictly prohibited. </p> <p>\"We're not selling a candidate; we're selling issues - educating people and mobilising them,\" says Sean Carr, ACT's press spokesman, based in nearby Allentown. He adds: \"When I've asked a lot of people why they never got involved in politics before they just say, 'Well, no one ever asked me.'\"</p> <p>Mr Carr, a New Jersey resident, left \"a government job, my fiancee and my dog\" to get involved full time at the beginning of the summer. Like the other activists I met, most of whom were trade unionists sporting ACT jackets and talking of regime change, he is being paid.</p> <p>After the election Tyrek Lee, 27, will be going back to his job in Boston, where he has three kids waiting for him. \"This is for their future,\" he told me. \"These 30 days here are worth it for them and for the rest of America.\" </p> <p>I asked several of the ACT staffers which way they would be voting, which induced a serious bout of squirming. \"I don't talk about my individual vote,\" said Mr Carr, adding: \"When we give people the facts on the issues, I think they will vote in a good way.\" </p> <p>Sympathetic visitors to the Middle-Class Squeeze orange juice stand were also asked to give a name and phone number to help get the vote out on election day. ACT replaces the usual party rhetoric of \"Vote for me\" with pocket-sized leaflets stating: \"Take the pledge! Your vote makes the difference.\" </p> <p>Wilkes-Barre voters who were prepared to engage in conversation with the ACT team were generally sympathetic to the Kerry cause. Ironically, the rather dilapidated square where we stood had been encircled with plastic barriers in preparation for a presidential campaign stop the following day. </p> <p>George Barron, a Democrat-supporting attorney who passed by, said he had profoundly mixed feelings about the 527 phenomenon: \"The unfortunate thing on both sides is that they have been more negative and less responsible than the candidates themselves.\" </p> <p>He said the advertising end of the 527 operation, led in oppositional terms by <a href=\" http://www.moveon.org/front/\" target=\"_new\"> MoveOn.org</a> had encouraged a new \"nastiness\".</p> <p>\"As long as the <a href=\"http://www.swiftvets.com \" target=\"_new\"> Swift Boat Veterans for Truth</a> are out there making noise we need folks on the other side doing the same .\"</p> <p>But he added: \"I would like to think after this election these 527s will be eliminated, because it defeats the entire purpose of campaign reform.\"</p> <p>Progressive 527s may truly have had no contact whatsoever with Democratic strategy chiefs - or enraged swift boat vets with the Bush campaign - yet their positioning has been complementary. They have spent money and attacked with advertising in places where the party could not go. In Pennsylvania, the voting registration deadline was last Monday, and early indications are that tens of thousands more people have signed up than did in 2000. </p> <p>ACT's office in the classic swing voter territory of the Lehigh Valley provides some insight into why the political party establishment is viewing the 527 ground operation as a force to be reckoned with. </p> <p>The network of rooms at the back of a shabby local hotel has all the feel of a local campaign headquarters in full swing, without the obligatory stack of candidates' biographies and smiling posters. </p> <p>The field director in charge, Siobhan \"Sam\" Bennett, 47, is almost messianic about her task and the youthful team around her. She is a registered Democrat who ran for city mayor four years ago, losing by a few dozen votes to a seasoned Republican incumbent. </p> <p>She sees no contradiction in shelving her party connections for an operation that serves both her causes well. \"This is an important region on the ground floor in terms of making sure that everyone who should be registered is registered and making sure that everyone votes,\" she said. </p> <p>\"How can we remain healthy as a nation, irrespective of party, if people are not engaged in the political process? Declining voter participation is terribly damaging to our long-term health.\" </p> <p>Her idealistic and genuine hope is that ACT will make more people take part, and she goes a great deal further in transcending the party political prism than does the organisation's own website. She used to vote Republican until the Clinton era: \"At the door, we don't ever mention George's name here when we work. What's important to me are the issues,\" she says.</p> <p>Unsurprisingly, local Republican officials do not recognise the civic-mindedness of the ACT and MoveOn agenda: \"They are shadowy groups funded by unregulated, soft money,\" said Mark Pfeifle, a media spokesman for the Bush campaign in Pennsylvania, who clearly sees the 527s as an electoral threat. </p> <p>\"Our grassroots operation has been empowered and excited by them. We have an army of volunteers who have made more than one million phone contacts; they, on the other hand, are paying people to come in from out of state.\" </p> <p>ACT has attracted thousands of volunteers of its own to help the huge doorstep operation in cities like Allentown. Many of them have indeed come by bus for the day or for the weekend from places such as nearby New York. Plenty of their volunteers are also locally based, say officials. </p> <p>One thing that both ACT and the state's Bush-Cheney campaign would agree on is that there is no way of properly judging the 527 effect until election day itself, although the local polling evidence is looking good for the anti-Bush lobby. </p> <p>Chris Borick, director of the public opinion institute at Muhlenberg college in Allentown, said that after being tied in the spring Kerry this week had a 6% edge over Bush among registered voters in the Lehigh Valley area. </p> <p>\"The 527s' presence is being clearly felt in local grassroots politics,\" he said. \"They are, by design, supposed to be unaffiliated with the campaigns, but by their very nature then go hand in hand ... While legally bound to be separate, in reality they are intertwined.\" </p> <p>With relatively small numbers of swing voters remaining, the decisive factor may be simply getting out the vote, he said: \"Something I'm not sure we are truly picking up in the way we model our polling numbers is greater-than-expected turnout. These groups could tip the balance in terms of mobilisation.</p> <p>\"When we look back at the book of the 2004 election, I am anticipating that 527s will be a fairly substantial chapter.\"</p>",
  "Read the media and you'll be aware of a momentous political event taking place some way east of California. Over on the other coast something called the 2004 presidential election is happening. Swing voters are being courted, canvassers are knocking on doors, and suspicious-sounding 527 committees are piling money into local TV commercials. But out here on the west coast, where people are as passionate about their politics as anywhere else, the whole thing seems like a phoney war. Sure, there are petitioners on street corners and leafleters at farmers' markets, but where oh where are the real politicians? California needs to see more of middle-aged men kissing babies, it needs to see more secret servicemen wearing mirror shades, it needs more senseless ticketed photo ops dressed up as political rallies. <p>True, Bush and Kerry both visited Los Angeles in the summer, indeed in the same week, and they both put in an appearance in the spring, going to their rich friends' houses to ask for money. But compared to four years ago the attention paid to the nation's most populous state, the state with the largest economy in the union, the state that has given most money to the presidential candidates, has been pitiful. </p> <p>Four years ago, California was the centre of things presidential as the Democrats held their convention in Los Angeles. The candidates swung through the state, they even had their photo taken with the governor. But this time, no one is coming to the party. </p> <p>The main reason is that, without a convention to go to, national candidates figure that there is little to be gained from the long trek to the west coast. Californian voters, polling wisdom tells us, have made up their minds, and their minds are firmly Democrat. So the Kerry-Edwards team stays away, not wanting to waste money on the converted, while the Bush-Cheney camp prefers to focus on the swing states. After all, it's a long way from Florida to California. </p> <p>But California, according to the latest polls, is slightly more complicated than they imagine. For a start, the state mirrors the nation. The coast is liberal, the interior more conservative. The further you travel from the Pacific, the more Republican the voters become. Californians also tend to be classic third way voters, sticking to neither liberal nor conservative orthodoxies: they are liberal on social issues, such as gun control, abortion, the environment, but are fiscal conservatives, preferring deregulation, low taxes and small government.</p> <p>If you were to try to embody this confused political philosophy in one person, that figure might look something like Californian governor Arnold Schwarzenegger. His recent flurry of decisions on bills passed by the state's legilsature have revealed him to be, well, unexpectedly liberal on some social issues - he is a Republican, after all - and convincingly conservative on others. So he has approved the distribution of clean hypodermic needles to people without prescription, toughened gun control and strengthened the rights of same-sex couples. But his conservative side has vetoed legislation promising an increase in the minimum wage, granting driving licences to undocumented immigrants and extending health insurance to cover maternity. Schwarzenegger has passed all of the tests set for him by the state's chamber of commerce, opposing all the legislation the chamber opposed and proving himself to be a reliable friend of car dealers, the pharmaceutical industry and big business in general.</p> <p>Of course, Governor Schwarzenegger is one explanation for the absence of the big players from California. His star wattage remains undimmed, despite the various political setbacks he has endured during the first 11 months of his mandate. No national politician in his right mind would be tempted by the prospect of sharing Arnold's spotlight in California. </p> <p>But Schwarzenegger is also one reason why it might make sense for the national players to come to California. His liberal credentials have earned him widespread support among Democrats and, if the state were ever to sway toward the Republicans, this might be the time. Recent polling suggests that the state may not be the shoo-in Democrats have for so long assumed. Three polls published in the last week send the sort of mixed message that can make George Bush so snippy. The Field Poll has Kerry leading Bush by 49-40, down from 53-41 in August, which in turn was down from a Kerry lead of 55-40 in May. But a survey by San Jose State University has Kerry ahead by just six points, at 48-42, down from his lead of 50-28 in July. And, just to confuse matters, the latest Rasmussen survey, covering the week to October 4, has Kerry ahead 53-40. </p> <p>Of course what will actually happen on November 2 is that John Kerry will win California, taking all its 55 electoral college votes with him and bearing out the decisions of the two campaigns not to bother with the state. Hopefully that result will lend weight to calls for reform of the winner-takes-all formula governing the presidential election. But don't hold your breath.</p>",
  "An opposition boycott of Afghanistan's presidential election appeared to be cracking yesterday as local and international observers declared the vote prone to blunders but generally fair. <p>Mohammed Mohaqeq, a high profile challenger to the interim president, Hamid Karzai, said he no longer supported the boycott announced on Saturday by all 15 opposition candidates, who claimed there had been widespread voter fraud. </p> <p>\"There is no question of a boycott,\" he told about 1,000 supporters at a mosque in western Kabul. </p> <p>The US ambassador, Zalmay Khalilzad, shuttled between other candidates to persuade them to follow Mr Mohaqeq's example as the counting of the votes started in eight tightly guarded centres. </p> <p>Another candidate, Abdul Hadi Dabir, said some had already changed their minds. </p> <p>Meanwhile, a joint UN-Afghan election body announced an independent inquiry into claims of fraud. </p> <p>The controversy marred an otherwise peaceful election that saw millions of Afghans participate in what they hoped would end a quarter of a century of violent chaos. </p> <p>In an initial assessment, the Free and Fair Election Foundation of Afghanistan (Fefa) said that despite many errors and some deliberate rigging the poll was largely successful. The Organisation for Security and Cooperation of Europe, which deployed 40 experts, gave a similar verdict. </p> <p>The fraud allegations emerged after just a few hours of polling, when voters complained that what was supposed to be indelible ink, used to prevent multiple voting, could be easily rubbed off. </p> <p>Naseem, a hotel waiter in Kabul, held out a spotlessly clean hand that he said had been inked at a polling station an hour earlier. \"I just washed it away,\" he said. </p> <p>The scale of the problem remained unclear yesterday. UN officials blamed inexperienced election workers, who had used the wrong ink. But observers said the organisers were also at fault because some of the correct ink had dried up or was not indelible. </p> <p>Fefa called for an investigation into the irregularities, which also included allegations that some poll workers directed voters how to vote. </p> <p>The election marked a setback for the Taliban, which managed just a few skirmishes and landmine attacks on polling days. \"The Taliban made very limited attacks,\" the US commander, Lt Gen David Barno, told Associated Press. \"Yesterday was a huge defeat for the Taliban.\" </p> <p>The insurgent force had issued warnings of bombings, beatings and rocket attacks. But millions of Afghans were undeterred, flooding into bullet-pocked schools, mosques and clinics to cast their ballot. </p> <p>One official with the peacekeeping force said a line of voters had had to scatter after a rocket exploded in Jalalabad. But after a few moments, they had returned to the queue and voted. </p> <p>Some voters saw the opposition boycott as a ploy by poor losers. \"This was like an exam for them, and they have failed,\" said Saleh Muhammad, 64, a shopkeeper in western Kabul. He said he kept a Mohaqeq poster in his window to avoid harassment, but had voted for Mr Karzai. </p> <p>First figures were due late last night, but a spokesman said a result might take another week. </p>",
  "The contest for the White House was locked in a dead heat yesterday, with Republican and Democratic strategists looking to the third and last debate to score the convincing victory that could alter the dynamics of the race. <p>With just three weeks until voting day, the gap between George Bush and John Kerry has narrowed significantly. </p> <p>An ABC television poll conducted after Friday night's debate in Missouri and released yesterday put Mr Bush marginally ahead with 50% support compared with 46% for Mr Kerry, but still within the margins of error. </p> <p>That tightening of the race elevates the importance of Wednesday's debate in Arizona as the last, best chance for either candidate to take a decisive lead. </p> <p>With that debate, the focus of the campaigns shifts from Iraq to domestic issues, where the Democrats believe they have an advantage. </p> <p>\"We have to, number one, focus on making sure the American people know what's happened over the last four years,\" the vice-presidential candidate, John Edwards, said yesterday morning in one of several appearances on the weekend chatshows. </p> <p>Mr Edwards said Mr Bush had presided over historic job losses and a worsening economy, charges the Democrats plan to amplify in the run-up to the debate. </p> <p>Although two instant polls crowned Mr Kerry the winner of Friday night's clash in Missouri, the victory was not so decisive as to reverse the Republicans' overall edge. </p> <p>For his part Mr Bush was far more in command of his material than during his dismal performance in the first debate, and he held his temper largely in check, replacing the angry scowls with a studiously blank expression. </p> <p>The Democratic pollster Stanley Greenberg said Mr Kerry had improved his \"likeability quotient\", especially among uncommitted voters. \"He clearly established a sense of confidence and likeability and made possible these gains in personal favourability which, I believe, will translate into vote changes during the next week,\" the pollster said. </p> <p>Now that the Democratic candidate has established a presidential demeanour with his two solid debate performances, he must work to convince the American people that he shares their concerns about jobs and healthcare. \"We are going to find that John Kerry is a fighter for the middle classes,\" said Joe Lockhart, a senior campaign adviser. </p> <p>Mr Kerry, meanwhile, picked up on one of the most pointed exchanges of Friday night, when Mr Bush refused to answer a woman who had asked for three examples of mistakes made by his administration. \"Do we want leadership - as it's called - that can't face reality and admit mistakes?\" Mr Kerry asked a Democratic rally in Ohio. </p> <p>But the president has been just as active in setting out the parameters of Wednesday's debate. With Iraq on the sidelines for now, Mr Bush has abandoned momentarily the \"flip-flop\" label that has dogged Mr Kerry throughout the campaign to focus on making the case that the Democratic candidate is a tax-and-spend liberal. </p> <p>Mr Bush used the \"liberal\" epithet four times in Missouri, and stayed with the theme in campaign appearances at the weekend. In the mid west battleground states of Iowa and Minnesota, Mr Bush moved to cast the Democratic challenger as a high-spending liberal who would raise taxes to pay for government welfare programmes. Mr Kerry \"can run but can't hide\" from his past support for tax increases, Mr Bush repeatedly said. </p> <p>The Republicans have homed in on Mr Kerry's healthcare plan, saying it would create an unwieldy government bureaucracy. \"If you like the DMV [department of motor vehicles] and you want to get that for your healthcare, you're going to love the Kerry plan,\" Mr Bush's campaign manager, Ken Mehlman, said yesterday. </p> <p>Mr Edwards has also become a target. A millionaire trial attorney before entering politics, he has become a convenient focus for Republican charges that health costs have escalated because of lawsuits. </p> <p>Meanwhile, Mr Kerry was out courting the crucial black vote yesterday. He attended two church services in Miami, one with Haitian Catholics and the other with black Baptists, where the Rev Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton tied his election to the civil rights struggle. \"We have an unfinished march in this nation,\" Associated Press reported Mr Kerry as saying at the Friendship Missionary Baptist church. </p> <p>\"Never again will a million African Americans be denied the right to exercise their vote in the United States,\" he added, referring to the disputed Florida recount in the 2000 presidential race. </p> <p>Black turnout is key to Mr Kerry winning in Florida and elsewhere - less than 10% of black voters nationally supported Mr Bush in 2000.</p>"

  "There can be few jobs in the United States Secret Service as cushy as being one of Jimmy Carter's bodyguards. You get to wear the cool earpiece, and ride in the blacked-out SUV, but, seriously, who's going to want to attack the most decent man to have occupied the White House in living memory? Wherever they go, George Bush, John Kerry and Bill Clinton are surrounded by burly, paranoid-looking men, ready to wrestle you to the ground if you breathe at them wrongly. But on a crisp autumn day at the Carter Centre, a human-rights institute sprawled over 35 leafy acres in Atlanta, Carter's security detail are relaxing near one of the entrances, trading jokes, while their 80-year-old charge works unmonitored within. Nearby, the young researchers showing up for work in jeans exude the happy calm of people whose jobs mesh well with their consciences. As they pass in the pink-walled lobby, they pause, make eye contact, and wish you good morning like they really mean it. All of which makes the question of how to address Carter slightly fraught. The standard practice (though not, I later learn, the official etiquette) is to call all former presidents \"Mr President\". But somewhere this informal, can that really be appropriate? <p>Actually, yes. The 39th president of the United States, in shirtsleeves and loafers today, is a man forever caught between niceness and grandeur. One of the two condescending cliches about him is that he was too nice for the White House, and perhaps in defiance, his manner remains somewhat imperious. With its gold-fringed American flag and massive, intricately carved desk, his private workplace seems like a replica Oval Office; the rumour used to be that his laptop still played Hail To The Chief when it was booted up. His use of the first-person plural, meanwhile, can sound decidedly royal. \"What we did, in our time, was to keep the country at peace,\" he will say later, in honeyed vowels that combine a lifetime in the political aristocracy with his origins as a Georgia peanut farmer. \"We had a very good actual record.\" </p> <p>But the grandeur vanishes, replaced by beaming smiles, whenever he talks about The Hornet's Nest, the book that recently made him the first former president to publish a novel. \"Are you familiar with Patrick O'Brian?\" he asks with excitement, explaining part of the inspiration for his densely researched tale of the American war of independence. I confess that I haven't read my way through O'Brian's long list of cult seafaring tales. \"I have,\" he responds. \"I've read all the way through them, and I'm reading them for a second time now.\" </p> <p>The other Carter cliche is that he is the best former president America has ever had. The fading popular memory of his administration is still dominated by the 444-day hostage crisis in Iran, in which 66 Americans were kidnapped, 52 of them held for months, and eight US servicemen were killed in a botched rescue mission. The Carter \"post-presidency\", by contrast, has been a marathon of valuable diplomacy in North Korea, the Middle East, Haiti and Cuba, of election-monitoring and Nobel Peace prize-winning. The Carter Centre, besides its conflict resolution work, has helped nearly eliminate several major world diseases. More recently, Carter has broken with ex-presidential etiquette by attacking Bush and Tony Blair for invading Iraq on the basis of \"lies or misinterpretations\", and savaged Jeb Bush over the potential for a new election fiasco in Florida. In his spare time, he paints. He makes furniture in his workshop in Plains, the Georgia village where he was born in the era of segregation. He studies Native American history. He writes poems. He is, depending on whom you believe, either an exuberant polymath, or a man still flailing to find a secure historical legacy. </p> <p>If it's the latter, I'm not sure The Hornet's Nest is going to help much. At 465 pages, the detail-laden story of Pratt, a Philadelphian lured to the South to fight for the American cause, is something of a slog, leavened mainly by its unintentionally funny sex scenes. (\"He was overwhelmed with a feeling of tenderness,\" one already much-mocked passage runs, \"and was also aroused sexually, which his tight trousers made obvious to both of them.\") </p> <p>Still, one neglected truth about the revolutionary war, deeply ironic today, jumps out from the novel: America owes its independence to the French. \"I never dreamed that by the time the book went into print, America would be refusing to eat so-called french fries, and things of that category,\" Carter says. \"Quite a ridiculous development. We could never have won the revolutionary war had it not been for the French.\" He smiles. \"Although the French didn't do it out of altruism, or love of America. They did it out of hatred for Great Britain.\" </p> <p>The more Carter talks, the more he gently lectures on the lessons of history and the dangers of the present moment, the more difficult it becomes to accept the idea that he was too nice for the presidency. Now that we know what happens when macho posturing replaces niceness at the White House, Carter's decency - his quiet moralism, his intense but low-key religiosity, his rock-solid marriage to his wife Rosalynn - all come to seem less like unaffordable indulgences and more like urgent necessities. (When it comes to toughness, in any case, there is style and there is substance: Carter, on taking office, had spent more years in the military than any 20th-century president except Eisenhower.) </p> <p>So why does he think the US electorate punished him so badly over Iran - a crisis that wasn't his choice, and in which relatively few Americans died - while the polls are so split about Bush's arguably far worse, and certainly more deadly, adventure in Iraq? </p> <p>\"I think the basic reason is that our country suffered, in 9/11, a terrible and shocking attack ... and George Bush has been adroit at exploiting that attack, and he has elevated himself, in the consciousness of many Americans, to a heroic commander-in-chief, fighting a global threat against America,\" Carter says. \"He's repeatedly played that card, and to some degree quite successfully. I think that success has dissipated. I don't know if it's dissipating fast enough to affect the election. We'll soon know.\" </p> <p>The bitter truth seems to be that the Iranian debacle was received so badly precisely because Carter had proven so successful, in other respects, at keeping the peace - whereas now, there's a war on. \"When your troops go to war, the prime minister or the president change overnight from an administrator, dealing with taxation and welfare and health and deteriorating roads, into the commander-in-chief,\" he says. \"And it's just become almost unpatriotic to describe Bush's fallacious and ill-advised and mistaken and sometimes misleading actions. The press have been cowed, because they didn't want to be unpatriotic. There has been a lack of inquisitive journalism. In fact, it's hard to think of a major medium in the United States that has been objective and fair and balanced, and critical when criticism was deserved.\" </p> <p>Another hazard of being a former president, it seems, is that you feel the force of your successors' policy reversals with all the acuteness of personal slights. \"All of those long, tedious negotiations that were done by Dwight Eisenhower, John Kennedy, Nixon and me and Reagan, to control the spread of nuclear weapons have been abandoned by Bush,\" he sighs. Carter praises Kerry for \"bringing out the fallacies of Bush's foreign policy\", but warns that he must \"show consistency in his positions, and that he's a strong leader. That's the only advice I'd give.\" </p> <p>Carter rejects the worst criticism that could be made of his administration: that his alleged softness in the face of Islamist terrorism helped nourish the threat that culminated in today's al-Qaida. \"I don't think that's an accurate assessment. \"The entire Islamic world condemned Iran. Nowadays, because of the unwarranted invasion of Iraq by Bush and Blair, which was a completely unjust adventure based on misleading statements, and the lack of any effort to resolve the Palestinian issue, [there is] massive Islamic condemnation of the United States.\" </p> <p> Still, it must be tough, having held the most powerful position in the world, to have so many people continue to believe that everything you've done since has been more impressive. Does the \"best former president\" line irritate him? \"Maybe it did at the beginning. But I don't have any doubt that my post-presidency has made some historians go back and look at the administration with a more benevolent and approving attitude. We promoted human rights, we promoted freedom, we promoted peace between others - peace between Israel and Egypt,\" in the Camp David accords. \"I feel quite at ease about the presidential record, and also the post-presidential. But I like to do different things. Last April, I began to paint...\" And he is smiling again, plunging back into the details of his richly varied life. </p> <p>Perhaps it is no wonder that Carter is still most aglow when he speaks of Plains, where he will sometimes rise at five, in the morning stillness, and write for five or six hours at a time. \"And then, when I'm tired of my computer screen, I usually go to my farmland to visit my crops, or to my woodlands, or I build another piece of furniture, or paint a picture. It's a very wonderful opportunity I have. Almost complete isolation.\" </p> <p>But he is a long way from retiring there permanently yet. \"I've got to go,\" he says suddenly. \"I have to go to Grenada.\" He jumps from his seat and vanishes to a private room behind his office. The interview is over and, as you leave, you find, to your surprise, that you've caught a bit of his glow - that you feel genuinely hopeful for hurricane-torn Grenada, and nostalgic for the days when the worst that could be said about a president's character was that he made himself look silly when he admitted to feeling lust in his heart for women who weren't his wife. </p> <p>Meanwhile, outside in the cool air, the happiest Secret Service operatives in all of America are bouncing on their feet to keep warm. Their conversation is beginning to drift towards wondering when Carter will be ready to be driven to the airport. But it would be wrong to suggest that they seem particularly worried about performing this crucial bit of bodyguarding. </p> <p>\"Shall we go find him?\" one of them asks. </p> <p>His colleague performs an exaggeratedly nonchalant shrug. \"He knows where the van is.\" </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> The Hornet's Nest by Jimmy Carter is published by Simon &amp; Schushter at \u00a317.99.

  "<p>With a week to go before the election, the sounds of silence about the main cause of economic instability are deafening. Perhaps that is because for 17 years there has been one gatekeeper of US economic policy: Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan - reinstated for a fifth term partly because he's the most vocal cheerleader of Bush's plans to cut taxes for the rich, mortgage the federal budget and privatise social security. </p> <p>Since his appointment in 1987, Greenspan has glided over an epic savings and loans crisis and merely levied a token 25-basis point rate rise to curtail the runaway stock market of the 90s. As the market came crashing down, he cut rates 11 times, enabling ever-larger banks access to even cheaper money to pump into corporate America. Greenspan's reaction to fraud fallout and bank misconduct was to bless more mega-mergers. </p> <p>After the bank-inspired corporate implosions came finger pointing, job cutting, and benefit slashing. Inculpability ran rampant - in the boardroom, on Wall Street and in Washington. It was \"the economy\" that hurt the economy, not the corporate debt overhang, cooked books, faux stock market or loose policy. </p> <p>Criticism of conflicts of interest on Wall Street never came from the Fed, nor the Bush administration, the SEC, Congress, or even John Kerry, former member of the Senate banking committee. It came from Eliot Spitzer, attorney general of New York. </p> <p>The finance, insurance and real estate sector pays well to be so overlooked. It poured $775m into political pockets over the past three election cycles: 59% to the Republicans, 41% to the Democrats. My former employer, Goldman Sachs, outdid itself this election, leading corporate American campaign donations with $4.8m. </p> <p>During the third presidential debate, Bush cooed: \"We've come through a recession, a stock market decline, an attack on our country. And yet ... this economy is growing.\" He says he has created 1.9 million jobs. Kerry says he has lost more than any president since Herbert Hoover. Neither candidate broached the connection between job losses and the deregulated corporate environment. Yet US firms produced more bankruptcies over the past few years than in any other period in US history. They created the widest wage gap between the average worker and average Fortune 500 chief executive. They cut jobs and pension plans to compensate. </p> <p>In 1929, America experienced a market crash followed by years of depression in which 25% of the population lost jobs. It was caused by wild speculation, availability of cheap money, and deception. The Glass-Steagall Act in 1933 separated bank functions in order to avoid conflicts of interest. It fostered stability for decades. </p> <p>It has been ripped apart by Greenspan, bipartisan Congresses, Robert Rubin, Clinton's treasury secretary, and now Citigroup's vice-chairman, and by regulatory neglect. The bigger financial institutions become, the greater the competition among them and the more incentive to fabricate value. On this impending crisis, Bush is a lost cause, Kerry a disappointment and Greenspan the biggest economic danger no matter who wins. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Nomi Prins wrote Other People's Money: The Corporate Mugging of America (The New Press) released in UK this week</p>",
  "George Bush has exploited the suffering of September 11 and turned back decades of efforts to make the world a safer place, the former president Jimmy Carter says in an interview with the Guardian published today. <p>Attacking Mr Bush and Tony Blair over Iraq, Mr Carter calls the war \"a completely unjust adventure based on misleading statements\". </p> <p>He also criticises Mr Bush for \"lack of effort\" on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and accuses him of abandoning nuclear non-proliferation initiatives championed by five presidents. </p> <p>The US \"suffered, in 9/11, a terrible and shocking attack ... and George Bush has been adroit at exploiting that attack, and he has elevated himself, in the consciousness of many Americans, to a heroic commander-in-chief, fighting a global threat against America,\" Mr Carter says. </p> <p>\"He's repeatedly played that card, and to some degree quite successfully. I think that success has dissipated. I don't know if it's dissipating fast enough to affect the election. We'll soon know.\" </p> <p>Mr Carter, 80, was president from 1977-1981, but did not win re-election amid the US hostage crisis in Iran. By comparison, support for Mr Bush's Iraq invasion is widespread, something Mr Carter attributes to a transformation in America's national mood. </p> <p>\"When your troops go to war, the prime minister or the president change overnight from an administrator, dealing with taxation and welfare and health and deteriorating roads, into the commander-in-chief,\" he says. \"And it's just become almost unpatriotic to describe Bush's fallacious and ill-advised and mistaken and sometimes misleading actions.\" </p> <p>Mr Bush and Mr Blair are blamed for helping to fuel the depth of anti-American feeling in the Islamic world. Denying any link between his handling of the Iranian crisis and the present threat, Mr Carter says: \"The entire Islamic world condemned Iran. Nowadays, because of the unwarranted invasion of Iraq by Bush and Blair, which was a completely unjust adventure based on misleading statements, and the lack of any effort to resolve the Palestinian issue, [there is] massive Islamic condemnation of the United States.\" </p> <p>American media organisations, he adds, \"have been cowed, because they didn't want to be unpatriotic. There has been a lack of inquisitive journalism. In fact, it's hard to think of a major medium in the United States that has been objective and fair and balanced, and critical when criticism was deserved\". </p> <p>On nuclear proliferation, the issue that the Democratic contender John Kerry has identified as the single most serious threat to national security, Mr Carter attacks Mr Bush for abandoning \"all of those long, tedious negotiations\" carried out by presidents Eisenhower, Kennedy, Nixon, Reagan and himself. </p> <p>In recent weeks he has also warned of the possibility of a new election fiasco in Florida. </p> <p>The two presidential candidates spent the weekend focusing their resources and words even more tightly on the small number of swing states considered crucial to the election on November 2. </p> <p>Mr Bush told supporters in Florida that \"despite ongoing violence, Iraq has an interim government. It's building up its own security forces. We're headed toward elections in January. You see, we're safer, America is safer with Afghanistan and Iraq on the road to democracy. We can be proud that 50 million citizens of those countries now live as free men and women\". </p> <p>Mr Carter's interview marks the UK publication of his book The Hornet's Nest, a story of the American revolutionary war and the first novel to be published by a former president. Ironically, he notes, those fighting for US independence could never have triumphed were it not for an alliance with the French.</p>",
  "For a cheese-eating surrender monkey, Guilhem Alandry is a brave man. A Frenchman, and plainly a bit of a lefty, Alandry is heading to George Bush's hometown of Crawford, Texas. Not just for a quick visit, not just to buy a Bush mug at a souvenir shop and head back out. Alandry wants to move in - temporarily - with a Crawford family and document their lives at a critical point in the town's history, the 2004 presidential election. <p>Alandry is one-fifth of Documentography, a London-based collective of photographers that will fan out across the US and capture the lives of five American families in the week before the election and its immediate aftermath. Guardian Unlimited will carry their project as part of our US election coverage. </p> <p>Only one of the photographers, the Brit Muzi Quawson, had a pre-arranged agreement to move in with a specific family. She will be in LaGrange, Georgia, living in a multi-generational household that runs the political spectrum from conservative to liberal. </p> <p>The others will be relying on the openness and hospitality of their host communities to find a family willing to live for a week with cameras, audio recordings and a foreigner with a possibly very different world view.</p> <p>Brazilian Eduardo Martino flew into San Diego on Wednesday, in search of a Hispanic family with military connections. Danish photographer Anna Kari - she came up with the idea for the project - left for Tallahassee, Florida on Thursday. And finally Magali Corouge is off to the battleground state of Ohio. </p> <p>Sitting in their cluttered, cosy Hackney flat, surrounded by souvenirs from trips to Africa, Alandry, Corouge and Kari are full of enthusiasm for the towns they hope will take them in. </p> <p>All three of them are typing away into their laptops as we chat. What was the name of that factory in Canton, Ohio that just laid off all those workers? Exactly how many people live in Crawford, Texas - is it 500 or 700? Tap, tap, tap. They have studied their target towns reverently and have constructed broad profiles of the types of families they hope will take them in for a week and a half. </p> <p>Corouge wants to document people affected by the 10% unemployment rate that has ravaged Canton. Most have lost their jobs in the last three or four years, she says. She hopes to find an extended family living together out of economic necessity, perhaps a working couple that have moved back in with their parents to make ends meet. But with just enough space left over to accommodate a sympathetic French photographer for a short time.</p> <p>Kari chose Tallahassee because it suffered most from governor Jeb Bush's move to purge criminals from the state's voter rolls before the last election. Thousands of Floridians were disenfranchised by lists that erroneously connected them with criminal records, and a disproportionate number of those voters were African-Americans likely to vote for Al Gore. \"I'm hoping to find someone upset about what happened four years ago, someone active in the community,\" says Kari.</p> <p>Alandry has wanted to visit Crawford since the French refused to join the invasion of Iraq. </p> <p>\"In Crawford they were the first to take up freedom fries and they really hated the French,\" he recalls almost fondly. But that was two years ago, and the people of Crawford have seen a nonstop parade of international VIPs and grown accustomed to media tents on their main street. </p> <p>He talks excitedly about the German immigrants that founded the community in the 1800s and the modern conflict of Democrats and Republicans coexisting in a small town made famous when George and Laura Bush bought a ranch there in 1999. </p> <p>Documentography hopes its project will counterbalance the mainstream media coverage of the elections, which has drowned out the sound of ordinary Americans discussing the impact of politics on their lives.</p> <p>\"I think political debate is a lot more aggressive in the US; it's like a stageshow. People are very radical in their opinions. Or maybe we don't hear from the middle ground so much,\" Kari says. \"I feel like I have to go down to local paper level to hear people's voices.\"</p> <p>Each photographer will post 10 pictures each day on Guardian Unlimited, along with accompanying text and three minutes of sound. </p> <p>\"It could be two neighbours talking about who they'll vote for, or ambient sound from a football stadium,\" Alandry explains. \"We won't constantly be asking the families, 'Who are you voting for? What about Iraq?' It will be much more about daily life, about sitting around a barbecue with a beer.\"</p> <p>Assuming the famous Texan hospitality comes to Alandry's aid and lands him with a home in Crawford for the week, he is still worried about what will happen the day after the election.</p> <p>\"If Kerry wins, I don't know what will happen to Crawford. For that village it is a big deal,\" he says. Crawford, he notes, was a dying community before the Bush ranch put it on the map. His presidency has created an unexpected revenue stream, one that might be cut off if the White House changes hands. </p> <p>In the meantime, though, Alandry just needs a nice Texan family to feed him up.</p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> The Documentography project will run from Tuesday October 26 to election day.

  "George Bush and John Kerry today enter the final week of a presidential race that is as deadlocked now as it was six months ago. <p>With the country polarised and only a relative handful of voters still undecided, the campaigns have three final tasks: focus on a few pivotal states, mobilise their supporters, and get ready to challenge the outcome.</p> <p>Focusing the campaign involves the hard decision to switch resources from the states they might like to win to those realistically within their grasp. The candidates will narrow their focus to those few battlegrounds, where voters will be subjected to an even heavier monsoon of television advertising by the campaigns and their political surrogates.</p> <p>Both sides acknowledge that all that frantic activity has rapidly diminishing returns. The unfortunate residents of Florida, Ohio and Pennsylvania have probably seen all the political advertising they can stand.</p> <p>But what matters most this week is mobilisation: the battle to get a bigger proportion of your supporters to the polls than the other side.</p> <p>The Democrats have long prided themselves on their get-out-the-vote prowess, but over the past four years Karl Rove, the president's chief strategist, has built a centralised machine, precinct by precinct, that could erase that traditional Democratic advantage.</p> <p>Broadly speaking, mobilisation has been the game plan throughout modern electoral history, but the searing experience of the 2000 recount has introduced a new element, that could once more make the difference between victory and defeat: the readiness for legal challenges.</p> <p>The Republicans have recruited thousands of volunteers to deploy at polling stations in Democratic districts in swing states to check the credentials of the flood of newly-registered voters expected to turn up on November 2.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the Democrats claim to have some 10,000 lawyers on standby to ensure their supporters, particularly new immigrants and minorities, get to vote, and to get to court quickly to declare challenges before results are officially announced.</p> <p>It seems likely that what appeared a freak phenomenon in 2000 could become a regular occurrence in an evenly split nation, with the final decisive stage of the battle taking place after election day is over.</p> <p>The sense of deja-vu is increasing already, as the contest boils down to the same small circle of states as last time.</p> <p>The Kerry campaign, buoyed by the southern charms of its vice-presidential candidate, John Edwards, had ambitions only a few months ago of mounting a serious challenge in traditionally conservative heartland states like Virginia and North Carolina. Those ambitions have been abandoned and the Kerry camp has also pulled its forces out of Missouri, repositioning them in the remaining dozen states still in play.</p> <p>Similarly the Bush campaign has closed its operation in Washington state, where it had hoped to score a surprise win. But the president is enjoying a surprise surge in Michigan, a blue-collar, traditionally Democrat bastion, which is now back on the swing-state list.</p> <p>If the shift to Mr Bush on election day is big enough to win a state like Michigan, then the game is up for Senator Kerry in any case.</p> <p>But assuming he can beat the president there, he will have to win two of the three big remaining battleground states: Florida, Pennsylvania and Ohio, to take the presidency</p> <p>It is a question of arithmetic. The goal is to amass 270 votes in the electoral college, a body consisting of delegates, or electors from each state, whose numbers are roughly proportionate to that state's population. In all the big swing states, electors are allotted on a winner-take-all basis.</p> <p>At the moment, both John Kerry and George Bush can count on about 200 electoral college votes each, leaving 135 up for grabs. Of those, Florida accounts for 27, Pennsylvania 21, and Ohio 20.</p> <p>Four years ago, Al Gore was trailing by a few points in most national polls, just as John Kerry is today, but on election day itself, as Democrats never tire of reminding the country, Mr Gore won half a million more votes.</p> <p>That last-minute turnaround, Republicans agree, was a direct result of the Democrats' superior capacity for mobilisation, relying on foot-soldiers from the unions, environmental groups and the local political machine. This year the effort has been augmented by liberal groups like America Coming Together, which have exploited a loophole in the campaign finance laws to raise money independently of the parties and their fundraising limits.</p> <p>This year, however, the Democrats will be matched by a meticulously constructed network of Republican volunteers in every voting precinct, in which local \"precinct captains\" have been set ambitious goals for recruiting voters and transporting them to the polls on election day.</p> <p>Yet the Republican machine is untested. Its ability to deliver on its promise to match the Democratic turnout will only become clear when the dust settles after election day.</p> <p>It is quite possible that the dust will not settle for quite some time after November 2. The Democrats are convinced that if they had been better prepared for the court battles that erupted in Florida, with more lawyers on hand to fly down to the flashpoints in Miami, Palm Beach, Tampa and Tallahassee, Mr Gore would have won the day. They are not about to make the same mistake again.</p> <p>But the Republicans are ready for them, convinced that the Democrats have bent the rules in the race to register new voters.</p> <p>Rather than calm denouement that polling day has traditionally been, next Tuesday is likely to witness skirmishes between lawyers and activists on both sides at polling stations across the nation. Those battles will inevitably spill into the courtrooms and stay there, as the conservative columnist George Will put it, until \"Bush or Kerry finally gets 270 electoral votes, perhaps in May\".</p>",
  "On October 11, four co-founders of a web-based youth activist group gathered in a small apartment in Manhattan for their weekly meeting. Chairs were pulled into a circle, and iPods and cellphones were dropped onto a wooden trunk-cum-coffee table. The attendants were well-groomed and collegiate looking. Wheat Thins and Oreos were going around. The host of the meeting, a 23-year-old publicity assistant named Julie Binder, sat barefoot on the floor, occasionally tapping out notes on a laptop. <p>The night's agenda was finding a venue and sponsors for the group's election-night party, and with just over two weeks until November 2, the mood was serious. They considered bars called APT, Piano and Happy Ending. The space would have to be large but cosy, hip but relaxed, and it would need to have a television for watching the election results come in. Also, added Peter Koechley, a 23-year-old Columbia grad, it should be someplace \"where it's easy to have sex where no one notices.\" The others nodded in agreement. </p> <p>The party in question would be the climax (if you will) of <a href=\"http://www.votergasm.org\">votergasm.org</a> a non-partisan activist group whose website encourages \"young people everywhere to have sex with voters on election night, and to withhold sex from non-voters until the next presidential election.\" Votergasm also features racy voting-themed photo spreads and a game in which players must guess a voter's party affiliation based solely on the person's head shot. The group's goal, according to the Votergasm home page, is to \"send 100,000 first-time 18 to 25 year old voters to polls for the 2004 elections, and to catalyse 250,000 orgasms by the morning of November 3.\" </p> <p>A joke, right? Not really, insists the group's 23-year-old publicist, Michelle Collins, a chatty, ponytailed Barnard grad who works as a legal assistant. Collins explained that the group was founded on the belief that young Americans are failing their country in two important respects: They are not voting and not having enough sex. \"If there's anything that's really going to speak to America's youth, it's saying that voting is as important as sex, as fun, as American,\" says Collins. \"Take part in both things; you know, be a patriot, be patriotic.\" </p> <p>The premise may sound convoluted, but so far the Votergasm plan seems to be working. Since launching on September 4, the site has received more than 516,000 unique visitors (nearly 20,000 unique visitors per day, recently). More than 25,000 people have pledged to vote and have sex on election day, and more than 1,000 have clicked on the site's voter registration link. Last month, Votergasm.org was targeted by Rush Limbaugh, who poked fun at the site, and called for his listeners to shut it down by overwhelming the home page with thousands of simultaneous hits. (Hordes of Rush fans succeeded in doing so, but the site was up again in a matter of hours.) \"Me and Rush Limbaugh having a back and forth. I never thought I'd say those words,\" laughs Collins. Getting younger voters to the polls is particularly important in this year's neck-and-neck election. A recent Newsweek poll shows the youth vote to be largely up for grabs. MTV has been trying to appeal to this key demographic with its Choose or Lose 2004 campaign and the mission of P. Diddy's Citizen Change: Vote or Die organisation is to make voting \"hot, sexy and relevant\" to Americans aged 18 to 30. </p> <p>But Votergasm and other organisations are taking \"hot and sexy\" to a whole new level. One group of young activists recently formed a pornography company called Porn for Progress and just released their first movie, \"Fahrenheit 69: The Porn for Kerry DVD.\" A hardcore skin flick that also strives for social commentary, \"Fahrenheit 69\" is described by its creators as \"the world's first Pornlitical satire.\" The film features X-rated characters with familiar names, such as pundit \"Ann Cunter,\" a greased-up, writhing blonde who so loves guns that she impales herself on one for the camera. </p> <p>Sitting at a downtown New York cafe, the producer and financial backer of \"Fahrenheit 69\", who goes by the name \"Dick Tater\", explained how he and two college buddies first thought of the project during a three-way phone conversation. \"We were kind of mulling things over: Bush sucks, and we hope Kerry wins, and we haven't done anything interesting lately, and I've always loved porn.\" Like that, the trio decided to start a \"socially conscious\" porn company and to donate all profits to pro-Kerry grass-roots organisations. Within weeks, they had worked out a budget, written scripts, bought costumes, and hired actors. The film was shot in Florida over four days, with \"Tater,\" a 23-year-old Wharton grad who refused to give his real name, fluttering behind the scenes, making sure the lines were right, and occasionally holding a boom mike. </p> <p>\"The thing about us,\" Tater said, sounding very earnest, \"is that we want to make a difference. We're trying to be the Ben and Jerry of porn, to make porn that has a message, that's of much higher quality and much more interesting than other porn.\" And while Tater is under no illusion that \"Fahrenheit 69\" will throw the election, he feels confident that its satirical message will remind young viewers of Bush's indiscretions, and hopefully motivate them to vote. Maybe college kids \"who see the character Jorge Bush lubing himself up with Iraqi oil will look at that and think, yeah, what a schmuck, we just went to war for oil,\" he says. </p> <p>An even more hands-on effort is <a href=\"http://www.fthevote.com\">FTheVote.com</a> a website that encourages \"sexy liberals\" to seduce and have sex with conservatives in exchange for their partner's promise to vote against Bush. FTheVote.com (not to be confused with Fuck the Vote, which discourages voting in elections altogether and has nothing to do with sex) features photos of volunteer liberal \"models\" who offer their bodies to would-be Bush voters. \"All you need to be armed with are your sexy progressive values, a razor-sharp wit, your genitalia, and a mindset that doesn't mind taking one for the team,\" the site advises. FTheVote also provides volunteers with a downloadable contract (\"I, the undersigned, acknowledge that in exchange for physical affection ... from the co-signee, I will cast my vote for any candidate other than George W. Bush in the upcoming 2004 presidential election\"). Since its July 4 launch, FTheVote has received more than 1.8 million unique visitors, and a West Coast branch of the group has formed. </p> <p>Like Votergasm.org and Porn for Progress, FTheVote is decidedly playful, while also being serious about political activism. Nathan Martin, a 27-year-old arts professor in Pittsburgh who launched FTheVote with his friends at the media arts group Carbon Defence League, says that he started the site as a joke. But beneath FTheVote's goofiness is a profound disillusionment. Aside from hoping to \"oust Bush from office,\" Martin says, the site was born of a frustration with American politics in general, including \"the disappearance of any progressive values from the left's agenda.\" </p> <p>Perhaps the most startling fact about FTheVote is that many people seem to be taking the site's challenge seriously. Martin has received about 100 signed FTheVote contracts, and has heard from more than 200 other sex traders by e-mail. One such volunteer is Chad Vollrath, a 28-year-old English teacher in Pittsburgh. Vollrath says that he was already platonic friends with the Bush-leaning voter he slept with, but the two had long been attracted to one another. \"It was a way to, I guess, transgress a boundary in our relationship that hadn't been transgressed at that point,\" he says. But his interest wasn't only prurient. Vollrath is a fervent Kerry supporter, and wanted to score one more vote for his candidate. He feels confident that the woman - who now has another boyfriend - will stick to her promise. \"I would probably be somewhat hurt if after the election she said, 'Oh, I voted for Bush.' But I can't see that happening.\" </p> <p>FTheVote and its ilk may be capturing the attention of college-age voters, but can reducing the presidential election into a big, flirty, subterranean orgy really be considered progress? Martin of FTheVote says yes. \"How could we tarnish a system that's already so tarnished?\" he asks. Votergasm's Michelle Collins says that combining sex with American politics is only natural to her generation. \"You look at Clinton, you look at Governor McGreevy ... sex does play a humongous role in politics,\" says Collins. \"The only problem ... is that it's always a negative role.\" </p> <p>Whether Votergasm, Porn for Progress and FTheVote will have any impact on the election is debatable. But these activists get points for being inventive, spirited and, during this year's super-antagonistic race, for not taking themselves too seriously. When asked what she hoped to achieve through Votergasm, Michelle Collins thought for a few seconds and said, \"I want to, like, speak to my generation.\" She stopped herself, blushed, and covered her mouth. \"Oh my God, if I turn into a human Pepsi can here, please, forgive me.\" </p> <p> <b>\u00b7</b> Jennifer Fried, an MFA student at Bennington Writing Seminars, is a lawyer living in Brooklyn</p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> This article has been provided by Salon through a special arrangement with Guardian Newspapers Limited<br> \u00a9 Salon.com 2004</p>",
  "Susan Dzieduszycka-Suinat is pumped. Two weeks ago, sitting in an internet cafe on Munich's Odeonplatz, the software marketer who crafted a hugely successful voter registration website, pulls up numbers that show a remarkable spike in Americans overseas mobilising to defeat George W Bush. Between her site and another out of Hong Kong, Democrats have registered 140,000 new voters, 40% of them from swing states - and that is just the tip of the iceberg. Americans abroad, roused to a boiling fury by a Bush doctrine that has smeared America's good name across the globe, are looking like the \"silent swing vote\" in several key battleground states. Overseas registration for both parties is up by 400% over 2000; estimates put the tally of possible civilian votes as high as 2 million. <p>Then the panicked emails start flooding in. Today, less than two weeks before the tightest presidential race in memory, untold thousands of overseas voters still have not received their ballots - and clearly won't be able to get them back in time. Late primaries and legal challenges to Ralph Nader's appearance on the ballot delayed mailings from half the battleground states. In swing states, including Florida, Ohio and New Mexico, different versions of the ballot have gone out, sowing wild confusion. In Pennsylvania alone, at least three versions were mailed overseas, in successive, chaotic waves - with Nader and without him, plus a blank one-size-fits-all ballot with no names at all. </p> <p>Activists now fear that huge numbers of Americans overseas - both military and civilian - may be as disenfranchised as they were in 2000, when anywhere from 10 to 40% of overseas ballots, depending on the county, just plain never showed up. But, far from helping civilians, the Federal Voting Assistance Programme (FVAP) has dragged its feet. A small liaison office based in the Pentagon, the FVAP provides voting materials to the departments of defence and state for soldiers and civilians abroad, and preaches overseas election law to thousands of local election officials back home. </p> <p>The Government Accountability Office excoriated the agency for losing thousands of overseas votes in 2000, but the FVAP insists it has corrected its problems this year. Frustrated civilian advocates, however, say the FVAP remains biased and ineffective. Despite reforms, they attest, it still has not shaken its Pentagon roots: It spends the bulk of its energy getting out a heavily Republican vote among half a million service people - but has failed the far greater numbers of civilians (an estimated 4 million, by most counts) who tend to vote a different way. </p> <p>The tsunami of overseas civilian voters this year has only made the inequity more glaring. The agency was overwhelmed by a flood that has clogged its fax lines, telephones and email. It has blocked access to its website to civilian voters abroad, given military voters access to electronic ballot-request systems that civilians cannot use, and subcontracted sensitive election work to a company with strong Republican ties. For months, it failed to heed requests from the state department to post an emergency substitute ballot on its website that will mainly help civilians living far from consulates and military bases. Finally, on October 21, with only 12 days till the election, it will post a downloadable version of the federal write-in absentee ballot, known as FWAB: a last-ditch device intended for the precise situation in which thousands of overseas voters now find themselves. </p> <p>Those who've busted their guts to get out the overseas civilian vote on both sides are relieved but still angry. \"Considering 2000 and the fact everybody knew this was going to be a close race, they should have seen it coming,\" says Joan Hills, co-chair of Republicans Abroad. \"The obstacles that have been thrown up are incredible,\" says Jim Brenner, executive director of AOK (Americans Overseas for Kerry), an arm of the Democratic National Committee. Samuel F Wright, director of the Military Voting Rights Project of the National Defence Committee, and a Navy Reserve officer who has spent 25 years observing the FVAP, says: \"Frankly, I'm not impressed with them. They're sort of going through the motions. I've been pinging on DoD for four years that this is the perfect situation for the emergency ballot.\" Voters who have requested but not received their ballot by now can dispatch the FWAB in its place. (If the real ballot subsequently arrives, election officials are required to discard the FWAB and count the regular ballot.) </p> <p>A million hard copies of the FWAB have been sent to military bases in Germany and Asia and to the troops in Iraq and Afghanistan - two for every member of the military, Wright says - who surely deserve them. But on the civilian side, the record is spottier. The state department, charged with helping civilians overseas, ordered its consulates and embassies to stockpile the form. But Democrats Abroad reports that many have been caught short-handed and that direct voter requests to the FVAP have gone unfulfilled. In one pathetic twist, employees of DaimlerChrysler in Stuttgart had to beg forms from the military at the gate of the base last week, a voting officer said. </p> <p>Because so much hangs on key states, and on the possibly widespread use of an untested, little-known ballot, the potential for disaster is enormous. \"If this election is close, 2000 is going to look like a cakewalk,\" says Margo Miller, a London-based lawyer for AOK. \"It's going to be so messy in so many places, the fact that the FWAB hasn't been easier to get is inexcusable.\" </p> <p>The Pentagon responds that the two major parties began asking for the online FWAB only in late September and that it has moved \"mountains of bureaucracy\" to get the form online. Starting now, the tiny bureau of 14 civil servants in suburban Virginia will get the word out to election officials in 3,142 American counties that the downloaded version of the write-in ballot is good to go. </p> <p>But the programme's record does not inspire much confidence. Indeed, voters contacting officials to ask about the ballot have been shocked at the ignorance they've encountered. In Nepal, one embassy worker said the ballot could be mailed from the United States, which it cannot; in Chester County, Pennsylvania, an election supervisor had no idea what it was. Says Wright of the Military Voting Rights Project: \"Nobody has ever heard of it. The FVAP does show up at meetings and presentations, but I bet a lot of the 5,000 election officials don't go to those meetings, judging from the very basic questions we get back.\" </p> <p>While waiting for the FVAP to act, both parties gyrated over the internet. AOK put up its own version online with the disclaimer that no one knew if such ballots would be accepted; Democrats Abroad and the two main registration websites did not. Republicans Abroad then snitched the AOK form, without the disclaimer, and put it on its site, only to shamefacedly pull it off when told that, until the FVAP formally approved it, nobody could use the darn thing. AOK finally sent out 25,000 hard copies at its own expense to voters from swing states who'd signed up on the Overseas Vote 2004 website. </p> <p>The overarching problem is the scant resources allotted civilian voters, who outnumber the military overseas by at least eight to one. While all applaud the goal of making sure men and women fighting for our country can exercise their right to vote, civilians point out that they are Americans, too. And the FVAP has a history of favouring the military, not least because the department of defence has a captive, easily identified audience and far more money and muscle than the state department. Citizens abroad are far harder to find than soldiers: Embassies have direct contact only with a small minority of those who have registered to be alerted and evacuated in case of a disaster - though one might call mass disenfranchisement a disaster of another degree. </p> <p>Highly publicised missteps this year have hardly restored faith in the FVAP. Civilian voters still have trouble getting through to the agency and are barred from the email ballot request-and-delivery website that is available to soldiers from ten states. More worryingly, a pilot email voting system signed on to by Missouri, Utah and North Dakota, in which soldiers can email ballots to a contractor that then faxes those ballots to local jurisdictions, is being operated by Omega Technologies, headed by a former Republican Party donor, according to the New York Times. </p> <p>The Times also reports that earlier this week two Democratic members of Congress, Henry Waxman of California and Carolyn B Maloney of New York, asked the Government Accountability Office to investigate the FVAP. Among their concerns is that the agency's online ballot-retrieval system is not open to most civilians abroad. </p> <p>Miller, the AOK lawyer, says the FVAP, which moved only two years ago from the Pentagon department that buys soap and toilet paper into the personnel department, \"is basically focused on the military and doesn't care\". A department of defence insider involved in getting out the vote overseas puts it more harshly: \"The senior military leadership will only admit they have a responsibility to help civilians get involved in elections if you force it down their throat. They're only interested in the soldiers.\" </p> <p>The Pentagon denies these charges. As each misstep has occurred, deputy undersecretary of defence Charles Abell has defended the FVAP, saying it is making a heroic effort to reach all citizens overseas through voting workshops and toll-free telephone numbers. Indeed, all observers agree that the FVAP has gone to extraordinary lengths this year to get out the military vote. Still, Democrats suspect that in the case of the online ballot, it's no accident that the agency did not move faster: The measure mainly benefits civilians, many more of whom will support John Kerry than their counterparts in the military. </p> <p>Dzieduszycka-Suinat frets darkly that \"higher up, someone is saying: 'Make sure there are problems.'\" From the perspective of Wright, from the Military Voting Rights Project, political pressure is a given. \"When Clinton was in charge, they tried to suppress the military vote for that very reason,\" he says. \"I would not disagree,\" he says, that politics this year, too, plays a role. Faced with a voting programme that at best is ineffective, and at worst partisan, ordinary citizens have been forced to pick up the slack. Wright's organisation, for instance, blitzed the country's election offices with faxed alerts telling them how to process the write-in ballot. And it is thanks mainly to the efforts of two smart groups of expatriates that tens of thousands of new voters made it through the registration process at all. The FVAP distributed millions of registration postcards, but without help, the complex rules daunted many civilians. </p> <p>The state department, stretched thin by new visa regulations imposed after 9/11, has nowhere near the resources in its consulates to help citizens that the department of defence has deployed for its soldiers abroad, a high-ranking official said. Though it has done its best to walk civilians through the 369-page \"Black Book\" of state-by-state election rules, \"we literally don't have the staff to be able to do this,\" the official said. The upshot: There is a military voting assistance officer for every 30 to 50 soldiers, but the onus is on the civilian to fill out the form alone. </p> <p>Democrats Abroad thus began the campaign season camped at card tables on foreign street corners and screenings of English-language movies, walking voters one by one through the Byzantine process. In late May, Dzieduszycka-Suinat and Mitch Wolfson, head of AOK Germany, looked at each other and said, in the words of Wolfson: \"There has to be a better way.\" In July, they took the federal registration form, simplified it, and lobbed it into cyberspace. Beyond the 140,000 mostly Democrats who registered online, another 170,000 physically registered through Democrats Abroad, according to John McQueen, the group's international campaign chair. Thousands more signed up through another clever website, the Amsterdam-based Tell an American to Vote. </p> <p>What infuriates AOK more than anything else, though, is the vast disparity in money and energy between the military and civilian efforts. Overseas civilians, who turn out at half the rate of the military, arguably need more help, they say. While FVAP spent its $5.5m budget mainly to reach half a million soldiers - a ratio that works out to $11 per vote - the Democratic National Committee spent $50,000 on a website that worked out to less than 75 cents a vote. </p> <p>Republicans eschewed pavement-pounding and bought dozens of ads in the military Stars &amp; Stripes, International Herald Tribune and English-language papers in key countries like Mexico, Canada and Israel, which together host some 1.5 million eligible American voters, says Hills of Republicans Abroad. Registrations are up fourfold over 2000. The Bush campaign is focused on large communities of American retirees overseas and counting on its traditional bases among businesspeople abroad and the military, where, Hills says, \"we're very confident we're going to get a strong majority\". </p> <p>Which way these hordes of new voters go is, in fact, the big overseas question - assuming they get to vote. Democrats and Republicans alike see gold in both the civilian and military camps. What's undisputed is that the Bush administration has galvanised overseas voters as never before. \"The entire world is against Bush, and we reflect that view that America has lost all its credibility abroad,\" says McQueen of Democrats Abroad. \"I was tired of cringing in the supermarket whenever I spoke English to my kids, knowing how much we as Americans were hated,\" says Dzieduszycka-Suinat. Hills, for her part, reports that many Republicans, angered at what they see as unjust attacks, are coming out in equal droves to support the president. On both sides, stories abound of older Americans, and dual citizens who've kept their American passports, emerging like Rip Van Winkle to vote for the first time in 30 or 40 years. </p> <p>In reality, the political affiliation of these voters is unknown. Both sides claim a 60% edge: Democrats, based on a Zogby study, say that Americans with passports tend to vote liberal. Republicans, meanwhile, cite international business and the conservatism of Pentagon civilian employees and soldiers. Yet both estimates are what military people call SWAG - scientific wild-ass guesses - about a woolly and ever-growing overseas population of civil servants, diplomats, employees of global businesses, students, journalists, artists, academics and, yes, soldiers on the battlefield. </p> <p>Since January, when the Pentagon decreed \"100% contact,\" every officer and enlisted man or woman has had a registration application pressed into his or her hands. Soldiers have been exhorted to vote at daily formation and while watching ballgames on Armed Forces TV, and they are reminded that \"It's Your Future - Vote for It\" on the bottom on their paycheques. After the \"horror story\" of 2000, the military is \"extremely vigilant\" this time around, says Captain Christina Maxwell-Borges, a voting assistance officer at the US Army Installation Management Agency in Stuttgart. </p> <p>At US Army Europe headquarters in Heidelberg, voting activists and Americans who've worked for the Army for decades say ordinary soldiers are more motivated than they've ever seen. Even with the massive deployment of voting officers, a non-partisan citizens group like the NAACP, which conducted registration drives on base, was swamped. \"Often we couldn't keep up with the demand,\" says Billee Manigault, an NAACP volunteer. \"There's a definite interest in participating,\" echoes Charles Keene of Democrats Abroad and the NAACP. \"From almost everyone you heard, it was, 'You better believe I'm going to vote.'\" </p> <p>Despite several recent polls showing staunch support for President Bush among high-ranking officers, soldiers on base and Pentagon civilians active in Democratic politics say the mood in the military is far more mixed. The controversial mission in Iraq has brought a sea change in political attitudes on base, these observers report. McQueen, a retired military civil servant, says, \"You're not seeing the kind of pressure to vote Republican you always had in the past.\" </p> <p>The strong pro-Republican culture that emerged in the military in the wake of Vietnam has begun to splinter, many observers say. A report in the Washington Monthly last year described rank-and-file soldiers, who are disproportionately non-white, working-class and female, as increasingly diverging from an ideologically conservative officer corps. \"For a long time here, Democrats were in the closet,\" concurs Trenton Browne, a military security contractor who works on bases from Heidelberg to Kaiserslautern. \"Now in the lower ranks you hear people speaking openly about their dissent.\" </p> <p>Gauging the overseas vote thus becomes a numbers game. Military turnout at home and abroad is high. More than 60% of soldiers overseas voted in 2000, double the record of expatriates, who turned out at a rate of 37%, according to the FVAP (though in both groups, the number of uncounted votes dropped those figures by at least 15%). Many expect even higher overseas military turnout this year. How many of those 500,000 active duty service people will vote for Kerry, or Bush, is the question. </p> <p>A survey of 4,000 service people, released last week by the Military Times, revealed strong loyalty to the president: 72% of those on active duty would vote for him, and 17% would vote for Kerry. In the view of military analyst Peter Feaver of Duke University, the early traction Kerry had with the troops has been lost by his recent hammering of the war as a \"colossal mistake\". Being a decorated Vietnam veteran doesn't improve Kerry's stock with the \"career military\" people polled by the Military Times, either; in fact, two-thirds hold the senator's long-ago anti-war activism against him. </p> <p>The survey, however, concentrated on higher-ranking service people, and is not representative of the rank and file. Along Heidelberg's main street, off-duty soldiers, some fresh from combat in Iraq, divided evenly between rejecting Kerry because \"he doesn't support the troops\" and supporting him \"because a lot of us feel jerked around\". \"People think the military is totally Republican, and that's definitely not true,\" says one strolling soldier, a burly 30-year-old from Florida. \"There's a lot of different views within the ranks.\" Capt Maxwell-Borges, the Stuttgart voting officer, agrees. \"Surprisingly, it's been really mixed,\" she says. \"A lot of people support Kerry because he's a veteran and says he's going to increase military spending, and others are the more traditional pro-Republicans. But I've been on bases in the past three elections and I have to say that this time [political views] seem a lot more varied.\" </p> <p>No one expects the soldier vote to swing to Kerry, but a softening of Bush's overseas military support could be significant. \"Even 100% military turnout overseas only equals 160,000 additional votes,\" points out Brett Rierson, co-founder of the Democratic Hong Kong website. With activists guesstimating that the overseas civilian haul could be as high as 2 million, a strong showing for Kerry among enlisted troops could neutralise the Republican advantage. </p> <p>In any event, it's unlikely anyone will know until well after November 2. Several states, in a scramble to accommodate overseas voters' late ballots, have extended their deadlines. As it now stands, Florida, Washington, Iowa, Colorado and Illinois allow ballots to be received late, in some cases up to 10 days after election day. The justice department, at the prompting of the FVAP, has sued Pennsylvania to extend its deadline by two weeks as well. </p> <p>Nor will Americans find out how effectively the overseas vote has been handled until \"after the horses have left the barn,\" says Joe Smallhoover, legal counsel for Democrats Abroad. Voting reform passed by Congress in 2002 requires states to track overseas ballots, at long last. But more to the point, Smallhoover says: \"We have to do more than reform the FVAP; we have to reform the whole system.\" Wright, the military voting expert, agrees. He advocates placing the whole overseas voting operation in the hands of the new Election Assistance Commission, a far better-funded agency created by the 2002 Help America Vote act that is supposed to help states improve their equipment and procedures. </p> <p>All this, however, lies in the future. In the meantime, Democrats Abroad has formed a \"rapid response\" team to unsnarl problems voters abroad have encountered with their county election officials. Thousands of lawyers on both sides are renting office space in battleground states, ready to pounce on illegalities in stateside balloting and absentee votes. For now, overseas voters groping their empty mailboxes can only download the write-in ballot, send it in - in the faith that local election officials will accept it - and pray. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b>Alix Christie is a reporter and former editor of the foreign service of the San Francisco Chronicle</p> <p><b>\u00b7</b>This article has been provided by Salon through a special arrangement with Guardian Newspapers Limited</p> <p>\u00a9 Salon.com 2004</p>",
  "President Hamid Karzai has won the majority of votes in the Afghan election, securing over 55 % and paving for the way for him to become the country's first popularly elected president. <p>Results posted on the <a href=\"http://www.afg-electionresults.org/\">website</a> of the Joint Electoral Management Board (JESB) - an Afghan and United Nations election commission - showed Mr Karzai way ahead with 55.3 % of the vote while his nearest rival, former education minister Yonous Qanooni secured only 16.2 %</p> <p>With nearly 95 % of votes counted, the interim leader already has more than half the estimated 8.1m votes cast. Under election rules, a candidate must secure 50 % plus one vote to win.</p> <p>A spokesman for Mr Qanooni conceded defeat last night, according to Reuters, but official confirmation of Karzai's victory was frozen pending the outcome of an investigation into alleged polling irregularities. </p> <p>The official result will be announced by the JESB later this week, after it has seen a report into the allegations by an independent. The three-man panel, made up of a Canadian diplomat and election experts from Britain and Sweden, is due to meet most of the 18 candidates later today to discuss claims of fraud.</p> <p>The biggest problem was the use of imperfect indelible ink on voters hands, which potentially allowed for multiple voting.</p> <p>Among the other candidates, Hazara Shia leader Muhammad Mohaqeq received 11.8 % and Uzbek general Abdul Rashid Dostum had 10.3 %. The only female presidential candidate, Masooda Jalal, was running sixth, with 80,922 votes, or 1.1 %. </p> <p>Voting for the historic election began on October 9, with approximately 22,000 polling stations operational in all districts of Afghanistan's 34 provinces. Millions of mostly illiterate Afghans braved threats of violence and harsh weather to cast their first vote. </p> <p>A European envoy to Afghanistan said that while there has been some flaws, they were not serious enough to affect the actual outcome of the vote. \"The vote pretty accurately reflects what the people feel,\" Francesc Vendrell, the EU's special representative, told the BBC.</p> <p>The JESB has reported that 60 % of votes were cast by women and in some provinces there was a 100 % voter turnout. In the largest out-of-country voting operation ever, 2,800 polling stations served refugees in Iran and Pakistan. </p> <p>Mr Karzai has served as interim leader of Afghanistan since the US forces toppled the ruling Taliban regime. With a likely victory, he will be president for the next five years and his most immediate task will be to prepare for parliamentary elections.</p>"

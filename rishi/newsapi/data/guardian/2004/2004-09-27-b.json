  "In these uncertain years at the beginning of the 21st century and Washington's \"war on terror\", there are qualities middle America demands of a first lady, and Laura Bush seldom disappoints. <p>Poise. Grace. Good manners. Good looks. Those are the admiring comments that follow the presidential spouse on the campaign trail. This week brings her to five battleground states in three days. With polls suggesting that John Kerry is slowly eating away at Mr Bush's lead, Republican party officials joke that she is their stealth weapon. </p> <p>For a political wife who approved her husband's run for the presidency on the condition that she never be required to give a speech, Mrs Bush has become a crucial campaign asset. </p> <p>She has raised $10m (\u00a35.5m) at political fundraisers, and a Gallup poll gave her a 74% approval rating - far ahead of the president. </p> <p>Mr Bush's stock campaign ad shows Laura by his side, nodding as he talks about the pain of the September 11 attacks. He frequently begins his speeches by saying that the strongest argument he can make for his re-election is that Laura would return to the White House. </p> <p>The signs distributed at Ms Bush's campaign events read: \"W stands for women.\" When she appears in a modest auditorium in this small town in northern Wisconsin, Mrs Bush does not stoop to the conventional posturing of political wives. </p> <p>There are no fake hugs or air kisses, no pointing into the crowd in phony delight at recognising a friend. She waves, but only a bit, and with her elbow pinned to her waist. Once she begins reading her speech, her hands remain fixed on the podium, and only occasionally does she look at the crowd. </p> <p>When she does, she encounters near-universal delight. This congregation, as is the rule for Mrs Bush's events, is a careful collection of local Republican grandees and their friends. </p> <p>\"Classy, she's got real class,\" says Marlene Peterson, from Marathon, Wisconsin. She presses through the crowd to shake hands with the first lady, and reports that Mrs Bush possesses an unusually firm grip. \"It was like a ray of sunshine.\" </p> <p>Americans are split on what kind of woman they are looking for in the White House. In these parts, the higher-income end of a town where mores are fairly conservative, the partnership of Bill and Hillary Clinton is a thing of horror. Teresa Heinz Kerry, the wife of the Democratic candidate, is also suspect as a bit of a wild woman. </p> <p>Laura Bush, they say, is eminently more suitable. </p> <p>\"I think she is the example of a real lady. The other lady running has a lot of disqualifications,\" says Sharon Kolbe. \"She just doesn't have the decorum that Laura Bush has.\" </p> <p>Life in the White House has not been kind to assertive women. Mrs Clinton got her comeuppance with her spectacular failure to reform healthcare policy. Mrs Bush has been far more circumspect in pursuing her policy interest - literacy - discreetly inviting her favourite writers to the White House. </p> <p>She is far too disciplined to do much more than hint at disagreement with her husband's policies - as she did in an interview in October's GQ, when she intimated she did not share his rigid stance on abortion. </p> <p>\"She doesn't put herself before her husband. She supports her husband fully,\" says Sue Becker, whose daughter, Ann Hunger, adds: \"That's the way it should be, because her husband is the president.\" </p> <p>There are a few brave souls who say they prefer a woman with definite opinions, but they admit to feeling a bit lonely in Wausau. </p> <p>\"I think the first lady should have a story behind herself; but I don't imagine the rest of the country does,\" says Rebecca Pilgrim-Tylinski, a lawyer. </p> <p>After growing up an only child in Midland, Texas, Laura Welch as a young woman was interested in culture and travel. She visited Europe after college and worked as a teacher and a librarian. </p> <p>She was 30 - and a Democrat - when she met and married Mr Bush. The couple were the only ones among their friends still single at the time. </p> <p>Marriage into America's pre-eminent dynasty had its trials. Until he became a Christian, Mr Bush was an alcoholic. In 1986 Mrs Bush is said to have offered him the choice: \"Jim Beam or me.\" Their twin daughters, Jenna and Barbara, 22, have a string of arrests for underage drinking. </p> <p>But none of those faults in the first family - not even Mrs Bush's surreptitious smoking habit - detract from her appeal on the campaign trail. </p> <p>During the past few weeks, opinion polls have detected a slide in Mr Kerry's popularity among women - generally one of the Democratic party's core areas of support. Al Gore took 54% of the women's vote in 2000 against 43% for Mr Bush. </p> <p>But the nervousness of so-called \"security moms\" - women who think that dangerous times demand a tough leader - and the personal appeal of the first lady are bringing female voters around to Mr Bush. </p> <p>So Mrs Bush is out on the road, delivering her 25-minute speech, working the lines, shaking hands and posing for photographs. </p> <p>Like many political speeches, hers rarely deviate from a standard text. </p> <p>She urges people not to be discouraged by the rising US death toll in Iraq. \"These acts are grim reminders of why our war to defeat terrorism and create free societies in the Middle East is so important,\" she says. Later, several members of the audience say this was their favourite line. </p> <p>This is Mrs Bush's most important task - to validate the choices of a man who often seems abrasive and uncaring. Once that is done, she returns her message to the personal, with her trademark line: \"George and I grew up in west Texas, where the sky seems endless and so do the possibilities.\" </p> <p><b>First wives' club</b></p> <p><b> Hillary Clinton</b> </p> <p>Highly political, Mrs Clinton was accused of being too involved in government, particularly over health reforms. Her support of her husband during the Monica Lewinsky scandal may have saved his presidency. She is now a New York senator </p> <p><b> Barbara Bush</b> </p> <p>The matriarch of the Bush clan, she was well-liked and fairly apolitical. She wrote Millie's Book in 1990, a view of White House life from the family dog's perspective </p> <p><b> Nancy Reagan</b> </p> <p>Came second last in a 1993 popularity poll judging 37 US first ladies. She was derided for soliciting $200,000 from donors for a new set of state china and for aligning her schedule to astrological forecasts. Partly redeemed herself with her \"Just say no\" crusade against drug abuse </p> <p><b> Rosalynn Carter</b> </p> <p>Remained in the background during the Carter presidency, though she was passionate about mental health issues. Nicknamed Steel Magnolia by White House staff because of her firm convictions </p> <p><b> Elizabeth \"Betty\" Ford</b> </p> <p>Noted for her candour: spoke of her breast cancer and battle with alcoholism while in the White House. Set up the Betty Ford Clinic, famed for treating high-profile addicts </p> <p> Katy Heslop</p>",
  "Afghan soldiers killed a senior Taliban commander and two fighters during an ambush in a central province where clashes with coalition forces are escalating. <p>Maulvi Abdul Ghafar, a former Guant\u00e1namo detainee, died after Afghan soldiers attacked a house in Uruzgan province on Saturday night, the governor, Jan Muhammad, said. </p> <p>The attack was the latest confrontation between the Taliban and coalition forces linked to the October 9 presidential election. </p> <p>The interior minister, Ali Ahmad Jalali, said Ghafar had been taken to Guant\u00e1-namo Bay in late 2001 and released eight months later. On his return he was made a regional commander. </p> <p>A Taliban spokesman told Reuters two fighters were killed in the attack, but said Ghafar had survived.</p>",
  "\"I am a full-time carer for my mentally handicapped brother, living on the Isle of Anglesey. I voted Labour (Albert Owen) at the last general election but previously I had voted Plaid Cymru - mainly to prevent a Tory getting in. <p>\"Ynys Mon has an interesting political history; solidly Labour as long as Lord Cledwyn of Penrhos stood, it surprisingly fell to the Tories after a vigorous campaign by Keith Best, who turned out to be an active and well thought of MP until his fall from grace. Ieuan Wyn Jones then took the seat for Plaid Cymru and held it until he decided to concentrate on his work as party president and leader in the Welsh assembly.</p> <p>\"His anointed successor was Eilian Williams, another local solicitor who was widely expected to be a shoo-in. It all went pear-shaped for a number of reasons, most importantly over-confidence. </p> <p>\"Ynys Mon will be one of the most interesting seats and one of the most difficult to predict. We had the highest turnout in Wales at the assembly elections, when Ieuan Wyn Jones held his seat. Albert Owen has a thin majority and the war in Iraq is even less popular in Wales than in Britain as a whole. Plaid's candidate is a relative heavyweight, Eurig Wyn, an ex-MEP whose chosen battleground is the lack of affordable housing for local people and, bafflingly, that more people are unemployed than the government stats say. The subtext is - English people are buying our houses and we don't like it.</p> <p>\"The Conservatives missed a trick in not selecting Peter Rogers (who was capable of winning) and at present have no candidate. The key for me is to stop Plaid Cymru winning. The party has taken an ugly turn towards language and cultural fundamentalism under Dafydd Iwan and Alun Ffred.\"</p> <p> <b>More about me</b></p> <p><b>Occupation:</b> I am a full-time carer for my mentally handicapped brother, Bret, and the main carer for my five-year-old daughter, Kezia.

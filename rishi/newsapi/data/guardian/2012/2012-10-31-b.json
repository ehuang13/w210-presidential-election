  "<p>People like me are always looking into the polling data to see what has worked well in the past to correctly forecast election results for the future. The problem is that there are a number of polling methods and ideas that worked well in prior years, yet are in opposition to each other right now. Who will be right?</p> <p>Here's a list of the top five polling match-ups of 2012.</p> <p><strong>1). Traditional polling averages v skewed polling averages</strong></p> <p>I learned a powerful lesson eight years ago: <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/oct/27/swing-state-polling-electoral-college-arithmetic\">polling averages work</a>. The averages have correctly predicted all state presidential contests except for five since 2000. They have accurately projected every Senate winner, save a few, over the last few years. The state polling averages say Obama is going to win.</p> <p>There is a crowd, however, that believes the <a href=\"http://www.nationalreview.com/articles/331192/nate-silver-s-flawed-model-josh-jordan\">polls have too many Democrats</a>. They look at the polling data and see the same, or even higher, percentage of poll respondents in states like Ohio self-identifying as Democrats than the polls had in 2008 \u2013 a year of record high enthusiasm for Democrats.</p> <p>My personal opinion is that the polling averages are likely correct. I witnessed Democrats making the <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/mark-blumenthal/unskewed-polls_b_1924293.html\">\"skewed\" argument in 2004</a> when polls showed \"too many Republicans\". The averages won, and George W Bush served another term. We'll see, though, if I'll be eating my words.</p> <p><strong>2). State v national polling</strong></p> <p>I've spoken <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/oct/11/mitt-romney-leads-national-polls\">about this one ad nauseum</a>. The national polls indicate that Mitt Romney and Barack Obama are in a dead heat. The state polls have Obama ahead in the key swing states of Ohio and Wisconsin and, therefore, have him ahead in the electoral college. You might say that Romney may run up the score in states where there are fewer state polls, but as <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2012/10/31/whats_behind_the_state-national_poll_divergence_115979.html\">Sean Trende pointed out</a>, the math on that equation doesn't work.</p> <p>In the past, when state and national polling split, as in 1996 and 2000, it was state polling that won the battle. This year, however, the national polls tend to be conducted by pollsters with longer track records. My guess is that the state polling is going to be right again, although I don't feel particularly confident on this one.</p> <p><strong>3). Likely v registered voters</strong></p> <p>President Obama would probably <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2012/10/31/whats_behind_the_state-national_poll_divergence_115979.html\">have this election sewn up</a> if <em>all registered voters</em> cast a ballot. The issue is that not all registered voters will actually do so. The task pollsters face is to try and narrow their polling samples to only those who will vote. They utilize different methods in hopes of getting as close to modeling the actual electorate as possible.</p> <p>The result has been mixed. Steve Singiser has compared <a href=\"http://www.dailykos.com/story/2012/10/14/1143653/-On-elections-and-likely-voters\">likely v registered voters</a> in state polls and found likely voter polls no more accurate. Nationally, likely voter samples were no better than registered voter ones at predicting the outcome in 2000. They did better in 2004, and again, in the 2010 midterms.</p> <p>It could be that the disparity we're seeing in state and national polling may simply be that the likely voter screens are, for whatever reason, too tight nationally, while just right in the state surveys. Either way, I'll lean towards the likely voter screens being closer to the truth \u2013 at least, in the state data.</p> <p><strong>4). Live v automated polls</strong></p> <p>I've heard <a href=\"http://www.dailykos.com/story/2012/10/14/1143653/-On-elections-and-likely-voters\">some version of this argument</a> for years: you can't trust automated polling (or \"robo-polls\") because they are cheap and anyone \u2013 including a dog \u2013 can answer them. Live interviewer polls, on the other hand, are done by trained professionals \u2013 plus the campaigns use them, so they must be correct.</p> <p>I've been skeptical of these hypotheses for as long as I can remember. I look at the track record and see that both are <em>equally</em>accurate, despite automated polls having lower response rates (and the dog issue). Perhaps, it's because people are more honest with a machine than a person, or the lower response rate acts as a likely voter screen.</p> <p>In recent years, a <a href=\"http://www.tnr.com/blog/electionate/107446/obama-pulling-ahead-in-live-interview-surveys\">new wrinkle</a> has emerged: cellphones. Automated polls can't call cells. The cellphone population tends to be overwhelmingly Democratic compared to the home telephone population. Some automated pollsters like Rasmussen and SurveyUSA try to supplement their home telephone samples with online or other electronic devices, but I'm not sure this works too well.</p> <p>Automated polls overall (save Public Policy Polling and SurveyUSA) have leaned toward Romney compared to live-interview polls. If they're wrong, it will just confirm the conventional wisdom. If they're right, we'll all need to have a conversation.</p> <p><strong>5). Public Policy Polling v Rasmussen</strong></p> <p>Democrats and Republicans each have a polling agency they cling to.</p> <p>Democrats have Public Policy Polling (PPP) \u2013 an openly Democratic-affiliated pollster. PPP did well in both <a href=\"public policy polling 2008 accurate\">2008 and 2010</a> and has shown a knack for accurately surveying difficult local contests. They have, however, been accused of bias because of the <a href=\"http://www.weeklystandard.com/blogs/morning-jay-did-obama-really-win-summer_652093.html\">groups who sponsor</a> some of their polls, as well <a href=\"http://pjmedia.com/tatler/2012/10/11/public-policy-polling-caught-push-polling-to-make-conservative-media-look-racist/\">as the questions</a> contained within some of their surveys.</p> <p>Republicans have Rasmussen Reports: officially, it's nonpartisan, but its <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/sep/25/gallup-rasmussen-polling-outliers-lean-republican\">owner goes on Republican cruises</a> (among other signs he's not exactly non-partisan). After a disastrous 2000, Rasmussen came back and was among the <a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/11/04/rasmussen-polls-were-biased-and-inaccurate-quinnipiac-surveyusa-performed-strongly/\">most accurate pollsters</a> in 2004 and 2006. Their 2008 data leaned a little to the right, and in 2010 midterm polls were far too Republican.</p> <p>This year, PPP and Rasmussen <a href=\"http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/\">have vastly different state data</a>. PPP has Obama ahead in Colorado, Florida, New Hampshire, Ohio and Virginia. Rasmussen has Romney leading in all those states. They can't both be right. </p> <p>A PPP victory would demonstrate that you can have an openly partisan affiliation and still be trusted to deliver accurate results. It might also signal that automated surveys can be just as good as live interview ones, but they just need to have good weighting and call backs. A Rasmussen win would send a lot of insider DC types into a tailspin, wondering what the heck happened.</p> <p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p> <p>Pundits and pollsters have been sticking their necks out. Some are going to be right and some wrong. All I know is there's a lot on the line come election day \u2013 and not just for the political candidates.</p>",
  "<p>A college gymnasium in late October; lines of eager voters stretched around the building; bunting and American flags inside the hall; sauna-like conditions under the hot television lights and a political candidate exhorting his most passionate supporters to vote on election day.</p> <p>This all-too-familiar autumnal scene was in Kenosha, Wisconsin, 11 days before American voters to go to the polls to choose their next president. The candidate was vice-president Joe Biden and it was a rite of passage that happens every four years in swing states across America. Biden's campaign event is the traditional and often most public element of this nation's seemingly unending quadrennial presidential races.</p> <p>But there is of course another story. It's one that goes on behind the scenes: the nuts and bolts of getting supporters the polls and persuading the small number of undecided voters to pick your candidate. Millions of voters are being pushed to cast their ballots early, the get out the vote (GOTV) operations of both campaigns has taken on a heightened sense of importance.</p> <p>In few places is that GOTV effort more pressing than Wisconsin \u2013 a state where Barack Obama trounced John McCain by 14 points in 2008, but in the previous two elections was won by John Kerry and Al Gore by the narrowest of margins. It's also a state that has been witness to a GOP resurgence, with five major elections in the state since 2010 \u2013 most of them won by Republicans.</p> <p>This year the polls have given Obama a narrow but persistent lead, but with a Wisconsin favorite son on the ballot \u2013 Paul Ryan \u2013 and a popular Republican governor, the Obama campaign is taking no chances. The president will hold an event in Green Bay on Thursday, one of his first campaign stops since hurricane Sandy stalled electioneering. Bill Clinton campaigned here for him on Wednesday, and Biden arrives on Friday. With less than a week until election day, therace for Wisconsin's 10 electoral votes has taken on unexpected urgency.</p> <p>So the Guardian dropped in on campaign offices and local rallies for both Obama and Mitt Romney in and around the south-eastern part of the state to try and get a sense of what is happening on the ground in Wisconsin and how it might affect the outcome on 6 November.</p> <h2>Obama's intimidating ground game</h2> <p>The ground game is the great unknown of the 2012 election \u2013 in trying to judge it properly one is forced invariably to rely on the confident predictions and massaged data of campaign staffers as well as what is visible, anecdotally, to the naked eye.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398656411\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2012/10/19/1350666913755/Barack-Obama-006.jpg\" alt=\"Barack Obama\" width=\"220\" height=\"132\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">President Barack Obama shakes hands with supporters at George Mason University, in Fairfax, Virginia. Photograph: Carolyn Kaster/AP</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Carolyn Kaster/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>However, what one can say with some certainty is that if Obama's ground game looks anything like it did in 2008, the president should be in pretty good shape. That year he put together what was arguably the best campaign infrastructure ever built for a presidential race \u2013 out-organizing and out-mobilizing his Democratic primary opponent Hilary Clinton and later the hapless John McCain in the general election.</p> <p>In an oft-cited campaign post-mortem, Seth Masket, a political scientist at the University of Denver, concluded that Obama's huge number of campaign offices, while not decisive, almost certainly expanded Obama's popular and electoral vote advantage and may have been single-handedly responsible for him winning three states on election day: Florida, North Carolina and Indiana.</p> <p>For a campaign focused on getting as many infrequent voters to the polls as possible \u2013 particularly young people, minorities and occasional voters \u2013 such efforts have the potential be as decisive in 2012 as they were in 2008.</p> <p>And from all appearances, while the GOP ground game has certainly improved since 2008, the infrastructure developed by Obama might be even better than it was four years ago \u2013 driven not only by years of preparation, but also a data-driven approach that has revolutionized how campaigns identify voters and craft micro-target messaging to get them to the polls.</p> <p>While it is virtually impossible to glean with any certainty the strength of the Obama ground game simply by walking into campaign offices, a few things did stand out in Wisconsin \u2013 and they are consistent with what others are reporting around the country. What is most obviously striking is the Obama effort's sheer ubiquity. The campaign is everywhere, with five offices in Milwaukee alone and seven in the surrounding country and suburbs. In all, the Obama campaign has 69 offices across the state.</p> <p>The Romney campaign, by comparison, lists 24 offices on their website. As was the case in 2008 this advantage is being replicated in swing states across the country. In Ohio, Obama has 131 outposts, compared to 40 from Romney; in Florida the edge is 106 to 47.</p> <p>Obama's outposts in and around Milwaukee were generally located on prominent street corners with large storefronts and visible signage. While I saw few volunteers during my visits (they were supposedly out canvassing) every office had numerous paid staff. The Romney effort on the other hand appears to depend more heavily on volunteer co-ordinators and local state party operatives.</p> <p>Moreover, while the Obama offices are focused on supporting all state candidates, it was a struggle to find the campaign paraphernalia of other Wisconsin Democrats under the onslaught of Obama-themed posters and placards. In one office located in a predominately Hispanic section of the city \u2013 with Latinos for Obama signs in the windows \u2013 even the bathroom was festooned with inspirational statements from the president.</p> <p>There was a remarkable similarity to look and feel of the Obama offices. It was like I had stumbled upon the McDonald's of campaign ground games. For example, the same large white paper scripts for how to talk to voters were pasted to the walls in several of the offices. And in keeping with the Obama campaign's approach of using peer pressure to get out the vote, one of the more revelatory lines in the script was a sentence that read: \"We are talking to a lot of people in [community name] and it looks like lots of your neighbors will be voting in this election.\"</p> <p>The other great similarity at the Obama offices was the complete fear of staff to actually speak with a reporter. When I told staffers that I was doing a story for the Guardian about the Obama ground game in Wisconsin I was met with often terror-stricken looks and a flat refusal to talk to me even on background. </p> <p>\"I don't want to get fired,\" said more than one staffer \u2013 a tribute, I suppose, to the Obama campaign's discipline. In one office, a staffer, apparently concerned that I was a Republican operative, demanded that I leave.</p> <h2>Romney's Wisconsin advantage</h2> <p>Things were a bit different on the Romney side of things (at the very least volunteers and staffers were far more willing to talk to me). While most observers credit the Romney campaign with a stronger ground effort than that of 2008 loser John McCain you'd be hard-pressed to find anyone who thinks it's on a par with Obama's. In fact, Romney doesn't really have a ground game. </p> <p>As Molly Ball reported in the Atlantic last week, he's largely outsourced GOTV responsibilities to the Republican national committee and in particular state GOP efforts \u2013 a fact that was clearly evident in Wisconsin.</p> <p>Still this might be Romney's biggest asset here.</p> <p>The reason lies in the badger state's constant stream of elections since 2010. That year Republicans won big, with Tea Party darling Ron Johnson taking the Senate seat from incumbent Russ Feingold and Scott Walker winning the governor's race.</p> <p>Walker quickly unveiled a plan to strip collective bargaining rights from Wisconsin public sector unions, a move that led to large protests at the state capitol in Madison and polarized an electorate that was already very narrowly divided. Walker's union ploy led to a host of recall elections by embittered Democrats including most controversially a recall race in June, which the well-financed Walker won handily.</p> <p>These one-after-the-other races left a sizable infrastructure in place as well as a battle-ready base of Republicans. It's an infrastructure that has quickly mobilized in support of Romney.</p> <p>According to Ben Sparks, Wisconsin communications director for the Romney-Ryan campaign the cumulative effect of winning the recall and then the selection of local congressman Paul Ryan as Romney's running mate has energized the state's Republican voters. </p> <p>\"Enthusiasm has been growing since 2010,\" said Sparks. \"Republicans have been bolstered from victory to victory and Democrats are demoralized. That excitement will be key to Romney's winning on election day.\"</p> <p>That enthusiasm was evident among local Republicans; and as was the sense of doom and gloom over the possibility of an Obama re-election. When I spoke with Obama supporters they talked about their desire to back the president and as one put it, \"keep things going\" with Obama. Women voters in particular stressed the president's views on reproductive health and pay equity \u2013 a key feature of his campaign's closing message.</p> <p>For Republicans, however, they were far more likely to see this campaign in existential terms. As Senator Johnson said in an appearance in a campaign office in a leafy suburb along the north shore of Milwaukee: \"This election is about saving America.\" A volunteer in the campaign's Waukesha office named Keith Best said an Obama win would be a \"tipping point\" moving the country toward \"socialism and the end of the free market\" in America.</p> <p>Still, while Romney supporters were clearly highly motivated, it appeared \u2013 at least anecdotally \u2013 that their campaign infrastructure couldn't quite measure up to that of Obama's.</p> <p>Take the Waukesha office for example. This is prime GOP territory: an area that is overwhelmingly Republican. In the Walker recall, the incumbent won nearly 73% in the vote. In 2008, it was John McCain's second best performing county in the state giving him 62% of the vote. Yet the office I visited was, as far as I could tell, the only one in the county. In neighboring Washington and Ozaukee counties, which make the so-called W-O-W swath of suburban communities around Milwaukee County, there was a mere handful of offices as well.</p> <p>In addition, while there were some volunteers manning the phones and others preparing to knock on doors, most of the foot traffic into the offices were people looking for yard signs or tickets to an upcoming Romney appearance in the state (it would have been Romney's first trip to the state since August, but its since been cancelled).</p> <p>Few of the volunteers had much to say about pushing their people to vote early. This Republican campaign here had the feel of a traditional GOTV operation with traditional campaign techniques. While that might have worked in the recall election, clearly the GOP was up against a much more formidable opponent in President Obama who brings to the table a far more sophisticated set of GOTV techniques.</p> <p>One Republican operative I spoke with said that the 2004 Bush campaign here featured probably as good a ground game as the GOP has ever run in Wisconsin \u2013 and he still lost by 11,000 votes. So while Romney will have a solid ground game behind him it doesn't mean that will be enough to overcome Obama's advantage or the state's Democratic lean in presidential elections.</p> <h2>The recall mirage</h2> <p>Nonetheless, Republicans point to the energy generated around the recall election as a sign that this race will be different \u2013 but it's a tough argument to sustain.</p> <p>Exit polls from the June election indicated that nearly one in five Walker supporters intended to vote for President Obama and that he led in head-to-head match-up against Romney by seven points.</p> <p>While some critics have pointed to inconsistencies in these results, Craig Gilbert, who covers state politics for the Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel, cautioned against reading too much into the Walker victory in June. </p> <p>\"Wisconsin,\" he said, \"has been on a knife's edge for a long time even though there have been pretty massive swings from surging to Obama in 2008 to then swinging hard for Walker in 2010. I'd be pretty cautious about seeing a shift \u2013 or too much of a shift because of Walker victory. More likely what we're seeing it a return to Wisconsin being the sort of swing state it was in the past with a slight advantage for Obama.\"</p> <p>Indeed, beyond the Walker-Obama supporters, nearly 500,000 Wisconsinites who voted in 2008 sat out the recall. Both sides assume many of those non-voters lean toward Obama, in particular the many liberal-leaning college students who didn't vote in the Walker recall.</p> <p>While it will be crucial for Obama to get these voters to the polls he, like Romney, will also have to do some persuasion as well. At one point, Democrats could often rely on strong turnout from their strongholds around Milwaukee and Madison to win statewide, but Wisconsin as a swing state produces one sizable wrinkle \u2013 it's got a lot of swingy voters.</p> <p>Aside from the Obama-Walker voters, Wisconsin has, according to Nate Cohn, who writes for the New Republic, one of the largest percentages of Bush-Obama voters in the country. This is particularly true around the Green Bay area, which is in north-eastern Wisconsin. In fact, voters who strongly supported George W Bush in 2004 (John Kerry won one country in north-east Wisconsin that year) went overwhelmingly for Obama in 2008. Not coincidentally, it is where the president will be traveling on Tuesday for a last opportunity to persuade the area's still persuadable voters.</p> <p>What will make things a bit easier for Obama is that Wisconsin's economy is not performing as badly as the rest of the country and unemployment is below the national average. Moreover, after Walker and his allies spend the first six months of the year telling voters how great things are in the state it's likely provided an unintentional boon to the Obama effort. And those scripts I mentioned earlier that were in each of the Obama offices \u2013 they brag about the 31 consecutive months of job growth, 5.2m private sector jobs and bemoan the economic calamity that Obama inherited upon taking office.</p> <p>According to one Democrat familiar with focus group research conducted in the wake of the recall election one of the advantages that Walker enjoyed in the recall was that voters were frustrated with Democrats for so stridently opposing Walker's agenda. Many Wisconsin voters feel the same about opposition to Obama and believe that even though they aren't wowed by his performance he deserves a chance to see his agenda through.</p> <p>In the end, that might be the deciding factor for Obama in the state. While there is disappointment with the president, anti-Obama attitudes are not quite as strong as they need to be for Romney to win. The most recent Marist poll in Wisconsin showed 45% of voters think the country is headed in the right direction versus 51% who do not \u2013 a nine-point swing from Marist's previous poll in September. </p> <p>At the same time, Obama approval ratings outweigh his negatives and Obama's polling averages consistently are in the 49-51% range. In fact, Romney hasn't led here since two polls taken in mid-August. A new poll out on Wednesday from Marquette Law School shows Obama leading by eight in the state, a seven-point increase from the school's previous poll. While this latest number is likely a bit high it is reflective of other polling that shows Obama leading in the state.</p> <p>When you combine a historical Democratic lean in presidential election, a steadily improving economy and an Obama ground game that is more than matching the GOP's enthusiasm from the Walker recall it's increasingly hard to imagine that Wisconsin will be turning red next Tuesday.</p>",
  "<p>The images of a paralysed New York City at the mercy of Hurricane Sandy's wall of water have forced climate change on to the political agenda in the final week of the 2012 presidential election campaign. Even before Sandy made landfall political commentators were debating whether the storm would be better for Mitt Romney or Barack Obama. In any event it has brought forth statements from prominent Democrats and elected officials on climate change and spurred public debate about the neglected topic.</p> <p>Campaigners said the devastating storm could turn out to be the October Surprise of the elections, exposing Republicans' failure to engage with an issue that is no longer a distant threat, but a present day danger.</p> <p>Bill Clinton, campaigning for Barack Obama in Minnesota, attacked Romney for using climate change as a laugh line in his convention speech. \"He ridiculed the president for his efforts to fight global warming in economically beneficial ways. He said, 'Oh, you're going to turn back the seas,'\" Clinton told a rally. \"In my part of America, we would like it if someone could've done that yesterday.\"</p> <p>He went on to argue the local leaders from both parties were already ahead of Romney and Republicans in Congress in engaging with the issue. Michael Bloomberg, a Republican, and Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat, have both cited Sandy as evidence of climate change.</p> <p>\"All up and down the east coast, there are mayors, many of them Republicans, who are being told, 'You've got to move these houses back away from the ocean. You've got to lift them up. Climate change is going to raise the water levels on a permanent basis. If you want your town insured, you have to do this,'\" Clinton said.</p> <p>Al Gore in a statement on his website sounded a similar theme, calling for Sandy to serve as a brutal wakeup call to the realities of climate change, much as floods in Nashville hit home for him in 2010.</p> <p>\"For many, Hurricane Sandy may prove to be a similar event: a time when the climate crisis \u2013 which is often sequestered to the far reaches of our everyday awareness became a reality,\" Gore wrote.</p> <p>\"Hurricane Sandy is a disturbing sign of things to come. We must heed this warning and act quickly to solve the climate crisis. Dirty energy makes dirty weather.\"</p> <p>The Republican contender had tried to cast Obama's promise for action on global warming as a sign of grandiosity.</p> <p>Romney and Obama have avoided mentioning climate change on the campaign trail and the topic did not get a single mention in the televised presidential debates \u2013 for the first time since 1988.The absence has frustrated campaigners who say this year's heat waves, drought, wildfires \u2013 and now Sandy \u2013 provide ample evidence of climate change and of the urgency for action.</p> <p>\"Climate change used to be a science of projection. Now it is a science of attribution,\" said Angela Anderson, climate and energy director for the Union of Concerned Scientists. She also argued the public was ahead of political leaders in engaging with the topic.</p> <p>\"People are beginning to connect extreme weather events to climate change more and more at the same moment that there is this deafening silence, so that is incredibly disappointing.\"</p> <p>Multiple studies have linked the warming of the atmosphere and the oceans to stronger Atlantic storms \u2013 though scientists balk at attributing a single severe storm such as Sandy to climate change.</p> <p>\"The terrifying truth is that America faces a future full of Frankenstorms,\" said Shaye Wolf, the climate science director for the Centre for Biological Diversity. \"Climate change raises sea levels and super-sizes storms. The threat of killer winds and crushing storm surges will grow by the year unless we get serious about tackling greenhouse gas pollution.\"</p> <p>Warmer ocean temperatures add more energy to storms. Warmer air holds more moisture, which means more rainfall. Sandy dumped more than 11 inches of rain in some parts of New Jersey, according to Nasa.</p> <p>In addition, there is growing evidence that Americans are increasingly vulnerable to such severe events.</p> <p>Sea-level rise, due to climate change, makes for more extreme storm surges. And sea-level rise in the north-eastern US is occurring three or four times faster than the global average, putting more Americans in harm's way. About 100 million Americans live in coastal areas within 3ft of mean sea level in cities such as Boston and Miami as well as New York.</p> <p>As Mike Tidwell, the founder of Chesapeake Climate Action, wrote this week: \"We are all from New Orleans now. Climate change \u2013 through the measurable rise of sea levels and a documented increase in the intensity of Atlantic storms \u2013 has made 100 million Americans virtually as vulnerable to catastrophe as the victims of Hurricane Katrina were seven years ago.\"</p>",
  "<p>A huge clean-up continued across America's north-east in the wake of a direct hit by superstorm Sandy that left New York City paralysed and that devastated coastal regions of New Jersey and other states.</p> <p>The historic storm killed at least 55 people, left more than 8 million people without power and had brought campaigning in America's turbulent presidential election to a temporary halt.</p> <p>Effects from the direct hit on Monday night were still being felt on Wednesday morning as vehicles from the National Guard headed into the New Jersey city of Hoboken \u2013 just across the Hudson river from New York \u2013 to help evacuate up to 20,000 people still thought to be trapped by flood waters. The local sewage authority estimated that 500m gallons of water contaminated with sewage and possibly dangerous live power lines remained in the stricken city. Uniformed soldiers in trucks brought in pumps, food and medical supplies and took out people still stuck in their homes.</p> <p>Hoboken officials warned residents not to go outside but instead await help. Hoboken's Facebook page turned into a forum for pleas for aid. One woman, Keri O'Connor Robinson, wrote: \"Please rescue my sister. She is seven months pregnant and she lives at 517 Jackson Street, on the second floor. We have not heard from her since Monday.\"</p> <p>Sandy is now thought to have caused tens of billions of dollars of damage with a unique combination of high winds, a massive flood surge and even a blizzard in mountainous areas. Its cone of impact stretched from North Carolina to Canada and it has been described by many as the worst ever to hit the region.</p> <p>But it was New Jersey that has suffered the worst of the storm, and on Wednesday President Barack Obama was visiting the state in the company of its Republican governor Chris Christie. Sandy had pummelled its way through the state's famous New Jersey shore, swamping seaside towns, ripping away boardwalks, destroying beaches and flooding the major casino resort of Atlantic City. \"The Jersey Shore we knew as kids is gone. We will rebuild it, but it will never be the same,\" Christie told one television interviewer.</p> <p>In New York, city officials announced that a limited commuter rail system will be up and running out of New York by Wednesday afternoon. In another sign of the gradual return to normality, they also said a small amount of subway activity in the city will also return on Thursday morning as three of the city's seven subway tunnels have now been cleared of water. However, there was no specific word on when the service will fully return to normal.</p> <p>At the South Ferry stop at the very tip of southern Manhattan, flood waters remained almost up to the station's ceiling. After almost 20,000 cancelled flights two New York area airports \u2013 Newark and JFK \u2013 reopened, but LaGuardia remained closed.</p> <p>In many ways, it was a surreal tale of two cities in New York. In upper Manhattan and many parts of the outer boroughs, life was steadily returning to normal. Businesses, shops and restaurants were open and thronged with customers and Broadway shows re-opened around Times Square. On bridges linking Brooklyn and Manhattan, traffic was packed into huge jams as people sought to come to work by car rather than the usual public transport.</p> <p>However, elsewhere the picture was very different. In lower Manhattan, where there is no power, vehicles negotiated streets without traffic lights and many residents left to stay with friends in other parts of the city. Usually packed and busy neighbourhoods like fashionable Soho and the East Village were relatively quiet and streets were lined with shuttered businesses.</p> <p>That was true, too, of many areas of Long Island, where hundreds of thousands of people remained without power. If they could, they headed off to other areas that had power or had moved out ahead of the storm. Carol Goleb, of Oceanside, Long Island, took shelter with her parents in Queens, New York.</p> <p>Goleb, said she was not going to take a chance that Sandy would be like last year's hurricane Irene, which largely spared the city. Unfortunately, many of her neighbours did not make the same decision. Ninety percent of Long Island residents are thought to be without power. \"A lot of them thought it was going to be another Irene,\" Goleb said.</p> <p>But as many areas struggled it was, however, a different picture on Wall Street. The New York stock exchange reopened on Wednesday morning after two days of having trading suspended. Mayor Michael Bloomberg rang the opening bell at 9.30am, right on schedule, as stock traders cheered from trading floor below. The market even rose as trading began adding 74 points to 13,182 shortly after opening. \"We've got to keep rebuilding,\" Bloomberg told reporters as he walked through the exchange.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the neighbourhood of Breezy Point in Queens was struggling with the aftermath of a devastating fire that swept through at least 111 homes as Sandy's flood waters rose through the streets. Elsewhere, in areas like Staten Island and Red Hook, which have extensive waterfronts, residents struggled to clear debris, stranded boats dumped on land and pools of standing water. In Coney Island, several feet of sand had been dumped by floodwaters several blocks inland.</p> <p>Across the stricken region the Red Cross was organising teams of volunteers. The organisation asked for people aged over 16 and fit enough to carry at least 40lbs to step forward to work twelve-hour shifts helping people in need and cleaning up the mess. It also appealed for donations: an appeal that was repeated by both Obama and his Republican challenger Mitt Romney.</p> <p>For almost two days Sandy has derailed normal campaigning for next week's presidential election. But on Wednesday there were signs of things getting back to the normal cut and thrust of the battle for the White House. Through the storm top Obama surrogates, like former president Bill Clinton and vice president Joe Biden, have been campaigning on Obama's behalf seeking to fend off Romney's challenge.</p> <p>The Romney campaign, after cancelling numerous events as the storm hit, was back to full throttle. On Wednesday, Romney was attending three full blown campaign events in the key swing state of Florida. Florida was largely spared any real impact from Sandy so many strategists believe Romney can safely campaign there without being seen as being insensitive to the storm's victims.</p>",
  "<p>It's the afternoon shift change at the Harrison Resources mine, and about 30 miners are heading home after 10 hours shovelling for coal on an exposed hilltop in eastern Ohio. The men are dressed in an unofficial uniform of jeans, T-shirt and hard hat, and they speak in unison, too, when asked about the presidential election, now less than a week away.</p> <p>\"Obama's done more damage in the last three years than anyone in the last 50,\" said Brad Knight. \"He and his advisers are a bunch of tree-huggers, east coast and west coast\".</p> <p>\"The way Obama's handling the coal business,\" said Lanny Stephen, \"it looks like he's trying to fade it out.\" A third miner, Trent Sigman, chimed in: \"They ought to raise the standards in China before they come after us \u2013 their standards are much less strict than ours\".</p> <p>Anger is running high in the coal country of Ohio. With the final countdown to election day under way, front yards in Cadiz, the nearest small town to the mine, are stacked with placards promoting the Romney-Ryan ticket alongside signs saying: \"Stop the war on coal \u2013 fire Obama\".</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398636114\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/31/1351699877256/Stop-the-war-on-coal-sign-004.jpg\" alt=\"'Stop the war on coal' sign, Ohio\" width=\"220\" height=\"132\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">'Stop the war on coal' sign, Ohio. Photograph: Ed Pilkington for the Guardian</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ed Pilkington/Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Republicans and their Super Pac supporters have been aggressively stoking emotions within Cadiz and neighbouring mining communities, bombarding the area with TV and radio adverts on the theme of the \"war on coal\". The intention is clear: in an election as razor-close as it looks to be in Ohio, a swing towards Mitt Romney in coal country could be enough to tip the entire state \u2013 and with it the US presidency \u2013 in his favour.</p> <p>That's why Paul Ryan, Romney's running mate, was in the coal town of Zanesville on Saturday telling a rally that \"here in this part of Ohio, we have so much energy, let's use our coal.\"</p> <p>That's also why outside lobbying groups with links to energy interests have been hammering the area with adverts accusing Obama of destroying jobs. <a href=\"http://americansforprosperity.org/failingagenda/files/2012/10/AFP-OhioCoalRadio-mix1.mp3\">One such ad</a>, put out by Americans For Prosperity, a group partly funded by the energy billionaire Koch brothers, says that Obama is trying to do away with coal that has provided \"opportunities for our children and our communities\".</p> <p>Another, put out by the American Energy Alliance, <a href=\"http://www.americanenergyalliance.org/\">accuses the Obama administration of causing coal mines to close</a> all across the country through the imposition of environmental regulations. \"The president and his Washington cronies have declared war on affordable energy and American jobs,\" the soundtrack says.</p> <p>A similar strategy is being pursued throughout the Appalachian coal areas. <a href=\"http://www.mittromney.com/forms/crushed-your-policies\">A new advert</a> implying that Obama was responsible for the imminent closure or conversion of 22 coal facilities in Pennsylvania was just launched on the TV screens of that state's coal communities this week.</p> <p>In 2008, Obama won seven out of the 18 Ohio counties that produce coal \u2013 an achievement that surpassed the record of any of his Democratic predecessors. In Harrison county, which covers Cadiz and the Resources mine, Obama polled 47% four years ago to John McCain's 50%, a near-parity that reflected a strong Democratic tradition in the locality strengthened by a vibrant trade union membership among coal miners and steel workers.</p> <p>Romney's challenge is to beat back Obama's showing in the region on 6 November. Hence the focus of the Republican campaign on the new Environmental Protection Agency regulations <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/blog/2010/apr/01/obama-administration-mining?INTCMP=SRCH\">introduced in 2010 by the<br>Obama administration</a>.</p> <p>The regulations are designed to reduce pollution and global warming emissions from coal-fired power plants, and to limit the damage to rivers and scenery caused by mountaintop mining, or surface mining as locals prefer to call it: the crude technique of blasting out hundreds of feet of hillside to reach seams of coal. The method is heavily used in the Appalachian coal areas that cross Ohio, Pennsylvania and West Virginia.</p> <p>Some of the new regulations have already been put on hold as a result of legal challenges. Local coal mines and coal-burning power plants are also facing fierce competition from natural gas production that is booming in Appalachia as a result of the advent of hydraulic fracturing, or fracking.</p> <p>But the Romney campaign has glossed over those inconvenient truths, blaming recent closures of coal-fired stations entirely on Obama's fetish for regulation. There are signs that the strategy might be working.</p> <p>For the first time since 1972 the <a href=\"http://www.umwa.org/?q=compac\">United Mine Workers of America has decided not to endorse a presidential candidate this year</a>, having backed Obama in 2008. In Cadiz, the mantra of the \"war on coal\" appears also to be enjoying some purchase.</p> <p>Ed Sobolawski, a retired steel worker, has voted as a Democrat all his adult life. This year though, for the first time, he is having doubts.</p> <p>\"To tell you the truth, I haven't decided what I'm going to vote. I keep switching back and forth,\" he said.</p> <p>We meet in a barn on the outskirts of Cadiz where Sobolawski is having an annual \"fry\" with friends from the neighbourhood. A group of about 10 men \u2013 mainly retired coal and steel workers \u2013 have assembled to eat side bacon, drink moonshine that one of them procured on the black market in Kentucky, chew on chewing tobacco and talk about the much-vaunted war on coal.</p> <p>\"I feel bad for the coal miners. So many are losing their jobs. Kids round here don't stick around \u2013 they all leave the area to find work,\" he said.</p> <p>Among the lunch gatherers is Bill Spiker, who used to be chief executive of a local coal mine. He says he is sympathetic to the idea that mining has to be regulated \u2013 he remembers in his youth how the open strip mines around here tore up huge swathes of countryside without any attempt to reclaim it; and he approves of the federal government's insistence on returning spent mines to something approximating a natural condition.</p> <p>But he argues that Obama has taken the regulations too far. \"He's regulated the coal industry just about out of existence. He doesn't like the coal industry so he's regulating it to death,\" Spiker said.</p> <p>There's a common sentiment that connects the mine workers of the Resources mine and the retired friends gathered at their annual fry: they all feel got at. Their way of life is under siege, as they see it, from tree-hugging environmentalists and coastal do-gooders, with Obama cast in the role of regulator-in-chief.</p> <p>That sense of beleaguerment is being put to powerful political use by Mitt Romney, backed by his supporters in the coal industry. Lost in the argument is the fact that the number of workers employed in the coal mining industry, contrary to the message being delivered locally, has actually gone up since 2008, from 77,000 to 82,000.</p> <p>Lost, too, is Obama's attempt to promote new technologies behind clean coal, and Romney's own record of flip-flopping on the issue. As governor of Massachusetts he insisted on a coal-burning power station abiding by strict emissions rules, saying: \"\"I will not create jobs or hold jobs that kill people, and that plant kills people.\"</p> <p>Lost, above, all is any talk about climate change and the long-term need to reduce emissions caused by non-clean coal. Back at the coal mine, Trent Sigman said emphatically that he doesn't believe in global warming: \"It's just something that occurs naturally over so many years, so they are using that for political reasons.\"</p> <p>The group of miners around him nodded in agreement.</p>",
  "<p>Afghanistan has fixed the date for its next presidential election, when voters will chose their first new leader in more than a decade, but even with 18 months to prepare, the government may struggle to tackle worries about security and fraud.</p> <p>The Independent Election Commission (IEC) said the vote would be held on 5 April 2014 after four months of campaigning. Elections to provincial councils will be held at the same time.</p> <p>Polls in 2009 and 2010 were marred by serious corruption, falling turnout and a rise in security problems as the Taliban targeted election booths, voters, poll workers and candidates.</p> <p>Afghanistan has been working on legislation and an electronic voter registration system to try to avoid fraud, and activists said a firm date and election timetable would make it easier to measure progress.</p> <p>\"The announcement of the calendar is a positive development and we certainly welcome this,\" said Ahmad Nader Nadery, chairman of the Free and Fair Election Foundation of Afghanistan, and a former commissioner on the country's Independent Human Rights Commission.</p> <p>\"There are other issues that are pressing now we have the date in front of us \u2026 for the IEC and the election to be trusted, and for people to go back and enthusiastically participate as voters and candidates, reform needs to be pursued much more aggressively.\"</p> <p>The vote will chose a successor to incumbent Hamid Karzai, who has run the country since the 2001 ousting of the Taliban, first as a nominated leader and then after winning two successive elections.</p> <p>The constitution bars him from running again, but there have been persistent concerns among some of his critics that he might try to alter the constitution to make way for a third term. A firm timetable could boost confidence that he plans to bow to the law, although he is expected to be heavily involved in the election.</p> <p>\"The question many people have been asking is whether Karzai is going to actually step aside and let someone else be president,\" said Heather Barr, Afghanistan researcher at Human Rights Watch. \"The choosing of a date goes some way towards assuaging those fears.\"</p> <p>The United Nations welcomed the decision and committed to supporting the elections, and the US embassy described the date as \"more than a day on a calendar\".</p> <p>The US ambassador to Afghanistan, James Cunningham, said: \"It is symbolic of the aspiration of Afghans for elections which will be crucial for Afghanistan's future stability. This will be an Afghan process, with the US and the international community prepared to provide support and encouragement.\"</p> <p>That support is likely to be much needed, as the Afghan government tries to fill gaps left by foreign troops. In past elections Nato forces have helped with security at voting booths in places dominated or strongly threatened by the Taliban, and helped ferry ballot boxes, poll officials and voting papers between remote parts of the country.</p> <p>Many of those troops are due to leave by the end of 2014, and by April of that year will have limited resources.</p> <p>\"[The IEC] has had to compromise between the fact that the later it pushes the date, the less it has in terms of international security, and the earlier it hosts it the less time it has to get ready,\" said Barr.</p> <p><em>Additional reporting by Mokhtar Amiri</em></p>",
  "<p>How's the election been for you? On a scale of one to 10? Great? Just OK? Would you recommend it to a friend? Not to trivialize the historical crossroads at which we find ourselves, still less the opportunity for a frank and rigorous exchange of ideas over the best policy with which to lead this great republic into the 21st century, but: have you had fun? Did it suck? Were you on the edge of your seat? Or was it a complete waste of your TiVo? </p> <p>That America's political machine is an ever-growing subsidiary of its entertainment industry has long been remarked upon. \"All campaigns are movies now, consisting of competing narratives with competing stars,\" <a href=\" http://www.amazon.com/Life-Movie-Entertainment-Conquered-Reality/dp/0375706534\">wrote Neal Gabler</a> in his superb 1998 book Life: The Movie, a radical expansion of Norman Mailer's famous comment, in his 1960 Esquire essay, <a href=\"http://www.esquire.com/features/superman-supermarket\">Superman Comes to the Supermarket</a>, that \"America's politics would now be also America's favorite movie.\"</p> <p>Whether it be Kennedy tapping into what Mailer called America's \"subterranean river of untapped, ferocious, lonely romantic desires\", or Nixon yucking it up on Rowan and Martin's Laugh-in, Reagan mashing up one-liners from old b-movies in his off-the-cuff remarks to the press, or Bill Clinton blowing his sax on the Arsenio Hall Show, presidents have long realized their responsibilities as America's \"entertainer-in-chief,\" <a href=\"http://www.kurtandersen.com/journalism/the-new-yorker/entertainer-in-chief/\">to use Kurt Anderson's term</a>.</p> <p>Or as Obama <a href=\"http://articles.nydailynews.com/2012-07-13/news/32667067_1_president-obama-republican-rival-mitt-romney-cbs-news\">said in an interview with CBS News</a> a few months ago: \"The mistake of my first term \u2013 couple of years \u2013 was thinking that this job was just about getting the policy right. And that's important but the nature of this office is also to tell a story to the American people that gives them a sense of unity and purpose and optimism, especially during tough times.\"</p> <p>In other words: he failed to construct an appealing and easily understood narrative around his achievements. He failed to make the public feel as if he had advanced America's plot.</p> <p>It's a curious omission given that one of Obama's greatest strengths is his gifts as a storyteller. It was how he first came to us, fashioning his own myth from the bare material of his life in Dreams of My Father. </p> <p>\"It was into my father's image, the black man, son of Africa, that I'd packed all of the attributes I sought in myself, the attributes of Martin and Malcolm, DuBois and Mandela,\" he wrote, only to be confronted with the truth of his father's decline. \"All my life, I had been wrestling with nothing more than a ghost!\" </p> <p>Much the same prism of projections would fan out around Obama as a political candidate, as he was himself sometimes uncomfortably aware. \"I am like a Rorschach test,\" <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/04/world/americas/04iht-obama.1.13459637.html?pagewanted=all\">he told the New York Times</a> in 2008, \"Even if people find me disappointing ultimately, they might gain something.\" In other words, Obama would succeed to the precise degree that he managed to replicate the same mixture of longing and long-distance charisma that his father once inspired in him.</p> <p>There's another word for that mixture: it's called \"fame\". As <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/commentary/la-oe-gablernew9-2008aug09,0,1401772.story\">Neal Gabler noted</a> at the time:\u2014</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Above all, Obama has something else that all great stars have \u2013 he embodies a theme. Every great star is a walking idea. James Cagney demonstrated the power of sheer energy early in his career, and the way that energy could curdle later in his career. Cary Grant demonstrated the force of charm and quick-wittedness. Paul Newman demonstrated the limitations of self-interest and the redemption that comes with engagement outside oneself. Robert Redford demonstrated the deception of appearances. Barbra Streisand, in the immortal words of critic Pauline Kael, demonstrated that talent was beauty. That is what made these individuals stars</p> </blockquote> <p><br> The 2008 election was as vividly plotted as an episode of the West Wing, with the added advantage that it was all playing out in real time, with new twists and developments every day, each ramping up the difficulty levels like a video game: the slaying of Hillary the dragon so nail-biting a drama you almost forgot that it was just the warm up for the confrontation with McCain. </p> <p>Not since Ripley blasted off from LV426 in Aliens only to find herself in the ring with the alien queen, have we been subject to a series of climaxes so cunningly staggered. That Obama <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xU0mu-qmy-U\">finally took to the stage in Chicago</a> to the sound of Trevor Rabin's almost illegally rousing score for the 2000 football-training drama Remember the Titans only went to show: ever now and again, given the right concatenation of inner character and circumstance, life serves up a happy ending worthy of a Denzel Washington movie.</p> <p>The first act of what followed was terrific, even if the genre was slightly unexpected, given the historical circumstances: comedy. Whether riffing on the White House as the perfect \"home office\", or goofily wide-eyed with his first flight on Air Force One, or sparring with McCain over the budget for a new fleet of presidential helicopters (\"The helicopter I have now seems perfectly adequate to me\"), Obama seemed to be channeling every ordinary Joe thrust into a fictional Oval office, from Jimmy Stewart in Mr Smith Goes to Washington to Kevin Kline in Dave. </p> <p>As Jon Stewart quipped, upon hearing the news that Obama had gotten Earth Wind and Fire to play at a White House party: \"Obama is actually doing the thing everyone says they would if they became president. 'If I become president I'm going have my favorite band play, and they're gonna play in the living room, like every day.'\"</p> <p>Then came the mid-terms. Traditionally the Second Act Complication brings the villain into play but in truth the Republican freshmen who took up their position in congress were not your typical not Vaudevillian villains, twirling their moustaches. Rather, with an obstructionist agenda that came close at times to outright nihilism, they were less, they more closely resembled Brechtian saboteurs, intent on breaking the fourth wall, bringing the entire performance to a shattering silence in which the audience looks at one another, nervily: what now? </p> <p>If the Clinton movie was baby-boomer nostalgia trip which descended into gluey sexual farce (The Big Chill meets Nine to Five) and the Bush presidency, like the second installment of all long-running franchises, a terrifying lurch over to the dark side (Superman 2, The Empire Strikes Back, Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom), then Obama's presidency soon resembled something out of the theatre of the absurd: an Beckettian anti-drama in which no is yes and up is down, designed to send the audience staggering out into the night, having been forcibly divested of their petit-bourgeois assumption that this or any drama should ever make sense.</p> <p>Anyone for a sequel? The biggest obstacle to a second Obama term, as with all sequels, is the removal of the asymmetry which made the hero's struggle so diverting in the first place. David has become his own Goliath. The kid who took on the Death Star is now a Jedi knight spouting Chinese-cracker bromides, and to be frank Princess Leia always preferred Han Solo anyway. </p> <p>\"You know, I recognize that times have changed since I first spoke to this convention,\" <a href=\" http://www.npr.org/2012/09/06/160713941/transcript-president-obamas-convention-speech\">said Obama when he accepted the Democratic nomination</a> earlier this year. \"Times have changed, and so have I. I'm no longer just a candidate. I'm the president.\"</p> <p>Some commentators took this for an Aaron Sorkin moment, akin to Michael Douglas's alpha-dog assertion of rank in The American President (\"My name is Andrew Shepherd, and I am the president\"), but he put the emphasis on a different syllable, sounding a more rueful note. </p> <p>Obama sounded like a man who knows his magic has partly evaporated, not as a consequence of anything he has said or done, but simply because he has ceased to be a projection of our desires. He has ceased to be fictional, and become real in front of our eyes. </p> <p>The good news for Democrats is that the same cannot be said of Romney. He has the looks of a president: the hair, now sporting attractive streaks of grey, the bone structure, the chin all seem the attributes of someone dreamt up by someone in central casting to appeal to our idea of what a commander-in-chief should look like \u2014 a CGI president, stranded in what animators call 'uncanny valley'. </p> <p>The rapid blink rate, the sunken eyes, the quick gulps, the nervous laugh, the over-concentration on whatever business is to hand: Romney has the unfailing sincerity of a bad actor. You have to go back to the old daytime soaps to find the furry unfamiliarity with which his mouth handles the word \"care\". He says it like he's removing a peach stone: when everyone's back is turned he'll drop it into the nearest plant pot. </p> <p>America is a nation of storytellers. It was founded on a David and Goliath narrative which every school kid can recite and which informs everything from the up-and-at-em urgency of its cinema, to the rags-to-riches narratives of its businesses, to the narratives of personal salvation fashioned by and for Oprah. </p> <p>Leave dramatic longeurs to the French, long form to the Russians and pauses to the British. Americans like to know what happens next. That the same dynamic also drives its politics should come as a surprise, and give those in the Obama camp cause for optimism. </p> <p>The country doesn't feel done with their candidate yet. The story feels only half done. We want to see how this one turns out.</p>",

That was the platform for a brief take on how fantastically Americans respond to adversity. But he said nothing about the government's relief response nor did he touch on the questions dogging him about a statement he made last year saying he would scrap the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) which has led the post-Sandy recovery efforts and drawn praise from New Jersey's Republican governor, Chris Christie.</p> <p>But former Florida governor Jeb Bush did weigh in at the Romney rally. He said his thoughts and prayers are with those enduring Sandy's destruction but then, in what sounded a little like one upmanship, he reminded the crowd that in 2004-5 Florida was hit by eight hurricanes and four tropical storms. And that, from his experience, \"local level and state level\" is better at handling the response than Fema. The crowd liked that, a lot.</p> <p>Romney played to his crowd in part of the country where Hispanic voters could decide the issue with a promise to boost trade with Latin America, saying it's economy is a big as China's and that it doesn't cheat as much.</p> <p>And Florida's role in the space programme prompted a familiar, lengthy story about Romney, the Boy Scouts and a flag on the space shuttle Challenger when it blew up. The flag survived. The crowd aah-ed. Romney managed not to mention that the space programme is government funded. It was among the more effective parts of a speech that was long on railing against corporate tax rates and working with Democrats as governor of Massachusetts to cut spending</p> </blockquote> <p>Nice to hear <strong>Jeb Bush</strong> criticise the federal government when under the aegis of his brother George, which it would have been in 2004-05.

Romney hasn't been helped by the Republican New Jersey governor Chris Christie's praise for Obama and FEMA during the crisis.</p> <p>Still, Romney has good reason to get back to campaigning, particularly in Florida where his substantial bounce after Obama's disastrous first debate performance has evaporated. Polls put the Republican candidate up to seven percentage points ahead a month ago but a New York Times survey on Wednesday has the president back in front, even if only by one point.</p> <p>If Romney doesn't take Florida, there's little chance of him winning the election.&#xa0;Outside the first stop at a Tampa aircraft hangar, a Romney opponent taunted supporters arriving for the rally by marking Halloween dressed up as a Republican Grim Reaper ready to slay Obamacare.

  "<p>As the flood waters recede and the states hit by Sandy start the grim task of mopping up, many questions remain, among them: how big an impact will the storm and its fallout have on the US economy?</p> <p>The short answer is: tens of billions of dollars, in damage, lost output and disruption to entire industries. And despite some optimistic forecasts made a day after Sandy moved inland, there are good reasons to think the final tally may be worse than expected.</p> <p>The devastation caused by Sandy comes at a critical time for the US economy as a whole, which seems to be on a slow march out of the doldrums, even if its pace is too slow for the millions out of work, and for Barack Obama's political fortunes.</p> <p>Luckily, in that sense alone, Sandy's landfall came too late for its wrath to be felt in the the economic data published before the presidential election, although the delays and confusion may yet cause the bureau of labour statistics to delay publication of its critical jobs report for October, scheduled to come out on Friday. Even if the BLS's number-crunchers can finish their work in time, the two-day outage on the eastern seaboard will put an asterix on the jobs numbers.</p> <p>The real effect won't be felt for several weeks, and it may be months and even years before the final cost of Sandy is calculated.</p> <p>The initial estimates take the usual response to a major natural disaster: yes, there will be losses caused by damage but these will be largely offset by the stimulus of rebuilding. Much lost production will be made up in subsequent weeks as companies and workers catch up with any backlog, while the consumer spending foregone by the days lost to the storm will be merely displaced to later dates or other avenues. Some sectors, such as tourism and transportation, will have permanent losses \u2013 empty hotel rooms and airline seats caused by cancelled bookings can't be resold later \u2013 but that effect will be brief and limited to the peak of the storm.</p> <p>That was the case with Hurricane Irene, which hit the area over a year ago and caused insured property damage worth $4.3bn, according to the Insurance Information Institute. But Sandy had a far bigger impact on the region, and hit a wider area. It may be that the final bill is well in excess of the early numbers being talked about on Tuesday.</p> <p>One of the first estimates was from Gregory Daco and Nigel Gault of IHS Global Insight, which said said early calculations of infrastructure damage was for losses worth $20bn. Lost economic activity could boost the overall total to $30bn-$50bn.</p> <p>Yet the final tally could be much higher for several reasons. The first is that much of the eastern seaboard \u2013 densely populated and containing some of the wealthiest areas in America \u2013 was at a virtual standstill for two entire days, as well as the federal government shut down and oil production along the entire coast being interrupted. Those things will help knock a chuck off GDP for the fourth quarter, perhaps 0.5 percentage points, at a time when growth is already slow.</p> <p>Then there is the scope of the rebuilding operation. The scale of damage may be far higher than initial estimates expected, because of the destruction in New Jersey that is still coming to light. That includes both private property and federal and state infrastructure.</p> <p>It is impossible to know at this stage what the economic impact of the destruction and damage to New York's transportation network will cause, over and above the cost of repairing the infrastructure itself. Simply closing the New York City subway for a week alone will have knock-on effects on output, tourism and even employment. Some are talking of up to six weeks before the full network is secured, and the longer the network is closed, the larger the costs will be.</p> <p>New York City does have one recent illustration of how economic losses can be far worse than first anticipated: the tragic events of 11 September, 2001. Like Sandy, it did huge damage in the city's financial district, and a cleaning-up operation that lasted for years. Initial estimates of $38bn in insurance claims later shot up to $52bn. The city was expected to lose 57,000 jobs after 9/11, but the BLS later said the attacks cost the economy 143,000 jobs and $2.8 bn in lost wages in the following three months.</p> <p>Could Sandy be anywhere near as bad? Most people think not. The 9/11 attacks came when the US economy was on a down swing, so it exacerbated an existing trend. Sandy, on the other hand, hit a region that was recovering. But one of the worst-off sectors since the housing boom ended has been the construction industry, and it has the spare capacity to rebuild the Sandy states at a lower cost than would have been the case five years ago. But whether that will be enough to compensate for lower activity and output elsewhere is another matter.</p>",
  "<p>Here's a sentence I wish I hadn't written \u2013 it rolled out of my Macbook in May, part of an <a href=\"http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/global-warmings-terrifying-new-math-20120719\">article for Rolling Stone</a> that quickly went viral:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"Say something so big finally happens (a giant hurricane swamps Manhattan, a megadrought wipes out Midwest agriculture) that even the political power of the industry is inadequate to restrain legislators, who manage to regulate carbon.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>I wish I hadn't written it because the first half gives me entirely undeserved credit for prescience: I had no idea both would, in fact, happen in the next six months. And I wish I hadn't written it because now that my bluff's been called, I'm doubting that even Sandy, the largest storm ever, will be enough to make our political class serious about climate change. </p> <p>Maybe I'm wrong, though. Maybe \u2013 just maybe \u2013 the arrival of a giant wall of water in the exact middle of the financial and media capital of our home planet will be enough to get this conversation unstuck. Maybe that obscene slick of ocean spreading unnaturally into the tubes and tunnels of the greatest city on earth will shock enough people to change the debate. New York Governor <a href=\"http://statepolitics.lohudblogs.com/2012/10/30/cuomo-we-have-a-new-reality-when-it-comes-to-these-weather-patterns/\">Andrew Cuomo, at a press conference Tuesday afternoon</a>, allowed as how:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"There has been a series of extreme weather incidents. That is not a political statement, that is a factual statement \u2026 Anyone who says there's not a dramatic change in weather patterns, I think, is denying reality.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg added:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"What is clear is that the storms we've experienced in the last year or so around this country and around the world are much more severe than before.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Truthfully, I think I'd just as soon see statements like that as carefully thought-out endorsements of climate science. It's experience that changes people: the summer's drought left more than half of American counties as federal disaster areas, and meteorologist Jeff Masters estimates Sandy hit 100 million Americans with \"extreme weather\". Add in the largest forest fires in Colorado and New Mexico, the hottest month in US history, and the completely absurd summer-in-March heatwave that kicked off our year of living sweatily, and you can begin to understand why the percentage of <a href=\"http://www.usclimatenetwork.org/hot-topics/climate-polling\">Americans worrying about global warming has spiked sharply this year</a>. Spiked high enough that even a few politicians are willing to speak out.</p> <p>Not many. The presidential candidates avoided the topic at all their big public forums \u2013 except for Romney's Republican national convention joke about how silly it was to try and slow the rise of the oceans (which probably didn't win him many votes on the Jersey Shore this week). Obama did talk climate with MTV last week, but that venue almost defines the issue's fringe status; his other real discussion of it was with Rolling Stone \u2013 global warming is, apparently, only for people with earbuds.</p> <p>They barnstormed through the hottest summer on record, and they didn't seem to notice. One appreciates cool in a president, but there's a limit.</p> <p>If Sandy, however, begins to give a little opening for discussion, we're unfortunately at the point where we have to force the discussion. After 20 years of inaction, we're so far behind the curve that we've got to raise the bar higher than mere acknowledgement that we've got a problem. We've got to get some action from these guys.</p> <p>And that, I think, requires a truly crucial set of changes. We need to neutralize the force that's kept them quiet. It's not that our politicians didn't know about climate change: I've watched, for two decades, as the world's best scientists make the annual trek to Capitol Hill to lay out the latest data. It's that, as scary as those charts and graphs were, the fossil fuel industry was scarier still.</p> <p>As the richest industry on earth, and the biggest political player, the boys from coal and oil and gas have bought one party and terrified the other. Last week \u2013 in the very final days of the US election \u2013 Chevron smacked down the single largest corporate donation in the Citizens United era, <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/election-2012/wp/2012/10/26/chevron-donates-2-5-million-to-gop-super-pac/\">$2.5m to a GOP Super Pac</a>. There's not a congressman who didn't notice, and who didn't think: what if they came after me with ten days to go?</p> <p>If we're going to change the political equation, we're going to do it by going after the fossil fuel industry. They deserve it. As that Rolling Stone article of mine laid out, they're planning to burn literally five times more carbon than the most conservative government on earth thinks is safe. They've turned into a rogue force.</p> <p>Which is why <a href=\"http://www.350.org/\">350.org</a> sent out an email blast today, raising money for the Red Cross and raising <a href=\"350.org\">signatures for a petition</a> to oil execs asking that they stop their campaign donations and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/oct/30/superpacs-superstorm-sandy-disaster-relief\">spend the money repairing New York instead</a>. And it's why we launch <a href=\"math.350.org\">a road show</a> next week. We'll go to 20 cities in 20 nights, trying to spark a movement for divestment from fossil fuel stocks, and a new willingness to stand up to the industry. It starts next Wednesday in Seattle, and we'll do it no matter who wins the White House next Tuesday night.</p> <p>Because as important as elections are, they're not the biggest battle.</p>",
  "<p>President Obama is to tour the beleaguered state of New Jersey on Wednesday, as large swathes of the US east coast attempt to recover from the worst affects of floods, fires and power outages whipped up by superstorm Sandy.</p> <p>Some of the most densely populated areas of the eastern United States awoke to continued disruption and scenes of devastation, with many areas still inundated with saltwater flooding, downed trees and scattered debris.</p> <p>The death toll currently stands at 55 and many people faced a miserable night as temperatures fell to freezing.

However, many transport links in and around New York remain closed.</p> <p>Authorities have warned that the New York subway system will be closed for at least the next four or five days, as water is pumped out of tunnels and stations are repaired. Of the underwater links into Manhattan, only the Lincoln tunnel was open on Wednesday. Of the ferries, only the Hudson ferry was operational.</p> <p>The New York stock exchange was reopened by Mayor Bloomberg on Wednesday after two days of closure, despite the lack of power in lower Manhattan.</p> <p>In a briefing on Wednesday evening, Kevin Burke, CEO of the main New York electricity supplier, ConEdison, said much of lower Manhattan would remain without power for days. He said it would take \"three to four days\" to restore service at a substation at 14th Street and FDR Drive, which serves power to 220,000 people. The substation failed on Monday night after flooding rose to levels that ConEd had not expected.</p> <p>On Tuesday, New Jersey governor Chris Christie said that he did not expect the <a href=\"http://www.paalerts.com/recent_pathalerts.aspx\">Path transit system,</a> which connects New Jersey with New York, to be operational for at least a week.</p> <p>The latest forecast from the US national weather service warns of further possible flooding from the Potomac river as Sandy makes it way through Pennsylvania, spreading its effects as far as the Great Lakes.</p> <p>Speaking on Tuesday, mayor Michael Bloomberg said: \"We will get through the days ahead by doing what we always do in tough times by standing together, shoulder to shoulder, ready to help a neighbour, comfort a stranger and get the city we love back on its feet.\"</p> <p>Footage released on Wednesday by NYPD also showed the extent of flood damage in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/31/superstorm-sandy-cleanup-live#block-5090f67295cb49410b863b9c\">residential areas of Staten Island,</a> as rescuers were forced to carry out a dramatic rooftop evacuation of five adults and a child and hoist them to safety in a helicopter.</p> <p>Obama was planning to visit an area near Atlantic City where Sandy hit on Monday night, with particularly devastating effect.</p> <p>With the presidential election just six days away, Obama cancelled campaign events for the third day to focus on coordinating the response to the superstorm.

  "<p>When Russian protesters took to the streets last year following allegations of mass fraud in the parliamentary elections, Vladimir Churov became a popular hate figure.</p> <p>Many held the head of the central elections commission responsible for massaged results that had given the ruling United Russia party up to 99% of the vote in some regions of the country.</p> <p>In a comment widely lampooned by protesters, the then-president Dmitry Medvedev referred to Churov as a \"wizard\" for his success in predicting the election's outcome.</p> <p>As the presidential vote looms in the US, however, Churov has gone on the offensive with his own scathing criticism of American democracy.</p> <p>\"The elections for the president of the USA are not direct, not universal, not equal and do not preserve voting secrecy,\" Churov wrote in a 3,600-word article in the state-owned Rossiskaya Gazeta on Wednesday. \"It's a stretch of the imagination to talk about the right of American citizens to choose their president.\"</p> <p>The heavily bearded former physics student attacked: a notable lack of election monitors at US elections; the absence of a centralised electoral co-ordination body; problems with voter registration; difficulties identifying voters at polling stations; poorly protected personal data; and defective counting systems.</p> <p>The whole democratic process is marred by \"complications, decentralisation, politicisation, a lack of transparency and anarchy,\" he wrote.</p> <p>Churov, 59, is known to be close to President Vladimir Putin with whom he worked in St&#xa0; Petersburg in the 1990s. He has said his first rule is that \"Putin is always right.\"</p> <p>Putin has repeatedly attacked foreign groups who try to meddle in internal Russian affairs, accusing opposition protesters of following the orders of the US secretary of state, Hillary Clinton.</p> <p>Churov concluded his article by suggesting that state pressure had been exerted on \"third party\" candidates during the US presidential campaign. And he alleged that the practice of heads of companies forcing their employees to vote in accordance with their own wishes was \"widespread\".</p>",

Some 330 buses will deliver the connecting service. A few Metro North and Long Island Railroad services will start today.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 Kennedy and Newark Liberty airports reopened with limited service Wednesday morning.</strong> New York's LaGuardia Airport, which suffered far worse damage and where water covered parts of runways, remained closed.

It reads: \u201cMultiple National Guard trucks will be coming through flooded streets, first to evacuate those with true medical emergencies. Keep an eye out, go down to the lowest possible floor, but do not go outside. Signal to get their attention.\u201d</p> <p>More than 20,000 people are trapped in their homes, according to reports, without power for the third day running as many parts of the city remain under several feet of water. Residents are being urged to stay inside for safety reasons as the water has live wires and is contaminated with sewage. More than half the population of 50,000, are without power, according to <a href=\"http://www.hobokenhorse.com/\">a city website</a>.&#xa0;Water is not expected to recede for 24-48 hours.</p> <p>The mayor sent out a call on Twitter asking for local volunteers to report to City Hall at 10am on Wednesday. Two shelters have been set up on Hudson Street, and people are being asked for blankets, pillows and other items to help make the evacuated more comfortable.</p> <p>Hoboken's Facebook page has become a message board for residents and their relatives, desperate for contact with each other as well as for information.

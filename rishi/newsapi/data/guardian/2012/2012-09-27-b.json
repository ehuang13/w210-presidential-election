  "<p>With the Obama-Romney presidential contest gaining momentum, many will be asking: where, oh where, is the classic political satire that can tackle the troubled zeitgeist? Could this movie starring Will Ferrell and Zach Galifianakis be the one? Erm \u2026 not exactly, no. It's a broad comedy, with some outrageous gross-out laughs, directed by Jay Roach and co-written by Shawn Harwell, who contributed to TV's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2010/nov/02/david-gordon-green-eastbound-and-down\" title=\"\">Eastbound and Down</a>. The film doesn't aspire to anything particularly sharp and sophisticated, and even diehard Ferrell fans might feel he isn't exactly giving us the shock of the new. But it's entertaining. Ferrell plays the appalling Congressman Cam Brady campaigning for re-election. He's a loathsome married womaniser whose polling numbers go into freefall when a&#xa0;drunk-dialled wrong number accidentally places his lascivious phone message on the answering machine of a fiercely Christian family. His opponents smell blood and put up a nerdy wholesome guy against him, local tourism chief Marty Huggins (Galifianakis), and the campaign turns nasty after the two candidates' nakedly hostile \"Civility Brunch\". If you're solemnly looking for contemporary political observation, this isn't the film for you. But laughs come rolling off the production line a-plenty.</p>",
  "<p>Quick: name the most memorable moment from the three presidential debates between Barack Obama and John McCain?</p> <p>Nothing coming to mind? (And no, Sarah Palin saying \"you betcha\" in the vice-presidential debate doesn't count.)</p> <p>How about the 2004 debates between John Kerry and George W Bush? Well, there was that line about a \"global test\" and then that great internet rumor that Bush had <a href=\"http://www.visualfuturist.com/bushiswired/\">a radio receiver on his back</a>. But anything else ring a bell?</p> <p>This isn't just a memory test for Guardian readers \u2013 it's a perhaps less-than-subtle reminder that even though presidential debates are often viewed as the most important part of a campaign (aside from the national conventions), they actually affect the final election results a lot less than you might think. If Mitt Romney is hoping that the debates turn the tide in what is an ever-widening polling gap between him and Barack Obama, he might want to think again.</p> <p>The idea of debates being a less consequential campaign event will likely seem counter-intuitive to many. For weeks, these TV setpieces have been hyped as the signal events of the fall campaign. And doesn't history provide many lessons of game-changing debate moments?</p> <p>Was it not Richard Nixon's five o'clock shadow that doomed him against the much smoother John F Kennedy <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QazmVHAO0os&amp;feature=player_embedded\">in 1960</a>? Or what about Ronald Reagan's famous quip in 1984, when asked if he was too old to be president:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"I will not make age an issue of this campaign. I am not going to exploit, for political purposes, my opponent's (Walter Mondale) youth and inexperience.\"</p> </blockquote>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/fJhCjMfRndk?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"276\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/fJhCjMfRndk\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Or what about Michael Dukakis's robotic response to a query about whether he would still oppose the death penalty for a rapist-killer if his wife, Kitty, had been the victim?</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/aUXz4wFDAo0?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"276\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/aUXz4wFDAo0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>These are just the sort of game-changing moments that allow the Romney campaign a flicker of hope.</p> <p>But not so fast. While political pundits love to impart great meaning and importance to these events, political scientists aren't so convinced. As John Sides, a political scientist at George Washington University, <a href=\"http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/magazine/septemberoctober_2012/ten_miles_square/do_presidential_debates_really039413.php?page=1\">wrote recently</a> in Washington Monthly:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"Scholars who have looked most carefully at the data have found that, when it comes to shifting enough votes to decide the outcome of the election, presidential debates have rarely, if ever, mattered \u2026 in the average election year, you can accurately predict where the race will stand after the debates by knowing the state of the race before the debates.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Debate gaffes, like your garden-variety campaign gaffes, rarely, if ever, move public opinion polls or affect the final outcome of elections. Even if Dukakis had given a more emotional response to the death penalty question, or if George Bush hadn't been caught <a href=\"http://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2008/01/17/a-damaging-impatience\">checking his watch</a> during the 1992 debate, both candidates were still likely to lose.</p> <p>Reagan's zinger against Mondale was highly effective, but incumbents who win 49 states don't need a great debate line to ride to victory.</p> <p>The first of two possible exceptions to the general rule of debate irrelevance is the <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/1996/debates/history/1980/index.shtml\">1980 debate between Ronald Reagan and Jimmy Carter</a>, which came only days before the election. While Reagan held a small lead going into the debate, by the weekend before election day, polls showed him approaching a landslide-like advantage. The debate, rather than \"changing the game\", simply confirmed the direction the polls were already headed \u2013 albeit in a decisive manner.</p> <p>Reagan, who was regularly portrayed by Carter in the most negative terms imaginable and, in particular, as a war-monger, came across as cool, calm and collected \u2013 anything but a loose cannon. If Americans needed reassurance that they could trust Reagan in the White House, the debate clinched it.</p> <p>In 2000, Al Gore's <a href=\"http://www.thedailyshow.com/watch/wed-october-4-2000/indecision-2000---sigh-language\">constant sighing</a> during his first presidential debate with George W Bush turned him into an object of ridicule (even Saturday Night Live poked fun at Gore's tic). According to Sides, Gore's unfortunate show of contemptuous impatience may have shifted the polls by two to three points in sympathy with his opponent, Bush. Considering the narrowness of Gore's eventual \"defeat\", the debate could be considered one of several decisive factors.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-audio\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.nbc.com/assets/video/widget/widget.html?vid=1356981\"> <iframe id=\"nbc-video-widget\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" src=\"https://www.nbc.com/assets/video/widget/widget.html?vid=1356981\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>But for those two examples, there is always the experience of John Kerry, who, in 2004, won not one, not two, but all three presidential debates against George W Bush, according to post debate polling \u2013 and still lost the election. Quite simply, Kerry's strong performance couldn't cancel out the advantages of his opponent. Or, still more importantly, while the debates gave him a boost in the polls, they didn't have the effect of fundamentally reversing the trajectory of the race. This is perhaps the most important factor: debates might affect the polls around the margins, but they have never had a seismic impact on a presidential campaign.</p> <p>And this brings us back to Mitt Romney. If the latest public opinion polls are to be believed, the Romney campaign is in serious and deepening trouble. Not only is he <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2012/09/27/politics/campaign-wrap/index.html\">trailing in the national polls</a>, but he is also losing badly in <a href=\"http://www.dailykos.com/story/2012/09/20/1134217/-New-Swing-State-Polls-Show-Romney-Falling-With-More-Trouble-Possibly-Looming\">swing state polls</a> from Ohio, Virginia and Florida, each of which suggests that Obama is opening up sizable, even insurmountable, leads.</p> <p>No matter how well Romney does in his debates with Obama, what reason is there to believe that he can do well enough to reverse this increasingly dire trend? Have any actions to date by the gaffe-tastic Romney given credence to the notion that he has the political chops to change the direction of the race in these debates? If anything, because of his now almost daily faux pas, even the smallest slip-up has the potential to dominate post debate coverage. The guy is practically going to have to bat 1,000, just to eke out a win.</p> <p>Moreover, it's not all about Romney. There is even less reason to believe that Barack Obama will make a mistake so grievous and costly that he will open the door to a Romney comeback. There's a reason, after all, people call him \"no-drama Obama\".</p> <p>Unless the president uses the debate to unleash a profanity-laced diatribe against the people of Ohio and Florida, it's very hard to imagine anything he could do or say that would badly hurt him. To be honest, even if he were, inexplicably, to do such a thing, I'm not convinced it would cost him the election. Considering the current polarization of the electorate and the dearth of undecided voters \u2013 short of Obama's breaking out the legendary \"whitey\" tape, or admitting that, yes, he was born in Kenya \u2013 he's likely safe.</p> <p>None of this is to suggest that voters shouldn't tune in to the debates. They are an excellent opportunity to more fully appreciate the positions of the two candidates and understand the rather profound differences between the two parties. Just don't expect it to make much of a difference in a race where the outlines of the final results are becoming increasingly clear.</p>",
  "<p>Fear that Barack Obama is going to win another four years is beginning to seep into the ranks of Mitt Romney supporters. </p> <p>About 200 people turned out to see Romney on a campaign stop in Virginia Thursday. It was not a big crowd but it was a loyal one, expressing hope against hope that the Republican candidate might yet turn in a dazzling performance in the first of the presidential debates next week. </p> <p>And yet, in the wake of polls on Wednesday showing Obama ahead by 10% in Ohio and 9% in Florida, there is a grim, growing recognition that hopes of the White House might be starting to slip. </p> <p>\"At this point, I have my fears that Obama will be back and we will see four years more of no growth,\" said Patrick Gallagher, 59, a former army engineer. </p> <p>Having said that, he expressed a distrust of polls, based on his experience of previous elections and hoped the three debates coming up might swing independents. \"The election in this state and nationwide will hinge on what happens in these debates,\" Gallagher said. \"It is a chance to see them go head to head.\"</p> <p>Romney's speech, at an American Legion hall in Springfield full mainly of vets, was targetted at voters either in the military or ex-military, warning that proposed Pentagon tax cuts will cost jobs and put America's security at risk.</p> <p>As a piece of micro-targeting, it is clever. Republicans are strongest in the south, but to win Virginia Romney needs also to take votes in the north, and people with military links are a good bet.</p> <p>But he showed little enthusiasm or passion, looking like someone weighed down by the polls and wondering how he could go on delivering speeches like this week after week all the way to November 6.</p> <p>He said it was unthinkable that the government would cut military spending when the world remains \"troubled and dangerous\". The problem for Romney with this as an attack line is that the Republicans, including running mate Paul Ryan, voted for those very cuts.</p> <p>He demonstrated yet again he is not an inspirational speaker. Even when he won an ovation when he said \"when I become president\", it was not long-lasting, with people just popping out of their seats and quickly sitting down again. </p> <p>Mackie Christenson, 65, from Leesburg, Virgina, said she believes Romney can still win in spite of the polls. \"Reagan was down 9% at this point against Carter,\" she said.</p> <p>She is not upset that Romney has changed tack over the last few days, more positive about Obama, acknowledging he cares about America. Romney is \"basically a nice person. Politics is a blood sport, and he is swimming with sharks.\".</p> <p>She predicted Romney will win the debate next week because he will have a chance to call out Obama on what she said were repeated lies about contraception \u2013 Republicans are not opposed to contraception, she said \u2013 the killing of ambassador Chris Stevens and other issues.</p> <p>She is especially annoyed that so many women are backing Obama. \"Women make up 75% of the unemployed. They are having to cope with high food prices. And yet they are for Obama because they think he is cute.\"</p> <p>Gallagher said that Obama's poll leads might even backfire. \"I think the poll leads could hurt Obama. If Obama supporters think he is going to win, they might stay at home,\" Gallagher said.</p> <p>That is far from being a vote of confidence in Romney's chances.</p>",
  "<p>Barack Obama called for a new era of \"economic patriotism\" as he launched a fresh series of attacks on Mitt Romney for his comments disparaging 47% of Americans as freeloaders.</p> <p>As the first votes were cast in the White House election, Obama placed the 47% remarks at the heart of his campaign, telling supporters in Virginia that change in cannot be achieved in one term and \"it can't happen if you write off half the nation before you take office\". </p> <p>Romney's comments were caught on a secretly recorded video when the Republican presidential candidate addressed a small group of wealthy donors in May.</p> <p>The attack was reinforced in new ads released Thursday. In one, Romney's voice is heard dismissing the 47% of the population who he said are dependent on the government and take no responsibility for their own lives. On screen, as Romney speaks, are pictures of the groups the Democrats suggest he was referring to: the elderly, veterans, Latinos, children and working-class women.</p> <p>It is a potent election message, and Romney's remarks are proving to be one of the most destructive moments of the whole White House campaign.</p> <p>Another Obama ad deals with \"economic patriotism\", a new label for the president's economic promises, which include creating 1m manufacturing jobs and hiring thousands of new teachers.</p> <p>They are to be broadcast in seven swing states: Virginia, Florida, Ohio, New Hampshire, Iowa, Colorado and Nevada. But they are not being shown in North Carolina, a sign that the Obama campaign may have written the state off as a gain for Romney. </p> <p>The \"economic patriotism\" promotes economic growth from the bottom up and contrasts this with Romney's trickle-down approach.</p> <p>\"This country doesn't succeed when only the rich get richer,\" Obama said in his speech. \"We succeed when the middle class gets bigger, when there are ladders of opportunity for all who strive to get into the middle class, when everybody who's willing to work hard has a chance to get ahead and live up to their God-given potential.\"</p> <p>Then, turning directly to the secret video, Obama added: \"I don't think we can get very far with leaders who write off half the nation as a bunch of victims who never take responsibility for their own lives.\"</p> <p>Both Obama and Romney were campaigning in Virginia on Thursday in areas with a strong military presence. The president was in Virginia Beach while Romney was in Springfield.</p> <p>Obama opted for a broad appeal to voters while Romney flailed about in the wake of disastrous poll figures showing him badly trailing the president in swing states. Obama is ahead in Virginia in spite of predictions he would not be able to hold it after his 2008 win.</p> <p>Early voting began in Iowa on Thursday and starts in Ohio next week and elsewhere round the country. An estimated 30%-40% of those voting will have cast their ballots before election day November 6.</p> <p>In his speech, Obama, echoing Romney's secret video, said that wherever he visited in America, including Virginia, he did not find victims as Romney contended but hardworking Americans.</p> <p>\"I see students trying to work their way through college. I see single moms, like my mom, putting in overtime to raise their kids right. I see senior citizens who have been saving for retirement your entire lives,\" Obama said. \"I see a whole bunch of veterans who served this country with bravery and distinction.\"</p> <p>In what could be a rehearsal for the first presidential debate in Denver on Wednesday, he noted that Romney had picked up on a comment he had made that change in Washington does not come from the inside and that change in Washington had to come the outside.</p> <p>\"And for some reason, this got governor Romney really excited. And he rewrote his speech, and he stood up at a rally and he proudly declared: 'I'll get the job done from the inside' \u2013 which got me thinking, what kind of inside job are you talking about?,\" Obama said, proving that not only does he have better delivery than Romney, he has better speech-writers.</p> <p>As the laughter subsided, Obama continued: \"Because if it's the inside job of rubber-stamping the top-down, lobbyist-driven agenda of this Republican Congress, we don't want that. If it's the inside job of letting oil companies write energy policy, insurance companies writing health care policy, outsourcers writing our tax code, we don't need that. If it's the inside job of trying to control the health care choices that women are perfectly capable of making themselves, we'll take a pass on that. We don't need an inside job.\"</p> <p>He added, ramming home his point about Romney's speech: \"In 2008, 47% of this country did not vote for me. But the night of the election, I said to all those Americans, I said, I may not have won your vote, but I hear your voice. I need your help. I will be your president, too.\"</p>",
  "<p>With Harvard Law Professor Elizabeth Warren gaining ground in the Massachusetts Senate race, US Senator Scott Brown's campaign decided there was nowhere to go but negative. Brown <a href=\"http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Elections/Senate/2012/0926/Elizabeth-Warren-and-Cherokee-heritage-what-is-known-about-allegations\">has blasted Warren</a> for months, charging that she claimed Native American heritage to take advantage of university affirmative action employment policies. In the first debate between the two, Brown went so far as to say that Warren did not look Indian.</p> <p>But his campaign finally overreached. At a recent Boston campaign event, a group of Brown supporters, including some members of his Senate staff, <a href=\"http://bluemassgroup.com/2012/09/scott-brown-staffers-do-indian-war-whoop-tomahawk-chop-youtube/\">taunted Warren's backers</a> with tomahawk chops and pseudo war chants. Suffice to say that such displays don't go <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/explainer/2012/09/origins_of_the_tomahawk_chop_scott_brown_s_staffers_mocking_elizabeth_warren_are_continuing_a_long_tradition_.html\">down well with Native Americans</a>.</p> <p>Brown's first apology wasn't enough for the Cherokee Nation. \"A campaign that would allow and condone such offensive and racist behavior must be called to task for their actions,\" Principal Chief Bill John Baker <a href=\"http://bluemassgroup.com/2012/09/chief-of-cherokee-nation-calls-on-scott-brown-to-apologize-for-his-staff/\">said in a statement</a>. Brown was finally forced to come up with a <a href=\"http://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2012/09/26/Scott-Brown-warns-staff-over-war-whoops/UPI-57811348683620/\">stronger mea culpa and a zero tolerance policy</a> on any future stunts.</p> <p>The no-more-Mr-Nice-Guy strategy is fraught with perils for Brown. He won his Senate seat, in part, thanks to his carefully crafted persona as a genial, regular Joe in an old barn coat who cruises around the state in a pickup truck. Even long-time Boston Mayor Thomas Menino, a Democratic warhorse if there ever was one, counts Brown as a friend and <a href=\"http://bostonglobe.com/metro/2012/09/21/brown-warren-push-for-votes-day-after-debate/RtEQIpZLLr2jZyM2A6e2rI/story.html\">waited as long as politically possible before endorsing Warren</a>. </p> <p>The feisty Warren is easygoing and personable on the campaign trail. But she's opted against being either warm and fuzzy or too <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/03/03/fight-for-the-cfpa-is-a-d_n_483707.html\">in-your-face</a> where it counts for most voters: on television. Her response to the heritage controversy has been muddled and only recently has she come out with a <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oIVinDXzOw\">more robust response</a>.</p> <p>Dial up the wayback machine and the personable Brown might well have been making short work of Warren, as he did with state <a href=\"http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2010/01/21/coakley_aides_paint_portrait_of_missteps_on_campaign_trail/\">Attorney General Martha Coakley in the 2010 special election</a> to fill the late Senator Ted Kennedy's seat. But in this Senate race, personal appeal is bumping up hard against the realities of party politics in a presidential election year. According to Alan Wolfe, a Boston College political science professor:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"If we lived in a world in which we vote for the candidate [as an individual], you couldn't lose as a middle class person by voting for either, but we don't live in that world. Party \u2026 matters right now more than the person, and the parties right now have very different approaches to the middle class.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>The two candidates break even on the crucial issue of middle class \"cred\". Warren often describes herself as growing up on the \"ragged edge of the middle class\". She worked as a waitress as a young teenager, after her father had had a heart attack. Her self-description could just as easily also apply to Brown, whose working mother briefly relied on welfare.</p> <p>So, Brown's strategy is to keep Warren off her game, which runs on <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-07-15/obama-eliminates-warren-as-consumer-head.html\">her deep knowledge</a> of the economy, consumer affairs, and Wall Street, lest she get more traction in turning the race into a referendum on the national Republican party and Brown's <a href=\"http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/b/scott_p_brown/index.html\">Senate record</a>.</p> <p>Four of five <a href=\"http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/pollster/2012-massachusetts-senate-brown-vs-warren\">recent state-wide polls showed</a> Warren edging out in front of Brown in what remains a very close race. Warren picked up <a href=\"http://www.c-span.org/DNC/Events/Elizabeth-Warren-at-the-2012-Democratic-National-Convention/C3779973/\">her Democratic national convention bounce</a> and ran with it. She hits all the right notes for her Democratic base on Massachusetts middle-class worries like unaffordable mortgages, student loan and credit card debt and bad guys like \"Big Oil\" and \"millionaires and billionaires\". For his part, <a href=\"http://www.masslive.com/politics/index.ssf/2012/08/scott_brown_says_hes_not_tryin.html\">Brown passed up a Republican national convention speaking slot</a> \u2013 a move that deliberately distanced him from Mitt Romney, the state's former governor and his political mentor. </p> <p>In the Senate, Brown has little room to maneuver on controversial issues like tax policy that are central to Republican orthodoxy. <a href=\"http://www.unh.edu/survey-center/news/pdf/bg_2012-bg32.pdf\">Few Massachusetts likely voters believe</a> that he would raise tax rates on the wealthy Americans. Indeed, he's opposed <a href=\"http://www.investinganswers.com/financial-dictionary/tax-center/buffett-rule-3653\">the \"Buffett rule</a>\" and <a href=\"http://www.boston.com/politicalintelligence/2012/07/25/senator-scott-brown-votes-against-extending-tax-cuts-under-gop-democrat-plans/WsuIo08WEpvOo67TYcwizH/story.html\">lifting Bush era tax cuts</a> on higher-income earners while preserving them for workers making less than $250,000.</p> <p>Bay State voters are cool toward their former governor \u2013 President Obama is expected to trounce Romney easily here \u2013 and cooler still toward the conservative Republicans who dominate the national party. Yet, a strong Democratic turnout doesn't guarantee victory for Warren in a state where independents <a href=\"http://www.sec.state.ma.us/ele/elepdf/2012_Party_Enrollment_Stats.pdf\">comprise more than 50%</a> of the electorate and historically have few qualms about voting for moderate Republicans like Brown.</p> <p>Which is why the tomahawk/chant episode could be a pivotal moment. It recalls a ghost of campaigns past: the 2006 Massachusetts gubernatorial race. Kerry Healey, the Republican candidate and Romney's lieutenant governor, deployed an ad <a href=\"http://www.csmonitor.com/2006/1031/p10s01-uspo.html\">loaded with powerful racial overtones</a> against the Deval Patrick, the African-American political newcomer. The tactic backfired badly: Healey never recovered and lost to Patrick in a rout. He is now in his midway through his second term; she advises the Romney campaign.</p> <p>Much is riding on the mood of the Massachusetts electorate. Do voters believe that Brown is still an affable guy who understands their issues better and can make himself heard in a politically polarized capital? Or is the Harvard law school maverick and consumer protection champion the best person to send to Washington?</p> <p>Clearly, Brown <a href=\"http://www.boston.com/politicalintelligence/2012/09/24/elizabeth-warren-defends-work-asbestos-lawsuit/LXxLBL9BBBHIXEDzQoFBLO/story.html\">has opted to keep voters focused</a> on his view of Warren's personal shortcomings. That could be a costly gamble for a nice guy.</p>",
  "<p>As Venezuelans get ready to head to the polls for the most closely fought presidential election of the past 14 years, one question is at the forefront of everyone's mind: does Hugo Ch\u00e1vez still have it? By \"it\", I&#xa0;mean his legendary, intense, emotional connection with the poor \u2013 a kind of attachment that has, for many, a feeling of religious fervour.

After the chaotic nationalisation of most of the agro-industrial chain \u2013 from the farm to the supermarket \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.economist.com/node/16326418\" title=\"\">food shortages have become chronic</a>, with various staples disappearing from shelves. <a href=\"http://wikileaks.org/cable/2007/12/07CARACAS2381.html\" title=\"\">Lines at subsidised government grocery shops are long,</a> and particularly scarce commodities sell out almost the second they're delivered.</p> <p>On closer inspection, the only thing that appears to be 21st century about Ch\u00e1vez's 21st-century socialism is <a href=\"https://twitter.com/chavezcandanga\" title=\"\">the presidential Twitter account</a>. The economy is still run along the same rigid lines that crippled eastern bloc economies for much of the 20th century. One after another, industries have been nationalised only to become outsized money-pits unable to produce the goods needed. The steel and cement industries <a href=\"http://blogs.ft.com/beyond-brics/2011/08/19/venezuela-no-cement-no-steel-no-housing/\" title=\"\">can't produce enough</a> to meet the country's housing needs; electric utilities have brought chronic <a href=\"http://latitude.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/09/21/chavezs-electric-power-problem/\" title=\"\">blackouts throughout the country</a>; and the phone company has failed to deliver adequate internet access. Venezuelans like to joke that Julian Assange passed over Venezuela for political asylum simply because the internet is so slow there.</p> <p>That Venezuela's economy doesn't grind to a halt, Zimbabwe style, amid the waste, corruption and mismanagement of incompetent central planning is down to a single word: oil. Sitting atop <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oil_reserves_in_Venezuela\" title=\"\">the world's largest reserves</a> at a time of extraordinarily high prices, the government is kept afloat by a torrent of petrodollars that more or less papers over the cracks. When steel production falls by two-thirds after a botched nationalisation, the government simply re-routes part of the petrodollar stream to finance steel imports. When nationalised farms suffer a similar fate, food imports are jacked up.</p> <p>Oil wealth is a magical elixir that keeps up the appearance of normality, even as the country sinks deeper and deeper into the economic morass.</p> <p>In many ways that near-mystical bond with the poor is the most important of the assets that oil funds. Ch\u00e1vez has been careful to keep the spigots open, channelling a constant stream of populist giveaways to his supporters. An oil-for-appliances deal with China, for example, has allowed Venezuela to import more than 3m Chinese-made stoves, refrigerators, washing machines, air conditioners and flat-screen TVs, goodies handed out directly to governing party supporters as part of \"My Well-Stocked Home\" \u2013 a government social programme, <a href=\"http://www.correodelorinoco.gob.ve/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Mi-casa-bien-equipada-.jpg\" title=\"\">whose logo includes the comandante presidente's face</a>. The guiding principle to Chavista social policy is simple: people must never be under the impression it's to the welfare state they owe their access to oil-financed goodies \u2013 all gratitude and loyalty must be focused on Ch\u00e1vez himself. The resulting cult of personality is neatly captured in that slogan. Ch\u00e1vez, we're told, is no mere politician: he is the \"heart of my fatherland\" \u2013 with that possessive pronoun to cement each voter's twin loyalties to the nation and its leader. It's only the tiniest step from that formulation to its flip-side: failure to support the leader is <a href=\"http://www.hrw.org/news/2012/07/17/venezuela-concentration-and-abuse-power-under-ch-vez\" title=\"\">tantamount to treason</a>.</p> <p>It has taken Venezuela's long-suffering opposition movement 14 years to decode Ch\u00e1vez's intoxicating appeal and formulate a compelling alternative. This year the opposition has finally united and rallied around <a href=\"http://hayuncamino.com/\" title=\"\">Henrique Capriles</a>, an energetic young state governor who has put pragmatism and problem solving at the centre of his campaign. Capriles can't match Ch\u00e1vez for charisma, and doesn't try to. But after 14 years of deepening economic dysfunction, administrative chaos and dependence on oil, he has sensed an opening for a no-nonsense campaign centred on institutionalising the revolution's social advances while sweeping away its legacy of political sectarianism, ideological rigidity and mismanagement. \"Never again should you have to show a Socialist party membership card to access a social programme,\" Capriles says in his stump speech, invariably bringing the house down. The line hits home because every person in the audience knows someone who has been shut out of access to the latest oil bonanza for ideological deviance.</p> <p>Capriles senses there's a thirst in Venezuela to move beyond the divisive politics of the Ch\u00e1vez personality cult; that for more and more one-time Chavistas the old visceral pull of the <em>caudillo's</em> charisma has worn thin in the face of a mass of unsolved problems; that Venezuelans crave the type of minimally competent government they've not had for years; and that they're ready to take a chance on change.</p>",
  "<p></p> <h2><a name=\"economy\">Economy</a></h2> <p><strong>It's the economy, stupid \u2013 or is it? You have to go back more than 70 years to find a president who retained his job when so many of his compatriots lost theirs. Economic gloom made short work of Jimmy Carter and George Bush Sr. But Barack Obama's record is not all bad \u2013 and that might be good enough to save him, says Larry Elliott</strong></p> <p>Barack Obama should be toast. Under his stewardship, the US economy has suffered its feeblest economic recovery since the second world war. Living standards for the average American have fallen since he arrived at the White House almost four years ago.</p> <p>Despite his rallying call to the struggling and the dispossessed in 2008, poverty is rising and the gap between rich and poor has grown. History shows that the last incumbent president to win an election with the unemployment rate above 8% was Franklin D Roosevelt.</p> <p>If the race for White House is about the economy \u2013 and American voters routinely say it is \u2013 Mitt Romney would be winning the election by a country mile and Obama contemplating joining George Bush Sr and Jimmy Carter as one-term presidents of the modern era.</p> <p>Polling by the Pew Research Centre shows that only 41% of Americans say their own personal financial situation is excellent or good, while consumer confidence is lower than it was when Gerald Ford lost to Carter in 1976 and when Carter was turfed out by Ronald Reagan four years later. The last time Americans felt this gloomy was in 1992, and Bill Clinton won.</p> <p>The fact that real median incomes, a benchmark of how well the middle classes are doing, have dropped by 4.7% since Obama became president has allowed Romney to ask the question so tellingly posed by Reagan against Carter: \"Are you better off than you were four years ago?\"</p> <p>If the well-off in the US were asked that question, the answer would be yes. The top 5% of earners, those making $186,000 (\u00a3115,000) or more, took 22.3% of national income in 2011, up from 21.3% in 2010.</p> <p>Income inequality, as measured by the Gini coefficient, is greater than it has been since records began in 1975, making the US the fourth most unequal country in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development after Chile, Mexico and Turkey. All this has got the pollsters scratching their heads.</p> <p>Bruce Stokes, fellow of the Pew Institute, said: \"Back in the spring, my assumption was that if unemployment remained above 8%, the president was going to lose. It has remained above 8% but despite that the president retains a great deal of public support, and that has grown in the last month.\"</p> <p>Obama has been helped in recent weeks by some tentative signs that the economy is on the mend. The recession in the real estate market \u2013 the worst the US has ever endured \u2013 appears to be at an end, with housing starts, home sales and property prices all on the rise.</p> <p>Ben Bernanke, chairman of the Federal Reserve, has lifted share prices on Wall Street by announcing that the US central bank will continue to use monetary stimulus until there is clear evidence of sustained growth. An easing of the eurozone crisis has calmed fears that the economy might plunge off a cliff in the runup to election day.</p> <p>There is, though, perhaps more to it than that. Analysts at Capital Economics say that the darkest days for the US economy were in the months between Obama's election victory in November 2008 and his inauguration in early 2009 and that the economy is in much better shape now than it was then.</p> <p>\"At the end of 2008, GDP was falling at an annualised rate of 9%, over 700,000 jobs were being lost every month and the banking system was in meltdown,\" Capital Economics said.</p> <p>Polls show that many voters still blame Bush and the Republicans for the current weakness in the economy, while at the same time giving Obama credit for rescuing the US car industry when it was faced with bankruptcy.</p> <p>Even this, however, does not appear to be the whole story, as voters in the swing states appear to be planning to vote for Obama while at the same time believing that Romney would be just as good, if not better, at handling the economy.</p> <p>According to Stokes, the explanation may be that Obama is well ahead when it comes to other issues, such as healthcare and national security, and is also seen as a more likable candidate.</p> <p>Romney's only hope in the remaining weeks of the campaign is to make Obama's handling of the economy the key election issue. If he fails to do so, Obama looks likely to be re-elected.</p> <p></p> <h2><a name=\"Health\">Health</a></h2> <p><strong>Obama's healthcare reform was arguably the biggest domestic achievement of his presidency, requiring Americans to buy health insurance and making sure people with pre-existing conditions got insurance. Republicans denounced the act as unaffordable, a violation of individual freedom. Romney pledged to repeal the care act in its entirety but now says there are a things he would keep \u2013 including allowing young adults to stay on parental policies until they are 25. In a trip to the US, the Guardian's health editor, Sarah Boseley, found plenty of beneficiaries of the Obama reforms</strong></p> <p>Dawn Josephson, who lives in Jacksonville, Florida, fell foul of an insurance trap. In 2008 her son, Wesley, then two, woke up one morning with just the white of one eye showing and the iris of the other hardly visible. It was sudden-onset strabismus, caused by lack of co-ordination between eye muscles and the brain. His eyes were no longer focusing on the same point.</p> <p>They were paying $800 (\u00a3495) a month for health insurance for their family of four, with an excess of $1,500, and they were liable for 20% of their costs after that.</p> <p>Wesley had a surgical procedure costing about $8,000, although there was no overnight stay. With lab tests, the bills probably came to $12,000.</p> <p>\"About two months later, we got a nice little note from our insurance company saying, 'we are now terminating this policy and we have nothing else to offer you',\" she said. \"My husband and I are self-employed, so we have to get our own policy. We found another for about the same rate, but because Wesley had this pre-existing condition, anything relating to the eye was not covered. We were still going to the doctor every two months, paying anything from $600 to $1,000 for doctors' bills.\"</p> <p>The local Nemours children's hospital offered a payment scheme, so they ran up bills and paid a small monthly amount towards them.</p> <p>\"Around April 2010, we said, 'we can't do this any more, there has got to be an alternative',\" she said.</p> <p>An insurance agent found the family a cheaper policy, which at least saved them money for Wesley's bills.</p> <p>When Josephson called the insurance company to check on the policy, she was told everyone was covered, including Wesley. Josephson could not believe what she was hearing.</p> <p>\"For a split second I thought they made a mistake \u2013 just shut up and take the policy,\" she said. \"Then she said to me, 'we are no longer excluding pre-existing conditions for children'.\"</p> <p>On 23 March, Obama had signed the affordable care act into law. Wesley Josephson had just become one of the first beneficiaries.</p> <p></p> <h2><a name=\"foreign\">Foreign policy</a></h2> <p><strong>Foreign policy did not figure much in the campaign, until the killing of the US ambassador to Libya this month. Since then the gloves have come off, writes Julian Borger, the Guardian's diplomatic editor</strong></p> <p>Mitt Romney said very little about foreign affairs on the stump but he seized on the attack on the US consulate in Benghazi as an emblem of America's place in the world under Obama. He claimed that the US response to the wave of attacks on American diplomatic mission had been to apologise for the amateur video that had triggered them.</p> <p>It turned out he has his timings wrong and that a statement by the US embassy in Cairo condemning the video for its cynical portrayal of the prophet Muhammad had preceded the attacks.</p> <p>But the Romney campaign pressed on with the theme, seeking to cast the administration as apologising for American values abroad.</p> <p>The president appeared to slip in a television interview aired in which he described the riots as \"bumps in the road\" on the way to a functioning democracy.</p> <p>Romney responded quickly saying: \"These are not bumps in the road, these are human lives.\"</p> <p>The theme resonated because of popular perceptions of what was widely seen as ingratitude among the new north African democracies for American support for the Arab spring.</p> <p>The Republican vice-presidential nominee, Paul Ryan, claimed this week that the riots over the anti-Muslim video were a demonstration of how the Obama foreign policy was \"blowing up in our faces\".</p> <p>Ryan compared the scenes from north Africa to the 1979 Iranian revolution, implying a comparison between Obama and the Democratic president at the time, Jimmy Carter, the personification among American conservatives of weak, unpatriotic, leadership.</p> <p>Obama has sought to counter that narrative with his emphatic celebration of those values in this week's speech to the UN general assembly.</p> <p>On the bigger picture, that is some polling evidence that Obama has the edge.</p> <p>A new YouGov poll, seen by the Guardian, shows that, while a large majority of Republicans see their country locked in a zero-sum struggle with Islam, Americans as a whole rejects that view by 47% to 39%. Almost half those polled believe \"it is possible for the west and Muslims to coexist in peace\".</p> <p>Obama's UN speech mentioned in passing what the White House believes are its principal achievements abroad \u2013 the killing of Osama bin Laden, the withdrawal from Iraq, and the planned pullout from Afghanistan.</p> <p>The first aspect inoculates Obama from Republican attacks for lack of resolve over the other two. The slayer of America's enemy number one cannot easily be accused of being weak on security. Moreover, there is no political advantage to be gained in a war-weary America by arguing that the White House is cutting and running from foreign conflicts.</p> <p></p> <h2><a name=\"immigration\">Immigration</a></h2> <p><strong>Immigration reform is one of the top issues for Latino voters. Most of the estimated 11 million illegal immigrants in the US are Latino. Obama won their overwhelming support in 2008, and polls show he should repeat this in November. Although he failed to deliver on his promise to introduce immigration reform, he has taken action, bypassing Congress, to give the children of some illegal immigrants relief from the threat of arrest. He has also promised reform in a second term. But as Ewen MacAskill and Ed Pilkington report, there is still a long way to go to prevent immigrants from falling foul of individual states taking matters into their own hands</strong></p> <p>Latinos living without immigration papers in Arizona have begun bombarding helplines and lawyers' offices with requests about how to provide for their children should they be arrested under the controversial new police power that came into effect last week.</p> <p>A phoneline hosted by the Arizona branch of the American Civil Liberties Union received almost 4,000 calls in two days, many from anxious parents who fear their children could be left abandoned should they be picked up under the \"show-me-your-papers\" provision.</p> <p>Hundreds have been asking for help setting up a power of attorney, which gives a relative or friend who has US citizenship the right to care for minors in such an eventuality.</p> <p>\"People are terrified. They fear that they will go to the store to buy groceries and won't get home, and their kids will be left alone at school,\" said Luz Santiago, a pastor in Mesa. She said she had personally handled about 50 requests for power of attorney so far.</p> <p>The \"show-me-your-papers\" clause is the most deeply contested of the provisions of SB 1070, an Arizona law passed in 2010 that has set the benchmark for a wave of hardline immigration laws clamping down on undocumented families in several states.</p> <p>Under its terms, police are required to investigate the immigration status of anyone they come across during their normal work and whom they suspect of being unauthorised.</p> <p>The law was snarled up in legal challenges that went up to the US supreme court. In June, the court struck down several elements of the legislation but allowed the clause to go ahead pending local Arizona court approval.</p> <p>That approval was granted this week and the provision is now in effect.</p> <p>Residents of Phoenix, the capital of Arizona, are braced for the rule change, having witnessed the impact of heavy-handed policing for years under Joe Arpaio, who calls himself \"America's toughest sheriff\".</p> <p>Groups working with undocumented Hispanics are more concerned about other smaller towns, such as Flagstaff and Prescott, which have large Latino populations but no experience of police officers acting as immigration agents.</p> <p>Tucson, Arizona's second-largest city, is calling a forum next Tuesday in which community leaders will meet the police chief, Roberto Villasenor, to discuss the implementation of the clause.</p> <p>Regina Romero, who sits on the city council and convened the meeting, said the clear fear was that police would be drawn into racial profiling. \"We live 45 minutes from the Mexican border, so who else other than Mexicans are you going to be picking up? You are not going to be looking for Canadians in this part of the country,\" she said.</p> <p>Alessandra Soler, head of the ACLU in Arizona, said that there was already evidence that Tucson police were making contact inappropriately with US border patrol officers even for such mundane issues as help with translation.</p> <p>\"It's extremely problematic when you have local police contacting border patrol when there is no good reason.\"</p> <p>The ACLU and other groups have an outstanding civil rights action against SB 1070 still lodged with the state's appeal court. That legal attempt to put a stop to \"show me your papers\" will continue to pass through the courts, and the intention of opponents of the provision is to beef it up with real examples of racial profiling.</p> <p>Lydia Guzman, director of the hotline, said the aim now was to chronicle the impact of the law. \"The supreme court has given us the green light to present to the courts victims of racial profiling, so that's our challenge: show me the victims.\"</p> <p></p> <h2><a name=\"gender\">The gender gap</a></h2> <p><strong>Polls show women could be a crucial issue for the Democrats, with Romney lagging 20 points behind Obama with women voters, writes Karen McVeigh</strong></p> <p>Democrats tend to do better among women voters than Republicans, but even allowing for historical precedent, Romney is performing terribly with a demographic group whose votes can be decisive in swing states.</p> <p>The latest polls suggest that the gender gap this year could hit historic levels, with Romney trailing Obama by some 20 points among women nationally, and even more in some key battlegrounds.</p> <p>There are many policy related reasons behind the antipathy towards the Republicans among female voters. Women are more likely consider healthcare and social issues as important to their voting choice.</p> <p>But Romney has said that if elected he will repeal Obama's Affordable Healthcare Act, and social issues have persistently intruded on his campaign's attempts to focus on the economy.</p> <p>One of the defining Democrat attacks on the Republican candidate and his party has been over its \"war on women\", for policies on equal pay, domestic abuse, abortion and contraception.</p> <p>The drive by Republican lawmakers to cut funding for Planned Parenthood, the nation's largest provider of cancer screening to women with low incomes, has alienated some female voters, as have attempts to restrict access to abortion.</p> <p>Romney has flipped his position on abortion, running as pro-choice in Massachusetts, before changing it to anti-choice when running for presidency in 2008.</p> <p>By picking Paul Ryan, one of the most staunch anti-abortion conservatives as running mate, Romney has alienated moderates. That tension was further exposed in August amid the furore over the \"legitimate rape\" comments of Senate candidate Todd Akin.</p> <p></p> <h2><a name=\"funding\">Campaign finance</a></h2> <p><strong>Court rulings have given corporations and the super-rich a greater role in the elections than ever, writes Ed Pilkington</strong></p> <p>Super Pacs sound like a new child's toy. In fact, these new entities, arising from two court rulings, form the single most important innovation of the 2012 election cycle and are pumping a torrent of private and corporate money into the race.</p> <p>Formed in the wake of two controversial court rulings in 2010, Citizens United v FEC and Speechnow.org v FEC, Super Pacs \u2013 based on the traditional political action committees but able to engage in unlimited political spending outside campaigns \u2013 allow corporations, for the first time in more than 40 years, to use their financial muscle to influence an election.</p> <p>Super Pacs cannot directly fund candidates but they can support them with their own message.</p> <p>Collectively, Super Pacs have already spent $270m this year. The Republicans have the edge on spending, with billionaire donors such as Sheldon Adelson and Bob Perry wading in with tens of millions of dollars. The Republican Super Pac effort is being closely co-ordinated by George Bush's former svengali, Karl Rove.</p> <p>Obama has a Super Pac that supports his candidacy, Priorities USA, but it has raised $43m to the $97m raised by Restore Our Future, the Super Pac which backs Romney.</p>",
  "<p>During the US election, American voters are the most heavily polled in the world, with hardly a day passing this year without a new survey. They almost all pointed to the same conclusion: the 2012 White House race was nip and tuck. At least until now.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/26/romney-campaign-polls-obama-ohio\" title=\"\">latest polls show Barack Obama opening up big leads in the swing states</a>. With these most important battlegrounds tilting heavily against him, the Republican challenger, Mitt Romney, faces an uphill struggle to find a path through the electoral college system to the White House.</p> <p>Obama started the race with an advantage. Look at the electoral college map of the US and you see swaths of Republican red but most of these Republican states have relatively small populations, each delivering only a few electoral college votes.</p> <p>By contrast, Obama starts with many of the most heavily populated states in the bag: New York, California and Illinois were always going to vote Democratic.</p> <p>Add together all the solid Democratic states and those likely to vote Democratic and Obama starts the election with 237 electoral college votes, just 33 short of the magic victory number.</p> <p>For Romney, the route to the White House is tougher. Even with staunch support in the south and midwest, he started the race with only 191 in the bag.</p> <p>So the race comes down to eight swing states: Florida (29 electoral college votes), North Carolina (15), Virginia (13), New Hampshire (4), Ohio (18), Iowa (6), Colorado (9) and Nevada (6). The bad news for Romney is that as things stand, these offer Obama various routes to the White House.</p> <p>The widely respected political scientist Larry Sabato <a href=\"http://www.centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/\" title=\"\">shifted several swing states</a> that had been toss-ups over to Obamaon Thursday, pushing him well over the magic 270 electoral college votes needed to win.</p> <p>Sabato, a Virginia University politics professor, said he was not calling the race because there were still three presidential debates to come, and an international crisis or poor economic numbers could still change everything. \"So caution is always in order with almost six weeks to go, yet President Obama clearly leads at the moment,\" he said.</p> <p>If Obama was to take Florida, where the polls currently put him ahead, he would only need one other small state \u2013 even as small as New Hampshire or Iowa \u2013 to remain president. According to the latest state polls, Obama also enjoys a considerable lead in Ohio, a state which no Republican has lost and gone on to win the White House. If Obama wins both there and Florida, there is no way Romney can come back even if he won all six remaining battlegrounds.</p> <p>With six weeks to go everything could still theoretically change. Other presidential candidates have been trailing in polls before and gone on to win. Ronald Reagan was behind Jimmy Carter in September 1980 but went on to take the lead in October and eventually win easily in November.</p> <p>So if Romney won Florida \u2013 which is not inconceivable \u2013 the calculations would begin to look different. North Carolina should also be natural Republican territory. With those two, Romney would be on 235 to Obama's 237 and nervousness would begin to seep into Democratic ranks. Virginia, too, is traditionally Republican territory. Obama's win in the state in 2008 was a surprise and pundits predicted he would find it hard to hang on to.</p> <p>Although he was raised in Michigan, Romney's home state is Massachusetts and he has high hopes of taking neighbouring New Hampshire.</p> <p>Obama losing all the east coast swing states is a theoretical possibility. At that point, Democrats watching the results coming in at Obama headquarters in Chicago would be nervously waiting for Ohio, Iowa, Colorado and Nevada.</p> <p>But Sabato thinks such a scenario is unlikely. Virginia and North Carolina, according to his calculations, are no longer in contention. Only Florida and New Hampshire on the east coast and Colorado in the west, a total of 42 votes, are still in play.</p> <p>\"Provided Romney wins the three toss-ups, he will then need to pry another 22 electoral votes from Obama. And that will be difficult,\" Sabato said.</p>",
  "<p>You could call it the clash of the titans, though scrap between a community organiser and management consultant might be more accurate. Next Wednesday, Barack Obama and Mitt Romney face off in the first of three televised debates that could seal not only their personal fates, but also determine the future direction of the world's most powerful nation.</p> <p>For Obama, the encounter will be a chance to solidify the creeping lead he has gained over his rival during the past few weeks. He will aim finally to blow away the pall of doubt that has hung over his White House from the start: is he a one-term loser, a black Jimmy Carter? Or is he a titan, a two-term conqueror in the mould of Bill Clinton?</p> <p>For Romney, the stakes are if anything even higher. The 60 minutes of verbal combat in Denver, Colorado, may be his last chance to rescue a campaign that is certainly floundering and at times has looked close to disintegration.</p> <p>\"Romney comes into the debates needing some luck, needing Obama to make a mistake, needing to win the first debate,\" said Steve Schmidt, a prominent Republican strategist who, as John McCain's campaign chief in 2008, knows all about the pitfalls of a presidential run. \"He's on the edge of losing control over his own destiny.\"</p> <p>That the two men enter the final stretch of the 2012 presidential marathon with the election Obama's to lose and Romney's yet to win is not how it should have been. No sitting president since Franklin Roosevelt has won re-election with unemployment above 7.2%, and with today's jobless rate of 8.1% Obama should be the one with rope burns on his back.</p> <p>But in this election cycle we are watching conventional wisdom and historical precedent turned on their heads. The <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2012/president/us/general_election_romney_vs_obama-1171.html\" title=\"\">Real Clear Politics tracker poll of polls</a> has Obama four points ahead on 49% to Romney's 45%. More significantly, Obama has begun to pull away from Romney beyond the margin of error in the swing states that matter most.</p> <p>Recent polls show him in front in the seven states \u2013 Colorado, Florida, Iowa, Nevada, Ohio, Virginia and Wisconsin \u2013 that are most likely to determine November's outcome .</p> <p>Of those, Florida and Ohio represent, as they so often do, the golden fleece of this year's presidential election. Without their combined 47 electoral votes, Romney will almost certainly fail to put together the 270 needed to win.</p> <p>A <a href=\"http://www.quinnipiac.edu/institutes-and-centers/polling-institute/presidential-swing-states-%28fl-oh-and-pa%29/release-detail?ReleaseID=1800\" title=\"\">new survey from the Quinnipiac University Polling Institute</a> gives Obama a 53%-to-44% lead over Romney in Florida and a similar 53%-to-43% advantage in Ohio. \"Romney is falling further behind and he's only got a few weeks left to make up ground,\" said Quinnipiac's analyst, Peter Brown.</p> <p>So how did we get to this point, where an election that for months has been too close to call has begun moving in Obama's direction? Not, it has to be said, with any of the soaring rhetoric and appeals to what's good in the American soul that distinguished Obama's first run for the highest office in 2008.</p> <p>At this point in 2008, millions of Americans were queuing around the block to enlist in the Obama army, brandishing their rising suns and chanting \"Yes we can!\" It was a time of great peril \u2013 Wall Street had just imploded \u2013 but also of great expectation that the coming presidential election would herald a new era.</p> <p>Four years later, the country is approaching its moment of truth in a starkly different frame of mind. Where 2008 felt as though the American giant was reawakening, this year we find it nursing its wounds in a gloomy cave. The mood of the electorate, made weary by the search for work or the fear of losing jobs, is as sour as it was euphoric back then.</p> <p>Take a look at the <a href=\"https://store.barackobama.com/? source=\" om2012_dd_g_store-search_general-store_||mkwid\"| gqimvs7s|kw|barack%20obama%20store|matchtype|p|pcrid| 13688195643|pl||&amp;gclid=\"CL-v0_bp1bICFcZlOgodznAA8A\" \" title=\"\">official store on the Obama for America website</a>. The merchandise on offer is uniformly corporate: there are badges for sale featuring the Obamas' dog, Bo (\"I Bark for Barack\"), silver Michelle brooches and a $95 Yigal Azrou\u00ebl scarf marked \"Made in the USA\". Gone is the exhilarating underground edginess of the 2008 campaign. Gone too is the single word that defined it: Hope.</p> <p>In its place we have an election that matches the current disposition of the electorate: restless, dissatisfied, grouchy. In Ohio, voters may be starting to fall in behind Obama, but they remain an angry crowd, disillusioned by politics and scathing of both presidential candidates. As one voter, Larry Bushnell in northern Ohio, put it to the Guardian: \"I think they both suck, honestly. They'll lie to get your vote.\"</p> <p>With 39 days to go, that crankiness will continue to be the dominant chord of this election. Over the next five weeks we will hear the candidates and their backers trade yet more insults, see an avalanche of negative TV adverts bear down upon already cheesed-off voters, listen to the endless was-it-a-gaffe/wasn't-it-a-gaffe commentary of the 24-hour news channels. It will be brutal, and it will be ugly.</p> <p>But it will be vital. Obama was right when <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/2012/09/06/160713941/ transcript-president-obamas-convention-speech\" title=\"\">he said in his nomination speech</a> in North Carolina earlier this month that Americans face \"the clearest choice of any time in a generation\".</p> <p>In Obama's blue corner of the ring, we have his bloodied but as yet unbowed vision of a collective future for America, in which government has a role to play in regulating the excesses of corporations, alleviating poverty and encouraging innovation.</p> <p>Putting a spin on JFK's famous invocation \"ask not what your country can do for you\", Obama crystallised his position at the Democratic National Convention by saying: \"As citizens, we understand that America is not about what can be done for us, it's about what can be done by us, together.\"</p> <p>In the red corner of the ring, there is the paradox of the Romney campaign. The former governor of Massachusetts has flip-flopped on an almost metronomic basis, to the extent that it is virtually impossible to clearly define his political convictions.</p> <p>All that can be said with certainty is that he goes to the ballot in November on a ticket that is dramatically to the right of George Bush and even to the right of John McCain, who had his own flip-flopping issues. In fact, much of the Romney position conforms to the extreme fiscal conservatism of the Tea Party.</p> <p>His promises to rein back government, to cut taxes, including for the very rich, to stage another bonfire of regulations of the sort that put America in the hole from which it is still trying to emerge, to repeal Obama's healthcare reforms that will extend medical insurance to many of the 47 million uninsured \u2013 all these are classic Tea Party policies. Even his vice-presidential running mate, Paul Ryan, is steeped in the anti-government ideology of the movement.</p> <p>That's one way to parse the importance of 6 November: can Obama stop the Tea Party taking possession of the White House? Another way of articulating the vital, almost existential, urgency of this election is that nothing less than the wellbeing of America's democracy is at stake.</p> <p>If that sounds melodramatic, consider this: Romney's outside fundraising body or \"Super Pac\", called Restore Our Future, has no fewer than 25 billionaires on its list of donors. Sheldon Adelson, a Las Vegas casino magnate, has alone injected almost $40m into this election cycle in favour of Republican candidates and may approach $100m before it's done. Emboldened by the two court rulings in 2010 (<em>Citizens United v Federal Election Commission</em> and <em>Speechnow.org v Federal Election Commission</em>) that removed any barriers from the investment of corporate, union or private money into elections, Adelson and other mega-wealthy donors will have pumped in close to $500m come November. That in turn will bring the total cost of putting one man into the White House to a dizzying total of $2.5bn.</p> <p>\"Wealthy donors are injecting money into the electoral process at a level we have never seen before,\" said Bob Biersack, who tracks the influence of cash in politics at the Centre for Responsive Politics. \"The danger is that this will swing the balance of power, effectively disenfranchising the majority of Americans.\"</p> <p>It is another measure of how Obama is bucking the trend this year that this vast mobilisation of billionaires' funds has so far failed to have the impact they desired. The blitzkrieg of TV advertising that their money has afforded, portraying Obama as a European socialist intent on burying the American dream under a pile of government bureaucracy, has not yet turned the voter against the president. With less than six weeks to go to election day, it seems the American people cannot be bought as easily as Adelson and his peers assume.</p> <p>Obama has fought off the march of Big Money partly by transmitting a positive message to voters of who he is and where he stands. His convention was a master-class in political communications, replete with a lecture from the master himself, Bill Clinton. With his help, Obama made the case that the continuing hardship felt by many Americans was not a reflection of his own failed policies, as the Republicans contest, but rather a sign that he needs more time to get the job finished. \"It will take more than a few years for us to solve challenges that have built up over decades,\" he said.</p> <p>The 2012 election was always going to be about the economy, and it remains Obama's most vulnerable point. But in this crucial area the Obama re-election campaign has coolly refused to be cowed by the Republican assault and calmly turned the argument back against them: the economic meltdown happened on the Republicans' watch; Romney opposed the bailout of the car manufacturers; though the economy still falters, the stock exchange is robust; and house prices are beginning to recover.</p> <p>Those arguments have played well in battlegrounds like Ohio, where Obama's role in having saved the auto industry resonates among its thousands of car parts and distribution outlets. The state has a jobless rate of 7.2%, notably below the national average.</p> <p>Across the country, the anxious electorate appear to have been listening. This week's Quinnipiac poll records that for the first time since it began following the Obama-Romney race, the president has come out on top on the economy. Some 51% of likely voters said that Obama would do a better job on the economy to Romney's 46%.</p> <p>Obama has also delivered a positive message on his healthcare reforms. While committed Republican voters continue to see \"Obamacare\" as a socialist Trojan horse, for many middle-of-the-road Americans, worried about losing their jobs and hence their health insurance, the promise of affordable medical cover for all sounds increasingly attractive.</p> <p>On foreign policy, too, Obama has rammed home the incumbent's advantage. At the Democratic convention he was profuse in his praise of the military, rebutting Romney's jibes that he was an apologist for his country by donning the uniform of the commander in chief.</p> <p>References to the president's overwhelming foreign affairs achievement were kept to a minimum, but who needs quantity when you have the quality of John Kerry's TV-friendly jingle: \"Ask Osama bin Laden if he's better off now than he was four years ago.\"</p> <p>But these positive messages are only a small part of the ruthless effectiveness of the Obama re-election machine. Campaign strategist David Axelrod and his Chicago-based spin wizards have primarily gone negative, weaving a straitjacket for Romney that has constricted his every move.</p> <p>While Romney and his conservative rivals were slugging it out with each other for the Republican nomination, the Obama team were quietly working behind the scenes to define Romney's biography. In a series of attack ads aired remorselessly in the swing states, they painted him as a rich kid born with a silver spoon in his mouth who had no affinity with the daily trials of the middle classes, destroyed ordinary people's lives as head of Bain Capital, and was so arrogant that he wouldn't declare his taxes.</p> <p>Quinnipiac's Peter Brown, who as a polling analyst sides with neither of the two main parties, says he has never witnessed such a successful character assassination in a presidential race. \"They have turned Romney into a wealthy, out-of-touch elitist, who is just not someone the average voter wants to have a beer with.\"</p> <p>Republican strategist Steve Schmidt believes the rot set in earlier this year when the Romney campaign made the mistake of conserving its war chest rather than investing it aggressively in a counter-offensive. Inexplicably, in his view, the Republican candidate was unprepared for the onslaught; he was caught off guard by the furore over his tax returns and was ill-equipped to defend himself on Bain Capital \u2013 a bizarre weakness given that Romney's record at the firm has been a political thorn in his side right back to his 1994 duel with Ted Kennedy for a US senate seat.</p> <p>In Schmidt's opinion, Romney made the basic error of seeing the election as a referendum on Obama's four years in office and not as a choice between two conflicting political visions: \"The Romney campaign was premised on the notion that Obama could not be re-elected with unemployment as high as it was and pessimism running in the country as high as it was. All that Mitt Romney had to do was to hold steady and the electorate would come to him.\"</p> <p>It didn't. Since the start of the presidential election proper this month, Romney's malaise has only deepened. Everything he has done since, according to Schmidt, \"has been the opposite of what he needed to do to get over the plausibility bar, so that people look at him and see him as a commander-in-chief.\"</p> <p>First he forgot to mention Afghanistan and returning war heroes in his convention speech \u2013 an astonishing error from the party that claims to own national security. Then he made hasty remarks about the death of the US ambassador in Libya.</p> <p>And to cap it all, there was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/18/romney-secret-video-government-dependent\" title=\"\">the \"47 per cent\" gaffe.</a> In remarks made before donors paying $50,000 per plate, he essentially accused almost half the nation of being lazy no-hopers suffering from a victim complex and languishing in the pocket of the president.</p> <p>Given that litany of horrors, Romney faces huge difficulties as he goes into Wednesday night. This race is not over: there is time yet for an upset. But the challenger from Massachusetts must access hidden strengths if he is to appear on 7&#xa0;November looking like a titan and not a mouse.</p>",
  "<p>The fragile state of the US's economic recovery was thrown into focus once more Thursday as the government announced growth was slowing and orders for long-lasting goods plunged in August, the latest sign of a weakening manufacturing sector.</p> <p>US gross domestic product (GDP) \u2013 the broadest measure of the economy \u2013 grew at an annual rate of 1.3% between April and June, the commerce department said Thursday. The figure was revised down from a previously reported 1.7% gain.</p> <p>Meanwhile the commerce department said durable goods orders fell 13.2% last month, the largest fall since January 2009. The measure of orders for goods designed to last three months or more is a key indicator of economic growth. </p> <p>The decrease followed three consecutive monthly increases including a 3.3% rise in July. August's figure was a seasonally adjusted $198.49bn, the lowest dollar figure since February 2011, and far below most economists predictions.</p> <p>The collapse was driven in large part by by declining transportation orders, particularly for aircraft. Transportation equipment orders fell 34.9% following four consecutive monthly increases. Orders for civilian aircraft plunged. Boeing received 260 orders in July and just one in August. Australia's Qantas airline cancelled an $8.5bn order with Boeing in August, triggering a net decline in new orders for the month. Motor-vehicle and parts orders dropped 10.9%. Outside of transportation, August orders slid 1.6%.</p> <p>But not all the news was bad. Non-defence capital goods orders excluding aircraft, a closely watched barometer of business spending plans, rose 1.1% after falling for the previous two months. The increase was above economists' expectations for 0.5% gain.</p> <p>Paul Dales, senior economist at Capital Economics, said the aircraft figures had skewed the latest figures but they still showed the fundamental weakness of the US's recovery.</p> <p>\"It's not as nasty as it looks but it's still quite dire,\" he said. \"There is a downward trend, whether businesses are worried about the global outlook or US fiscal issues isn't clear but there is clearly some concern,\" he said.</p> <p>Dan Greenhaus, chief global strategist at BTIG, said: \"Yes 1.3% growth is worse than 1.7% but the larger story is that growth in the second quarter was really bad.\" He said cuts in government spending were a major drag on the economy but it was also clear that consumers and businesses were also becoming more cautious.</p> <p>The figures came as the latest weekly number for people claiming unemployment insurance for the first time fell sharply. Some 359,000 people filed for jobless benefits for the first time in the week ending last Saturday, down 26,000 from the previous week, the labor department said.</p> <p>The number is close to the 350,000 economists see as a benchmark for recovery in the jobs market. The less volatile four-week average was 374,000, down 4,500 from the previous week. Next week the monthly nonfarm payroll report will give a wider snapshot of the US jobs market. The closely watched indicator has become a monthly flashpoint in the 2012 election.</p> <p>The latest economic figures present arguments for both sides with the presidential election just weeks away.</p> <p>In his latest TV ads President Barack Obama claims the economy is \"moving forward again\", after reminding viewers of the depth of the economic crisis the country faced when he took office.</p> <p>\"It's time for a new economic patriotism, rooted in the belief that growing our economy begins with a strong, thriving middle class,\" says Obama. \"Read my plan. Compare it to Governor Romney's and decide for yourself.\"</p> <p>Romney and his vice-presidential pick Paul Ryan have stepped up their attacks on the president. In an interview with 60 Minutes last Sunday Romney said a vote for Obama was a vote for continued economic woes and higher deficits.</p>",
  "<p>So Silvio Berlusconi says that Germany is <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/09/25/us-berlusconi-germany-idUSBRE88O0K020120925\" title=\"\">\"a hegemonial state that \u2026 dictated to the other European countries the rules of rigour and austerity\"</a>. Big surprise. The guy is planning a comeback, and Germany-bashing always goes down well in Italy.</p> <p>Remember when <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/jul/02/italy.eu\" title=\"\">Berlusconi assumed the presidency of the EU in 2003</a>? He used his first appearance before the European parliament to attack the German MEP Martin Schulz, saying he would recommend Schulz for the role of a Nazi concentration camp commander in an upcoming second world war film. A week later, Berlusconi's secretary of state for tourism criticised the \"uniform supernationalistic blondes\" \u2013 German tourists \u2013 who \"loudly invade\" Italy's beaches every summer.</p> <p>The background to that round of anti-Teutonic fervour was also internal Italian politics, namely Berlusconi's legal woes.</p> <p>The problem with <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/09/25/silvio-berlusconi-mario-monti-lhuffington-post_n_1910534.html\" title=\"\">Berlusconi's latest outburst</a> is that \u2013 and I never thought I'd say this \u2013 he is in part right. Not about Germany's hegemony. We'll get to that. But when he says that it is an illusion to think \"that austerity leads to debt reduction\", Berlusconi has a point, as he does when saying that \"public debt diminishes when GDP increases, which means development and growth\". And he is also right to criticise his successor, Mario Monti, for caving in on labour market reform, which would be key to increasing Italy's competitiveness.</p> <p>But what about this German \"diktat\"? Is Germany dictating austerity policies to other countries? Are national budgets now decided in Berlin? I might have been inclined to agree with Berlusconi before the French presidential election, the European summit of 28 June and <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-19499950\" title=\"\">Mario Draghi's announcement that the European Central Bank is ready to buy unlimited amounts of eurozone government bonds</a>.</p> <p>At the June summit, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, Mario Monti and Spain's Mariano Rajoy faced down Angela Merkel and got her to agree that next to structural budget cuts a big dollop of Keynesian stimulus is needed to get the eurozone moving again. Then came Draghi's \"bazooka\" and Germany's ratification of the European stability mechanism (ESM) with \u20ac700bn-worth of funds, \u20ac190bn courtesy of the German taxpayer.</p> <p>As a result, the management of the debt crisis and the \"economic governance\" of the eurozone are now off the hands of national governments \u2013 including the one in Berlin. They are in the hands of three unelected officials: the bosses of the ECB, the ESM and the European commission. The European parliament has been sidelined. As has the council.</p> <p>Draghi says that in order to qualify for the ECB's debt-buying programme, governments will have to apply for ESM aid and submit to the ESM's conditions. But since the June summit there is reason to suppose that the ESM will not impose very harsh conditions \u2013 why should they? The ECB, after all, is ready and waiting with its bazooka. The eurozone, in short, will try to inflate its way out of the crisis with Anglo-Saxon style \"quantitative easing\". So much for the German \"diktat\".</p> <p>Merkel has got the opposite of what she wanted: the euro is now on the path to becoming a soft currency, as the French always hoped it would be. The Maastricht treaty is dead. Inflation is the new eurobonds. This is how Germany is paying for its vast current account surplus.</p> <p>So, should Germany leave the euro, as <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/1e2f2cd0-064e-11e2-bd29-00144feabdc0,Authorised=false.html?_i_location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ft.com%2Fcms%2Fs%2F0%2F1e2f2cd0-064e-11e2-bd29-00144feabdc0.html&amp;_i_referer=http%3A%2F%2Ft.co%2FMasoN1Op#axzz27V8ZvTQy\" title=\"\">some commentators</a> in Britain and the US and German populists are suggesting? I can't help pointing out that Anglo-Saxon columnists just might be a weeny bit nationally biased, as a return to the deutschmark could price German exports out of the market. One of the nasty secrets about the euro is that the money German taxpayers fork out to keep the currency afloat is an export subsidy for German industry. Yet the idea that Germany leaving the eurozone would somehow benefit the southern Europeans is far-fetched, if not plain loony.</p> <p>The rump euro would devaluate as the deutschmark rose, making not only German goods but almost all imports unaffordable to consumers. Fearing further devaluation, investors would pull out of government bonds, causing governments to default. Germany, on the other hand, would do what it has always done: concentrate on quality that people are willing to pay for, rationalise production, keep wages low and so on. In other words, pursue the mercantilist policy that is part of the current problem, concentrating on northern and eastern Europe, China, and the US rather than the Mediterranean basket cases. After a couple of hard years, Germany would be back, leaner and meaner than before.</p> <p>Quite frankly, the new, soft euro \u2013 precisely because it makes German goods cheaper \u2013 is poison to that fabled German work ethic and innovative spirit. <em>Vorsprung durch</em> an undervalued currency? Not for very long.</p> <p>Historical reasons mean that Germany can't exit the euro, period. The common currency was, after all, the price Helmut Kohl paid to get Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand's backing for German unification. Mitterrand thought this would give France some control over the economic giant next door. For a while, it looked as though he had blundered. But now it's Kohl who's got egg on his face. If there's one European instinct you can count on, it's clubbing together to keep the Germans down.</p>"

I was in Atlanta, Georgia that day and I remember the line snaking right round the school where the polling station was set up; on and on it went. This year I truly didn't expect to see anything nearly as impressive, what with the mood of the country being so sour and the economy still so sluggish. But I've just seen one of the longest lines I've ever seen at the polling station in downtown Cleveland. It was so long it went round the block and around another block. I walked all the way along it and counted my steps \u2013 400 full paces of voters queuing up dutifully in the cold to cast their ballot. You'd have to be pretty cynical not to find that impressive.</p> <p>The line is 90% African American, I'd say, and every one of the people I spoke to were intending to vote for Barack Obama. This is Souls to the Polls day when black churches encourage their congregation from all over the city to come to the polling station and vote. I've come down here with a black church from the suburbs, God's Tabernacle of Faith. Pastor Thomas Eppinger finished his Sunday service, then piled his congregants into two vans and brought them to the polling station.</p> <p>It takes some determination on a cold day like this to join the very back of the queue. But that is what Barbara Dixon, 39, had just done when I spoke to her just now. She said she was happy to wait \"as long as it takes because I want to make sure this election is won by a president who has values that I care about\". She's got at least two hours to go before she gets to the voting booth, but really she didn't seem at all bothered.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-dd51ea76-1ff1-4d58-8dfd-c591cc8ca906\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/11/4/1352064233397/-460.jpeg\" alt=\"voters queue in Cleveland, Ohio\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">People in Cleveland, Ohio, waited in long queues to cast early votes.

Saturday night was bitterly cold in Bristow, Virginia, but that didn\u2019t stop thousands coming to a rally addressed by the two best orators their party has produced since Robert Kennedy. \u201cIt\u2019s once in a lifetime,\u201d Jennifer Rodriguez, a nurse who\u2019d made the journey from Richmond, told me.</p> <p>Of course Bill Clinton has to play the support act these days, but he does so with huge heart. He bounded on stage in brown leather bomber jacket, wrapped up far less warmly than his audience, and delivered what was largely a reprise of his Charlotte showstopper, when he wowed the Democratic convention with a masterclass in substantive rhetoric, patiently laying out the policy-based reasons why the American people should re-elect their president. His voice was so hoarse, you wondered if it would give out. But the crowd stayed with him, lapping up the unarguable simplicity of lines such as \u201c\u2019We\u2019re all in this together\u2019 is better than \u2018you\u2019re on your own.\u2019\u201d And he can still work a rally like the most seasoned Catskills comic. Of Mitt Romney\u2019s multiple positions on the auto-bailout, Clinton said: \"He\u2019s tied himself up in so many knots, he could be hired as the chief contortionist of Cirque du Soleil.\u201d</p> <p>There were two moments of almost imperceptible tension. One came early, when Clinton confessed himself \u201cmore excited\u201d about supporting Barack Obama \u201ceven than I was four years ago.\u201d It brought a fleeting reminder that in early 2008, Bill Clinton was devoting all his red-faced energy to dismissing the Obama candidacy as a \u201cfairytale.\u201d Later the former president spoke of the ailment known as Romnesia, the habit of forgetting the Republican\u2019s past record. I\u2019m pretty sure I heard him add, as an aside, that \u201cHis opponent may even have got a bit of it.\u201d That sounded like a reference to Obama himself, an apparent dig at the president\u2019s failure, especially in the first debate, to nail Romney\u2019s many contradictions.</p> <p>If that's what it was, few noticed it. Instead, the crowd cheered for Obama when he come on to high-five and hug his predecessor - and cheered louder as he delivered a strong, confident and, at times, stirring performance. He lavished praise on Clinton, saying his team \u201ccalls him the Secretary of Explaining Stuff\u201d. He added that \u201cthe only person working harder than he is is Hillary.\u201d</p> <p>When the speeches were over, the two men worked the ropeline together to the sound of Clinton\u2019s old anthem, Don\u2019t Stop Thinking About Tomorrow. Yesterday the Clintons were Obama\u2019s foes. Today they are two of his most useful friends.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-4904d4d3-5714-4a5d-998e-7e76eee714bb\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/11/4/1352038483183/f647848e-9104-48a6-b46d-7885295c6730-460.jpeg\" alt=\"Bill Clinton and Barack Obama in Virginia\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bill Clinton and Barack Obama at their joint appearance in Bristow, Virginia, on Saturday night.

The modest lead for Obama marks a shift from a week ago when the two were tied on 47% before Sandy. Among likely voters, 69% said they approved of Obama's handling of the storm.</p> <p>The findings are similar to a Wall Street Journal/NBC poll published at the weekend. The two offer the first firm evidence of the impact of Sandy on the election. Pew carries one caution for Obama, suggesting turnout may be lower than in 2008 and 2004, which could help Romney.</p> <p>The poll came as the president's top campaign advisers accused Romney of desperation on Sunday as they claimed the race was moving decisively in Obama's direction. Obama is enjoying a slight edge in polls from most of the crucial swing states that will decide the outcome.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398865406\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/maps_and_graphs/2012/11/4/1352071764127/Obamas-campaign-trail-001.jpg\" alt=\"Obama's campaign trail\" width=\"460\" height=\"322\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Obama's campaign trail.

The Obama team also cited visits Monday to Florida and Virginia, two states it said the Romney camp had claimed to have locked up.</p> <p>In an interview with ABC, David Plouffe, who organised Obama's re-election bid, expressed confidence the president will win on Tuesday, and seized on a comment by Karl Rove that Obama had benefited from superstorm Sandy. </p> <p>Democrats are interpreting this as Rove, George W Bush's former campaign strategist and co-founder of the Crossroads Super Pac that has poured millions of dollars into Romney's campaign and those of other Republicans, beginning to get his excuses in early.</p> <p>\"A few days ago he [Rove] predicted a big Romney win. My sense is Karl is going be at a crossroads himself on Tuesday when he tries to explain to the people who wrote him hundreds of millions of dollars why they fell up short,\" Plouffe said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398865407\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/maps_and_graphs/2012/11/4/1352071823787/Obamas-campaign-trail-001.jpg\" alt=\"Obama's campaign trail\" width=\"460\" height=\"322\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Obama's campaign trail.

They've tried to expand the map because they know in states like Ohio. They're behind and they're not catching up at this point.\" He added: \"They understand that the traditional, or the battleground, states that we've been focusing are not working out for them.\"</p> <p>A Washington Post/ABC poll had the two tied on 48% nationally while a Wall Street Journal/NBC one puts Obama on 48% to Romney on 47%, compared with last week when the two were on 47%.</p> <p>The WSJ/NBC poll shows Obama is being given credit by likely voters for his handling of hurricane Sandy, with nearly seven in 10 voters approving of his performance, with only 15% disapproving.</p> <p>Romney's political director Rich Beeson, also on Fox, questioned the credibility of the polls, often a sign of a campaign unhappy with the direction an election is headed, said: \"These polls are like nailing Jello to a tree. They are all over the place.\"</p> <p>He predicted that independents would turn out in greater numbers for Romney and that Republicans too will flood the polling booths. \"There's an intensity factor out there on the side of the Republicans, that is a significant gap and we see it out on the ground, we see it when people are knocking on the doors, we see it when people are making the phone calls,\" Beeson said.</p> <p>Asked about a controversial ad that the Romney campaign is broadcasting that claims jeep jobs are being sent to China as a result of Obama's bailout of the motor industry, Beeson ducked the question. Motor manufacturers have denied the claim but the Romney campaign has expanded the number of outlets for broadcasting the discredited ad.</p> <p>Obama, campaigning alongside Bill Clinton, attracted a crowd of 24,000 for a late-night rally in Virginia on Saturday night and 14,000 in New Hampshire on Sunday. The crowd in Virginia, while respectable for a cold evening, was well down on 2008 when an eve-of-election event at almost the same location attracted more than 80,000.</p> <p>Although Obama and Romney are tied nationally, Obama appears to be doing better in key swing states. In Iowa, the normally reliable Des Moines Register poll put Obama on 47% to Romney's 42%.</p> <p>In Ohio, which both campaigns are treating as potentially decisive, attracting more visits than the others, a Columbus Dispatch poll puts Obama on 50% to Romney's 48%.</p> <p>Campaigning in Iowa yesterday, Romney added a new line to his stump speech, saying that Obama's slogan 'Forward' should be renamed 'Forewarned', that a second term would look much like the first.</p> <p>Romney too is focused on a remark by Obama on Friday in which he told a crowd in Ohio not to boo. \"Voting is the best revenge,\" Obama said.</p> <p>Romney, in his speeches, said: \"Vote for revenge? Let me tell you: Vote for love of country.\"</p> <p>Campaigning alongside Bill Clinton in Concord, New Hampshire, on Sunday Obama drew a parallel with Clinton's presidency.</p> <p>\"Just as we did when Bill Clinton was president, we gotta ask the wealthiest to pay a little bit more so we can reduce the deficit and still invest in the things we need to grow,\" he said.</p> <p>Jen Psaki, the president's spokeswoman, said he was energised by the fact that this is the last time he will campaigning on his own behalf. \"I think he's really taking in the moments and taking in the times he has backstage with the introducers, and the conversations he has along the rope line, and it is really helping to bolster him through the final days,\" she told reporters.</p>",
  "<p>\u2022 It's fitting, surely, that an election race defined by imaginary gaffes based on absurdly selective quotations - remember \"you didn't build that\"? - should end with an imaginary gaffe based on an absurdly selective quotation. In Ohio on Friday, when Barack Obama fans booed a mention of Mitt Romney, the president told them: \"No, no, no, don't boo \u2013 vote. Voting is the best revenge.\" Never mind he was paraphrasing a famous saying about the merits of not behaving vengefully: he'd said the word \"revenge\"; and that meant class war. <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2012/11/03/romney_vote_for_love_of_country_not_revenge.html\" title=\"\">\"Vote for revenge?\"</a> said Romney rhetorically[, at an event soon afterwards: \"Let me tell you what I'd like to tell you: vote for love of country.\" The campaign swiftly threw together an ad: \"Revenge or love of country.\" Paul Ryan said during a campaign stop: \"Just yesterday, Obama was asking his supporters at a rally to vote out of revenge.\" (The Washington Post's resident right-wing blogger, Jennifer Rubin, dutifully castigated the president for \"an unseemly utterance\").Amid the deafening sound of Democratic foreheads being smacked from coast to coast in disbelief at the Romney campaign's sheer gall, no one noticed that the Republican challenger, in attacking the \"revenge\" line, had committed a far graver gaffe of his own. He told the crowd: \"Vote for \u2026 President Obama. President Obama [is] \u2026 the door to a brighter future.\" I've trimmed that quotation for reasons of space, and moved a couple of words around for clarity. But you get the gist.</p> <p>\u2022 Back in the world of non-imaginary gaffes, senior Democratic gaffologist Joe Biden did in fact unveil a classic over the weekend, by way of a campaign sign-off. \"I tell you what \u2013 there's never been a day in the last four years I've been proud to be [Obama's] vice-president,\" he told cheering supporters. \"Not one single day!\" Meanwhile here's senior Obama strategist David Axelrod, in Ohio, getting sweaty with appreciation for his boss: \"He believes in what he's doing. He believes in what he's fighting for. You can see in the speech that he's delivering that this is coming from his loins.\" Um, OK. That last part wasn't strictly necessary, but thanks anyway.</p> <p>\u2022 Post-Sandy Hurricane days it's quite natural that Rudy Giuliani, though a committed Republican, should show solidarity with the president as he oversees responses to the aftermath of the storm. Entirely natural \u2013 but far from the truth. Instead, the 9/11 leader is spending time calling for Obama's resignation. \"He should resign. He lied. He has been a disaster: the worst president for our economy in our lifetime,\" <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/news/stories/1112/83252_Page2.html\" title=\"\">Giuliani told a Romney rally</a>. \"He doesn't want a second term. He wants a second chance because he screwed it up the first time!\" Vicious words, but then at least Giuliani is bipartisan in that: in recent years he attacked a prominent Republican presidential candidate as <a href=\"http://gothamist.com/2011/12/15/giuliani_thinks_gingrich_is_reagani.php\" title=\"\">\"a man without a core</a> \u2026 a man that will say anything to become president of the United States\". Awkwardly, that man was Romney. \"I've never seen a guy change his position so many times, so fast, on a dime,\" Giuliani said last year, stumping for Newt Gingrich. But perhaps it's unfair to call him wildly inconsistent. It's been clear for years that Giuliani, in his heart, believes there's only one person truly qualified to lead America: Rudy Giuliani.</p>",
  "<p>As hurricane Sandy barrelled towards the&#xa0;east coast, <a href=\"http://www.desmoinesregister.com/article/20121027/OPINION03/121026026/The-Des-Moines-Register-endorsement-Mitt-Romney-offers-fresh-economic-vision\" title=\"\">Iowa's Des Moines Register newspaper endorsed Mitt Romney</a> \u2013 the first Republican it had endorsed since Richard Nixon in&#xa0;1972 (look how that turned out). Arguing that \"the partisan divide had hardened\" under Barack Obama, the leader writers said: \"One of the biggest obstacles either candidate faces is partisan gridlock in Congress [which] has hampered not only the economy, but the entire country.\"</p> <p>A week earlier the Orlando Sentinel, which backed Obama in 2008 in the crucial state of Florida, made the same argument in its <a href=\"http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/2012-10-19/opinion/os-ed-endorsement-president-mitt-romney-101912-20121018_1_trillion-deficit-reduction-plan-mitt-romney-obama-s-republican\" title=\"\">support for Romney</a>. \"With Obama in charge, the federal government came perilously close to a default last year,\" it said. \"It verges on magical thinking to expect Obama to get different results in the next four years.\"</p> <p>As Sandy inched closer, coverage of the campaign \u2013 like the campaigning itself \u2013 was suspended. All talk of gridlock was eclipsed by scenes of mayhem. One day reporters were standing in front of electoral maps analysing every poll, demographic and gaffe while speculating about the outcome. The next they were standing in sou'westers in wind and rain speculating about where it would make landfall. For a few days Ohio got a reprieve while New Jersey got a battering, and pollsters took a back seat while meteorologists drove the story.</p> <p>But when the winds subsided and the campaigns resumed, the dynamics of the race had changed and the validity of those arguments had been challenged. The hurricane and its aftermath helped illustrate the vacuity of this election campaign, what's at stake in its outcome, and who's responsible for the gridlock. With the frenetic polling and endless punditry, there may have been precious little calm before the storm but there was a greater degree of clarity after it.</p> <p>Beyond a <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/26/us/politics/climate-change-nearly-absent-in-the-campaign.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0\" title=\"\">punchline for Romney at the Republican convention</a>, climate change simply has not come up during this election. Moderators didn't ask about it during the presidential debates, and both Obama and Romney were too busy posing as friends of oil and coal to mention it. While no single storm can be attributed to climate change, warming oceans make them more likely \u2013 and&#xa0;a clear pattern is emerging that would help to explain an occurrence such as Sandy. <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/01/opinion/kristof-will-climate-get-some-respect-now.html\" title=\"\">As the New York Times's Nicolas Kristof pointed out</a>, three of the 10 biggest floods in lower Manhattan since 1900 have occurred in the past three years, while seven of the 10 warmest summers on record have taken place in the past 12.</p> <p>But to raise an issue like this during an election takes the kind of political courage that has long been in short supply. Given the hours of coverage and the billions of dollars devoted to the election, it's stunning how few of the nation's most glaring problems are being discussed. The US now has <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/atlarge/2012/01/30/120130crat_atlarge_gopnik?currentPage=all\" title=\"\">more people in its penal system</a> than the Soviet gulag at its height; its capital city has a <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/life-expectancy-varies-widely-in-the-washington-area/2012/04/19/gIQAjShVWT_story.html\" title=\"\">male life expectancy</a> lower than that of <a href=\"https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2102rank.html\" title=\"\">the Gaza Strip</a>; and the country openly operates a system of torture and a policy of targeted assassination. The fact that nobody even expects these issues to come up tells you something about the low expectations Americans have of their politicians.</p> <p>But Sandy concentrated minds. Disasters have a way of doing that. Its arrival prised a much coveted <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-11-01/a-vote-for-a-president-to-lead-on-climate-change.html\" title=\"\">endorsement for Obama from the New York city mayor, Michael Bloomberg</a>, an independent who formerly ran as a Republican. \"The devastation that Hurricane Sandy brought to New York City and much of the north-east \u2026 brought the stakes of next Tuesday's presidential election into sharp relief,\" he said. True, Obama had not campaigned on it \u2013 but at the very least he acknowledges its existence, made some efforts to address it, and is not beholden to a party that refuses to accept the science.</p> <p>As Bloomberg was penning his endorsement, Obama was touring storm-hit areas with the Republican governor of New Jersey, Chris Christie. Christie, Romney's <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/news/stories/1112/83254.html\" title=\"\">first pick for vice-president</a>, delivered a keynote speech at the Republican convention. The week before, he had <a href=\"http://www.philly.com/philly/columnists/karen_heller/20121104_Karen_Heller__The_storms_before_the_calm.html\" title=\"\">described the president</a> as \"a man wandering around a dark room, hands up against the wall, clutching for the light switch of leadership, and he just can't find it\". Last week, when the lights went out, he <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/post/the-morning-plum-chris-christie-drives-stake-into-romney-closing-argument/2012/11/01/2a435398-240d-11e2-ac85-e669876c6a24_blog.html\" title=\"\">praised Obama for his handling of the storm</a>, saying: \"The president has been all over this and he deserves great credit.\"</p> <p>While Sandy prompted both Bloomberg's and Christie's conversions, elsewhere in the country came evidence of a deeper split in Republican ranks. In the Nebraska Senate race, <a href=\"http://azdailysun.com/news/state-and-regional/gop-voices-for-kerrey-show-deep-split-in-party/article_891c6e6b-b0f6-5497-8bab-8c061bff62d4.html\" title=\"\">several Republicans came out against</a> the Tea Party-supported candidate and for the Democrat, Bob Kerrey.</p> <p>A week earlier, George Bush's former secretary of state Colin Powell \u2013 a Republican \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/news/stories/1012/82860.html\" title=\"\">broke ranks again to back Obama</a>. \"I think I'm a Republican of more moderate mould and that's something of a dying breed, I'm sorry to say,\" he said. \"But, you know, the Republicans I worked for are President Reagan, President Bush, the Howard Bakers of the world, people who were conservative \u2026 but people who recognise that, at the end of the day, you got to find a basis for compromise. Compromise is how this country runs.\"</p> <p>Powell's breed may be further from extinction than has been apparent. For the past four years, Tea Party activists have been claiming they want to take their country back. Now a growing number of Republicans appear to want to take their party back.</p> <p>And so it was that by the end of last week you got a sense of what an Obama presidency might have been, and might be again, were it not for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/jul/17/us-default-debt-ceiling-obama-congress\" title=\"\">the wilful obstruction of an opposition</a> whose primary stated aim was to deny him a second term: too timid for what is necessary but nonetheless the best that is possible within the narrow confines of American electoralism. Of course, he still has to win on Tuesday, which is by no means certain. But the dying days of the campaign put to rest one of the cases against him that has gained most traction among waverers.</p> <p>The arguments of the Des Moines Register and the Orlando Sentinel are true as far as they go. But they don't go very far unless they locate the source of the gridlock and hold to account those responsible for it. In the absence of that, handing the presidency to Romney becomes little more than <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/wp/2012/10/30/mitch-mcconnell-and-john-boehners-strategy-worked/\" title=\"\">a reward for bad behaviour</a>.</p> <p><em>Twitter: </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/garyyounge\" title=\"\"><em>@garyyounge</em></a></p>",
  "<p>America experienced a moment last week when forecast became fact; shockingly, concretely. Tomorrow, the same thing will happen. A speculative river will solidify into a hard fact. Whether it is the trajectory of the \"super storm\" Sandy, or the outcome of the presidential election, recent US media discourse has been dominated by forecasts, forecasting and those who make and disseminate them.</p> <p>Informed judgment, or speculation as it is less flatteringly known, has formed a key component of reporting for as long as the practice itself. The faulty forecast has become the dry rot in the flimsy framework of public trust in journalism. Failures to adequately anticipate phenomena, from al-Qaida's rise to the financial system's collapse, have contributed to an erosion of credibility. The \"bendy tree\" journalism of wind-blown TV news reporters has too often misled audiences about the threat of weather systems; the charts say one thing, the man in the Berghaus clinging to a lamppost another.</p> <p>As with every other branch of journalism, the dynamics of reporting \"what will happen\" are shifting from the qualitative model of expert opinion to the quantitative model of what can be extrapolated from measurement. One of the astonishing aspects of Sandy was how accurate the forecasts often were; foreseeing, for example, its move offshore before landing, as predicted, smack in the middle of New Jersey's shoreline.</p> <p>Thorough reporting soon followed, as a torrent of social media updates and photos tumbled into the stream of innovative efforts by big media. The rapid, sketchy information, false rumours and photos made some kind of sense of the scattered chaos. We watched, with timelines, maps and commentary, journalism get better before our very eyes.</p> <p>In a real storm, it seems the media can pull together, and make use of the streams and technologies which arrived to disrupt it. In US political forecasting, however, punditry has created its own fake storm, centring on the predictive powers of one man, Nate Silver. Silver's FiveThirtyEight blog makes his voice one of the most listened-to in US politics. But Silver didn't develop his journalism through the traditional Harvard Crimson and Washington Post route, wearing out shoe leather on the campaign trail and drinking in Capitol Hill bars with interns and advisers. He has a background in economics and started his career modelling baseball statistics. His prediction modelling for the 2008 election gave him remarkable accuracy and elevated his blog to a sought-after source of political wisdom. A deal with the New York Times sealed his rise.</p> <p>His prominence has unsettled those he disrupts, and the possibility that he might be wrong encouraged the sceptics into open hostility. In his new book The Signal and the Noise, Silver lays bare how political pundits failed to predict accurately the scale of the Obama victory. Joe Scarborough, a commentator for MSNBC, and a former Republican congressman, levelled his guns at Silver last week, saying that he was an \"ideologue\", a far more insulting term in US journalism than in British, and that the election was in effect a \"coin toss\".</p> <p>At its most basic level, this argument goes beyond left and right \u2013 it is about a new emerging school of journalism challenging the status quo. Journalism delivered through lovely prose and burnished anecdote, developed through access traded, sometimes for truth, is under threat from spreadsheets and the numeracy of a different elite. All journalism in one way or another is about the performance of information; presenting, polishing, contextualising and reporting. Silver's performance is through numbers and methodology; those left outside it attack it, without acknowledging this might be a world where both can thrive.</p> <p>As of Friday Silver had Obama at an 81% likelihood of winning the election. The polls themselves, it seems, were disrupted by the politics of Sandy. And this was something no one predicted.</p>",
  "<p>Veronica Romero was belting it out for Mitt Romney. Her band, Punto y Coma, flipped between Cuban and Puerto Rican numbers for a crowd of Republican supporters in Kissimmee, a central Florida town next to Disneyworld where a surge in Hispanic residents since the last presidential election is shaking up old assumptions about the Latino vote in an important swing state.</p> <p>The Cuban songs played to a community that has for decades defined Latino politics in Florida as solidly pro-Republican. The Puerto Rican music was an acknowledgement that hegemony is increasingly under challenge from Latino migrants whose votes are up for grabs.</p> <p>Romero is Puerto Rican and for Romney. But when she talks about the election she sounds much like a Barack Obama supporter four years ago.</p> <p>\"We are tired of the same old. We are looking forward,\" she said. \"We were looking for a change and we didn't get it. Especially the economy. We need more job opportunities. We are looking to work.\"</p> <p>Opinion polls show Obama commanding a sizeable lead among Latino voters across the US who support him about two to one against Romney. But Florida is different.</p> <p>The bulk of the Hispanic population in US border states to the west has Mexican roots. Florida's Latino politics has for half a century been dominated by Cubans who fled Fidel Castro's rule and their descendants, and they have generally been solid Republicans because of their hostility to communism.</p> <p>But years of immigration from South and Central America, and more recently migrants from Puerto Rico, has not only contributed to a dramatic change in demographics \u2013 with Latinos rising from one-tenth of the state's population 30 years ago to nearly one quarter today \u2013 but has shifted the ground in this year's presidential election. And unlike many other new arrivals in Florida, people born in Puerto Rico are Americans citizens and can vote, even if their island is not a US state.</p> <p>\"The Puerto Rican vote in Florida is up for grabs,\" said Puerto Rico's Republican governor, Luis Fortuno. \"Puerto Ricans in Florida tend to be very conservative socially. If they are second or third generation moving south from New York, that's different. Those coming straight from Puerto Rico are social conservatives for whom issues such as high taxes are very important.\"</p> <p>Democrats say some of that is true. \"The Puerto Ricans like Romney because they are conservative,\" said Nicole Murillo, secretary of the Democratic party's Hispanic caucus in Kissimmee. \"They don't like abortion. They don't like gay marriage. But Romney as a person who can fix the economy \u2013 very few believe in that.</p> <p>\"When I hear from Latinos that they're not going to vote for Obama because he hasn't fixed the economy, I say: are you going to vote for Romney who only cares about the rich? I say look at it this way: they're both bad but you have to look at the one that is less bad. They say that makes sense.\"</p> <p>There are about one million Cuban Americans in Florida. <a href=\"http://www.miamiherald.com/2012/10/28/3070930_p3/miami-dade-commission-term-limits.html#storylink=cpy\">Opinion polls show about three out of four of them back Romney</a>, in large part because they do not believe Obama has been tough enough on Cuba's communist leadership.</p> <p>But there are also now about 850,000 Puerto Ricans resident in Florida. Many of the new arrivals have settled in Orlando and neighbouring Osceola County, where Kissimmee is the largest town. Latinos now make up 40% of residents and the sharp rise in the number of Puerto Ricans led to the area getting a new congressional district this year.</p> <p>Tammy Celeste, the chair of Kissimmee's Republican party, said that knocking on doors campaigning, she hears a lot of disillusionment with Obama.</p> <p>\"The guy promised them change. He promised them the world and they fell for it,\" she said. \"There's a lot of them that's changing their politics. Mostly they are conservative. They believe in what we believe in \u2013 less government, family. But they just need to be told in Spanish what we stand for. There are those who are much more favourable to [Obama] but they're the ones who don't want to work.\"</p> <p>Murillo, an immigrant from Colombia and a substitute teacher, said she, too, hears the distress over jobs when she's campaigning on streets lined with closed restaurants and shops plastered with \"For Rent\" signs. But that does not necessarily translate into support for Romney.</p> <p>\"In this area, Disney is the biggest employer. They've been cutting a lot of people,\" she said. \"Most of the time we worry more about jobs; how we are going to provide for our families. One of the things that is happening in central Florida, people are having two jobs. That was difficult but now some people have three or four part time jobs in order to provide for your family. People don't look at Romney and think he is going to bring more secure jobs or better pay.\"</p> <p>The Romney campaign is hitting the unemployment issue hard in adverts targeted at Latino voters. It has also bought blocks of air time on a Spanish-language liberal talk radio show during which surrogates get to argue the Republican candidate's case with a sceptical host and Obama supporter, Fernando Miguel Negron.</p> <p>Obama scored points with some Puerto Ricans in particular, and Latinos in general, by appointing Sonia Sotomayor, who is of Puerto Rican heritage, to the US supreme court. Two former Democratic party governors of Puerto Rico, Carlos Romero Barcel\u00f3 and Rafael Hern\u00e1ndez Col\u00f3n \u2013 who are renowned as bitter rivals on the island \u2013 joined forces in Kissimmee to endorse the president.</p> <p>Obama has tried to woo the Cuban American community with an endorsement from Cristina Saralegui, a talk show host sometimes described as the Oprah Winfrey of Spanish-language television in Florida. Saralegui, who arrived in Florida as a child refugee from Cuba, says she is backing Obama because he \"understands the Hispanic community and has supported it unconditionally\".</p> <p>Saralegui joined Michelle Obama in an advert where the first lady said it was important to reelect her husband because of the promise of immigration reform and preserving achievements such as healthcare and widening access to higher education.</p> <p>But while immigration plays significantly as an issue with Latino voters in other parts of the US \u2013 and Obama said in an interview with Spanish-language television that his failure to pass comprehensive immigration reform is his biggest failure to date \u2013 it does not have the same weight in Florida.</p> <p>Puerto Ricans, who have automatic American citizenship, have the right to vote if they live in the US, and most Cubans who make it to Florida are generally granted legal residence.</p> <p>But Republican leaders' attitudes toward immigration do have an impact in Florida, where Latinos are generally more sympathetic to the plight of the undocumented even if it is not so much of a voting issue. Murillo said Republican-sponsored legislation, such as anti-immigrant statutes in Arizona and Alabama, reinforce the perception that the party is hostile to minorities.</p> <p>\"I haven't heard people talking about immigration,\" she said. \"It's not a big issue. But people do talk about the Republicans and how they want self-deportation and to bring the Arizona laws to Florida. They want to make the only language English, but we raise our kids bilingual,\" she said.</p> <p>Romero said that while immigration is not a voting issue for her, she thinks the Republicans have called it wrong. \"People have sympathy for illegal immigrants. I don't see them lying in a hammock, getting a suntan. Many of them work three times as hard as an American,\" she said.</p> <p>Which puts her at odds with Romney's views. \"I think it's fair to say there's always room for change. We need to continue to review the policy,\" she said.</p>",

Activists are following the candidate on the campaign trail, to shout out questions about climate change from the rope line.</p> <p>The two new anti-Romney ads mix the Republican candidate's off-hand remarks about sea-level rise and global warming with scenes from the devastation wrought by Sandy.</p> <p>\"I'm not in this race to slow the rise of the oceans or to heal the planet,\" says a relaxed-looking Romney, as his wife Ann looks on, in the ad produced by the League of Conservation Voters.</p> <p>The group has spent more than $13m on ads in these elections, more than the 2006, 2008 and 2010 elections combined. Most of that has gone on ads attacking Republican House and Senate leaders who do not accept climate science.</p> <p>Another campaign ad produced by Forecast the Facts uses a clip from Romney's now notorious convention speech in which he mocked Obama's 2008 campaign pledge to act on climate change.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ZENtH3psXl4?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ZENtH3psXl4\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p></p> <p>Meanwhile, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jX796xAbbk&amp;feature=player_embedded#!\">activists are turning up at Romney's rallies </a>demanding: \"Do you still believe global warming is funny?\"</p> <p>Sandy finally made climate change an issue in the presidential elections \u2013 after months with virtually no mention from Obama or Romney on the campaign trail.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/nov/01/bloomberg-endorses-obama-climate-change\">Michael Bloomberg's decision to snub Romney and endorse Obama</a> \u2013 because of the president's work on climate change \u2013 has also focused attention on the issue.</p> <p>\"It's become more immediate. People are not thinking about climate change as far away and in the future any more,\" said Daniel Souweine of Forecast the Facts.</p> <p>\"It's shifting from a kind of scientific conversation to a moral one.\"</p> <p>The group, which focuses on pushing back against climate change denial, has been raising money off Romney's convention speech.</p> <p>It plans to run the climate ad in the Washington DC suburbs of northern Virginia, a strongly Democratic area in the battleground state, and around Columbus, Ohio, which typically is a swing district.</p> <p>Souweine said the group hoped to expand to New Hampshire, where Romney plans to hold his final rally on Monday, or to North Carolina.</p> <p>The prospect of going on the air in North Carolina has excited some activists. Last June, state officials voted to ban discussion of future sea-level rise, in what was seen as an attempt to stop debate on global warming.</p> <p>After Sandy, campaigners hope such a posture will become politically untenable.</p> <p>\"We cannot risk having leaders in Washington who turn a blind eye to the threat of climate change and the devastating impact it's having,\" Gene Karpinski, president of the League of Conservation Voters said.</p>",
  "<p>Leading Republicans in a key Florida battleground have condemned Mitt Romney's campaign for writing off African American voters and attitudes toward minorities that they say have cost the party crucial support.</p> <p>Art Wood, chairman of the Republican party in Hillsborough County, a diverse area of about one million people and one of the most heavily contested regions of the state, said his party's presidential candidate failed to even try to win over black voters.</p> <p>\"Romney did a really poor job with minorities. That was my greatest disappointment. You'd go on to his website and he'd have a column for outreach. You clicked on that and there was Catholics for Romney, Democrats for Romney, fishermen for Romney. You never saw blacks or African Americans for Romney until four weeks ago,\" Wood said.</p> <p>\"I think it's the big frigging smart guys at the top who think they know how to run a campaign, and they probably just wrote off the African American vote. Romney did a really poor job with the African Americans. They're in many ways like Hispanics. They favour traditional marriage, they go to church regularly, they're suffering worse from unemployment.\"</p> <p>Wood was backed by a Republican contender for the US Congress in the area, EJ Otero, who is not even including his party affiliation on his election posters and literature because he thinks it will harm his chances.</p> <p>\"I think it's true but not only with the Romney campaign. That's a problem with the Republican party as a whole, and not just with African Americans. Hispanics, too. The Republican party has written off African Americans and Hispanics for the past 20 years and it needs to change,\" he said.</p> <p>Otero, a former air force colonel who served in Iraq and is of Cuban descent, said part of his party's problem is how it discusses issues that are important to minorities such as immigration and welfare.</p> <p>\"I do believe we've got to get off the emotional argument of: the border, the border, the border. We need to control the border so white slavery stops and narco trafficking. But when it comes to the people, we're talking about community,\" he said. \"There's also this myth that all poor people want here is handouts. They don't. All they want is the jobs they used to have.\"</p> <p>Otero acknowledged that he has distanced himself from his own party. \"I put my ideas. Nowhere in there does it say I'm a Republican. That's not helpful,\" he said.</p> <p>African American and Latino voters waiting outside the C Blythe Andrews library in Tampa to cast their ballot in early voting said Republican attitudes towards the less well off, and even \"fear\" of a Romney presidency, is driving people in the area to the polls.</p> <p>\"This is a serious election,\" said Tonya Lewis who runs a charity, Children With A Vision, to help underprivileged young people in school. \"There's been so much negativity from the Republicans. Mitt Romney scares the hell out of me. Romney can't relate to the people, he has no connection to the people. People are really afraid because if you get somebody whose worth millions of dollars, how can they know?\"</p> <p>Betty Reed, a Democratic party representative in the Florida legislature, said that turnout for early voting in the area is so high that she was arranging buses to move people to less busy polling stations.</p> <p>\"Voters in this area support the president but they're turning out to keep Romney out. His campaign played a big role. He went to the NAACP meeting and he talked about how he wanted to get rid of Planned Parenthood, things that are good for poor people. He didn't talk about what he would do for us,\" she said. \"Race is also a part of it. There's more than one issue but we know some people did not want Obama to be successful as president and we know why.\"</p> <p>Vivien Warren, who was brought from Cuba to the US as a child, was among those at the library voting for Obama. She said that the Republican-controlled Florida legislature's cutting in half of the number of days early voting, along with attempts to introduce new photo identification requirements at polling places that were struck down by a federal court as discriminatory, also drove people to vote.</p> <p>\"There's been a lot of talk among people about voter suppression. People are angry. How dare they? They're trying to prevent us from voting,\" she said.</p> <p>\"People are also angry that Romney and the Republicans have been disrespectful of the office of the president. The way Romney talked to him at the debate. People think that's about race. They don't want a black person in the White House.\"</p> <p>The legislature's removal of the last Sunday before the general election as an early voting day \u2013 a day when many African Americans went to the polls after church \u2013 mobilised religious leaders to launch a campaign, Souls to the Polls, to get black people to vote the previous Sunday instead. Vote monitors say it was successful and that turnout in minority districts will at least match that of 2008.</p>",
  "<p>The campaign is nearing an end. The final polls are being conducted. Soon enough, we'll all be sitting and watching actual votes being counted.</p> <p>For election junkies like myself, we always have a lot of data in our minds. We know a state's voting history and what to expect from it. What I've done here is try and put you inside the head of someone like me. I've laid out, as clearly as possible, what I believe are the key states in the presidential race on election night, along with key details on each state including <a href=\"http://www.thegreenpapers.com/G12/closing.phtml?format=gc\">closing times</a> (note that no state will be called until the last closing time for a given state), <a href=\"http://www.ismittromneythepresident.com/\">polling average</a>, <a href=\"http://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/\">voting history</a> and the key swing counties in each state.</p> <p>The assumptions made here are pretty simple. We start with an electoral map where President Obama holds a 237 to 206 electoral vote lead. This leaves eight swing states listed below. You might notice that some of the peripheral swing states such as North Carolina and Pennsylvania are not listed. If either Obama carries North Carolina or Romney wins in Pennsylvania, this election is likely to be over very quickly. They are not swing states in my opinion.</p> <p>So, here are write-ups on the key swing states in chronological order of poll closings.</p> <p><strong>Virginia (7pm ET)</strong></p> <p><em>Real Clear Politics average:</em> Romney +0.5 points</p> <p><em>2008 result:</em> Obama won by 6.3pt</p> <p><em>2004 result:</em> Bush won by 8.2pt</p> <p><em>Swing counties with 50k+ population (in every case, percentage points more Democratic than state in 2008):</em> Henrico (+5.9), Loudoun (+2.0)</p> <p>No state better represents the old v the new south. The northern part of the state surrounding Washington, DC is filled with highly-educated Democratic supporters, while most of the rest of the state's white population is Republican. Obama also benefits from a large African-American population in the south-east. Virginia had not voted for a Democrat for president since 1964 until it voted for Obama in 2008. The polls show the state to be dead-even, so expect this race to take hours for the networks to call as northern Virginia is usually the last to report.</p> <p><strong>Ohio (7.30pm ET)</strong></p> <p><em>Real Clear Politics average:</em> Obama +2.3pt</p> <p><em>2008 result:</em> Obama won by 4.6pt</p> <p><em>2004 result:</em> Bush won by 2.1pt</p> <p><em>Swing counties with 50k+ population:</em> Hamilton (+2.2), Lake (-3.7), Montgomery (+1.6), Portage (+4.4), Stark (+0.9), Wood (+2.5)</p> <p>No Republican has ever won the presidency without winning Ohio. This year will likely not be an exception. Obama is buffered by a large African-American population surrounding Cleveland, as well as old conservative Democrats along the state's eastern border. Romney benefits from evangelical support in the more rural areas in the western and southern sections of Ohio. Romney's strength with white working-class voters has been slowed in Ohio because of Obama's support of the auto bailout and Romney's lack thereof. Obama holds a small lead in the polls: don't expect the state to be called by the networks for at least four hours after closing.</p> <p><strong>Florida (7pm ET for eastern part of state; 8pm ET for the west)</strong></p> <p><em>Real Clear Politics average:</em> Romney +1.2pt</p> <p><em>2008 result:</em> Obama won by 2.8pt</p> <p><em>2004 result:</em> Bush won by 5.0pt</p> <p><em>Swing counties with 50k+ population:</em> Duval (-0.9), Hernando (+0.7), Hillsborough (+4.4), Pasco (+0.8), Sarasota (-2.9), Volusia (+2.9)</p> <p>George W Bush won the state by 537 votes and, with it, the White House in 2000. Much of the northern two-thirds of the state is filled with residents whose families have lived in Florida for generations. These folks are Romney's strength, along with Cubans in Miami. Obama will do very well with a growing non-Cuban Hispanic population around Orlando, black voters and Jewish retirees in the southeast. Look at the I-4 corridor in the central part of the state from Orlando to Tampa: whoever wins the I-4 will likely win the state. Polls give Romney a slight edge, although it is too close to call.</p> <p><strong>New Hampshire (7pm ET for most of state; 8pm ET for a few bigger cities)</strong></p> <p><em>Real Clear Politics average:</em> Obama +2.0pt</p> <p><em>2008 result:</em> Obama won by 9.6pt</p> <p><em>2004 result:</em> Kerry won by 1.4pt</p> <p><em>Swing counties with 50k+ population:</em> Hillsborough (-5.9), Merrimack (+4.2)</p> <p>New Hampshire was the only state to vote for George W Bush in 2000 and John Kerry in 2004. It supported Obama in 2008, but did a U-turn and voted three Republicans to the federal government in the 2010 midterms. The state is nearly all-white, yet it has a unique mix of old-time Libertarians, tax escapees from Massachusetts (note there's no income or sales tax in New Hampshire) and social liberals on the state's western edge. New Hampshire only has four electoral votes, but they could play a big role in a number of electoral scenarios. The race here is too close to call, with perhaps a slight edge to Obama.</p> <p><strong>Colorado (9pm ET)</strong></p> <p><em>Real Clear Politics average:</em> Obama + 0.9pt</p> <p><em>2008 result:</em> Obama won by 9.0pt</p> <p><em>2004 result:</em> Bush won by 4.7pt</p> <p><em>Swing counties with 50k+ population:</em> Arapahoe (+4.0), Jefferson (+0.1), Larimer (+0.8)</p> <p>This state is ground zero for the newer parts of the Democratic formula to win, despite losing working-class whites. Latinos, along with a growing highly-educated white suburban population around Denver, have shifted this former Republican stronghold into a state where either party can win. Republicans still run strong in the exurbs of Weld and the strongly religious El Paso County, home to the Christian conservative group Focus on the Family. Jefferson County, which is the basis for the comedy South Park, is likely to mirror the state's vote. Polling in the state indicates that the race is a true toss-up.</p> <p><strong>Wisconsin (9pm ET)</strong></p> <p><em>Real Clear Politics average:</em> Obama +5.0pt</p> <p><em>2008 result:</em> Obama won by 13.9pt</p> <p><em>2004 result:</em> Kerry won by 0.4pt</p> <p><em>Swing counties with 50k+ population:</em> Kenosha (+4.2), Outagamie (-2.3), Racine (-6.7), Winnebago (-2.3)</p> <p>No state is perhaps more partisan than the Badger. It was here where a recall drive against the state's controversial Republican governor failed in June. Each candidate is pretty much locked in, with 47% of the vote no matter what. Obama can count on Milwaukee with its black population, socially liberal whites around the University of Wisconsin and old-time Democrats in the west. Romney must crush in the Milwaukee suburbs, which are among the most conservative in the nation. The area around Green Bay in the northeast matches the word \"swing\" perfectly. If Romney doesn't win Ohio, he must win here. Polls give Obama a small lead.</p> <p><strong>Iowa (10pm ET)</strong></p> <p><em>Real Clear Politics average:</em> Obama +2.0pt</p> <p><em>2008 result:</em> Obama won by 9.4pt</p> <p><em>2004 result:</em> Bush won by 0.7pt</p> <p><em>Swing counties with 50k+ population:</em> Polk (+5.1), Scott (+5.0), Woodbury (-10.0)</p> <p>This state is where the primary season begins, and it likes to keep Americans guessing. It's a mix of old heartland liberals in the east and very conservative evangelicals in the west. This was one of only two states that voted for Al Gore in 2000 and George W Bush in 2004. No state has better mirrored the national vote since 1992 than Iowa. Early voting suggests a tight race, while polling gives Obama a small advantage. Obama won his first victory outside of Illinois here and would like to win where his national candidacy began. Iowa has historically not been decided until very late in the evening.</p> <p><strong>Nevada (10pm ET)</strong></p> <p><em>Real Clear Politics average:</em> Obama +2.7pt</p> <p><em>2008 result:</em> Obama won by 12.5pt</p> <p><em>2004 result:</em> Bush won by 2.6pt</p> <p><em>Swing counties with 50k+ population:</em> Washoe (+0.1)</p> <p>There is perhaps no better example of the gaining influence of Latinos in the American south-west. Combined with Jewish retirees, blacks and white casino workers, Latinos form the Democratic base in and around Las Vegas. Democrats, led by Senate Majority leader Harry Reid, have been registering voters at an incredible pace. Mitt Romney is relying on a base in the rural areas, including a large Mormon population. Washoe County in the north-west is a swing county and usually votes with the winner. Early voting suggests that Obama will carry the state, with polling mostly agreeing: Obama will likely win Nevada by a small margin.</p>",
  "<p>One of the less convincing critiques of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/us-elections-2012\" title=\"\">US presidential election </a>campaign, which winds up on Tuesday, is that there has not been much to choose between the incumbent, President Obama, and his challenger, Mitt Romney.</p> <p>The reality is very different. Instead, a stark choice exists. One can only judge a candidate on his past record and on what he has pledged to do in the future. Romney has said and done a lot of things, many contradictory, some deliberately so. It has been very hard to know during the campaign which Romney is real: the man who backed the precursor of Obamacare when he was governor or the candidate who suggested to donors that almost half of Americans were welfare beneficiaries beyond his political reach? Is he the centrist Republican of the first presidential debate or the man who insisted during the primaries he was \"severely conservative\"?</p> <p>Doubts about Romney have accrued not only from his ever shifting politics but also from a wider sense of flakiness. His economic policies have a touch of the fantastic. Romney would enact large tax cuts, reducing revenue, while increasing defence spending sharply, but also arguing he would eat into the deficit by spending cuts alone.</p> <p>On foreign policy too, Romney represents a return to the disastrous years of George W Bush \u2013 threatening confrontation with China by saying he would list it as a currency manipulator, while making bellicose noises about conflict with Iran.</p> <p>On the other side of the balance sheet, what is there to say about Obama? Few would disagree that America's first black president, who was once able to inspire with his oratory, has lost some of his lustre. The messages of hope and change ran aground in the midst of the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression, exacerbated both by the parlous state of the economy he inherited from his predecessor and by the two huge costly wars he was obliged to fight.</p> <p>If he has not transformed America in the way that many might have hoped, he has at least mitigated some of the pain while moving to bring to an end one of the US's greatest iniquities, its shocking inequality in affordable healthcare provision. Through the car manufacturers' bailout, his insistence on stress testing of banks and through carefully targeted stimuli, he ensured that the US now appears to be emerging from financial crisis with modest growth and a rise in employment figures even as those European governments that pursued a strategy of austerity are at very best bumping along the bottom. Obama steered a course between the left of his own party, who were advocating for populist but risky measures, and Republican obstructionism.</p> <p>On foreign policy, the Obama doctrine has been a mixed bag. He strictly limited US involvement in the most significant military adventure launched under his watch, in Libya, and has resisted Israeli pressure for military strikes against Iran. On the Arab Spring, he has preferred by and large to keep a watching brief and avoided an overt entanglement in Syria. After the war in Iraq, launched on a false pretence, and the mishandling of Afghanistan by Bush, this caution should be seen as positive.</p> <p>But while Obama may have brought an end to some of the human rights abuses of the Bush era, he has failed either to close Guant\u00e1namo Bay, as he promised, or moved to end the immunity of Bush-era officials implicated in abuses.</p> <p>On climate change too, Obama has been disappointing, not least on the campaign trail. In 2008, speaking at the <a href=\"http://www.clintonglobalinitiative.org/\" title=\"\">Clinton Global Initiative, </a>he insisted: \"No single issue sits at the crossroads of as many currents as energy. This is a security threat, an economic albatross and a moral challenge of our time.\"</p> <p>Whoever is elected will face a new presidential term marked by considerable challenges. While the US is recovering from recession it remains weak and would be vulnerable to a number of factors, including a war in the Gulf over Iran disrupting oil supplies, China falling into recession itself or a further worsening of the eurozone crisis.</p> <p>He will also have to engage quickly with the \"fiscal cliff\", due at the year's end, when temporary payroll tax cuts are due to come to an end, which promises a tough choice between sharp tax increases for ordinary Americans that would threaten the recovery (but cut the deficit) or an extension of the tax cuts and a consequent increase in the deficit, an issue fraught with political strife.</p> <p>On the wider stage, the war in Syria is sucking in its neighbours, producing growing instability and, for all Obama's alleged commitment to negotiated solutions, he appears unable to engage Assad's main backer, Russia. The proposed draw down of the majority of US troops in Afghanistan by 2014 and the continuing tensions in Pakistan threaten another crisis.</p> <p>Despite all of these caveats, the candidate best equipped for the challenging period ahead is Barack Obama. While his campaign has hardly been inspiring, he remains a thoughtful figure who has taken his responsibilities with a seriousness absent from the Bush years. He has brought a new dignity to the White House and while there remain many who are still opposed to him simply for the colour of his skin, for many others he has achieved the remarkable by making it seem unremarkable that the president of the United States is a black man.</p> <p>His response to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/hurricane-sandy\" title=\"\">hurricane Sandy,</a> praised by both the independent mayor of New York, Michael Bloomberg, and the Republican New Jersey governor, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/shortcuts/2012/oct/31/chris-christie-republican-pass-notes\" title=\"\">Chris Christie</a>, was a belated reminder that there is a wider middle ground in US politics than the recent period of partisan disputes has often led us to believe.</p> <p>In the coming months, it will not be solely the new president's responsibility to confront the challenges facing the US and the world but all of those involved in the US political process. Any chance for healing and consensus after the elections should be grasped by all sides. This election offers an opportunity for a fresh start for US politics itself. It should not be squandered.</p>",
  "<p>President Barack Obama and Republican challenger Mitt Romney on Saturday began the last frantic days of campaigning in their battle for the White House by criss-crossing America's key swing states.</p> <p>Obama's team was planning a series of large events aimed at drawing big crowds. His closing weekend included two joint events with former president Bill Clinton: a rally on Saturday night in Virginia and an event on Sunday in New Hampshire.</p> <p>At a rally in Ohio \u2013 the most important swing state in the contest \u2013 Obama touted his first-term record and promised that he would do more to get America's struggling economy back on track. \"We've made real progress these past four years. But Ohio, we're here today because we all know we've got more work to do,\" he told the crowd in the town of Mentor. \"As long as there's a single American who wants a job and still can't find work; as long as there are families who are working harder and harder but are still falling behind; as long as there's a child anywhere in this country who is languishing in poverty, or barred from opportunity, we got more work to do,\" he added.</p> <p>Though national polls show a race that is virtually tied, it appears that Obama has maintained a slim but steady lead in the swing states, making him the favourite of most media pundits as the election comes to a close. Influential New York Times election blogger Nate Silver put Obama's current chances of winning at around 80%. The latest Wall Street Journal/Marist/NBC poll in Ohio put Obama up by six points in a state that no Republican challenger has ever won the White House without. But elsewhere things were more fluid. In Florida one poll early on Saturday morning showed Obama with a two-point lead, while another claimed Romney was six points ahead.</p> <p>Both campaigns tried to claim a boost from the jobs numbers released on Friday in an election in which the economy, and the fragility of America's recovery, has been the core issue. Obama's team pointed to a better than expected number of new jobs at 171,000. But Romney and other Republican figures seized on the rise in the nation's jobless rate to 7.9%, though that increase was largely due to people returning to the job market to look for work. Obama will face voters with the highest unemployment rate of any incumbent president since Franklin Delano Roosevelt during the Great Depression.</p> <p>Romney and his team were not letting up with their message that change was sorely needed in order to get America's economy growing again. He said Obama's first term had been marked by an endless series of broken promises, from job creation to working with Republicans. \"He made a lot of promises, but they were promises he couldn't keep. I've made promises that I've kept and will keep for the American people,\" Romney told a crowd in Dubuque, Iowa, another vital swing state.</p> <p>The Romney team also released a new TV ad that criticises Obama for saying \"voting is the best revenge\" at a rally in Friday in Ohio. That line has given Romney a new avenue of attack in trying to portray Obama as a divisive figure compared with Romney's own attempted image-makeover as a centrist. \"Vote for revenge?\" the Republican candidate asked at a rally in New Hampshire. ,\"Let me tell you what I'd like to tell you: vote for love of country. It is time we lead America to a better place.\"</p> <p>Both sides are now engaged in an all-out push. Virtually Romney's entire senior team has left the campaign's Boston headquarters to travel with him for the contest's final few days. Meanwhile, some of Obama's top aides from his historic campaign four years ago were planning to join him on the road, including Robert Gibbs, who served as Obama's first White House press secretary, and Reggie Love, the president's former personal aide.</p> <p>Romney and the Republican party have raised some eyebrows by seeking to expand the political battleground to include Pennsylvania, despite the fact that a Democrat has won the state for the last five presidential contests. Obama won Pennsylvania by more than 10 percentage points in 2008 and the latest polls in the state give him a four- to five-point lead. Nevertheless, Romney will campaign in the Philadelphia suburbs on Sunday. Republican strategists say that they think the state is in play, pointing to a disillusioned Democratic base.</p> <p>However, Democratic aides, including Obama's campaign guru, David Axelrod, have laughed off the Romney visit there as a piece of clever spin. But they are also seeking to head it off by adding television spending in the state, and have even sent Bill Clinton to campaign there on Monday. Vice-president Joe Biden has also visited the area.</p> <p>Democrats have also put huge emphasis on trying to get their side to vote early. At some Democratic rallies, buses park outside waiting to take attendees to early voting booths. Though no votes will be counted until election day itself, several battleground states have released the party affiliation of people who have voted early. So far, Democratic voters outnumber Republicans in Florida, Iowa, Nevada, North Carolina and Ohio. Republicans have the lead in Colorado.</p> <p>The immediate political impact of hurricane Sandy, which devastated parts of New York, New Jersey and other north-eastern states earlier in the week, was starting to recede. Though many of the worst-hit towns and neighbourhoods remained in trouble and without power, life was getting back to normal in many other areas. Power had been returned to nearly all of Manhattan and the military was taking steps to ease a dramatic fuel shortage in New Jersey that had led to huge queues and the need for a police presence at gas stations.</p> <p>The main political consequence of the storm seemed to be the embrace of Obama by New Jersey governor Chris Christie. Christie, who has been an active surrogate for Romney and gave a high-profile speech at the Republican party convention in Tampa, was effusive in his praise for Obama's performance during the disaster. Images of the two men working together were seen as a coup for the president and have raised Republican hackles that Christie might have deliberately undermined Romney's campaign at the last minute to serve his own political needs.</p>"

We need leadership from the White House \u2013 and over the past four years, President Barack Obama has taken major steps to reduce our carbon consumption, including setting higher fuel-efficiency standards for cars and trucks.</p> </blockquote> <p>Romney, in contrast, has \"reversed course\" on his previous support for policies to tackle climate change.</p> <p>The irony here is that climate change has barely been mentioned at all during the election campaign, and was never mentioned by name during the presidential debates. In the Republican primaries, candidates queued up to pour scorn on the very notion of man-made climate change. And now Bloomberg has made their party \u2013 which he was once a member of \u2013 pay the ultimate political price.</p> <p>Bloomberg then fires a lethal shot at Romney:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I believe Mitt Romney is a good and decent man, and he would bring valuable business experience to the Oval Office. He understands that America was built on the promise of equal opportunity, not equal results. In the past he has also taken sensible positions on immigration, illegal guns, abortion rights and health care. But he has reversed course on all of them, and is even running against the health-care model he signed into law in Massachusetts.</p> </blockquote>  <p>Interestingly, a close reading of Bloomberg essay makes it seem that he was planning to endorse Obama before Sandy. If that's true then presumably he was planning to punish the Republican party's war on climate change even before Sandy's unwanted attention.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-9ee9e396-0b0b-4a70-a9b2-0667b3eeb7de\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/11/1/1351800259417/Barack-Obama-and-Michael--007.jpg\" alt=\"Barack Obama and Michael Bloomberg in 2008\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Barack Obama and Michael Bloomberg at a breakfast meeting in 2008.

Of course, he knows in current circumstances no sane person would really push defence spending, projected to fall below 3% of GDP, to 4%; of course President Romney would strike a deal that raises overall tax revenues, even if he cuts tax rates.</p> <p>However, even if you accept that Romneynomics may be more numerate in practice than it is in theory, it is far harder to imagine that he will reverse course entirely. When politicians get elected they tend to do quite a lot of the things they promised during their campaigns. Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, France\u2019s famously pliable new president, was supposed to be too pragmatic to introduce a 75% top tax rate, yet he is steaming ahead with his plan. We weren\u2019t fooled by the French left; we see no reason why the American right will be more flexible.

Internal surveys conducted for candidates like George Allen in Virginia, Richard Mourdock in Indiana and Josh Mandel in Ohio draw much rosier conclusions than polls conducted for their Democratic counterparts Tim Kaine, Joe Donnelly and Sherrod Brown. And media surveys, at least in Virginia and Ohio, show Kaine and Brown winning (restrictive Indiana laws make polling prohibitively expensive there).</p> <p>Republicans say their party is a victim of media bias \u2013 but not in the standard Lamestream Media sort of way. Pollsters on both sides try to persuade public surveyors that their voter turnout models are more accurate reflections of what's going to happen on Election Day. This year, GOP pollsters and strategists believe those nonpartisan pollsters are adopting Democratic turnout models <em>en masse</em>.</p> </blockquote>  <p>Reid's conclusion:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Republicans believe Democrats are counting far too much on low-propensity voters and a booming minority turnout that isn't going to materialize on Election Day. Democrats believe Republicans are hopelessly reliant on an electorate that looks far more like their party than the nation as a whole. The day after Election Day, somebody's pollsters are going to be proven seriously wrong.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-11-01T17:05:24.997Z\">at 5.05pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5092a8b695cb1506d24446df\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-11-01T16:52:06.508Z\">4.52pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Obama for America is back on the offensive with another smack at <strong>Mitt Romney</strong>'s \"let Detroit go bankrupt\" comment.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FP41ogzwsBk\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/FP41ogzwsBk?wmode=opaque&fs=1&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>There's no telling how much damage a dumb remark can do \u2013 and this is an example of something that was never an issue in the GOP primary \u2013 Romney won <strong>Michigan</strong> \u2013 but blows up big time in the general election.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5092a3bfb579f74bac7648de\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-11-01T16:30:55.588Z\">4.30pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Nate Silver v Joe Scarborough</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>For fans of media-politics inside baseball: Many <strong>Republicans</strong> and <strong>Politico</strong> have been engaged in bizarre guerrilla warfare aimed at the <a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com/\">New York Times' polling guru</a> <strong>Nate Silver</strong>, whose election model was the only thing keeping the Democratic party from headless panic while the Romney surge was at its height last month.</p> <p>The motivations of the those involved at throwing mud at Silver is suspect \u2013 the Republicans because it punctures their narrative of inevitable Mittmentum and Politico because of jealousy.

  "<p>If you <a href=\"https://twitter.com/forecasterenten\">follow me</a> on Twitter (which you should), you'll see me tweet out a lot of new polls. But I rarely write daily updated articles here about the movement of the polls. Why?</p> <p>It's not that this isn't a worthy cause. There are plenty of people who write pearls of wisdom on each new set of polling data. Rather, it's because I don't want to spend my time saying the same thing over and over again.</p> <p>There are certain years where the polls bounce up and down, and we really don't know what's going to happen. In <a href=\"http://www.pollingreport.com/white.htm\">2000</a>, the polls were quite bouncy, and we saw a Gore lead give way to a Bush lead \u2013 and vice versa, more times than I can count. In <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/Presidential_04/oh_polls.html\">2004</a>, John Kerry held a lead in the pivotal state of Ohio as late as 20 days into the month of October, before Bush regained an edge he never lost.</p> <p>Then there are other years where the polls are fairly static. The outcome of the <a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/poll/154559/us-presidential-election-center.aspx\">1992, 1996 and 2008</a> campaigns were fairly clear by October. The Democratic candidate was going to win, and by a fairly comfortable margin.</p> <p>This year, the national polls have indicated a fairly tight race, yet in the states \u2013 where the election will be lost and won \u2013 polls denote a race that is more stable than <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/blog/2012/oct/18/alex-rodriguez-decline-new-york-yankees\">A-Rod's lack of clutch</a> in the post-season.</p> <p>Check out this chart from HuffPollster tracking the latest data from state to rule all others Ohio:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398723711\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/11/1/1351810109623/Ohio_460.jpg\" alt=\"Ohio polling\" width=\"460\" height=\"222\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Huffpollster tracking in Ohio (the blue line is Obama's poling; the red, Romney's)</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: guardian.co.uk</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>You see the race tighten after the first debate, but since that initial tightening, there has been no change.

Anyone who says they see either Obama or Romney gaining ground in the states (save Nevada) is selling you a sack of nothing.</p> <p>Thus, the only way Romney can win is <em>if the average of the polls is wrong</em>. <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/11/01/presidential-polls_n_2056377.html?utm_hp_ref=@pollster\">Mark Blumenthal over at HuffPollster</a> is going to do a whole series on what could go wrong with the polls, and I invite you to read his thoughts if you want to get into the nitty-gritty.</p> <p>Still, let me outline three possible reasons that the aggregates might not be telling the whole truth.</p> <p>First, averages do occasionally get a race wrong \u2013 usually, one per cycle. It could be that Ohio is the state where the polls are wrong this time around \u2013 although I have my doubts, because usually, the state that is incorrectly called is one where the polling average is within 1 point, such as <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2012/president/co/colorado_romney_vs_obama-2023.html\">Colorado</a> or <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2012/president/va/virginia_romney_vs_obama-1774.html\">Virginia</a> are this time around.</p> <p>The exact odds that it is Ohio might be higher than I have thought, though. Simon Jackman <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/simon-jackman/converting-a-poll-average_b_2044222.html?utm_hp_ref=@pollster\">utilized historical data</a>, and if we factor in a lot of uncertainty in the polls, he still has Obama as a 2:1 favorite in Ohio and, thus, the electoral college. This two-thirds chance is almost certainly under-confident, but it's not insane to think a Romney reversal could happen.</p> <p>Second, there does seem to be a bit of an unequal distribution in the polling in Ohio. Whether if it's because of random error or different turnout models, my friend <a href=\"http://www.weeklystandard.com/blogs/morning-jay-polling-quandary-buckeye-state_659852.html\">Jay Cost argues</a> that there are two peaks in the Ohio polls. One peak shows that Obama will win Ohio by 4 or more points and the other has a tied race. In other words, the average isn't a useful measure.</p> <p>I was initially skeptical of Jay's argument. My own examination of <a href=\"http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/441/screenshot20121101at132.png/\">all the data </a>suggests that there does seem to be a peak at around a 2- to 2.5-point Obama lead in Ohio. When I looked back at <a href=\"http://imageshack.us/scaled/landing/5/screenshot20121101at132.png\">2008 data</a>, however, the distribution was more normal. That is, the average point was a convergence of the majority of the data. This year, it does seem to be spread out in its peaks.</p> <p>Third, Rasmussen Reports is correct and pretty much everyone else is wrong. As <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/oct/31/other-2012-election-contest-pollster-polling\">discussed earlier</a>, the only pollster in the past few weeks to have Romney ahead in Ohio and tied in Wisconsin is Rasmussen. Rasmussen has had some years, like 2004 and 2006, when they were among the best. They also had 2010, when they were way off. </p> <p>There's always the chance an outlier like Rasmussen sees something others miss. There's a better chance, though, that the outlier is wrong.</p> <p>All of this is to say that you shouldn't anticipate much in the way of presidential horserace coverage from me in the next few days. There's pretty much no chance the polls will change outside a last-minute scandal. Either the surveys are either right in projecting President Obama's re-election, or the story will be how wrong they were. We'll find out which soon enough.</p>",
  "<p>New York City's mayor Michael Bloomberg took climate change out of the closet on Thursday by invoking the issue in his endorsement of Barack Obama.</p> <p>\"This November, vote for a president who will lead on climate change,\" <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MikeBloomberg/status/264080226886221824\">Bloomberg wrote on Twitter</a>.</p> <p>The stunning snub to Mitt Romney, in the wake of Hurricane Sandy, at a stroke turned climate change from liability into a potentially winning political issue in this presidential election.</p> <p>It might even embolden other Republicans, who do support action on climate change, to come out of the closet as well. At least, that seems to be partly Bloomberg's intention.</p> <p>The real test of power will be whether Obama makes climate change part of his standard stump speech \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/nov/01/obama-strategy-silence-climate-change\">something that has been notably lacking so far</a> \u2013 and whether Republicans dare to admit a connection between Sandy and climate change.</p> <p>Obama, in his response to the endorsement, relegated climate change to a lesser item on his list. For Bloomberg it was the focal point as a result of the disaster that has struck his city.</p> <p>\"The devastation that Hurricane Sandy brought to New York City and much of the north-east \u2013 in lost lives, lost homes and lost business \u2013 brought the stakes of next Tuesday's presidential election into sharp relief,\" Bloomberg wrote. \"Our climate is changing. And while the increase in extreme weather we have experienced in New York City and around the world may or may not be the result of it, the risk that it may be \u2014 given the devastation it is wreaking \u2014 should be enough to compel all elected leaders to take immediate action.\"</p> <p>Businessweek, which is owned by Bloomberg, made the point even more trenchantly with a cover reading: \"It's global warming, stupid.\"</p> <p>But Bloomberg made a point of rebuking Romney for abandoning his own record on climate change, as governor of Massachusetts, in an effort to win over conservative Republicans. The New York mayor also praises Obama for his efforts on climate change in the White House.</p> <p>\"Over the past four years, President Barack Obama has taken major steps to reduce our carbon consumption including setting higher fuel-efficiency standards for cars and trucks,\" Bloomberg said.</p> <p>The mayor went on to invoke the administration's moves to clean up coal-fired power plants \u2013 which have been vigorously opposed by Republicans \u2013 before citing his own efforts on climate change.</p> <p>Then comes the swipe at the Republican contender. \"Mitt Romney, too, has a history of tackling climate change \u2026 He couldn't have been more right. But since then, he has reversed course.\"</p> <p>In the aftermath of Sandy, a number of Democrats including Bill Clinton, Al Gore, and New York's governor Andrew Cuomo have begun talking publicly about climate change.</p> <p>The mention comes after an election season in which climate change has been strangely absent \u2013 to the frustration of campaigners and the bewilderment of European observers.</p> <p>For Obama, the silence was strategic. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/nov/01/obama-strategy-silence-climate-change\">The White House saw climate change as a vulnerability for Obama</a>.</p> <p>Mitt Romney's most prominent mention of climate change was as a laugh line in his convention speech \u2013 an attempt to win over conservative Republicans.</p> <p>The Tea Party movement has turned climate denial into a litmus test of conservative credentials \u2013 and that has made climate change one of the most sharp divisions between Obama and Romney.</p> <p>But even Republicans who accept climate science are opposed to the kind of sweeping economic transformation required to prevent the most catastrophic effects of global warming.</p> <p>George Pataki, the former governor of New York, argued it was the Democrats' focus on big solutions to climate change had set Republicans on edge. \"Part of it is a reaction to the stridency of some of the activists who really are looking to expand government power,\" he said.</p> <p>He said Obama's policies on climate change amounted to a \"massive power grab\".</p> <p>\"This president and his administration supported the Waxman-Markey bill that was horribly flawed \u2013 one more aimed at expanding government control over industry, generated government revenue, and extending favours to friends than at dealing with climate change.\"</p>",

New Jersey bore the brunt of the storm and in the city of Hoboken \u2013 just across the Hudson river from New York \u2013 the US National Guard arrived to help evacuate up to 20,000 people stuck in their homes.</p> <p>Sandy is now thought to have caused tens of billions of dollars of damage with a unique combination of high winds, a massive flood surge and even a blizzard in mountainous areas. Its cone of impact stretched from North Carolina to Canada and it has been described by many as the worst ever to hit the region.</p> <p>In New York, there was good news with the restoration of limited commuter rail transport into and out of city and the announcement that parts of the subway system will start again on Thursday morning. The return of public transport will go some way to easing gigantic traffic jams that have plagued the city all day as people used their cars to enter Manhattan.</p> <p>But it was New Jersey that has suffered the worst of the storm, and on Wednesday <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/video/2012/nov/01/barack-obama-new-jersey-sandy-video\">President Barack Obama was visiting the state in the company of its Republican governor Chris Christie</a>. Sandy had pummelled its way through the state's famous New Jersey shore, swamping seaside towns, ripping away boardwalks, destroying beaches and flooding the major resort of Atlantic City.</p> <p>In Hoboken, uniformed soldiers in trucks brought in pumps, food and medical supplies amid flood waters contaminated with sewage and potentially lethal live power lines. Hoboken officials warned residents not to go outside but instead await help. Hoboken's Facebook page turned into a forum for pleas for aid. One woman, Keri O'Connor Robinson, wrote: \"Please rescue my sister. She is seven months pregnant and she lives at 517 Jackson Street, on the second floor. We have not heard from her since Monday.\"</p> <p>Obama and New Jersey governor Chris Christie, usually a staunch supporter of Republican challenger Mitt Romney, toured hard hit parts of the state. \"We have suffered losses and this the worst storm that I have seen in my lifetime,\" Christie said. \"We will get up and get this thing rebuilt and put back together.\"</p> <p>Christie and Obama also traded praise, hailing each other's leadership in the crisis and creating a powerful image of bi-partisan co-operation that could ripple out into the presidential election.</p> <p>Obama vowed that the federal government would do everything it could to<br>help. \"We are going to have a lot of work to do,\" he said. \"We will not quit until this is done.\"</p> <p>In New York in many ways, it was a strange tale of two cities. In upper Manhattan and many parts of the outer boroughs, life was steadily returning to normal. Businesses, shops and restaurants were open and thronged with customers and Broadway shows re-opened around Times Square. The steadily returning transport network will only speed up that picture of normalcy.</p> <p>However, elsewhere in the city the picture was very different. In lower Manhattan, where there is no power, vehicles negotiated streets without traffic lights and many residents left to stay with friends in other parts of the city. Usually packed and busy neighbourhoods like fashionable Soho and the East Village were relatively quiet and streets were lined with shuttered businesses. There was still little indication of when exactly power will return to the area. In all, about 600,000 New Yorkers were without power. Cell phone service, too, was spotty, hampering the efforts of people to get in touch with relatives and friends and tell them that they were all right.</p> <p>That was true, too, of many areas of Long Island, where hundreds of thousands of people remained without power. If they could, they headed off to other areas that had power or had moved out ahead of the storm.</p> <p>Carol Goleb, of Oceanside, Long Island, took shelter with her parents in Queens, New York.</p> <p>Goleb, said she was not going to take a chance that Sandy would be like last year's hurricane Irene, which largely spared the city.</p> <p>Unfortunately, many of her neighbours did not make the same decision. Ninety percent of Long Island residents are thought to be without power. \"A lot of them thought it was going to be another Irene,\" Goleb said.</p> <p>But as many areas struggled it was, however, a different picture on Wall Street. The New York stock exchange reopened on Wednesday morning after two days of having trading suspended. Mayor Michael Bloomberg rang the opening bell at 9.30am, right on schedule, as stock traders cheered from trading floor below. The market even rose as trading began adding 74 points to 13,182 shortly after opening. \"We've got to keep rebuilding,\" Bloomberg told reporters as he walked through the exchange.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the neighbourhood of Breezy Point in Queens was struggling with the aftermath of a devastating fire that swept through at least 111 homes as Sandy's flood waters rose through the streets. Elsewhere, in areas like Staten Island and Red Hook, which have extensive waterfronts, residents struggled to clear debris, stranded boats dumped on land and pools of standing water. In Coney Island, several feet of sand had been dumped by floodwaters several blocks inland.</p> <p>Across the stricken region the Red Cross was organising teams of volunteers. The organisation asked for people aged over 16 and fit enough to carry at least 40lbs to step forward to work twelve-hour shifts helping people in need and cleaning up the mess. It also appealed for donations: an appeal that was repeated by both Obama and his Republican challenger Mitt Romney.</p> <p>For almost two days Sandy has derailed normal campaigning for next week's presidential election. But on Wednesday there were signs of things getting back to the normal cut and thrust of the battle for the White House. Through the storm top Obama surrogates, like former president Bill Clinton and vice-president Joe Biden, have been campaigning on Obama's behalf seeking to fend off Romney's challenge.</p> <p>The Romney campaign, after cancelling numerous events as the storm hit, was back to full throttle. On Wednesday, Romney attended three full blown campaign events in the key swing state of Florida. He returned to his stump speech hammering away at Obama's first term record and saying the county needed a change at the top.</p> <p>However, he deliberately did not mention the president by name in order to not appear too negative at a time of national crisis. \"I believe this is the year for us to take a different course. I would bring real change and real reform. I don't just talk about change, I actually have a plan to execute change,\" Romney said in Tampa.</p>",

After dropping to 7.8% last month, any rise could dominate the final days of the campaign, tilting what remains of the tiny group of undecided voters towards Mitt Romney.</p> <p>Romney, who resumed campaigning day earlier, made the economy and unemployment a big part of his final pitch. \"If the president were to be re-elected, we're going to see high levels of unemployment continue,\" he said.</p> <p>An Obama spokeswoman, Jen Psaki, asked about the figures yesterday, said: \"Regardless what they are, the president is going to feel there's more we need to do to help people get back to work.\"</p> <p>The Obama team is hoping that any poor unemployment figures will be more than compensated for by the plaudits Obama has won this week for his handling of Sandy.</p> <p>The president, looking more confident and with more vigour than he has throughout most of the campaign, told a small crowd gathered near the steps of Air Force One at an airport in Green Bay that America had been inspired by what it had witnessed this week.</p> <p>\"All the petty differences that consume us in normal times all seem to melt away. There are no Democrats or Republicans during a storm, there are just fellow Americans,\" the president said.</p> <p>The line is a reprise of the plea for bipartisan cooperation that saw him rise to national prominence after a speech to the Democratic convention in 2004 and that he used repeatedly in the 2008 campaign.</p> <p>\"Leaders of different parties working to fix what's broken. neighbours helping neighbours cope with tragedy; communities rallying to rebuild; a spirit that says, in the end, we're all in this together -\u2013 that we rise or fall as one nation, as one people.\"</p> <p>Both the Obama and Romney campaigns claim they are winning. National polls show the two tied but of 11 polls published yesterday/Thurs in the eight swing states that will decide the election Obama is ahead in eight, Romney in two and the other a dead heat.</p> <p>The election could hinge on Ohio, a volatile and unpredictable state in which Obama holds a small lead, up two points in the Real Clear Politics average of polls.</p> <p>The Republican challenger enjoyed a surge in support after his success against Obama in the first of the presidential debates on October 3, regularly attracting crowds of 10,000 or more, but in the aftermath of Sandy these have dropped away. The crowd at his first event in Virginia yesterday attracted fewer than 3,000.</p> <p>Some Republicans are rehearsing excuses if they lose, such as blaming Sandy.</p> <p>The former Republican governor of Mississippi, Haley Barbour, emailed Politico to say: \"One thing is obvious \u2013 for a period of three days or more, nobody on the news media was reporting anything about the economy or job, spending, deficits or debts. And that's the Obama campaign's dream.\"</p> <p>In Green Bay, Obama shifted quickly from talking about Sandy to making his closing argument, a reprise of the stump speech he had been giving before Sandy.</p> <p>He described Romney as \"using all his talents as a salesman\" in trying to sell the same policies of George W Bush that had created the economic mess and that he would rubberstamp Tea Party policies.</p> <p>Obama's bipartisanship message is aimed not just at independents but Congress, hoping that a victory for him might persuade Republicans who control the House to cooperate in working out a deal in the face of an impending economic crisis.</p> <p>Although the White House is careful to avoid any accusations of complacency, work is underway on post-election priorities. The White House spokesman, Jay Carney, briefing reporters, refused to discuss specifics beyond saying that the administration is always working on budget issues. The big problem looming is a face-off with Congress over tackling the 'fiscal cliff', major spending cuts to reduce the burgeoning deficit.</p> <p>\"The president has said and believes that after the election we will be able to come together in a bipartisan way to resolve these issues and to deal with our deficit and debt challenge with a balanced proposal that reflects an overwhelming consensus among experts and the American people about how we should get this done. And he looks forward to tackling those issues after the election,\" Carney said.</p> <p>Romney, in his first speech of the day in Virginia, stuck too to his stump speech, reprising an anecdotes about Boy Scouts, the song America the Beautiful and lines from a fictional football team in the show Friday Night Lights in which there was a rallying cry on the way out of the locker room: \"clear eyes, full hearts, can't lose\". Romney is persisting with the latter in spite of complaints from the show's writer.</p>",
  "<p>American pop music has been steeped in the idea of rebellion since the days when <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2MuH6nhZMA\" title=\"\">Elvis Presley's swivelling hips were deemed too hot for television</a>. Should Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney pull out a victory next week, it could, for better or worse, reframe the narrative of rebellion, with popular acts having a lightning-rod figure to rail against and distressed thirtysomethings taking to their garages and, in a nod to the 80s hardcore scene, starting thrashy outfits called Romney Youth.</p> <p>Looking at the artists who have backed Romney provides a bit of a jumping-off point for how this might play out. Kid Rock, the Detroit-born rap-rocker-turned-AutoTuned troubadour, is <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmYfqmZMt6I\" title=\"\">pop's most prominent Romney supporter</a>; he'll perform at the Republican nominee's final rally this coming Monday in New Hampshire. Meat Loaf also made internet waves last month after he was <a href=\"http://entertainment.nbcnews.com/_news/2012/10/26/14724826-meat-loaf-screams-wails-america-the-beautiful-for-mitt-romney?lite\" title=\"\">photographed in a state of dashboard-light-adjacent levels of ecstasy</a> while on stage with the candidate; John Rich of arena-country duo Big &amp; Rich was also on that night's bill. This summer, karaoke stalwarts <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/johnclarke/2012/08/27/journey-paid-500000-to-play-republican-national-convention-fundraiser/\" title=\"\">Journey played the Republican National Convention</a>, where Republican vice-presidential candidate Paul Ryan garnered laughs by bragging about how his listening to AC/DC and Led Zeppelin showed his relative hipness.</p> <p>In contrast, Obama's recent rallies have featured performers such as Bruce Springsteen and Katy Perry (who wore <a href=\"http://articles.nydailynews.com/2012-10-25/news/34734452_1_barack-obama-nevada-polls\" title=\"\">a body-hugging dress bearing a ballot paper</a> during her performance); pop power-couple Jay-Z and Beyonc\u00e9 also threw a $4m fundraiser for the president at Jay's 40/40 Club in September. The demographic stratification here is pretty obvious and almost ridiculous in a high-school definition of \"cool\" sense. Romney's musician supporters tend to be older, whiter, and more often male, while Obama has youth, diversity, and Crazy in Love on his side. (Not that Romney hasn't tried; he told an interviewer this summer that he was a big fan of the Killers, whose Brandon Flowers shares Romney's Mormon faith. Last month, however, Flowers demurred when asked about his political leanings, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2012/oct/25/brandon-flowers-world-against-christian-man\" title=\"\">telling the Guardian</a> that the band was neutral on the subject of the election.)</p> <p>The seeds of discontent have already been planted for reasons both political and personal. When Ryan mentioned his appreciation of Rage Against the Machine, the poli-rap-rock group's guitarist Tom Morello took some time out from soundtracking the Occupy movement to <a href=\"http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/tom-morello-paul-ryan-is-the-embodiment-of-the-machine-our-music-rages-against-20120816\" title=\"\">politely suggest</a> that the Wisconsin politician (who he referred to as a \"right wing nut job\") should get to Googling the band's lyrics. He wasn't the only musician to get peeved by the Romney/Ryan playlist: the dreamgaze act Silversun Pickups had their lawyer shoot off a cease and desist order to the campaign after it used the group's song Panic Switch, and <a href=\"http://www.inquisitr.com/310211/dee-snider-of-twisted-sister-tells-mitt-romney-and-paul-ryan-to-stop-using-his-song/\" title=\"\">Dee Snider of Twisted Sister also objected</a> to his band's agitated 80s anthem We're Not Gonna Take It being used at rallies.</p> <p>Musicians have been getting angry at politicians for appropriating their songs ever since Ronald Reagan's campaign managers only paid attention to the chorus of Born in the USA, but it's not too much of a stretch to think that this agitation would spill over into music. In the rock world, that would represent something of a shift; mainstream rock in this decade is starting finally to shake off the post-grunge scowl that it has worn since the 90s, with <a href=\"http://www.billboard.com/news/mumford-sons-babel-scores-biggest-debut-1007965952.story\" title=\"\">Mumford &amp; Sons dominating the sales charts</a> and heirs to their folked-out throne such as the Lumineers and Of Monsters &amp; Men making their own inroads. The music is airy and punctuated by campfire-choir singalongs and a feeling of optimism, if not happiness. Toughening them up might actually do them some good, or at least give them some of the urgency possessed by their other obvious forebears, Arcade Fire.</p> <p>The place to look for a truly rebellious sound might seem like the least likely: radio stations pumping out top-40 hits. In recent years, a strain of pop that could be dubbed It-Gets-Better-Core has carved out a small, yet crucial, niche on the charts. And those chart-topping \"you do you\" songs, like Katy Perry's Firework and Ke$ha's <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q97c5szTgIA\" title=\"\">We R Who We R</a>, and even One Direction's What Makes You Beautiful, were seemingly inspired by the <a href=\"http://www.itgetsbetter.org/\" title=\"\">It Gets Better movement</a>, which was started to help LGBTQ youth deal with harassment in school and at home. Given that Romney and his party are against basic rights for gay people to the point of vehemence, songs that are plainly about accepting one's self no matter what societal pressures exist might be a truly nervy form of political protest \u2013 and if they have a good beat and can be danced to, all the better.</p>",
  "<p>\u2022 First came the suspension of politics. Then, exactly one day later, came the awkward splitting of reality into two: bipartisanship of a genuinely stirring kind in those areas worst hit by Sandy \u2013 and the resumption of warfare elsewhere. As Barack Obama and the New Jersey governor, Chris Christie, surveyed storm damage, the president's press secretary told reporters: \"It's not a time for politics.\" Translated from Washingtonese, that meant \"release the Biden\" \u2013 and the vice-president responded with a Greatest Hits retrospective. \"<a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/election-2012/wp/2012/10/31/vp-im-being-a-good-biden-today/\" title=\"\">I'm being a good Biden today</a>,\" he told one crowd, though he did also call the Cleveland Plain Dealer, an Ohio paper, \"<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=IC2b_6ztnoU\" title=\"\">one of the major newspapers in this state</a>\", which technically speaking wasn't Ohio but Florida. He also needlessly risked offence by <a href=\"http://www.buzzfeed.com/zekejmiller/joe-biden-are-you-indian-man-american\" title=\"\">asking a member of the public</a> \"Are you Indian?\" (\"American,\" the man replied.) And he insisted on telephoning one supporter's Republican brother, engaging him in an impromptu debate on healthcare, then expressing the hope that \"you'll vote for me in 2016\" \u2013 thereby <a href=\"ttp://www.latimes.com/news/politics/la-pn-biden-presidential-campaign-2016-20121031,0,4332077.story\" title=\"\">apparently announcing a run for the presidency</a>.</p> <p>\u2022 Not that the president's camp seemed troubled. Indeed, Obama's senior adviser, David Axelrod, was so sure of victory in the crucial states of Michigan, Minnesota and Pennsylvania, he told NBC, that he'd \"come on [television] and I will shave off my moustache of 40 years if we lose any of those three states\". The American Moustache Institute (\"protecting the rights of, and fighting discrimination against, moustached Americans\"), which exists solely for comedic purposes, condemned the offer as \"incredibly irresponsible\". All credit to the Washington Post's Natalie Jennings, though, for <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/election-2012/wp/2012/10/31/axelrod-bets-his-moustache-on-three-states/\" title=\"\">pointing out</a> that at least Axelrod was \"willing to put his money slightly above where his mouth is\". Current polling averages suggest his facial hair is probably safe \u2013 though it could be close. No, not a \"close shave\". We're not writing gags for Joe Biden here.</p> <p>\u2022 Just how deep does political division run in the toss-up state of Colorado? The highways outside the city of Boulder are peppered with the burrows of prairie dogs, a species of rodent related to the squirrel, and also, it seems, blessed with a degree of political awareness unusual among herbivorous burrowing animals. The Boulder Daily Camera newspaper <a href=\"http://www.dailycamera.com/ci_21886717\" title=\"\">reports</a> that tiny \"yard signs\" have started to appear outside their roadside burrows, bearing the logos of the Romney and Obama campaigns. The split in signage was roughly 50/50, suggesting that neither side can yet feel confident in having locked down the prairie dog vote, though admittedly it's also possible that the whole thing is some kind of prank. (Prairie dogs are well-known for their love of practical jokes.)</p> <p>\u2022 Squeaking in under the wire comes the election's best campaign ad, from Richard Tisei, a Republican congressional candidate from Massachusetts. It consists of 27 seconds of <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=Alzz11k9yMk\" title=\"\">relaxing footage of a Massachusetts beach</a>, apparently at sunrise, the waves lapping gently on the sand. \"Because you need a break from all the campaign ads,\" reads the caption. Contemplative quiet, gentle humour, and an appreciation for the natural environment: why haven't the Republicans expelled Tisei yet?</p>",
  "<p>Life in America's hurricane battered north-east slowly headed towards normality on Thursday as presidential election campaigning resumed, public transport networks struggled to life and power began to come back on.</p> <p>But the impact of devastating superstorm Sandy was still being felt across the region as more of the damage inflicted by the history-making weather system was revealed, the death toll more than 140, with 74 dead in the US, many more missing and some five million people were still without electricity.</p> <p>New Jersey remained the centre of destruction as state officials began to count the cost of the direct hit on the state's famed Jersey Shore of beach towns, casinos and boardwalks. It is thought Sandy will inflict $30bn of damage in New Jersey alone.</p> <p>In Hoboken, just across the Hudson river from New York, the US National Guard patrolled debris-strewn flooded streets in Humvees hoping to evacuate 20,000 stranded residents. City officials there had launched a desperate appeal for supplies of flashlights, food, generators, fuel and water.</p> <p>All along the coastline of New Jersey, scenes of disaster emerged, from shattered boardwalks, to coast roads suddenly turned into beaches, to houses reduced to piles of wood. In south Mantoloking, the ruins of home still smouldered after a terrible fire. In Sayreville, it emerged that almost 200 people had been rescued by boat. In Atlantic City, local officials contemplated a huge blow to their casino-based economy amid streets that had been flooded waist deep. In Jersey City, a curfew was put in effect. Across the state, huge queues built up at petrol stations as desperate drivers tried to fill up their cars amid a tightening of supplies.</p> <p>In Seaside Heights, rows of houses had been effectively flattened by Sandy's enormous flood surge. Seaside's boardwalk, which featured in MTV's hit reality show Jersey Shore, has been uprooted, amusement rides beside Casino Pier have been swept into the sea, and sand covered coastal streets and houses. City officials simply asked people to leave town. \"We have to get everyone off the island because there is total devastation,\" Seaside Heights police chief Thomas Boyd said at an earlier press conference.</p> <p>One of the main problems many areas have faced is that the flood waters are polluted with oil and chemicals after Sandy struck such a built-up part of the country. Officials also warned that 336,000 gallons of diesel fuel had spilled into the waters around Staten Island and New Jersey after a storage tank was ruptured and lifted from its holdings. Authorities say the fuel, which leaked at the Motiva oil tank facility in Woodbridge, was now contained in booms on the ocean.</p> <p>In New York, however, there were increasing signs of life as America's largest city struggled \u2013 sometimes chaotically \u2013 to get back to normality. Commuter railway lines sputtered back to life but were inundated with customers. So was the subway system as a limited service began and was immediately swamped by people who began queuing up at 5am to catch a train. The city's streets were often clogged with traffic and massive jams built up as Mayor Michael Bloomberg tried to control the number of cars in the city by barring any carrying less than three passengers.</p> <p>Bloomberg was also currently resisting calls to cancel the New York marathon scheduled for Sunday. Numerous politicians have appealed for him to scrap the event as the city copes with aftershock of Sandy, but so far the famous road race remains on track to takee place. \"It's a great event for New York, and I think for those who were lost, you've got to believe they would want us to have an economy and have a city go on,\" Bloomberg said.</p> <p>All three main airports in the New York area were also expected to be operational on Thursday after waters receded from LaGuardia, the final airport to open, which sits just a few feet above sea level by the East river.</p> <p>However, as working life returned to some areas of New York, many neighbourhoods were still without power. ConEdison reported that 719,000 of its own customers in the New York area were without power, with 227,000 of those in Manhattan though it was predicting full power would be restored there by Saturday. But for the moment, life in downtown Manhattan is still an eerie experience for those suddenly taken back to living an electricity-free era. Many thousands of residents have simply left to stay with friends and family in other parts of the city. Others are putting up with darkened hallways, no lifts and living by candlelight.</p> <p>Though a few restaurants and food shops are open, the vast majority of businesses on the usually frantic and busy city streets are closed. Many of the areas more famous residents have fled the usually fashionable neighbourhood. The New York Post reported that film stars like Naomi Watts and Russell Crowe, model Helena Christensen and Vogue editor Anna Wintour had all fled uptown for the plush Mark Hotel on the Upper East Side.</p> <p>Others had less options. Diane Ward, a 76-year-old who has lived in the East Village neighbourhood for 45 years, stayed put to look after her cat. She had just gone to a local home supplies store that was hawking candles and batteries on the street. \"I bought some candles,\" she explained. \"It is depressing inside when you are living by flashlight. Candles are much nicer.\"</p> <p>Meanwhile, America's election campaign was back in top gear.</p> <p>President Barack Obama had visited New Jersey on Wednesday in the company of its Republican governor Chris Christie, who is usually a staunch critic. But that rare political truce was over on Thursday as both Obama joined Republican challenger Mitt Romney back on the campaign trail.</p> <p>In Wisconsin, Obama implicitly reminded his audience of Romney's habit of making dramatic changes on issues. \"You know what I believe. You know where I stand. You know that I'll make tough political decisions even when they are not popular,\" Obama said. \"After all we've been through together, we can't give up now.\"</p> <p>Meanwhile, Romney was back on the attack, mentioning the president by name for the first time in two days. At a campaign stop in Virginia he slammed an Obama idea to create a new government agency to help businesses create jobs. \"I don't think adding a new chair to his cabinet will help add millions of jobs on Main Street,\" Romney said.</p> <p>Romney's campaign also released a highly aggressive attack ad in Florida, linking Obama to high-profile socialists in Venezuelan president Hugo Ch\u00e1vez and Cuban dictator Fidel Castro.</p>",
  "<p>Every day three scenes, on the surface unconnected, unfold in different corners of the world. By breakfast time in Macau, China's gambling mecca, thousands of people are inside vast casino resorts spending money on baccarat, poker, slot machines and restaurants. Managers monitor the profit by the hour.</p> <p>By lunchtime in Israel commuters and shoppers are perusing Israel Hayom, a brash giveaway tabloid and the country's most-read newspaper. It supports the government of Binyamin Netanyahu. And it clobbers rival dailies to the point of extinction.</p> <p>By dinnertime viewers in Florida, Ohio, Colorado, Nevada and other swing states in the US presidential election are watching, for the umpteenth time that day, television advertisements attacking Barack Obama and promoting Mitt Romney. Their volume and cost have set records.</p> <p>This eclectic, global triptych is connected by a fourth, less visible scene. In the quiet hum of his air-conditioned Las Vegas headquarters a short, portly man with thinning red hair absorbs reports detailing it all, Macau, Israel, the election, because in every one he is a player. He crunches the profits, circulation and polling and ponders his next move. His name is Sheldon Adelson, and he is one of the world's richest men.</p> <p>\"I suppose you could say that I live on Vince Lombardi's belief. Winning isn't everything, it's the only thing,\" <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0912/81588.html\">he told a recent interviewer,</a> citing the legendary American football coach. \"So, I do whatever it takes, as long as it's moral, ethical, principled, legal.\"</p> <p>No one doubts Adelson, 79, lives to win. But with the White House race entering the final stretch of what both sides call the most important election in decades there is growing controversy over his business interests and methods.</p> <p>\"I've studied Sheldon Adelson closely but I don't claim to know him,\" said John L Smith, a Las Vegas-based author and columnist who tangled with him in a bitter court case. \"I'm like a kid at the zoo watching the big predator but not understanding.\"</p> <p>How the son of immigrants \u2013 Adelson's Lithuanian-born father was a taxi driver, his British-born mother a seamstress \u2013 rose from poverty in Boston's tough Dorchester district to become a force in global politics and commerce is, depending on your perspective, an inspiring story of entrepreneurial grit and flair, or a cautionary tale of plutocracy and democratic dysfunction.</p> <p>Adelson, with a fortune valued at over $20bn, controls a unique web linking gaming empires in Nevada and Asia, media control in Israel and mega-donations to Romney and other Republican candidates.</p> <p>He represents a new breed of tycoon, said Chrystia Freeland, the editor of Thomson Reuters Digital and author of Plutocrats: the rise of the new global super-rich and the fall of everyone else. \"The caricature is of conspicuous consumption, yachts and jets, but for the super-rich the real status symbol is having a voice, having an impact on public policy, and in that sense Sheldon is characteristic of his class.\"</p> <p>He is not shy about declaring his wealth. \"You know,\" <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2008/06/30/080630fa_fact_bruck#ixzz2A4OeCImt\">he reportedly bragged to George W Bush</a>, when he was president in 2008, \"I am the richest Jew in the world.\"</p> <p>If few knew that then, many know now. Adelson has burst onto the international stage by becoming, as one observer noted, \"sugar daddy\" to zionist and conservative causes.</p> <p>He is a modern Croesus who converts cash into influence. The question, which to critics becomes more urgent with each day of the campaign, is the extent to which he may convert, or try to convert, influence into cash. In a written reply to Guardian questions, Adelson said he wished only that the White House invite him to its annual Hanukah party and save him some potato pancakes.</p> <h2>'He doesn't give up'</h2> <p>A Romney victory could yield Adelson billions in tax cuts and make the White House an ally. His businesses are under investigation from the justice department and other agencies over alleged wrongdoing in Asia.</p> <p>There was little in his background to suggest Adelson would become the right's impresario. Reared in liberal Massachusetts, he worked his way through multiple jobs \u2013 vending machine salesman, court reporter, real estate dealer, toiletries packager \u2013 and scored big with Comdex, a computer trade show he launched in 1979.</p> <p>In 1988 he bought a chunk of the Sands hotel and casino, a fading, one-time rat pack haunt and turned it into Las Vegas Sands Corporation, a glitzy triumph with the Venetian as its flagship. He gambled, correctly, that if he built convention centres conferences would flock to Sin City.</p> <p>Even in a town known to be filled with tough operators, Adelson's steeliness stood out. He drove aides as hard as he did himself, did not take no for an answer, and did not forgive trespasses.</p> <p>He successfully sued the Daily Mail for libel and in a separate case went after Smith and his publisher, Barricade Books, over a depiction of Adelson in Smith's book Sharks in the Desert.</p> <p>Threatened with a $15m lawsuit, the publisher entered bankruptcy and agreed to a judgement of libel. Smith also entered bankruptcy. A judge dismissed the suit against him and ordered Adelson to pay some of the author's costs. \"He's a real sweetheart,\" said Smith. \"He doesn't give up.\"</p> <p>Ron Reese, a spokesman who who has represented Adelson for a decade, defended his boss. \"It is easy to be a critic of someone if you don't know them, haven't taken the time to learn about their values, or if you are simply jealous of their accomplishments. It's a lot like criticising the coaches and players of a football match you didn't watch or attend. The fact is, Mr Adelson is among the world's greatest philanthropists and has created tens of thousands of jobs throughout his business career.\"</p> <p>What vaulted Adelson into a league Donald Trump can only dream of was Macau, the former Portuguese colony that is part of China and hosts gambling under the \"one country, two systems formula\".</p> <p>He outfoxed rival casino moguls to open the territory's first Las Vegas-style resort, the Sands Macao, in 2004. In reality it is two vast resorts, one of them the world's biggest. On its first day the crowd reportedly ripped doors off their hinges in a stampede for the gaming tables. Adelson recouped his $265m investment within a year.</p> <p>\"In 2004-5 the big question was when Macau would overtake Las Vegas; it was taking about $4bn to Las Vegas's $6bn. Now Macau is taking nearly $40bn a year - and Las Vegas is still on about $6bn,\" said Aaron Fischer, head of consumer and gaming research at CLSA Asia Pacific Markets.</p> <p>Asia \u2013 he expanded into Singapore \u2013 has made him a multi-billionaire. \"Other guys have made promises that may be they weren't able to deliver on. Sheldon stuck to the promises that he made [to officials] even though they have not always been perceived to have the best relationship,\" said Fischer.</p> <p>\"He doesn't have a reputation for always saying the right thing. I really think he's a character. I respect him and I find him to be quite honest and very down to earth. Maybe that's sometimes been his problem; he's not very good at diplomacy.\"</p> <p>Sergio Terra, editorial executive director of the Portugese-language newspaper Tribuna Macau, said Chinese officials bristled even as they benefited from Adelson's investment.</p> <p>\"He wanted everything and everything first. That's not the way the Macau government works. And he had to adjust to the Beijing approach. They don't like pressure.\"</p> <p>One veteran observer of the casino industry, who declined to be named, said Adelson charged through barriers. \"It's served him well but he might have knocked down a few too many and used weapons that are going to be subject to review by regulators. I think his quest is to be the world's richest man \u2013 I don't think he's made any secret of that. He's always referring to his ranking.\"</p> <p>Las Vegas Sands faces three lawsuits over its Macau operations: a former executive, Steve Jacobs, claims wrongful dismissal and alleges the company collaborated with triads and sought to blackmail officials. The company is also snagged in a bribery scandal and claims it violated US anti-money laundering laws. Adelson vehemently denies wrongdoing. \"We're going to be found absolutely clean,\" he said last year. The company blamed the accusations on disgruntled former employees.</p> <h2>Breaking into the Israeli newspaper market</h2> <p>Macau is the golden egg, but Israel is Adelson's enduring passion. The mogul often tells the story how he stepped off the plane for the first time wearing the shoes of his late father, who had been too poor to travel. His commitment has grown since marrying his second wife, Miriam, an Israeli, in 1991.</p> <p>The Adelsons have underwritten think tanks, exchange programmes, DC-based lobby groups and, most controversially, the interests of Netanyahu. Adelson believes Israel's hawkish prime minister is a necessary bulwark to supposed peace talks and Palestinian statehood, a prospect he abhors.</p> <p>After false starts, Adelson established his tabloid, Israel Hayom, in 2007. It now has a 38% share of the weekday newspaper market, compared to 36% for its main rival Yedioth Ahronoth, 11% for Ma'ariv and 7% for Haaretz.</p> <p>The heavily advertised paper is given away by uniformed distributors on the streets, outside supermarkets and at gas stations. It also has paid home-delivery sales.</p> <p>Its partisanship earned the nicknamed \"Bibiton\", a play on the prime minister's nickname and the Hebrew word for newspaper.</p> <p>Many have blamed it for the catastrophic demise of paid-for newspapers. Maariv faces possible closure. Haaretz is also in crisis, with layoffs and pay cuts looming. Yedioth announced cutbacks earlier this year, including dozens of job losses.</p> <p>The Israeli business website Globes quoted a senior Yedioth executive as saying: \"You must know that Israel Hayom is destroying Israeli journalism not only at the professional level, with its embarrassing editorial conduct, but also at the economic level.\"</p> <p>Israel Hayom was breaking the market with ads at zero cost, crippling rivals' revenue streams, he said. \"Israel Hayom has finished Ma'ariv, and it is now finishing Haaretz. Adelson has simply brought ruin.\"</p> <p>The mogul's friends disagree. \"He put his money up for an alternative voice and people liked it. That's capitalism,\" said Sig Rogich, a businessman and media consultant in Las Vegas. Rogich also defended his friend's plunge into this year's US presidential and congressional races after years of confining himself to Nevada politics. He has shattered records by spending an estimated $70m backing Republican candidates nationwide.</p> <p>\"This is a country built on the principle of freedom of speech,\" said Rogich. \"When George Soros funded the other side no one complained. Sheldon has been transparent (about his contributions). You have to admire the truthfulness of standing up and telling the world that's he's responsible for the message.\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398724982\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2012/8/4/1344108450223/Sheldon-Adelson-and-his-w-008.jpg\" alt=\"Sheldon Adelson and his wife Miriam\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sheldon Adelson and his wife, Miriam, expanded their involvement in US politics out of Nevada and onto a national state in the 2012 presidential campaign.

As the money has flowed, and as Paul Ryan and other Republican figures paid homage to their benefactor in Las Vegas, the New York Times, among others, <a href=\"www.nytimes.com/2012/08/17/.../in-thrall-to-sheldon-adelson.html\">asked what does he expect in return</a>. </p> <p>Consciously or not, at a private fundraiser Romney echoed Adelson's views when he appeared to dismiss a two-state solution and said the Palestinians had no interest in peace. The Republican's proposed tax cuts could swell the mogul's bank account by about $2bn.</p> <p>In an interview with Politico, Adelson, who runs the only non-unionised resort on the Las Vegas strip, accused Obama's administration of waging a vendetta. If Romney wins, observers will closely watch the fate of the probes into Adelson's businesses.</p> <p>Onkar Ghate, a vice-president of the Ayn Rand Institute, which champions free markets, said tycoons had a right to fight back against vindictive governments: \"If they spend money purely defensively then I think that's entirely correct.\"</p> <p>But others, <a href=\"http://www.economist.com/node/21564418\">including the Economist</a>, fret that Super Pacs backed by the \"0.1%\" are rigging the system and entrenching inequality. \"It is hard to believe that this surge of cash from the richest will have no impact at all.\"</p> <p>Freeland, the author of Plutocrats, said Adelson's activism raised profound issues. \"Democracy is supposed to be one person, one vote. But when economic disparity grows and transfers into political disparity, well, you have to ask where it's going.\"</p> <h2>A conversation with Sheldon Adelson</h2> <p><strong>Guardian: You have made substantial donations to the Romney campaign. Do you expect a return from this investment? How do you respond to critics who say you are buying influence?</strong></p> <p><strong>Sheldon Adelson:</strong> I do not expect any type of return, except that if the candidate we are supporting becomes president he maintains this country's freedom and its free-market capitalist ways, as opposed to his opponent who I believe is following socialist policies \u2013 it may work in other countries, but not here.</p> <p>There is absolutely no expectation of any favoritism whatsoever, though If I'm fortunate enough to be invited to the White House Hanukkah Party I hope someone would save me a couple of potato pancakes. They ran out the last time I was there.</p> <p><strong>Guardian: Some critics also say a Romney victory could yield you billions in tax cuts and possible protection from multiple investigations into your business affairs. How do you respond?</strong></p> <p><strong>SA: </strong>I would be entitled to no preferential tax cuts or any other type of preferential treatment whatsoever. Any tax cuts that would apply to me would apply to President Obama, his wealthy donors, and everyone else. By the way, what is wrong with supporting a candidate whose economic views and values are the same as yours?</p> <p><strong>Guardian: It's been said of you that you are probably the most aggressive, unforgiving individual in the business world today. What do you say to that?</strong></p> <p><strong>SA:</strong> Friends I've had for as long as 70 years would never match that word with me or my way of life. The word unforgiving and my name don't belong together \u2013 it is inconsistent with my concept of giving away much more than I make or spend on my family to help repair the world \u2013 through our drug treatment centers which rehabilitate drug addicts, specifically women who turn to prostitution because of drugs; our medical research foundation; the strong support we provide for our military veterans here in the United States and many other causes.</p>",

We will elect the important national leaders at this meeting. It is very significant: many people's hopes and expectations are attached to it,\" said Wu, party secretary of Huaxi \u2013 \"<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/oct/06/huaxi-village-tower-china\" title=\"\">China's richest village</a>\" \u2013 and one of 2,270 delegates who will gather in Beijing for the 18th party congress on 8 November.</p> <p>\"I think people in other countries will care about the congress, just as we care about the presidential election in the United States,\" he added.</p> <p>That may be optimistic, but China's rise means that the handover's reverberations will eventually be felt around the globe.</p> <p>\"Whether you are in the US or UK, what China does matters now,\" said Dali Yang, a political scientist at the University of Chicago.</p> <p>Two days after the US goes to the polls, the world's second-largest economy \u2013 and a fifth of its population \u2013 will see the beginning of the power shift from Hu Jintao and his peers to younger leaders under Xi Jinping.</p> <p>All but two of the Politburo standing committee, the country's top political body, will step down. About two-thirds of positions in the other key leadership organs and the Central Committee will change hands. Over time, the effects will ripple through the wider party and state systems.</p> <p>To treat the handover as a standalone event is misleading. In the US, Barack Obama and Mitt Romney's neck-and-neck contest will be decided only when polls open. In China, Xi's ascendancy, and Li Keqiang's elevation to replace Premier Wen Jiabao, were signalled at the last party congress in 2007.</p> <p>The gathering in Beijing next week is merely the manifestation of the backstage process that began years ago, when the jockeying for power started, and will run through to next spring - when Xi becomes president - and even further; his authority will in part depend on when Hu Jintao steps down as chairman of the Central Military Commission, for example.</p> <p>In the US, the candidates have laid out dramatically different programmes. In China, where a consensus-driven system stresses continuity, it is impossible to know what Xi stands for, what he plans and what he will be able to achieve.</p> <p>As general secretary, Xi will be first among equals; the composition of the standing committee as a whole, which remains uncertain, will be crucial. And the general course of future policy will be outlined by the congress's political report, hammered out within the party over this year.</p> <p>The biggest contrast, of course, is that despite Wu's words, even China's 82 million Communist party members \u2013 never mind the rest of the 1.4 billion population \u2013 have no real role in choosing their leader.</p> <p>The outside world thinks of Hu foremost as the Chinese president. But he holds that position, and wields his power, because he is general secretary of the party \u2013 China's state system is interlocked with the party structure, but subservient to it.</p> <p>The party congress is at the heart of a procedural facade that presents the handover as the result of an series of bottom-up decisions. In reality, Xi has been chosen by the current leadership, with input from party elders and others.</p> <p>\"The political struggles and the negotiations before and after the Congress are important \u2013 the meeting [itself] is just going through the formalities,\" said Chen Ziming, an independent political scholar based in Beijing.</p> <p>Delegates like Wu \u2013 \"elite party members with a firm political stand, virtue, fine working style, excellent achievements and comparatively strong capability\", in the words of the state news agency \u2013 represent electoral blocs within the party, such as provinces and state-owned enterprises.</p> <p>They elect the 400 or so members of the central committee, who convene as soon as the congress closes, about a week after it opens, to \"elect\" the politburo standing committee.</p> <p>In reality, they are implementing choices made at the top. All of which raises an obvious question: why bother?</p> <p>\"It is a fake phenomenon to show their power,\" said Jin Zhong, a veteran political analyst based in Hong Kong. Yang suggested that the process \"confers some measure of procedural legitimacy within the Communist party\".</p> <p>And while major decisions are reached in advance, there can be minor upsets. Although candidates for the central committee only just outnumber the available places, people have missed out on the jobs they expected after an unexpected failure to make it through. But Yang also pointed out that holding the congress forces those at the top to reach agreement on the new leadership, even if they may not do so until the eleventh hour.</p> <p>This year has proved a bumpier ride than many expected, and not just thanks to the toppling of the Chongqing party secretary, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/bo-xilai\" title=\"\">Bo Xilai</a>, who is under investigation by criminal prosecutors. His wife, Gu Kailai, was convicted of murdering the British businessman Neil Heywood, but even if that scandal had not erupted, Bo's evident ambition and populist campaigning had alarmed many in the party. The organisation brought to power by Mao Zedong has worked for years to institutionalise politics and prevent the rise of another charismatic, destabilising figure.</p> <p>The party elite is all the more nervous because this is the first succession not ordained by the founders of the People's Republic. Deng Xiaoping, then paramount leader , anointed Hu as Jiang Zemin's successor as general secretary, but \u2013 by design \u2013 no one wields that kind of authority within the party these days.</p> <p>\"It is not a smooth transition. It is full of contradictions and struggles and compromises too,\" said Li Weidong, a Beijing-based political commentator and former magazine editor. Some believe that even now there is disagreement over who will join the standing committee, though others insist a deal has been reached.</p> <p>\"This time, the political struggle is more intensive than the past,\" said Zhang Lifan, a Beijing-based scholar. \"I don't think the political struggles have finished. I think they have just finished the first round. It will last until the National Congress finishes, until the final name list of the standing committee comes out. It is just like they are playing bridge, and bidding.\"</p>",
  "<p>On 27 February 1973, members and supporters of the <a href=\"http://www.aimovement.org/\" title=\"\">American Indian Movement (AIM)</a>, mostly Lakota Sioux, occupied the town of Wounded Knee, South Dakota \u2013 the site of what is sometimes described as the last battle of the Indian wars, where in December 1890 the US 7th Cavalry, the regiment led by General Custer at the Little Big Horn, massacred some 350 Lakota, mostly women and children.</p> <p>The 300 protesters were soon surrounded by some 800 federal marshals, FBI agents and national guardsmen in a siege that lasted 71 days and led to the deaths of two Native Americans, one a Cherokee, and left one agent paralysed.</p> <p>As the spokesman for AIM brought to Washington to negotiate, Russell Means, who has died aged 72 after suffering from throat cancer, became the leading face of Native Americans. Viewed as the most notorious Indian since Sitting Bull, he assumed a position of de facto leadership that often put him at odds with his fellow activists, as well as with the authorities. With long braids and a sculpted face, Means looked the part. Years later he would pursue an acting career, most notably as Chingachgook in Michael Mann's The Last of the Mohicans (1992). But Means had always been a keen actor in the sort of political theatre which was a prominent, if only occasionally successful, part of 1960s protest.</p> <p>He almost literally drifted into Native American activism. Born Russell Charles Means into the Oglala Sioux on the Pine Ridge reservation, South Dakota, his Oglala name was Oyate Wacinyapin, \"works for the people\". During the second world war, his father, Hank, moved the family to San Francisco to work in shipyards. Russell faced discrimination growing up in Vallejo, and became a delinquent. He tried college four times, but moved across the west back to reservations, finally finding work first with the Rosebud Sioux tribal council, then with the federal Office of Economic Opportunity.</p> <p>In Cleveland, Ohio, he met Dennis Banks, co-founder of AIM, which he joined in time to take part in the 1969 occupation of Alcatraz Island, San Francisco Bay. He became AIM's national director and organised the boarding of a replica of the Mayflower during Thanksgiving Day celebrations at Plymouth Rock, Massachusetts, in 1970. In 1971, at the Mount Rushmore national memorial in the Black Hills of South Dakota, he urinated on the giant visage of George Washington, and filed a $9m defamation suit against the Cleveland Indians baseball team and their mascot, Chief Wahoo. The following year, he led the Trail of Broken Treaties occupation of the Bureau of Indian Affairs in Washington, which ended, as the protest at Wounded Knee would, with promises of meetings with government officials.</p> <p>After Wounded Knee, Means and Banks were charged with assault, conspiracy and larceny but were acquitted in 1974 due to the prosecution's misconduct and collusion with the FBI. Means ran for president of the Oglala but lost the election amid claims of voter fraud and intimidation against the incumbent, which led to riots outside a Sioux Falls courthouse. He was shot by an agent of the Bureau of Indian Affairs in 1975, and survived two assassination attempts within the next year. In 1976 he was acquitted of abetting murder in a bar-room brawl, but convicted of charges stemming from the Sioux Falls riot. He was sent to prison, where he was stabbed, but was released in time to join the celebration, at the Little Big Horn, Montana, of the 100th anniversary of Custer's last stand.</p> <p>Means was often involved in political conflicts within AIM and was frequently accused of self-promotion, not least when he agreed to become the running mate of Larry Flynt, the publisher of Hustler magazine, in his attempt to become the Republican candidate in the 1984 US presidential election. Four years later he lost his bid to become the Libertarian party's presidential nomination to the future Republican senator and candidate Ron Paul.</p> <p>He split AIM over his support for the Miskito Indians of Nicaragua, driven from their lands by the Sandinista government. Many AIM members refused to follow Means's support of the rightwing Contra movement, amid accusations of widespread fraud with monies given to the Contras to benefit the Miskito. In 1988 he resigned, for the sixth and final time, from AIM, which split officially five years later.</p> <p>Means's acting career then blossomed. After The Last of the Mohicans, he appeared in Oliver Stone's Natural Born Killers (1994) and was the voice of Powhatan in Disney's Pocahontas and its sequel (1995, 1998). In more than 30 films and television movies he played such heroes as Jim Thorpe and Sitting Bull, as well as sending himself up in the TV comedy Duckman. Means published an autobiography, Where White Men Fear to Tread (1995), in which he defended the use of violent confrontation: \"It told the world that John Wayne hadn't killed us all.\"</p> <p>In 2007 Means was arrested in Denver for blocking the city's Columbus Day parade \u2013 which he accused of celebrating genocide \u2013 and, following the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples the same year, he tried to unilaterally declare an independent Lakota nation.</p> <p>Divorced four times, he is survived by his fifth wife, Pearl, and 10 children.</p> <p>\u2022 Russell Charles Means, Native American activist and actor, born 10 November 1939; died 22 October 2012</p>",
  "<p>The invitation to the White House in the spring of 2009 struck Barack Obama's allies in the environmental movement as a big moment: a clear sign that climate change was on his radar and that the president was eager to get to work.</p> <p>The event was indeed a turning point, but not the one campaigners expected. Instead, it marked a strategic decision by the White House to downplay climate change \u2013 avoiding the very word \u2013 a decision some campaigners on the guestlist say produced the strange absence of climate change from the 2012 campaign, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/oct/31/sandy-climate-change-us-election\" title=\"\">until hurricane Sandy blew it right back on the political agenda</a>.</p> <p>The storm \u2013 which <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/30/obama-sandy-aftermath-campaign?utm_term=%23SGS&amp;utm_source=twitterfeed&amp;utm_medium=twitter\" title=\"\">interrupted campaigning for three of the last eight days of the presidential race</a> \u2013 may even prove the decisive factor in the elections, with voters <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/30/new-jersey-christie-obama-response-sandy\" title=\"\">watching how Obama handles Sandy's aftermath</a>. The devastation has already sparked debate about America's present-day vulnerability to climate change.</p> <p>But back in 2009, the off-the-record event with the White House green team at the old executive office building offered the first chance for the White House to share its plans for getting a climate change law through Congress. Aides handed round a one-page memo of polling data and talking points.</p> <p>\"It was in the context of the financial collapse. With everyone struggling, how do we connect with the public and build political support when everyone's mind was on the very scary economy,\" said <a href=\"http://breakthroughstrategiesandsolutions.com/About_Us.html\" title=\"\">Betsy Taylor, president of Breakthrough Strategies and Solutions</a> an organisation that works with philanthropic and non-profit clients, who attended the meeting.</p> <p>The answer was clear: climate change was not a winning message. Raising the topic would also leave Obama open to attack from industry and conservative groups opposed to intervention in the economy.</p> <p>\"What was communicated in the presentation was: 'This is what you talk about, and don't talk about climate change'.\" Taylor said. \"I took away an absolutely clear understanding that we should focus on clean energy jobs and the potential of a clean energy economy rather than the threat of climate change.\"</p> <p>The message stuck. Subsequent campaigns from the Obama administration and some environmental groups relegated climate change to a second-tier concern. After industry and conservative groups mobilised to attack Obama's policies and climate science in the summer of 2009, the topic was seen as an even greater liability and politically toxic.</p> <p>There was no mention of climate change during six hours of televised debate. Moderators failed to bring up the question, and Obama and Mitt Romney made no effort to fill in the gaps \u2013 even during a long and heated exchange about offshore drilling and coal.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2012/aug/29/ann-romney-chris-christie-address-video\" title=\"\">Romney's convention speech</a> reduced climate change to a laughline. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/sep/07/barack-obama-mitt-romney-climate\" title=\"\">Obama defended climate science at the Democratic convention</a>, and he answered a question on climate in an MTV interview last month.</p> <p>Otherwise, Obama mentioned climate only in passing and in front of safe or rock-solid Democratic audiences, such as fundraisers in San Francisco and New York or events on college campuses. Since Sandy's devastating storm, a number of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/oct/31/sandy-climate-change-us-election\" title=\"\">prominent Democrats like Bill Clinton and Al Gore have talked about climate change</a>, and taken Romney to task on the issue.</p> <p>Those gathered on 26 March 2009 to hear from key members of Obama's green dream team \u2014 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jan/25/carol-browner-obama-climate-advisor-departs-white-house\" title=\"\">Carol Browner, then energy and climate adviser</a>, Nancy Sutley, chair of the <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/eop/ceq\" title=\"\">Council on Environmental Quality</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/sep/07/van-jones-resignation\" title=\"\">Van Jones, then green jobs adviser</a>, believed it would be a pivotal year.</p> <p>The White House and both houses of Congress were controlled by Democrats, world leaders were due to gather in Copenhagen in December to finalise a global climate change treaty.</p> <p>But the economy was in meltdown. The White House, after studying polling and focus groups, concluded it was best to frame climate change as an economic opportunity, a chance for job creation and economic growth, rather than an urgent environmental problem.</p> <p>\"My most vivid memory of that meeting is this idea that you can't talk about climate change,\" said Jessy Tolkan, who at the time was a leader of the climate youth movement, Power Shift. \"The real sense at that time was that talking about clean energy jobs, green jobs, was the way we were going to be able to gain momentum and usher in real change. Talking about climate change and global warming was not going to resonate as much.\"</p> <p>None of the principal White House officials would talk on the record about the meeting. The White House did not release materials related to the meeting or respond to a request for visitors' records.</p> <p>But most of the environmental groups were inclined to go along. \"When the White House invites you to a meeting and says: 'here is how we are going to talk about these things', it sends a very clear message,\" said <a href=\"http://www.foe.org/about-us/our-team/our-president\" title=\"\">Erich Pica, president of the US Friends of the Earth Action</a>, who was also at the meeting.</p> <p>Now with Obama fighting for re-election, and the climate agenda stalled and under constant attack from Republicans and industry, environmental groups acknowledge the go-softly strategy was a mistake.</p> <p>\"I thought it was a mistake and I told them,\" said Bill McKibben, who heads the <a href=\"http://350.org/\" title=\"\">350.org</a> group, who was one of the few people at the meeting to voice his misgivings. \"All I said was sooner or later you are going to have to talk about this in terms of climate change. Because if you want people to make the big changes that are required by the science then you are going to have to explain to people why that is necessary, and why it's such a huge problem,\" he said.</p> <p>The stealth approach also gave the opposition an opening. The White House reluctance to even mention climate change allowed some in industry and on the right of the political spectrum to discredit climate science.</p> <p>Others argue the strategy of downplaying climate change was a politically necessity. It was na\u00efve to expect to get ambitious measures through Congress in a debate clogged up with scientific detail.</p> <p>\"I don't think it was a mistake,\" said Steve Cochran. vice-president of climate and air at the <a href=\"http://www.edf.org/\" title=\"\">Environmental Defence Fund</a>. \"The people that supported climate were already with us. The people who had questions needed arguments beyond climate, which led to more and more focus on arguments beyond climate.\"</p> <p>Campaign groups agree Obama continued to push the climate agenda, even if he did so below the radar, through the Environmental Protection Agency regulations and other branches of the government.</p> <p>The economic recovery plan included some $90bn for green-ish measures, such as high speed rail and public transport, and weather-proofing low-income homes.</p> <p>Obama also publicly embraced some environmental measures, standing out in front when the administration proposed raising car mileage standards in May 2009. But the president left climate change out of his Earth Day event, and was a no-show in June 2009 at the release of a landmark scientific report on how America's cities and coastlines would be affected by climate change. There was no mention of climate change in his <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/jan/25/state-of-union-2012-environment\" title=\"\">2012 state of the union address</a>.</p> <p>Environmental groups, taking their cue from the White House, also downplayed climate. The coalition pushing for climate change law in Congress called itself Clean Energy Works. The bill itself was called the American Clean Energy and Security Act. Campaign groups ran ads featuring former steel workers in green helmets talking about the well-paying new jobs building wind turbines.</p> <p>\"If you look at the messaging being done during the climate legislation, it was mostly not about climate,\" said Carl Pope, who was then the executive director of the Sierra Club. \"They realised it was going to be a big target as soon as it passed the house.\"</p> <p>And it nearly didn't pass. The house of representatives' vote on the climate bill was uncomfortably close, 219-212, with only eight Republicans supporting and 44 Democrats opposed, and it set off a furious backlash.</p> <p>The oil and gas industry alone spent $175m in 2009 trying to block climate legislation, <a href=\"http://www.opensecrets.org/news/2010/08/pro-environment-groups-were-outmatc.html\" title=\"\">according Open Secrets</a>, which tracks money in politics. The conservative Tea Party movement turned opposition to climate legislation, even climate science, into an article of faith.</p> <p>In the summer of 2010, the US senate dropped the bill, with then Democrat Senate majority leader Harry Reid admitting: \"We know we don't have the votes.\"</p> <p>The administration and environmental groups talked about climate change even less, said Pica, and when they did the connections were even less clear.</p> <p>Facing public confusion about the green jobs promised by Obama's recovery plan, and scepticism about his promise to build a clean energy economy, administration officials switched to talking about climate through healthcare or even national security. They recruited Iraq war veterans to talk about wind energy.</p> <p>\"There was a really big emphasis on talking about what I call the sub-narratives \u2013 that there were other ways to speak about the opportunity and the challenge of climate change rather than calling it that,\" said <a href=\"http://climaterealityproject.org/our-ceo/\" title=\"\">Maggie Fox, the chief executive of Al Gore's Climate Reality Project</a>. \"There was a whole suite of sub-narratives: national security, clean energy future, diversification of energy, health, future generations \u2026 \"</p> <p>But Fox acknowledges none of those reasons \u2013 although compelling \u2013 went far enough in justifying the need for sweeping transformation needed to avoid catastrophic climate change. \"Over time it became in effect an absence of conversation about climate change as a threat, and I think in the end that proved to be unwise because it is the one reason all these storylines matter.\"</p> <p>The problem now, say campaign groups, is that it has become even more difficult for politicians to talk about climate change, even when evidence is all around them in extreme weather events and even when there is growing public concern about climate change. <a href=\"http://environment.yale.edu/climate/files/Climate-Beliefs-September-2012.pdf\" title=\"\">A Yale University study last month found 70% of Americans now believe in the reality of climate change</a>, a sharp rise over the last two years. The administration, the campaigners say, missed an educational opportunity.</p> <p>Obama, in debates and in campaign stops, continued to talk up the importance of investing in America's future through building a clean energy economy. But the connection to the threat of climate change was lost.</p> <p>\"It's really hard to sell clean energy. Clean energy is really struggling because the story has gotten garbled,\" said Larry Schweiger, president of the <a href=\"http://www.nwf.org/\" title=\"\">National Wildlife Federation</a>. \"You can't have a clear conversation, and the reason there can't be a clear conversation is because of this elephant in the room which is climate change.\"</p>",

  "<p>Since the dawn of the television age, political advertising has been a mainstay of American presidential elections, from the infamous \"<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=63h_v6uf0Ao\">Daisy</a>\" spot from Lyndon Johnson against Barry Goldwater (the first political attack ad) to <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbdzMLk9wHQ\">George W Bush's ad</a> parodying Senator John Kerry windsurfing.</p> <p>With spending projected to reach record levels, this election is no different. But behind the scenes, a revolution is underway in how these ads are targeted and delivered.</p> <p>Every presidential election can point to big breakthroughs in marketing tactics that are often ahead of their time, whether it was the first candidate websites that launched in 1996, following Bill Clinton's first term, or Barack Obama's domination of media in 2008, helped by a steady stream of content on YouTube, emails and text messages.</p> <p>This election is also evolving its marketing with the times and has embraced real-time media buying in both the display market but more significantly video advertising, which is important for pushing the emotive films and attack ads.</p> <p>In an election where everything can change in a minute, real-time buying offers flexibility and control, letting campaigns shift budgets, creative, site mix and geographic targets in minutes. For instance, if energy policy becomes a key issue overnight in a region \u2013 such as, coal country in key swing state Ohio \u2013 a campaign can create an ad on the fly, targeting specific audiences and zip codes with a video (maybe an existing ad or quickly-edited campaign speech) that explains a candidate's position on cap and trade and turn off all other ads that might be running in that region.</p> <p>Or if one candidate makes a mistake, the other can exploit it immediately and target ads to those who would be likely to change their vote because of the gaffe. An example of this would be Obama's description of Romney as a 'bullshitter' \u2013 likely to upset those of a delicate temperament and those who feel the presidential office holder should be held to a higher standard. Another would be Romney's use of the bizarre phrase 'binders full of women' in the debate which with such technology the Obama campaign would be able to target women in swing states with ads highlighting this.</p> <p>As well as allowing campaigns to take advantage of issues and gaffes, real-time buying can also help minimise waste as media becomes scarce in the days preceding an election. The campaign can invest exclusively in a smaller set of likely swing voters in swing states, and retargeted supporters can be shown a different set of creative more aimed at \"getting out the vote\" in the days leading up to an election.</p> <p>The targeting in political advertising is particularly rich, combining voter registration data and retargeting based on previous behaviour or opinion surveys. As with any campaign, marketers have an incredible amount of control over who sees an ad, where and when. The result is more hyper-customised advertising than ever.</p> <p>As in elections past, the tactics used in this election may prove to be a bellwether of what is to come for the marketing world generally.</p> <p><em>Brett Wilson is CEO of real-time video ad buying platform </em><a href=\"http://www.tubemogul.com/\" title=\"\"><em>TubeMogul</em></a><em>, whose clients include brand marketers as well as U.S.-based political advertisers.</em></p> <p><strong>To get more articles like this sent direct to your inbox, </strong><a href=\"https://register.guardian.co.uk/media/\" title=\"\"><strong>sign up</strong></a><strong> for free membership to the </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media-network\" title=\"\"><strong>Guardian Media Network</strong></a><strong>.

From the air, he could see houses flattened, roads covered in sand or water, a carnival and large pier that looked as if large bites had been taken out of them, and the boardwalk gone except for lonely posts here and there, according to a White House pooled report.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398662511\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/31/1351713786420/Barack-Obama-and-Chris-Ch-004.jpg\" alt=\"Barack Obama and Chris Christie\" width=\"220\" height=\"132\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Barack Obama and Chris  Christie.

He is being given a boost by an unexpected source, the popular governor of New Jersey, Chris Christie, who joined him in Atlantic City for the helicopter tour. Christie is not only a Republican but one of Romney's highest-profile backers.</p> <p>Republicans are still trying to work out how to respond to Christie lavishly praising Obama, less than a week before the election.</p> <p>Christie, resisting calls from some Republicans to get in a dig at Obama during the visit, went out his way instead to thank him again.</p> <p>Obama and Christie stood together at a press conference amid the debris in Brigantine, devastated tourist resort, at the end of his New Jersey tour. Christie praised Obama for his speedy response to the crisis and Obama returned the favour, describing the governor as having put his heart and soul into helping the state bounce back.</p> <p>Obama identified New York, New Jersey, Connecticut and West Virginia as the areas worst hit. Although Obama tried to avoid saying anything political, he nonetheless made the case for federal intervention, in particular the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which has been overseeing the rescue and recovery operation. Romney last year proposed cutting back Fema.</p> <p>Referring to Fema, Obama said that \"because of some good preparation the loss of life was kept lower than it could have been\". To emphasise the point, he suggested that the military and other federal assets could be used to help restore transport.</p> <p>\"The federal government will be working as closely as possible with state and local officials and we will not quit until this is done,\" Obama said.</p> <p>A Washington Post/ABC poll published on Wednesday night found that eight out of ten likely voters awarded Obama high marks for his handling of the crisis. Even two thirds of those who said they support Romney gave the president credit.</p> <p>With the storm still raw, few politicians or commentators are prepared yet to discuss publicly the impact of Sandy on the White House race.</p> <p>But in private, some, even Republicans, will admit that Obama is the fortunate beneficiary of this act of nature.</p> <p>Roger Simon, a columnist on Politico, is one of the few to go public, writing that: \"Hurricane Sandy has given Barack Obama a lift beneath his wings.\" He said that the disaster and his \"shrewd calculation\" to stop campaigning in order to supervise the relief effort has provide him with the one thing he had needed for weeks: the opportunity to look presidential.</p> <p>This week had supposed to be Romney's big push, building on the momentum that started with his surprise debate victory over Obama in Denver on October 3. Instead, he has been largely sidelined by Sandy.</p> <p>Having seen his campaign schedule wrecked on Sunday and Monday, and having been forced to suspend it on Tuesday, even Romney's return failed to excite the media. He was only a few sentences into a speech in Florida when one of the television networks subjected him to the indignity of cutting him off mid-sentence.</p> <p>Obama's team knows that Obama is benefiting from the attention but are<br>careful to avoid acknowledging it.</p> <p>The White House spokesman, Jay Carney, was asked by a reporter on a flight to New Jersey if Obama was sending a political message by visiting the state. Carney vigorously denied it.</p> <p>\"This is a time to focus on what was a devastating storm and the terrible aftermath of that storm.,\" Carney said. \"New Jersey was by many measures the hardest-hit state. I believe that's correct. It is entirely appropriate for the president to visit New Jersey and receive updates on the efforts there to recover and to view first-hand the damage inflicted by Sandy. This is not a time for politics.\"</p> <p>The mayor of New York, Michael Bloomberg, had not invited Obama to the city, but Carney insisted that was because the two had agreed that a visit to lower Manhattan would have tied up resources needed for helping to restore transport links and power.</p> <p>Before leaving for New Jersey, Obama phoned doctors and nurses in New York to thank them for their bravery during the storm and helping to evacuate 200 patients.</p> <p>Against that backdrop, it was an awkward balancing act for Romney on his return to the campaign trail. He had to avoid being too aggressively partisan in time of crisis. But he could not completely hold back, saying that unlike Obama, he does not \"just talk about change \u2014 I actually have a plan to execute change and make it happen.\"</p> <p>Screens on either side of Romney urged donations to the Red Cross. He also asked people if they had a spare dollar, to send it in.</p> <p>\"We love all of our fellow citizens, we come together in times like this and we want to make sure they have a speedy recovery,\" Romney said. But he could not resist making a political point too. \"People coming together is also what I believe will happen on November 7,\" he said, suggesting that the public would rally round behind him after he wins the November 6 election.</p> <p>One fact that the Romney campaign can hang on to is that the storm has so far not had a major impact on the swing states. Both New York and New Jersey are solidly Democratic, at least in White House races, and while there is sympathy for the victims, New York in particular is viewed in the midwest as Gomorrah.</p> <p>It is the second time in months that weather has disrupted Romney's campaign. A hurricane forced him to abandon the opening day of the Republican convention in Tampa, meant to introduce him to the American people and showcase his policies. The convention never quite recovered from the disruption.</p> <p>In spite of the lost days, his campaign team expressed confidence that Romney will win on Tuesday, pointing to polls showing him with leads in key states.</p> <p>Obama's chief campaign adviser, David Axelrod, in a phone-conference with reporters, described the Republicans as delusional and suggested the polls they were quoting were unreliable.</p> <p>He said he was hesitant to talk about the election in terms of the impact of the storm given that 50 people had died and millions of dollars worth of damage. Having said that, he admitted: \"The only impact I would suggest is that it tended to freeze the race because people are focused on the storm.\"</p> <p>Obama will return to the campaign trail Thursday, making up for lost time with a race across three states: Wisconsin, Nevada and Colorado.</p> <p>Polls show the race remains tight. The Obama campaign claims it is tied or ahead in all eight swing states and is building a strong firewall, having a large advantage among those voting early.</p> <p>The Republicans say that their supporters traditionally turn out in larger numbers on election day and this will eliminate the Democratic early voting advantage.</p>"

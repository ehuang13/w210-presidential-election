  "<p>Mitt Romney received a major boost on the eve of the second presidential debate when his team announced he had raised $170m in campaign donations in September, putting the 2012 election well on course to be the costliest ever.</p> <p>Romney's haul is $11m less than Obama took in over the same period. But the strong fundraising effort by Romney and the Republican party is notable because it came before the first debate in Denver a fortnight ago, at a time when Romney's campaign was thought to have stalled.</p> <p>Given that Romney took in $12m in the immediate aftermath of the Denver debate and that more people will become engaged as the election draws closer, the Romney campaign is looking to surpass the $170m figure this month.</p> <p>A fundraising meeting for wealthy donors is being held this week at the Waldorf-Astoria in New York following a similar successful event held at Park City, Utah, earlier this year.</p> <p>Romney's campaign team said it and the Republicans have $191m on hand to spend on the remainder of the campaign.</p> <p>Past election strategies by Romney has seen him favour late ad blitzes in contrast to the Obama campaign, which has been spending heavily on ads since the summer.</p> <p>With the amount of money available to both campaigns, Obama and Romney are at risk of reaching saturation point, running out of ad slots in the swing states to spend money on.</p> <p>The $170m, a record for Romney, was raised jointly by his team and the Republican party and easily outstrips the $111m Romney raised in August.</p> <p>The Romney campaign, keen to counter perceptions that it is funded by a clique of wealthy backers, said 93% of the money came from small donations, with more than 1 million giving $250 or less.</p> <p>The Obama campaign said 98% of its cash is from donors paying $250 or less.</p> <p>The fundraising boost for Romney came as Obama's campaign team Monday promised that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/15/obama-campaign-energised-presidential-debate\">a better-prepared and more combative president</a> will turn up for Tuesday's debate. Polls showed the two tied in a dead heat in the race for the White House.</p> <p>\"He's energised, and I expect he will make a passionate case,\" Obama campaign spokeswoman Jen Psaki told reporters said. Psaki acknowledged that the polls had tightened and the race is now \"very, very close\".</p> <p>With three weeks left to election day, the onus is on Obama to mount a strong comeback in Tuesday's Long Island debate to undo some of the damage caused by his dismal showing in Denver. Another poor performance is likely to seriously jeopardise his re-election chances.</p> <p>Psaki told reporters the president would be \"firm but respectful\" in his approach to Romney, suggesting he will not adopt the same strategy as Jode Biden, who was accused of being rude, patronising and disrespectful in his confrontation with his opponent, Paul Ryan, in Kentucky last week.</p> <p>The president has reviewed a video of the Denver debate, studied Romney's policies intensively and is practising hard with the Romney stand-in, former Democratic presidential candidate and senator John Kerry.</p> <p>Hinting at the strategy he will pursue, Psaki accused Romney of \"trying to hide from his severely conservative record.\"</p> <p>Obama was heavily criticised by fellow Democrats of failing in Denver to exploit Romney's perceived weaknesses such as the secret video in which he dismissed 47% of Americans as freeloaders, his approach on women's rights, his record as chief executive of Bain Capital and his unwillingness to provide details of his plans for tax and deficit-reduction.</p> <p>Before the Denver debate, the race had seemed to almost all but over. Since then, Republican activists and enthusiasts have been energised and polls have tightened. If the polls remain unchanged, it is going to an unpredictable finish on November 6.</p> <p>A Washington Post/ABC poll published Monday had Obama on 49% to Romney's 46% among likely voters, statistically a dead heat. The detail showed a big increase in post-debate enthusiasm for Romney, up from 26% five months ago to 59% in the new poll, 11 points of this coming since the Denver debate.</p> <p>According to ABC polling analysts, enthusiasm for Romney is substantially higher than it was for Obama's Republican opponent in 2008, up 30 points.</p> <p>There was some consolation for Obama, enjoying a 13-point increase, up to 42%, since the summer in the number who believe the country is headed in the right direction. His job approval rating is 50%, poor but good enough to win an election on past historical precedent.</p> <p>Political commentators have drawn comparisons with 1984, when Ronald Reagan, after a poor first debate against Walter Mondale, rebounded with a strong second one.</p> <p>The format for the Long Island debate is different from the Denver one. It is billed as town-hall style, with questions taken from the audience rather than put by a moderator. Genuine town hall debates with politicians in front of the public can be exciting, rowdy and unpredictable, but this one will be more organised, with the 80 potential questioners chosen by Gallup.</p> <p>Still, the format requires a skilful approach by the debaters, careful not to be seen as condescending towards real voters, as opposed to journalists.</p> <p>Representatives from the two campaigns combined to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/15/candy-crowley-debate-romney-obama\">express concern over the moderator</a>, CNN journalist, Candy Crowley, a feisty anchorwoman who has said she views her role as asking follow-up questions as required. Debate negotiators from the Obama and Romney camps said that is not how they viewed her role and the agreement had been that questions from her would be limited.</p> <p>Psaki, briefing reporters on Monday, sought to end the minor row by saying Obama will happily take questions from either the audience or the moderator.</p>",
  "<p>The world stood still 50 years ago during the last week of October, from the moment when it learned that the Soviet Union had placed nuclear-armed missiles in Cuba until the crisis was officially ended \u2013 though, unknown to the public, only officially.</p> <p>The image of the world standing still is due to <a href=\"http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/60676/lawrence-d-freedman/the-week-the-world-stood-still-inside-the-secret-cuban-missile-c\">Sheldon Stern</a>, former historian at the John F Kennedy Presidential Library, who published the authoritative version of the tapes of the ExComm meetings where Kennedy, and a close circle of advisers, debated how to respond to the crisis. The meetings were secretly recorded by the president, which might bear on the fact that his stand throughout the recorded sessions is relatively temperate, as compared to other participants who were unaware that they were speaking to history. Stern <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/sidebars/2012/05/robert_caro_s_new_history_of_lbj_sidebar_3_.html\">has just published</a> an accessible and accurate review of this critically important documentary record, finally declassified in the 1990s. I will keep to that here. \"Never before or since,\" he concludes, \"has the survival of human civilization been at stake in a few short weeks of dangerous deliberations,\" culminating in the Week the World Stood Still.</p> <p>There was good reason for the global concern. A nuclear war was all too imminent \u2013 a war that might \"destroy the Northern Hemisphere\", President Eisenhower had warned. Kennedy's own judgment was that the probability of war might have been <a href=\"http://truth-out.org/opinion/item/10660-in-hiroshimas-shadow\">as high as 50%</a>. Estimates became higher as the confrontation reached its peak and the \"secret doomsday plan to ensure the survival of the government was put into effect\" in Washington, described by journalist Michael Dobbs in his <a href=\"http://www.michaeldobbsbooks.com/1/post/2012/08/cold-war-humor.html\">recent, well-researched bestseller</a> on the crisis \u2013 though he doesn't explain why there would be much point in doing so, given the likely nature of nuclear war. Dobbs quotes Dino Brugioni, \"a key member of the CIA team monitoring the Soviet missile build-up\", who saw no way out except \"war and complete destruction\" as the clock moved to One Minute to Midnight \u2013 Dobbs' title. Kennedy's close associate, historian Arthur Schlesinger, described the events as \"the most dangerous moment in human history\". Defense Secretary Robert McNamara wondered aloud whether he \"would live to see another Saturday night\", and later recognized that \"we lucked out\" \u2013 barely.</p> <p>A closer look at what took place adds grim overtones to these judgments, with reverberations to the present moment.</p> <h2>'The most dangerous moment'</h2> <p>There are several candidates for \"the most dangerous moment\". One is 27 October, when US destroyers enforcing the quarantine around Cuba were dropping depth-charges on Soviet submarines. According to Soviet accounts, reported by the <a href=\"http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB75/\">National Security Archive</a>, submarine commanders were \"rattled enough to talk about firing nuclear torpedoes, whose 15 kiloton explosive yields approximated the bomb that devastated Hiroshima in August 1945\".</p> <p>In one case, a reported decision to assemble a nuclear torpedo for battle readiness was aborted at the last minute by Second Captain Vasili Archipov, who may have saved the world from nuclear disaster. There is little doubt what the US reaction would have been had the torpedo been fired, or how the Russians would have responded as their country was going up in smoke. Kennedy had already declared the highest nuclear alert short of launch (Defcon 2), which authorized \"Nato aircraft with Turkish pilots ... [or others] ... to take off, fly to Moscow, and drop a bomb\", <a href=\"http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0CCIQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Ftruth-out.org%2Fopinion%2Fitem%2F10660-in-hiroshimas-shadow&amp;ei=6op4UKX5Hcml0QX4g4C4CQ&amp;usg=AFQjCNGCLwsylmQR4OW6dN5IDifm3V8Iig\">according to Harvard University strategic analyst Graham Allison</a>, in Foreign Affairs.</p> <p>Another candidate is the previous day, 26 October. That day is selected as \"the most dangerous moment\" by a B-52 pilot, Major Don Clawson, who piloted one of those Nato aircrafts and provides a hair-raising description of details of the Chrome Dome (CD) missions during the crisis, \"B-52s on airborne alert\" with nuclear weapons \"on board and ready to use\". 26 October was the day when \"the nation was closest to nuclear war,\" Clawson writes in his \"irreverent anecdotes of an Air Force pilot\", Is That Something the Crew Should Know? On that day, Clawson himself was in a good position to set off a likely terminal cataclysm. He concludes that:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"We were damned lucky we didn't blow up the world \u2013 and no thanks to the political or military leadership of this country.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>The errors, confusions, near-accidents and miscomprehension of the leadership that Clawson reports are startling enough, but not as much as the operative command-and-control rules \u2013 or lack of them. As Clawson recounts his experiences during the 15, 24-hour CD missions he flew \u2013 the maximum possible \u2013 the official commanders \"did not possess the capability to prevent a rogue crew or crew-member from arming and releasing their thermonuclear weapons\", or even from broadcasting a mission that would have sent off \"the entire airborne alert force without possibility of recall\". Once the crew was airborne, carrying thermonuclear weapons, he writes:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"It would have been possible to arm and drop them all with no further input from the ground. There was no inhibitor on any of the systems.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>About one-third of the total force was in the air, according to General David Burchinal, director of plans on the air staff at Air Force headquarters. The Strategic Air Command, technically in charge, appears to have had little control. And according to Clawson's account, the civilian National Command Authority was kept in the dark by SAC, which means that the ExComm \"deciders\" pondering the fate of the world knew even less. General Burchinal's oral history is no less hair-raising, and reveals even greater contempt for the civilian command. According to him, Russian capitulation was never in doubt. The CD operations were designed to make it crystal clear to the Russians that they were hardly even competing in the military confrontation, and could quickly have been destroyed.</p> <p>From the ExComm records, Stern concludes that on 26 October President Kennedy was \"leaning towards military action to eliminate the missiles\" in Cuba, to be followed by invasion, <a href=\"http://www.kentucky.com/2012/10/10/2366509/archives-to-recount-jfks-cuban.html\">according to Pentagon plans</a>. It was evident then that the act might have led to terminal war, a conclusion fortified much later by revelations that tactical nuclear weapons had been deployed, and that Russian forces were far greater than US intelligence had reported.</p> <p>As the ExComm meetings were drawing to a close at 6pm on the 26 October, a letter arrived from Prime Minister Khrushchev, directly to President Kennedy. Khrushchev's \"message seemed clear,\" Stern writes:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"The missiles would be removed if the US promised not to invade Cuba.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>The next day, at 10am, the president again turned on the secret tape. He read aloud a wire service report that had just been handed to him:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"Premier Khrushchev told President Kennedy in a message today he would withdraw offensive weapons from Cuba if the United States withdrew its rockets from Turkey.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>These were Jupiter missiles with nuclear warheads. The report was soon authenticated. Though received by the committee as an unexpected bolt from the blue, it had actually been anticipated: \"We've known this might be coming for a week,\" Kennedy informed them. To refuse public acquiescence would be difficult, he realized. These were obsolete missiles, already slated for withdrawal, to be replaced by far more lethal and effectively invulnerable Polaris submarines. Kennedy recognized that he would be in an \"insupportable position if this becomes [Khrushchev's] proposal\", both because the Turkish missiles were useless and were being withdrawn anyway, and because \"it's gonna \u2013 to any man at the United Nations or any other rational man, it will look like a very fair trade.\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397785051\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/15/1350324465025/Cuban-missile-crisis-defe-008.jpg\" alt=\"Cuban missile crisis defense department photo\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A photo released by the US Defense Department on 3 November 1962, illustrating a medium-range ballistic missile site at Sagua La Grande, Cuba. Photograph: AP</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>A serious dilemma</h2> <p>The planners therefore faced a serious dilemma: they had in hand two somewhat different proposals from Khrushchev to end the threat of catastrophic war, and each would seem to any \"rational man\" to be a fair trade. How then to react?</p> <p>One possibility would have been to breathe a sigh of relief that civilization could survive, to eagerly accept both offers and to announce that the US would adhere to international law and remove any threat to invade Cuba; and to carry forward the withdrawal of the obsolete missiles in Turkey, proceeding as planned to upgrade the nuclear threat against the Soviet Union to a far greater one, of course, only part of the global encirclement of Russia. But that was unthinkable.</p> <p>The basic reason why no such thought could be contemplated was spelled out by National Security Adviser McGeorge Bundy, former Harvard Dean and reputedly the brightest star in the Camelot firmament. The <a href=\"http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/nsa/cuba_mis_cri/moment.htm\">world must come to understand</a> that \"the current threat to peace is not in Turkey, it is in Cuba,\" where missiles are directed against us. A vastly more powerful US missile force trained on the much weaker and more vulnerable Soviet enemy cannot possibly be regarded as a threat to peace, because we are Good, as a great many people in the western hemisphere and beyond could testify \u2013 among numerous others, the victims of the ongoing terrorist war that the US was then waging against Cuba, or those swept up in the \"campaign of hatred\" in the Arab world that so puzzled Eisenhower (though not the National Security Council, which explained it clearly).</p> <p>And, of course, the idea that the US should be restrained by international law was too ridiculous to merit consideration. As <a href=\"http://thinkprogress.org/yglesias/2011/11/07/362379/noam-chomsky-versus-me/\">explained recently by the respected liberal commentator Matthew Yglesias</a>, \"one of the main functions of the international institutional order is precisely to legitimate the use of deadly military force by western powers\" \u2013 meaning the US \u2013 so that it is \"amazingly na\u00efve\", indeed quite \"silly\", to suggest that the US should obey international law or other conditions that we impose on the powerless: a frank and welcome exposition of operative assumptions, reflexively taken for granted by the ExComm assemblage.</p> <p>In subsequent colloquy, the president stressed that we would be \"in a bad position\" if we chose to set off an international conflagration by rejecting proposals that would seem quite reasonable to survivors, if any cared. This \"pragmatic\" stance was about as far as moral considerations could reach. In a review of recently-released documents on Kennedy-era terror, Harvard University Latin Americanist <a href=\"http://cubajournal.blogspot.com/2010/09/operation-mongoose-us-sponsored.html\">Jorge Dom\u00ednguez observes</a> that:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"Only once in these nearly thousand pages of documentation did a US official raise something that resembled a faint moral objection to US government-sponsored terrorism.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>A member of the National Security Council staff suggested that raids that are \"haphazard and kill innocents \u2026 might mean a bad press in some friendly countries.\" The same attitudes prevail throughout the internal discussions during the missile crisis, as when Robert Kennedy warned that a full-scale invasion of Cuba would \"kill an awful lot of people, and we're going to take an awful lot of heat on it.\" And they prevail to the present with only the rarest of exceptions, as easily documented.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397785052\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/15/1350324764755/John-F-Kennedy-during-Cub-008.jpg\" alt=\"John F Kennedy during Cuban missile crisis, 1962\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">US president John F Kennedy making his dramatic television broadcast to announce the Cuba blockade during the Cuban missile crisis, 22 October 1962. Photograph: Hulton Archive/Getty</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hulton Archive/Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Unbeknownst to the public \u2026</h2> <p>We might have been \"in even a worse position\" if the world had known more about what the US was doing at the time. It was only recently learned that, six months earlier, the US had secretly deployed in Okinawa missiles virtually identical to those the Russians later sent to Cuba. These were surely aimed at China, at a moment of elevated regional tensions. Okinawa remains a major offensive US military base, over the bitter objections of its inhabitants \u2013 who, right now, <a href=\"http://nation.time.com/2012/09/09/still-no-luck-for-the-v-22-in-japan/\">are less than enthusiastic about the dispatch of accident-prone V-22 Osprey helicopters</a> to the Fukenma military base, located at the heart of a heavily-populated urban center.</p> <p>In the deliberations that followed, the US pledged to withdraw the obsolete missiles from Turkey, but would not do so publicly or in writing: it was important that Khrushchev be seen to capitulate. An interesting reason was offered, and is accepted as reasonable by scholarship and commentary. As Dobbs puts it:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"If it appeared that the United States was dismantling the missile bases unilaterally, under pressure from the Soviet Union, the [Nato] alliance might crack.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Or, to rephrase a little more accurately, if the US replaced useless missiles with a far more lethal threat, as already planned, in a trade with Russia that any \"rational man\" would regard as very fair, then the Nato alliance might crack. To be sure, when Russia withdrew Cuba's only deterrent against ongoing US attack with a severe threat to proceed to direct invasion and quietly departed from the scene, the Cubans would be infuriated \u2013 as they were, understandably. But that is an unfair comparison for the standard reasons: we are human beings who matter, while they are merely \"unpeople\", to borrow Orwell's useful phrase.</p> <p>Kennedy also made an informal pledge not to invade Cuba, but with conditions: not just withdrawal of the missiles, but also termination, or at least \"a great lessening\", of any Russian military presence. (Unlike Turkey, on Russia's borders, where nothing of the kind could be contemplated.) When Cuba is no longer an \"armed camp\", then \"we probably wouldn't invade,\" in the president's words. He added also that if it hoped to be free from the threat of US invasion, Cuba must end its \"political subversion\" (Stern's phrase) in Latin America.</p> <p>Political subversion had been a constant theme for years, invoked, <a href=\"http://www.chomsky.info/articles/200412--.htm\">for example</a>, when Eisenhower overthrew the parliamentary government of Guatemala and plunged the tortured country into an abyss from which it has yet to emerge. And the themes remained alive and well right through Reagan's vicious terror wars in Central America in the 1980s. The \"political subversion\" consisted of support for those resisting the murderous assaults of the US and its client regimes, and sometimes \u2013 horror of horrors \u2013 perhaps even providing arms to the victims.</p> <h2>The problem with Castro</h2> <p>In the case of Cuba, the State Department policy planning council explained: </p> <blockquote> <p>\"The primary danger we face in Castro is \u2026 in the impact the very existence of his regime has upon the leftist movement in many Latin American countries \u2026 The simple fact is that Castro represents a successful defiance of the US, a negation of our whole hemispheric policy of almost a century and a half.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>The Monroe Doctrine announced the US intention, then unrealizable, of dominating the western hemisphere. An example of great contemporary import is revealed in Iran scholar Ervand Abrahamian's important <a href=\"http://thenewpress.com/index.php?option=com_title&amp;task=view_title&amp;metaproductid=1868\">recent study</a> of the US-UK coup that overthrew the parliamentary regime of Iran in 1953. With scrupulous examination of internal records, he shows convincingly that standard accounts cannot be sustained. The primary causes were not cold war concerns, nor Iranian irrationality that undermined Washington's \"benign intentions\", nor even access to oil or profits, but rather the demand for \"overall controls\" with the broader implications for global dominance, threatened by independent nationalism. That is what we discover over and over by investigating particular cases.</p> <p>Cuba, too, not surprisingly \u2013 though the fanaticism might merit examination in this case. US policy towards Cuba is harshly condemned throughout Latin America, and indeed most of the world, but \"a decent respect for the opinions of mankind\" is understood to be meaningless rhetoric intoned mindlessly on 4 July. Ever since polls have been taken on the matter, a considerable majority of the US population has favored normalization of relations with Cuba, but that, too, is insignificant. Dismissal of public opinion is, of course, quite normal. What is interesting in this case is dismissal of powerful sectors of US economic power, which also favor normalization, and are usually highly influential in setting policy: energy, agribusiness, pharmaceuticals and others. That suggests that there is a powerful state interest involved in punishing Cubans, as well as the cultural factors revealed in the hysteria of the Camelot intellectuals.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397785053\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/15/1350323930816/Fidal-Castro-with-Nikita--008.jpg\" alt=\"Fidal Castro with Nikita Khrushchev in Moscow, 1963\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cuba's Communist leader Fidel Castro with Soviet premier Nikita Khrushchev during a 1963 official visit to Moscow.

The outcome was not obscure. That evening, in a special CBS News broadcast, <a href=\"http://articles.latimes.com/1987-10-23/local/me-10523_1_cuban-missile-crisis\">Charles Collingwood reported</a> that the world had come out \"from under the most terrible threat of nuclear holocaust since the second world war\", with a \"humiliating defeat for Soviet policy\". Dobbs comments that the Russians tried to pretend that the outcome was \"yet another triumph for Moscow's peace-loving foreign policy over warmongering imperialists\", as \"the supremely wise, always reasonable Soviet leadership had saved the world from the threat of nuclear destruction.\" Extricating the basic facts from the fashionable ridicule, Khrushchev's agreement to capitulate \"had saved the world from the threat of nuclear destruction\".</p> <p>The crisis, however, was not over. On 8 November, the Pentagon announced that all known Soviet missile bases had been dismantled. And on the same day, Stern reports, \"a sabotage team carried out an attack on a Cuban factory,\" though Kennedy's terror campaign, Operation Mongoose, had been formally curtailed at the peak of the crisis. The 8 November terror attack lends support to Bundy's observation that the threat to peace was Cuba, not Turkey \u2013 where the Russians were not continuing a lethal assault. Not, however, what Bundy had in mind, or could have understood.</p> <p>More details are added by the highly respected scholar Raymond Garthoff, who also had a great deal of experience within the government, in his careful 1987 account of the missile crisis. <a href=\"http://books.google.com/books?id=7zeg81n47GsC&amp;pg=PA122&amp;lpg=PA122&amp;dq=Raymond+Garthoff+a+Cuban+covert+action+sabotage+team+dispatched+from+the+United+States+successfully+blew+up+a+Cuban+industrial+facility&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=N-eskttTFO&amp;sig=QPZucjCqfdly4Wzio7rmkZB1_SA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=hBt8UJbnHcWY1AX_04GoAw&amp;ved=0CEIQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Raymond%20Garthoff%20a%20Cuban%20covert%20action%20sabotage%20team%20dispatched%20from%20the%20United%20States%20successfully%20blew%20up%20a%20Cuban%20industrial%20facility&amp;f=false\">On 8 November, he writes</a>, \"a Cuban covert action sabotage team dispatched from the United States successfully blew up a Cuban industrial facility,\" killing 400 workers, according to a Cuban government letter to the UN Secretary General. Garthoff comments that \"the Soviets could only see [the attack] as an effort to backpedal on what was, for them, the key question remaining: American assurances not to attack Cuba,\" particularly since the terrorist attack was launched from the US. These and other \"third-party actions\" reveal again, he concludes, \"that the risk and danger to both sides could have been extreme, and catastrophe not excluded.\" Garthoff also reviews the murderous and destructive operations of Kennedy's terrorist campaign, which we would certainly regard as more than ample justification for war, if the US or its allies or clients were victims, not perpetrators.</p> <p>From the same source we learn further that on 23 August 1962, the president had issued <a href=\"http://http://www.tomdispatch.com/blog/175430/best_of_tomdispatch%3A_noam_chomsky_on_terrorizing_cuba\">National Security Memorandum No 181</a>, \"a directive to engineer an internal revolt that would be followed by US military intervention\", involving \"significant US military plans, maneuvers, and movement of forces and equipment\" that were surely known to Cuba and Russia. Also in August, terrorist attacks were intensified, including speedboat strafing attacks on a Cuban seaside hotel \"where Soviet military technicians were known to congregate, killing a score of Russians and Cubans\"; attacks on British and Cuban cargo ships; contaminating sugar shipments; and other atrocities and sabotage, mostly carried out by Cuban exile organizations permitted to operate freely in Florida. Shortly after came \"the most dangerous moment in human history\", not exactly out of the blue.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397785054\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/15/1350323559111/Bay-of-Pigs-captured-rebe-008.jpg\" alt=\"Bay of Pigs captured rebels 1961\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Captured Cuban rebels in the wake of the 1961 CIA-backed invasion fiasco at the Bay of Pigs, Cuba.

Ten days before his assassination, he approved a CIA plan for \"destruction operations\" by US proxy forces \"against a large oil refinery and storage facilities, a large electric plant, sugar refineries, railroad bridges, harbor facilities, and underwater demolition of docks and ships\". A plot to assassinate Castro was apparently initiated on the day of the Kennedy assassination. The terrorist campaign was called off in 1965, but \"one of Nixon's first acts in office in 1969 was to direct the CIA to intensify covert operations against Cuba,\" Garthoff reports.</p> <p>In the current issue of <a href=\"http://www.psqonline.org/article.cfm?IDArticle=19003\">Political Science Quarterly</a>, Montague Kern observes that the Cuban missile crisis is one of those \"full-bore crises \u2026 in which an ideological enemy (the Soviet Union) is universally perceived to have gone on the attack, leading to a rally-'round-the-flag effect that greatly expands support for a president, increasing his policy options.\" Kern is right that it is \"universally perceived\" that way, apart from those who have escaped sufficiently from the ideological shackles to pay some attention to the facts. Kern is, in fact, one of them. Another is Sheldon Stern, who recognizes what has long been known to such deviants. As he writes, we now know that:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"Khrushchev's original explanation for shipping missiles to Cuba had been fundamentally true: the Soviet leader had never intended these weapons as a threat to the security of the United States, but rather considered their deployment a defensive move to protect his Cuban allies from American attacks and as a desperate effort to give the USSR the appearance of equality in the nuclear balance of power.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Dobbs, too, recognizes that:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"Castro and his Soviet patrons had real reasons to fear American attempts at regime change, including, as a last resort, a US invasion of Cuba \u2026 [Khrushchev] was also sincere in his desire to defend the Cuban revolution from the mighty neighbor to the north.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>The American attacks are often dismissed in US commentary as silly pranks, CIA shenanigans that got out of hand. That is far from the truth. The best and the brightest had reacted to the failure of the Bay of Pigs invasion with near hysteria, including the president, who solemnly informed the country that:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"The complacent, the self-indulgent, the soft societies are about to be swept away with the debris of history. Only the strong \u2026 can possibly survive.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>And they can only survive, he evidently believed, by massive terror \u2013 though that addendum was kept secret, and is still not known to loyalists who perceive the ideological enemy as having \"gone on the attack\" \u2013 the near-universal perception, as Kern observes. After the Bay of Pigs defeat, historian Piero Gleijeses writes that JFK launched a crushing embargo to punish the Cubans for defeating a US-run invasion, and \"asked his brother, Attorney General Robert Kennedy, to lead the top-level interagency group that oversaw Operation Mongoose, a program of paramilitary operations, economic warfare and sabotage he launched in late 1961 to visit the 'terrors of the earth' on Fidel Castro and, more prosaically, to topple him.\"</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/books/00/11/26/specials/schlesinger-robert.html\">phrase \"terrors of the earth\"</a> is Arthur Schlesinger's, in his quasi-official biography of Robert Kennedy, who was assigned responsibility to conduct the terrorist war, and informed the CIA that the Cuban problem carries \"the top priority in the United States Government \u2013 all else is secondary \u2013 no time, no effort, or manpower is to be spared\" in the effort to overthrow the Castro regime. The Mongoose operations were run by Edward Lansdale, who had ample experience in \"counterinsurgency\" \u2013 a standard term for terrorism that we direct. He provided a timetable leading to \"open revolt and overthrow of the Communist regime\" in October 1962.</p> <p>The \"final definition\" of the program recognized that \"final success will require decisive US military intervention,\" after terrorism and subversion had laid the basis. The implication is that US military intervention would take place in October 1962 \u2013 when the missile crisis erupted. The events just reviewed help explain why Cuba and Russia had good reason to take such threats seriously.</p> <p>Years later, Robert McNamara recognized that Cuba was justified in fearing an attack. \"If I were in Cuban or Soviet shoes, I would have thought so, too,\" he observed at a major conference on the missile crisis on the 40th anniversary. As for Russia's \"desperate effort to give the USSR the appearance of equality\", to which Stern refers, recall that Kennedy's very narrow victory in the 1960 election relied heavily on a fabricated \"missile gap\" concocted to terrify the country and to condemn the Eisenhower administration as soft on national security. There was indeed a \"missile gap\", but strongly in favor of the US. The first \"public, unequivocal administration statement\" on the true facts, <a href=\"http://books.google.com/books?id=9us4Q9iFI7kC&amp;pg=PA97&amp;lpg=PA97&amp;dq=Deputy+Secretary+of+Defense+Roswell+Gilpatric+the+US+would+have+a+larger+nuclear+delivery+system+left+after+a+surprise+attack&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=zabHQyP8nb&amp;sig=rtgg58Gexy7dL2MafuxpotcQhwo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=eip8UNDUOorJ0QWulIGQDA&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=Deputy%20Secretary%20of%20Defense%20Roswell%20Gilpatric%20the%20US%20would%20have%20a%20larger%20nuclear%20delivery%20system%20left%20after%20a%20surprise%20attack&amp;f=false\">according to strategic analyst Desmond Ball</a> in his authoritative study of the Kennedy missile program, was in October 1961, when Deputy Secretary of Defense Roswell Gilpatric informed the Business Council that \"the US would have a larger nuclear delivery system left after a surprise attack than the nuclear force which the Soviet Union could employ in its first strike.\"</p> <p>The Russians, of course, were well aware of their relative weakness and vulnerability. They were also aware of Kennedy's reaction when Khrushchev offered to sharply reduce offensive military capacity and proceeded to do so unilaterally when Kennedy failed to respond: namely, Kennedy undertook a huge armaments program.</p> <h2>In retrospect</h2> <p>The two most crucial questions about the missile crisis are how it began, and how it ended. It began with Kennedy's terrorist attack against Cuba, with a threat of invasion in October 1962. It ended with the president's rejection of Russian offers that would seem fair to a rational person, but were unthinkable because they would undermine the fundamental principle that the US has the unilateral right to deploy nuclear missiles anywhere, aimed at China or Russia or anyone else, and right on their borders; and the accompanying principle that Cuba had no right to have missiles for defense against what appeared to be an imminent US invasion. To establish these principles firmly, it was entirely proper to face a high risk of war of unimaginable destruction, and to reject simple, and admittedly fair, ways to end the threat.</p> <p>Garthoff observes that \"in the United States, there was almost universal approbation for President Kennedy's handling of the crisis.\" Dobbs writes that \"the relentlessly upbeat tone was established by the court historian, Arthur M Schlesinger Jr, who wrote that Kennedy had 'dazzled the world' through a 'combination of toughness and restraint, of will, nerve and wisdom, so brilliantly controlled, so matchlessly calibrated'.\" Rather more soberly, Stern partially agrees, noting that Kennedy repeatedly rejected the militant advice of his advisers and associates who called for military force and dismissal of peaceful options.</p> <p>The events of October 1962 are widely hailed as Kennedy's finest hour. <a href=\"http://www.inthesetimes.com/article/13626/the_next_hiroshima/\">Graham Allison joins many others in presenting</a> them as \"a guide for how to defuse conflicts, manage great-power relationships, and make sound decisions about foreign policy in general\". In a very narrow sense, that judgment seems reasonable. The ExComm tapes reveal that the president stood apart from others, sometimes almost all others, in rejecting premature violence.</p> <p>There is, however, a further question: how should JFK's relative moderation in management of the crisis be evaluated against the background of the broader considerations just reviewed? But that question does not arise in a disciplined intellectual and moral culture, which accepts without question the basic principle that the US effectively owns the world by right, and is, by definition, a force for good despite occasional errors and misunderstandings, so that it is plainly entirely proper for the US to deploy massive offensive force all over the world, while it is an outrage for others (allies and clients apart) to make even the slightest gesture in that direction, or even to think of deterring the threatened use of violence by the benign global hegemon.</p> <p>That doctrine is the primary official charge against Iran today: it might pose a deterrent to US and Israeli force. It was a consideration during the missile crisis as well. In internal discussion, the Kennedy brothers expressed their fears that Cuban missiles might deter a US invasion of Venezuela then under consideration. So \"the Bay of Pigs was really right,\" JFK concluded.</p> <p>The principles still contribute to the constant risk of nuclear war. There has been no shortage of severe dangers since the missile crisis. Ten years later, during the 1973 Israel-Arab war, Henry Kissinger called a high-level nuclear alert (Defcon 3) to warn the Russians to keep hands off <a href=\"http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB98/press.htm\">while he was secretly authorizing Israel to violate the ceasefire</a> imposed by the US and Russia. When Reagan came into office a few years later, the US launched operations probing Russian defenses and simulating air and naval attacks, while placing Pershing missiles in Germany with a five-minute flight time to Russian targets, providing what the CIA called a \"super-sudden first strike\" capability.</p> <p>Naturally, this caused great alarm in Russia, which, unlike the US, has repeatedly been invaded and virtually destroyed. That led to a major war scare in 1983. There have been hundreds of cases when human intervention aborted a first strike minutes before launch, after automated systems gave false alarms. We don't have Russian records, but there's no doubt that their systems are far more accident-prone.</p> <p>Meanwhile, India and Pakistan have come close to nuclear war several times, and the sources of the conflict remain. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_on_the_Non-Proliferation_of_Nuclear_Weapons#India.2C_Israel.2C_and_Pakistan\">Both have refused</a> to sign the non-proliferation treaty, along with Israel, and have received US support for development of their nuclear weapons programs \u2013 until today, in the case of India, now a US ally. War threats in the Middle East, which might become reality very soon, once again escalate the dangers.</p> <p>In 1962, war was avoided by Khrushchev's willingness to accept Kennedy's hegemonic demands. But we can hardly count on such sanity forever. It's a near miracle that nuclear war has so far been avoided. There is more reason than ever to attend to the <a href=\"http://www.pugwash.org/about/manifesto.htm\">warning of Bertrand Russell and Albert Einstein</a>, almost 60 years ago, that we must face a choice that is \"stark and dreadful and inescapable\":</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Shall we put an end to the human race; or shall mankind renounce war?</p> </blockquote>",
  "<p>Barack Obama's campaign team Monday promised that a better-prepared and more combative president will turn up for Tuesday's vital debate with Mitt Romney as polls showed the two tied in a dead heat in the race for the White House.</p> <p>\"He's energised, and I expect he will make a passionate case,\" Obama campaign spokeswoman Jen Psaki told reporters at his debate preparation camp in Williamsburg, Virginia. Psaki acknowledged that the polls had tightened and the race is now \"very, very close\".</p> <p>With three weeks left to election day, the onus is on Obama to mount a strong comeback in Tuesday's Long Island debate to undo some of the damage caused by his dismal showing in the first of the presidential debates in Denver a fortnight ago. Another poor performance is likely to seriously jeopardise his re-election chances.</p> <p>The sense of urgency in the Obama campaign camp was captured in an appeal to supporters sent out in Obama's name for more campaign donations. \"What we do over the next 22 days will determine not just the next four years, but what this country looks like for decades to come. That's what I'll be fighting for up on that stage tomorrow night,\" he said.</p> <p>He needs to lift Democrats' morale, building on running-mate Joe Biden's aggressive showing on the vice-presidential debate last Thursday, and win over floating voters.</p> <p>In the run-up to the first debate, Obama seemed uninterested, finding excuses to avoid preparing, including a visit to the Hoover Dam near his debate camp in Nevada. This time round, there have been no side-trips, golf or similar distractions, other than walks in the grounds of his resort hideaway, according to his aides.</p> <p>Psaki told reporters the president would be \"firm but respectful\" in his approach to Romney, suggesting he will not adopt the same strategy as Biden, who was accused of being rude, patronising and disrespectful in his confrontation with his opponent, Paul Ryan.</p> <p>The president has reviewed a video of the Denver debate, studied intensively Romney's policies and is practising hard with the Romney stand-in, former Democratic presidential candidate and senator John Kerry.</p> <p>Hinting at the strategy he will pursue, Psaki accused Romney of \"trying to hide from his severely conservative record\". </p> <p>Obama was heavily criticised by fellow Democrats of failing in Denver to exploit Romney's perceived weaknesses such as the secret video in which he dismissed 47% of Americans as freeloaders, his approach on women's rights, his record as chief executive of Bain Capital and his unwillingness to provide details of his plans for tax and deficit-reduction.</p> <p>Before the Denver debate, the race had seemed to almost all but over. Since then, Republican activists and enthusiasts have been energised and polls have tightened. If the polls remain unchanged, it is going to an unpredictable finish on November 6.</p> <p>A Washington Post/ABC poll published Monday had Obama on 49% to Romney's 46% among likely voters, statistically a dead heat. The detail showed a big increase in post-debate enthusiasm for Romney, up from 26% five months ago to 59% in the new poll, 11 points of this coming since the Denver debate.</p> <p>According to ABC polling analysts, enthusiasm for Romney is substantially higher than it was for Obama's Republican opponent in 2008, up 30 points.</p> <p>There was some consolation for Obama, enjoying a 13-point increase, up to 42%, since the summer in the number who believe the country is headed in the right direction. His job approval rating is 50%, poor but good enough to win an election on past historical precedent.</p> <p>A Politico poll published Monday put Obama on 49% to Romney on 48%. The most significant shift over the past fortnight has been in the eight swing states, where Romney has largely eroded Obama's poll leads.</p> <p>A Public Policy Polling survey published Monday put Romney up 1% in Florida, the biggest of the swing states. Romney has risen five points since last month in the state. PPP also puts Romney up two points in another swing state, North Carolina, on 49% to Obama's 47%.</p> <p>In Ohio, one of Obama's last lines of defence if Florida, North Carolina and other east coast swing states fall to Romney, Obama maintains a five-point lead, according to PPP. It has Obama on 51% to Romney's 46%, little changed from a fortnight ago when it was 49% to 45%.</p> <p>Political commentators have drawn comparisons with 1984, when Ronald Reagan, after a poor first debate against Walter Mondale, rebounded with a strong second one.</p> <p>Obama has come back strongly after setbacks before, particularly in 2007, during the battle for the Democratic nomination, when his aides and donors criticised him for his seeming apathy, and again in 2008 when a row over remarks by his then Chicago pastor critical of the US threatened to end his political career.</p> <p>The format for the Long Island debate is different from the Denver one. It is billed as town-hall style, with questions taken from the audience rather than put by a moderator. Genuine town hall debates with politicians in front of the public can be exciting, rowdy and unpredictable, but this one will be more organised, with the 80 potential questioners chosen by Gallup.</p> <p>Still, the format requires a skilful approach by the debaters, careful not to be seen as condescending towards real voters, as opposed to journalists.</p> <p>Representatives from the two campaigns combined to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/15/candy-crowley-debate-romney-obama\">express concern over the moderator</a>, CNN journalist, Candy Crowley, a feisty anchorwoman who has said she views her role as asking follow-up questions as required. Debate negotiators from the Obama and Romney camps said that is not how they viewed her role and the agreement had been that questions from her would be limited.</p> <p>Psaki, briefing reporters on Monday, sought to end the minor row by saying Obama will happily take questions from either the audience or the moderator.</p>",

  "<h2>The speechwriter, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/michael-cohen\">Michael Cohen</a>: 'Forget the extraneous wonky arguments of Denver'</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397791639\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/5/1/1335856877642/michael-cohen-003.jpg\" alt=\"michael cohen\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">michael cohen Photograph: Guardian</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>So, after what has been dubbed by the news media as the single most catastrophic, calamitous, Hindenburg-esque debate disaster in American political history, the question for Barack Obama is how does he avoid making the same mistakes again?</p> <p>The answer is not for Obama to be aggressive as a means of over-compensating for his lackluster performance in Denver (a la Al Gore in 2000) but rather keep things as simple as possible. There's an old dictum in speechwriting that the key to a good speech is \"tell 'em what you're gonna tell 'em; tell 'em; and then tell 'em again.\" The idea is to hammer on a central point, but also, drill down your argument to something that is easily digestible.</p> <p>While Mitt Romney has lately demonstrated the physical characteristics of Jello when it comes to nailing down his policy positions, Obama's job should be easier than it seems. Romney has, throughout his presidential campaign, espoused positions that are to the right of the median American voter: he wants to cut taxes on the wealthy; he would fundamentally transform Medicare; he wants to repeal Obamacare fully; and his position on choice and immigration run afoul of women and Hispanic voters.</p> <p>The key for Obama, then, is to remind voters, over and over, that Romney is a hard-right conservative who would take the country in a very different and uncertain direction. He failed to do this in the first debate, and instead, let his GOP opponent get away with engaging in a nationally televised facelift. That Romney had faint rhetorical echoes of the technocratic Republican who was Governor of Massachusetts.</p> <p>But those soothing efforts were not a true reflection of Romney's policy positions. Romney might offer a smokescreen about the impact of his 20% across the board tax cut, for example, but the facts are the facts \u2013 the math doesn't add up. Romney might say he supported the auto bailout, but the op-ed he penned titled \"Let Detroit Go Bankrupt\" suggests otherwise. For Obama to succeed, he needs to do something similar to what his running-mate Joe Biden did last week in the vice-presidential debate: he needs to stick to the facts and remind voters that the GOP ticket is not what it seems.</p> <p>Do that, and forget the extraneous wonky arguments he made in Denver, and Obama will avoid the universal panning his first debate performance received.</p> <p><em>Michael Cohen is a US political columnist for the Guardian and Observer and author of Live from the Campaign Trail</em></p> <h2>The stylist, <a href=\"www.guardian.co.uk/profile/megan-collins\">Megan Collins</a>: 'Michelle should cut Barack's tie in half just beforehand'</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397791640\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/15/1350314913431/megancollins_140x140.jpg\" alt=\"Megan Collins\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Because the second debate will be conducted in a town hall format, the president should wear something he can move in. He should feel comfortable standing or sitting, and walking around stage holding a microphone.</p> <p>That said, President Obama did everything right \u2013 sartorially speaking \u2013 in the first debate. It's hard to argue with either candidate's choice of a charcoal, two-button suit with notch lapels. While I'd suggest that both men would be better served by a flat front pant rather than one with pleats, I understand that old habits, especially among politicians, die hard.</p> <p>The president's suit fit well, with subtle pick-stitching defining the lapel and a natural shoulder hugging his frame. The jacket's double vents felt modern, as did its slightly shorter length. His point collar dress shirt fit snugly, but not too tight, around his neck. His polished dress shoes were neither too square, nor too pointy. His flag pin: present, but not showy. Even the dimple in his (unsurprisingly Democrat blue) tie gets an \"A\" for textbook menswear polish.</p> <p>With his outfit in order, the president, then, needs to work on presenting himself as a more passionate, determined, confident candidate at the second debate. In short, he needs to upgrade his attitude.</p> <p>I'm reminded of a great West Wing episode where the First Lady, played by Stockard Channing, took scissors to her husband's tie just moments before a debate. The president, played by Martin Sheen, had to hustle to find new neckwear from someone on his staff with less than a minute to air. The frenzy provided him with a fantastic energy during the debate.</p> <p>I think if someone can convince Michelle to cut Barack's tie in half before Tuesday night's town hall, he'll do ten times better in this debate than the last.</p> <p><em>Megan Collins runs <a href=\"http://stylegirlfriend.com/\">Style Girlfriend</a>, a website about guys' style from a female perspective</em></p> <h2>The body language expert, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/christopher-kowal\">Christopher Kowal</a>: 'His non-verbal cues need to express sincerity and empathy'</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397791641\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/15/1350321940363/Chris_Kowalheadshot.jpg\" alt=\"Chris Kowal\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Emotional connection is one of the major keys in attracting and motivating voters. It's easier to vote for a person we feel a connection with. So, while having an articulate and rational vision is imperative for candidates, voters are increasingly judging them on their ability to emotionally connect with them.</p> <p>After the charismatic administrations of Bill Clinton and Tony Blair, voters have a strong desire for leaders who move them emotionally and connect with them, especially as they face economic and security uncertainties. Clinton has a strong ability to show empathy. Think of his \"I feel your pain\" statement, made with a sincere and concerned facial gesture that matched those words.</p> <p>The last debate performance by President Barack Obama is a perfect case study in the area of connection. Critics suggested Obama was disengaged, perhaps even angry. My own analysis suggests that he was emotionally flat. </p> <p>During the next two debates, it is critical for Obama not only to articulate his vision for the next four years, but also to connect that vision with the majority of American voters. His facial expressions and other non-verbal cues need to express sincerity and empathy. He must reflect the emotions of his base and of the ever-so-important independent voter.</p> <p>Voters are worried about the economy and angry at the failings of Washington. They need to feel reassured that the politician understands what is important to them and will have their best interests in mind.</p> <p>Both nominees for president lack a natural ability to truly emotionally connect with voters. This has created mistrust and uncertainty. The presidential hopeful who wins the next debate will be the one who truly shows that he feels what the voters are feeling.</p> <p><em>Christopher Kowal is an assistant professor of consumer science at Purdue University, Indiana, specialising in non-verbal communication and emotional cues</em></p> <h2>The Democratic strategist, <a href=\"www.guardian.co.uk/profile/alex-slater\">Alex Slater</a>: 'The worst thing Obama could do is over-compensate'</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397791642\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2010/12/7/1291745438055/Alex-Slater-002.jpg\" alt=\"Alex Slater\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alex Slater</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Public Domain</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The president doesn't have an easy job ahead of him in this second debate. Unlike much of the Democratic establishment, I don't believe that expectations for his performance are low, whatever his campaign tried to spin on the Sunday talkshows. On the contrary, if Obama doesn't deliver a \"slam dunk\" on Tuesday, we'll see another round of liberal hand-wringing and conservative victory laps. The polls will become unpredictable, at best.</p> <p>As Democratic strategist Mike Feldman told Piers Morgan on Saturday night, tomorrow's debate will be a 3-D game of chess, between the candidates, the moderator, the town-hall participants and the undecided voters tuning in from swing states.</p> <p>So my advice to the president is this: do not overreact. In the first debate, Obama left Romney's blatantly false assertions and attacks go unchecked. Certainly, he was devoid of the energy and verve Americans have come to expect. That can't happen on Tuesday. But the worst thing Obama could do is over-compensate by becoming, as Feldman put it, \"the incredible hulk\". The risk is that the president, so intent on going after Governor Romney, could be perceived as a bully. Given Romney's affable demeanor in the first debate, the contrast could be considerable.</p> <p>The president has to use the town-hall format to his advantage. Obama's not quite the college professor he's declared to be. In fact, he's a great communicator, especially in one-on-one situations. He has the power both to empathize with the audience members while drawing a contrast with Mitt Romney. And it's that contrast that will put Romney in a difficult position.</p> <p>After all the fact-checking of the first debate, it's going to be very hard for the governor to continue making spurious arguments. It'll be even harder when facing town-hall participants. Downright making up facts in a moderated debate is one thing; lying to the face of real Americans is quite another. Obama has the advantage of his facts being true. It's up to him to use that advantage without being the town-hall bully.</p> <p><em>Alex Slater is a Democratic strategist and principal of the political consultancy <a href=\"http://www.clydestrategies.com/\">Clyde Strategies</a></em></p> <h2>The sport psychologist, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/roland-carlstedt\">Roland Carlstedt</a>: 'High self-esteem can have an insidious flip-side'</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397791643\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/15/1350310092096/rolandcarlstedt_140x140.jpg\" alt=\"Roland Carlstedt\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Presidential debates are not really debates as debates are defined or should be. They have devolved to the extent that most debate performers in our recent history would have been kicked off high-school debate teams, where facts rule, not theatrics and superficial attempts to seduce, as opposed to accurately inform undecided voters. Debate victors are declared on the basis of pundit impressions of body language, confidence, forcefulness and self-control ,among many other behaviors and what are smoke-and-mirror-based attempts to appear more presidential. In the end, it's more about role-playing than the issues in an America that appears to be easily smitten and swayed by that presidential-looking haircut, chiseled facial features and the ability to use the right tone, verbal inflection and retorts no matter how absurd and removed from reality.</p> <p>As such, an individual like Barack Obama may be at an inherent disadvantage when debating an individual who is all too willing to focus on appearing to be presidential, one who will say anything, even if it means defying logic, distorting the facts, switching positions and even denying having said things that have been recorded for all to hear. Mitt Romey has been accused of doing all of the above. In the first debate, Obama seemed befuddled by Romney's responses and aggressive approach, hearing things that he did not expect. That threw off his entire game plan.</p> <p>What to do? In the context of my research, three crucial personality traits and behaviors have emerged that predict who is more or less like to falter under pressure. I suspect that President Obama's \"performer's profile\" is a middle-ground one consisting of medium to high hypnotic susceptibility, medium neuroticism and low repressive coping. These measures interact to drive perceptions and behaviors, including risk-taking behavior \u2013 such as distorting the facts, as Romney has been accused of doing. Consequently, Romney's profile is likely to be low hypnotic susceptibility, low neuroticism and high repressive coping \u2013 a profile that is associated with mental toughness in athletes, high self-esteem and confidence and obliviousness to what people think.</p> <p>While mental toughness, and high self-esteem and confidence may seem like a good thing, they also can have an insidious flip-side \u2013 namely, narcissistic as opposed to more altruistic, empathy driven motives that better serve the masses. My two identified \"ideal athlete's\" profiles, while facilitating peak performance in sports, debate performance and the seduction of voters, nevertheless must be viewed with caution. After all, voters are not opponents as in tennis matches; they are humans looking for measured and tempered leadership from leaders who do not try to seduce, but rather, inform the populace with facts and positions that are stable and constant and not expediently whipped out to win a debate.</p> <p>Now, I have never tested President Obama and candidate Romney; as such, I am speculating on the basis of their known and observed behaviors and how they correlate with the critical peak/pressure performance relevant measures that I have identified. Nevertheless, I strongly recommend assessing politicians using my \"athlete's profile\" model. It provides highly predictive insight into important subliminal psychological processes that can influence and even drive decision-making and what one will do to win an election or debate.</p> <p>My advice to President Obama: stick to the facts, elucidate your positions and when necessary defend your point of view and agenda. Unless the president is high in repressive coping, I doubt that he is capable of engaging in spin at the highest level. He would be best advised to be himself, as he is when he is on the stump \u2013 although that is easier said than done.</p> <p>Interestingly, my research suggests that there is also a dual-placebo effect, in which psychotherapists are most persuasive and believed by clients who share a similar profile. As a result, if Romney is indeed low in hypnotic susceptibility, low in neuroticism and high in repressive coping (a more rare profile), Obama can take solace in knowing there are vastly more middle-of-the-road profiles who are less likely to be influenced by behaviors and even debate presentations that are diametrically opposite to what they believe and like to see and hear.</p> <p><em>Dr Roland A Carlstedt is chairman of the American Board of Sport Psychology and author of Evidence-Based Sport Psychology (2012)</em></p>",

That's left the candidates fighting over the very few undecided voters \u2013 about 5% to 7% of the electorate. This percentage is far lower than 2008. Seeing as these undecided voters will play a key role in determining the winner of the election, I <a href=\"http://www.quora.com/Politics/Have-you-ever-been-undecided-in-the-presidential-race\">took to Quora</a> to try to find the \"undecided voter\".</p> <p>I asked the audience if they had ever been or are undecided in a presidential race and why. Not too surprisingly, I didn't find very many. Why?</p> <p>Elections' demographic expert <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PatrickRuffini\">Patrick Ruffini</a> went into the thread and gave us an informative explanation:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-audio\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.quora.com/widgets/content\"> <span class=\"quora-content-embed\" data-name=\"Politics/Have-you-ever-been-undecided-in-the-presidential-race/answer/Patrick-Ruffini/quote/74488\">Read <a data-width=\"460\" data-height=\"746\" class=\"quora-content-link\" href=\"http://www.quora.com/Politics/Have-you-ever-been-undecided-in-the-presidential-race/answer/Patrick-Ruffini/quote/74488\" data-embed=\"uls0UQd\" data-type=\"quote\" data-id=\"74488\" data-key=\"f69942f4ec8a97c8acbdd0792bd660f2\">Quote of Patrick Ruffini's answer to Politics: Have you ever been undecided in the presidential race?</a> on <a href=\"http://www.quora.com\">Quora</a><script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"https://www.quora.com/widgets/content\"></script></span> </figure>  <p>Backing up Patrick were the respondents who said they were not and were rarely if ever undecided in any race. Here's one snippet from Quora user <a href=\"https://twitter.com/kitchenettekat\">Kat Li</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It feels strange, even to admit it to myself, but I have never really been undecided in a presidential election, whether primary or general. I like to think of myself as \"flexible\" and \"open-minded\" but my realization here is that when the stakes are high enough, I actually am quite decided. </p> </blockquote> <p>But with less than a month to go until November 6, there were still a few people who were undecided the year \u2013 just not in the way you might think. Many of the undecideds were unsure whether to vote for a major party candidate \u2013 who they saw as the lesser of two evils \u2013 or cast a vote for a third party candidate that they felt would be wasted. </p> <p>This is a constant issue in a two-party system, as illustrated by this comment from user <a href=\"http://www.quora.com/Bryce-Johannes\">Bryce Johannes</a>: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I am also in a non-swing state so am on the look out for a third party to support. I have a friend who campaigns \u2013 to his Facebook friends \u2013 tirelessly against the two very similar mainstream candidates. </p> </blockquote> <p>Many were undecided in previous primary campaigns, which is expected. Primaries are often marked by few issue differences. Thus, voter decisions are based more around the personalities of the candidates. The greater degree of undecided voters in previous presidential campaigns can also be seen in some of the responses, like this one from user Richard H Schwartz, who said he noticed more uncertainty in 2008: </p>  <figure class=\"element element-audio\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.quora.com/widgets/content\"> <span class=\"quora-content-embed\" data-name=\"Politics/Have-you-ever-been-undecided-in-the-presidential-race/answer/Richard-H-Schwartz/quote/74502\">Read <a data-width=\"460\" data-height=\"375\" class=\"quora-content-link\" href=\"http://www.quora.com/Politics/Have-you-ever-been-undecided-in-the-presidential-race/answer/Richard-H-Schwartz/quote/74502\" data-embed=\"uls0UQd\" data-type=\"quote\" data-id=\"74502\" data-key=\"a029af5cf3cfd08cf93b6ce87a87dcbd\">Quote of Richard H.

For the first time since the recession hit the United States almost five years ago, Alex Bernhardt thinks that this year there is reason to be optimistic. But he's not going overboard.</p> <p>\"Things are better than they were in 2008 but not nearly as good as they were in 2007\", the chairman of Bernhardt Furniture said from his plant in Lenoir.</p> <p>\"We're halfway back.\"</p> <p>The company, Bernhardt says, was devastated by the collapse in the housing market \u2013 the worst the US has ever suffered \u2013 in the aftermath of the sub-prime mortgage crisis. But in recent months there have been signs that a combination of time and the colossal stimulus provided to the economy have started to work.</p> <p>Prices are gently rising, the number of new buildings is rising, forced sales are dropping. The unemployment rate nationally has dipped below 8%, and \u2013 according to Bernhardt \u2013 among his 1,000 workers the \"fear has abated\" for those with a job. But there's a long way to go.</p> <p>In Bernhardt's Caldwell County unemployment is still 13%.</p> <p>The essence of Barack Obama's pitch to the American people is that government action is starting to repair the damage to the economy. His period in office has seen 5m private sector jobs created, the auto industry saved from bankruptcy, and a commitment by the Federal Reserve, to keep interest rates low until America is fully back to work.</p> <p>Consumers are more hopeful than they have been in five years, according to the latest University of Michigan poll. But that rise has to be put into the context of the worst half-decade for the US economy since the Great Depression of the 1930s.</p> <p>The glacial pace of America's recovery \u2013 highly unusual for a country that until the 1990s had a tradition of coming out of recession fast \u2013 has made this year's presidential race a knife-edge contest. US voters are susceptible to the question posed by Ronald Reagan in his contest with Jimmy Carter in 1980: do you feel better off than you did four years ago?</p> <p>Obama's approach to running the economy has been cautious. Early in his presidency he announced a stimulus package worth almost $800bn; it was attacked as reckless extravagance by the Republicans, but as timid and inadequate by Keynesian economists such as Paul Krugman.</p> <p>Unlike Franklin Roosevelt in the 1930s, he has not sought to punish Wall Street for its role in blowing up the economy. The current incumbent of the White House could not say, as FDR did when seeking re-election in 1936: \"Wall Street hates me and I welcome that hate.\"</p> <p>The stock market has rallied strongly in the past four years, and one of Obama's problems is that Wall Street has done a whole lot better than Main Street, affected by the triple whammy of high unemployment, a depressed housing market and a squeeze on wages. Simon Johnson, economics professor at MIT, said the failure to crack down harder on the financial sector was \"shocking and appalling given the damage caused by Wall Street\".</p> <p>North Carolina, where the unemployment rate is two points above the national average and nudging 10%, is a state Barack Obama narrowly won in 2008 but looks likely to lose to Mitt Romney next month. </p> <p>The state's economy was once based around the three Ts \u2013textiles, tobacco and timber \u2013 but diversified in the wake of the decline of traditional manufacturing. This recession hit new industries as well as old.</p> <p>Charlotte, where Obama held the Democratic party convention this year \u2013 is the home of Bank of America, which has slashed jobs by the thousands in recent years. Its biggest private sector employer is Carolinas Healthcare System, which employs more than 20,000 people in the city and 60,000 across the state. </p> <p>Even the healthcare industry felt the pinch as companies cut back insurance and people who lost jobs, and their health coverage, deferred procedures.</p> <p>Joe Piedmont, president and CEO, said he had been surprised by the severity of the recession. \"We believed healthcare tended to be insulated from the general economy, but we found elective procedures and discretionary spending on health dropped.\"</p> <p>Life is getting better, he said, but its not just the economy that is holding business back. The bitter political infighting that has characterised Obama's first term remains a real drag on the economy, he said. Decisions are delayed, investments put on ice as business leaders worry about what the future holds. </p> <p>\"People really don't want four more years of the last two years of gridlock. I can remember the 60s and in my lifetime I can't recall anything like this. This is a very big philosophical divide.\"</p> <p>Natalie English, senior vice-president for Charlotte's chamber of commerce, agrees. \"I have never seen political deadlock like this. It's really bad for business. There are decisions about infrastructure that need to be made for this community that are just stuck because of political infighting. No one will compromise.\"</p> <p>At the Democrats' Charlotte office Sam Spencer, president of the Young Democrats of North Carolina, is organising the final push before voting begins. Spencer says the economy is issue number one but while the present remains difficult he believes Obama has proven he is on the right track.</p> <p>\"People are aware that the president inherited an economic disaster,\" says Spencer. \"We were on track for economic collapse, we saw the abyss and we are still standing.\" He says local voters are keen to push back against the more extreme Republican elements and that their hardline stance on social issues is winning over voters.</p> <p>Bernhardt is far less keen on four more years of Obama. Not least because he believes Obama is anti-business. \"He has been antagonistic to business. He's populist, he attacks the banks. He's much more liberal than most business people,\" he said.</p> <p>But on one thing they both agree. \"It's going to be very close,\" said Bernhardt.</p>",
  "<p>Havas Media's latest meaningful brands report has cast its eye towards brand Romney and brand Obama. In a survey of 378 adults distributed across the political who intended to vote in the 2012 presidential election, the conclusion of last week's report was that President Obama's meaningful brand attributes scored higher than Mitt Romney's, despite Romney victory and subsequent poll swings in the presidential debate.</p> <p>The Meaningful Brands survey looks specifically at how brands can help us live more fulfilled lives, feel more connected, less stressed, secure and positive about the future, and how different media platforms form those views. Obama was voted more meaningful than Romney both in terms of how he impacts voters' personal lives and the lives of the communities they care about.</p> <p>For more individual, personal concerns, Romney lags behind Obama by 10 percentage points (14% vs. 24%). When it comes to more collective, social issues surrounding the community or economy, Obama outpaces Romney by 15 percentage points (36% vs. 21%). However, the percentages for both candidates across both individual and collective indicators of wellbeing are low.</p> <p>While Obama is winning the meaningful brands race by a significant margin, but meaningful scores for both candidates are low. Romney is only considered meaningful by his core Conservative audience and is threatened by low scores from moderate Conservatives and middle of the road voters. Does this show that voters in the US do not think that either candidate is doing enough to help them live better lives? Do measures such as the Meaningful Brands analysis give us a different view of perceptions offered by traditional polling data?</p> <p>Umair Haque, Director Havas Media Labs, comments, 'There is optimism in the US but it's clear that both candidates are not delivering on this desire to live better lives in any sort of tangible form. Our Meaningful Brands project highlighted that the American public are looking to live more fulfilled valuable lives \u2013 we are all if you like on a quest for meaning. Even though Obama wins this week, it's clear with scores in the 20th and 30th percentiles that he has a long way to go before 'Brand Obama' becomes really meaningful \u2013 as both a President and a leader.'</p> <p>The results also confirm that Romney is not considered meaningful with anyone other than hardcore Conservatives. If isolating the focus on his core audiences, his scores across all 39 aspects of meaningfulness could challenge Obama \u2013 especially when speaking about business and the economy \u2013 but results show that he needs to convince people who are identified as the moderate conservatives or the 'middle of the road / swing votes' that his policies resonate in terms of generating more meaningful lives to voters.</p> <p>The survey confirms that Democrats are more social and digital than Republicans. During the debates, the liberal audience shared ideas on social media platforms to a greater extent than their Conservative counterparts and were more likely to spend at least an hour per day talking about the candidates and the election. Liberals were three to four times as likely to be actively posting or reading about the election during the debates.</p> <p>Hernan Sanchez CEO Havas Media Intelligence, concludes, 'It's no surprise that Facebook usage and digital platforms in general are used more prolifically by the Democrat voters. However, unless the real strategic issues of meaningfulness are addressed, these digital platforms will only help close short-term gaps. Having a more socially oriented group of voters can open up gains for Obama but it also can make Obama's brand more volatile.</p> <p>Unless these social platforms are used to enable people to live better, more connected and meaningful lives, these gains are short-lived.'</p> <p>Fast facts on meaningful scores for the first first of the weekly surveys:</p> <p>1. Overall, voter confidence for the future of the country is low, but 26% strongly agree that Obama helps them feel more confident vs. 19% Romney</p> <p>2. More Conservatives reported watching the debate on October 3rd (27% more Conservatives watched the debate than Liberals)</p> <p>3. The weekly TV debates in the run-up to the election are still considered meaningful to the majority of voters surveyed</p> <p>4. Aligned with the post-debate sentiment, 53% of the voters asked reported that their feelings shifted more favourably towards Romney following the debate</p> <p>5. 45% feel that Obama listens and cares \u2013 compared to only 20% with Romney</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398239417\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/15/1350307330212/obama-romney-brand-analys-001.jpg\" alt=\"obama romney brand analysis infographic\" width=\"462\" height=\"1460\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">  Photograph: Havas Media</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Havas Media</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>6. Obama is still scoring well on social issues, such as fair pay and equal opportunities, with over 40% of voters scoring him well in these areas compared to scores averaging 20% for Romney</p> <p>7. Romney achieves a small margin over Obama on business related areas, such as creation of jobs and development of business</p> <p>8. On more personal issues, 31% of recipients respondents strongly agree that Obama treats them with respect (compared to 15% for Romney)</p> <p>9. Overall, Obama doubles the scores of Romney on such issues as 'helping us become better citizens' and 'becoming more informed' \u2013 but these scores are still only averaging percentages in the mid 20s.</p> <p>10. The key potential problem areas for Obama are mainly economic \u2013 it's a close call on how each is considered to help us make our money grow (18% scores for Obama with Romney close on nearly 17%)</p> <p>11. Respondents were twice as likely to read/post about the election on Facebook compared to Twitter during the debate</p> <p>12. Twitter comes in at second with just under 8% overall. Once again we see huge differences between the two parties \u2013 16% of Liberals are using it compared to only 5% of Conservatives 13. Middle of the road voters were more likely to be reading the newspaper or listening to talk radio during the debates than any other political leaning group</p> <p><strong>To get more articles like this sent direct to your inbox, </strong><a href=\"https://register.guardian.co.uk/media/\" title=\"\"><strong>sign up for free membership</strong></a><strong> of the Guardian Media Network.

  "<p>Just when he thought he was out, they pull him back in. <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2012/07/30/120730fa_fact_remnick\" title=\"\">Having told the New Yorker that he was going to sit this election out</a>, Bruce Springsteen <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/13/barack-obama-bruce-springsteen-ohio\" title=\"\">has decided to saddle up once more in support of President Barack Obama's re-election bid</a>. His first appearance will be alongside Bill Clinton at a rally in Parma, Ohio this Thursday. Like Clinton, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/05/bill-clinton-elizabeth-warren-live\" title=\"\">whose convention speech thrilled the faithful last month</a>, Springsteen is well-equipped to inject some emotional heat into a somewhat chilly and apologetic Obama&#xa0;campaign.</p> <p>In this area Springsteen knows failure as well as success. While 2008 was a dream election for the left in the&#xa0;US, Springsteen was also the star attraction on <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/oct/03/uselections2004.arts\" title=\"\">the 2004 Vote for Change tour in aid of John Kerry</a>. Not one of the swing states visited by the tour changed direction as a result and George Bush returned to the White House. REM's Peter Buck has recalled talking to Springsteen's guitarist Steve Van Zandt backstage: \"We both said: 'Y'know, I'm glad we're doing this, but&#xa0;it's not going to do anything. Kerry's losing.'\"</p> <p>So you can see why Springsteen hesitated this time. In campaigning for&#xa0;broader issues, you can claim to be nudging public opinion in the right direction, however slowly, but the brutal calculus of elections allows only&#xa0;for winners and losers. It takes courage to risk being numbered among&#xa0;the latter.</p> <p>Rock music's first concerted effort to&#xa0;influence an election ended in the most crushing defeat of all. Such marquee names as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/apr/06/natural-woman-carole-king-review\" title=\"\">Carole King</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/grateful-dead\" title=\"\">Grateful Dead</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/simonandgarfunkel\" title=\"\">Simon and Garfunkel</a> played benefit shows for anti-war liberal <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/feedarticle/9977858\" title=\"\">George McGovern</a> in 1972 \u2013 Neil Young even recorded a single for the candidate, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBhAUr-8zDc\" title=\"\">War Song</a> \u2013 and the Republican Richard Nixon still won by a historic landslide. The cherished youth vote, <a href=\"http://system.uslegal.com/u-s-constitution/amendment-xxvi-right-to-vote-at-age-18-1971/\" title=\"\">expanded by the lowering in 1971 of the voting age from 21 to 18</a>, failed to materialise in McGovern's favour. So much for the power of rock music to win hearts and minds, you might think. And yet <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/21/opinion/21thu4.html\" title=\"\">Nixon had been troubled by John Lennon's plans to stage an anti-incumbent tour</a> (cancelled due to&#xa0;his fight against deportation), so somebody was taking it seriously.</p> <p>Many disconsolate McGovern supporters, including Lennon and Young, steered away from politics for years afterwards. In Britain, the same happened to Paul Weller after Margaret Thatcher's re-election in 1987. Weller had stifled his suspicion of party politics in order to add his star power to the <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/3682281.stm\" title=\"\">Red Wedge campaign in support of Neil&#xa0;Kinnock's Labour party</a>, and his political commitment never recovered from Red Wedge's failure. \"Before the Wedge, the Style Council had done a&#xa0;lot independently, raised a lot of money in benefits,\" he told Q magazine. \"After the Wedge, we were so disillusioned it all stopped. We were totally cynical about all of it.\"</p> <p>Weller was simply too idealistic for electoral politics. That role requires the pragmatism to understand what is achievable, the strength to endure defeat and the humility to know that campaigning musicians aggravate as many people as they inspire. \"[Political] capital diminishes the more often you do it,\" Springsteen admitted to the New Yorker.</p> <p>The principled yet pragmatic Springsteen must know he has a tricky task ahead. Unseating a president you hate is much more energising than re-electing one who has disappointed you. It's notable that many of the musicians who were shouting their support for Obama from the rooftops in 2008 will now only express approval if prompted by interviewers. Many have waited until late in the day before stepping forward, although Springsteen is not alone: <a href=\"http://blog.chron.com/celebritybuzz/2012/10/katy-perry-stevie-wonder-others-play-for-barack-obama/\" title=\"\">a rally in Los Angeles last week featured Stevie Wonder, Bon Jovi and Katy Perry</a>. Perhaps the horrific prospect of a Romney-Ryan White House has only just sunk in.</p> <p>Jay-Z and Beyonc\u00e9 hosted a fundraising party in New York in September for 100 guests who paid $40,000 (\u00a325,000) each; under new campaign finance laws, perhaps the most practically useful thing celebrities can do is help fill the war chest.</p> <p>Springsteen's ability to affect the outcome is limited. No matter <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KFAr2AbvvF8\" title=\"\">how passionately he sings Badlands</a>, he has&#xa0;little chance of stopping <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2012/09/20/beyond_guns_and_god/\" title=\"\">white blue-collar men from backing Mitt Romney 2:1</a>. They are more likely to see the singer as another celebrity liberal than as a fellow son of toil.</p> <p>But in a polarised country with few&#xa0;undecideds, ballot-box success rests more on getting out the vote than&#xa0;on winning over swing voters. Maybe Springsteen saw <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/04/romney-obama-first-presidential-debate\" title=\"\">Obama's low-voltage debate performance</a> and thought the base needed firing up in a&#xa0;hurry. An inspiring performance might just provide the visceral jolt that&#xa0;propels someone to the polling station on 6 November, but if Obama loses, then Springsteen is wise enough and tough enough not to take it personally. On the billion-dollar stage of a presidential election, even the biggest celebrities must settle for supporting roles.</p>",

  "<p>Vladimir Putin has hailed victories by his supporters in regional elections as proof that Russia's citizens support him.</p> <p>Opposition activists alleged widespread fraud in Sunday's polls, in which candidates from Putin's United Russia party won all five races for governor and most elections for local parliaments. But a bigger problem was voter apathy, with turnout nearing record lows.</p> <p>Putin, meeting Russia's election chief on Monday, thanked voters for the result. \"For me, the elections results are not unexpected,\" he said. \"I think it's yet another step that confirms voters' intention to support the current institutions of power and the development of the Russian state.\"</p> <p>The elections, held in regions throughout Russia, were the first since Putin returned to the presidency in May amid unprecedented protests against the longtime leader's continuing rule.</p> <p>They were also the first to be held since Russia returned to the practice of electing governors \u2013 which Putin banned in 2004 as he moved to centralise control.</p> <p>Dmitry Medvedev, now prime minister, brought back the elections as one of his parting moves as president earlier this year \u2013 a move seen as an attempt to appease growing opposition among the urban middle classes. Putin added a so-called \"filter\" to the practice, leaving the Kremlin an outlet for control.</p> <p>The opposition shared videos of ballot-stuffing and reports of so-called \"carousels\" \u2013 vans driven from poll to poll so that paid voters could cast their vote more than once. Golos, an independent vote monitoring organisation, said it received 850 reports of polling violations.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/feedarticle/10410439\" title=\"\">Yevgenia Chirikova, an opposition activist</a> who lost the race for mayor of the Moscow suburb of Khimki, said she would file several law suits to contest the result.</p> <p>Opposition activists threw their support behind Chirikova, an outspoken environmental campaigner who picked up about 20% of the vote. They remained largely silent on other electoral contests, a stark contrast to their large-scale agitation in the runup to national parliamentary elections late last year and the presidential vote in March.</p> <p>The movement has instead turned inward, holding a series of debates leading up to the election later this month of a \"co-ordinating council\" that is due to be its governing body.</p> <p>Turnout was low, with less than 15% of the electorate in the far eastern regions of Kamchatka and Primorye voting, and just 28% in Khimki.</p>"

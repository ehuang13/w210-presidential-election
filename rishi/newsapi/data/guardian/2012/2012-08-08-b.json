  "<p>We all make silly statements. We all make poor predictions. Indeed most Washington pundits are <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/05/03/study-pundits-wrong-most-_n_856886.html\">right as often as they are wrong</a>. One Washington prognosticator, however, stands above the rest.</p> <p>Step up, Dick Morris.</p> <p>Morris was at one time a top political operative. From his guiding of now Congressman Jerry Nadler's student government campaign to his work for Bill Clinton, Morris was a winner. He was running another Bill Clinton campaign, in 1996, when he found himself <a href=\"http://img.timeinc.net/time/magazine/archive/covers/1996/1101960909_400.jpg\">embroiled in a sex scandal</a>. </p> <p>That imbroglio marked a turning point. Morris was no longer to work for Clinton. Instead, he reinvented himself as a writer and television pundit. It is this work that we celebrate here today.</p> <p>Morris' ability to make statements and predictions that are <a href=\"http://mediamatters.org/research/2010/11/09/dick-morris-needs-a-new-crystal-ball/173089\">often so, so wrong</a> is exceptional. He has <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/mark-nickolas/worst-pundit-in-america-d_b_160212.html\">been called</a> the \"worst pundit in America\". The more cynical among us might argue that the word \"America\" should be replaced with \"world\". Indeed, to recall all of Morris's spectacular failures would require more space than Santa is allotted for his Christmas list. </p> <p>Instead, I bring you ten fun and exciting Dick Morris audios, images, videos (in chronological order). Most of these are forecasts, hilarious for just how wrong they were. I cannot guarantee them as the top ten of all time: there are just too many Dick Morris moments from which to choose, so please feel free to note any choices that I've omitted in the discussion thread. </p> <p><strong>1. Bush and congressional Democrats in 2002</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394453697\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/8/1344462942974/dickmorriscspan1_460x276.jpg\" alt=\"Dick Morris on C-Span\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dick Morris on C-Span (<a href=\"http://www.c-spanvideo.org/program/Plays/start/4646/stop/4826\">view video here</a>)</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: guardian.co.uk</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Sometimes, Morris is kind enough to offer us a two-for-one deal. In the span of two minutes, Morris said that President Bush's approval rating would remain in the 80s so long as we were fighting overseas. It did, of course, <a href=\"http://www.hist.umn.edu/~ruggles/Approval.htm\">drop precipitously</a>, into the low 50s, by the 2004 election. Morris also believed that congressional Democrats had neutralized Bush by supporting his wars. It turned out the opposite happened: 2002 was only the second time since 1934 that the president's party gained seats in the House during a midterm election. </p> <p><strong>2. North Korea and Iran will cave</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394453698\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/8/1344463003976/dickmorriscspan2_460x276.jpg\" alt=\"Dick Morris on C-Span\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dick Morris on C-Span (<a href=\"http://www.c-spanvideo.org/clip/3662917\">view video here</a>)</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: guardian.co.uk</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I guess Morris thought that if he couldn't predict elections, then he might do better with the actions of foreign governments. Apparently, Bush's foreign policy was going to bring Iran and North Korea to their knees and force them to cooperate with the United States. Eight years later, Iran continues to back the Syrian government and is as close to war with Israel as it's ever been. Oh, and North Korea is as much a mystery and a headache as ever.</p> <p><strong>3. Condi v Hillary</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394453699\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/8/1344463109631/dickmorrisbookcover_220.jpg\" alt=\"Dick Morris book cover\" width=\"220\" height=\"329\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dick Morris's 2005 book, Condi Vs. Hillary, predicting the 2008 presidential contest, wrongly</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: guardian.co.uk</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This book cover says it all.</p> <p>Morris was correct in believing that Clinton would run, but wrong that she would get the nomination. </p> <p>But Condoleezza Rice running for political office? </p> <p>She'd never run for anything, and didn't run in 2008. </p> <p>Plus, how in the dickens would she possibly win a primary in a pro-life party when she is pro-choice? </p> <p>Morris's wrongness truly boggles the mind.</p> <p><strong>4. The 2008 electoral map</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394453700\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/8/1344463322458/dickmorrismap_460.jpg\" alt=\"Dick Morris election map\" width=\"460\" height=\"293\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>What do Arkansas, Louisiana, Tennessee, and West Virginia have in common? They are all states where the <a href=\"http://www.pollster.com/polls/2008president/\">Pollster.com aggregate</a> favored John McCain over Barack Obama by at least 10 points, yet Morris, for some ridiculous reason, thought the states were toss-ups or leaned Obama? Obama lost them all by 12 to 20 points. And for good measure, Obama won the leaning-McCain state of Indiana.</p> <p><strong>5. Sarah Palin wins 2008 vice-presidential debate</strong></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Mv9pt6LBqwg?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Mv9pt6LBqwg\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Well, Morris thinks Sarah Palin is Ronald Reagan, or something. Morris also manages to smack around Hillary Clinton in this video. To his point that Palin won the debate? All <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/uselection2008/presidentialdebates/3129259/Who-won-the-VP-debate-Palin-or-Joe-Biden.html\">national polls</a> found voters believing Biden won the debate, by at least 15 points. Some <a href=\"http://www.surveyusa.com/index.php/2008/10/03/ohio-poll-palin-biden-debate-is-split-decision/\">state</a> <a href=\"http://www.surveyusa.com/index.php/2008/10/03/state-of-washington-poll-split-decision-on-palin-biden-vice-presidential-debate/\">data</a> pointed to a closer race, but even there, voters thought Biden was more prepared to be president. Palin resigned from office less than a year later and seemingly has no future in running for political office.</p> <p><strong>6. Democrats to lose over 80 seats in the 2010 midterm elections</strong></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/jgImACKB-hY?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/jgImACKB-hY\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>There's a difference between being overly optimistic and being downright off the ledge. Morris crosses that line many times, and did so in calling for Republicans to win 80 new seats in the House of Representatives. Republicans would win a historic victory in 2010, but would only take 63 seats.</p> <p><strong>7. Republicans will shutdown the government over something in 2011 ... and win!</strong></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C_-t7lGR8tI?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C_-t7lGR8tI\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Sometimes, I'm not even sure from where a Dick Morris prediction comes. Here, he claimed that Republicans would shut down the government after regaining control of the House in the 2010 elections, and would win that shutdown. No shutdown ever happened. I guess one almost did over the debt ceiling, but Republicans were the ones who caved to President Obama. </p> <p><strong>8. Donald Trump to run for president</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-audio\" data-canonical-url=\"http://mediamatters.org/embed/181690\"> <iframe class=\"video-embed\" src=\"https://mediamatters.org/embed/181690\" width=\"460\" height=\"345\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen scrolling=\"no\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Donald Trump running for office is like a game of three-card monty. Anyone who knows anything knows that Trump likes to fool around, but at the end of the day, is never going to run. He just likes to hear himself talk. Somehow, Morris thought that Trump had great potential. Trump would plummet in the polls \u2026 and, of course, didn't run.</p> <p><strong>9. Obama to secretly take our guns away on 27 July</strong></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/XZeJpXLsVCI?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/XZeJpXLsVCI\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Did you know that President Obama was working in cahoots with the United Nations to take Americans' guns away on 27 July 2012? I didn't either. It was Obama's secret plan to foil the second amendment! Of course, the United States delegation to the UN <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/07/27/un-arms-trade-treaty-nra_n_1711578.html\">ensured the bill failed</a>.</p> <p><strong>10. The \"real polls\"</strong></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/jabmky1BT38?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/jabmky1BT38\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>I'm just not even sure I have the words for this one, but Morris claims he has the \"real polls\" from a pollster he can't name. Perhaps the funniest thing of this whole clips is even the \"real polls\" have Romney winning only 228 electoral votes. He needs 270 to win the election. (My own estimate would be that if the election were today, then Romney would take 206 electoral votes.)</p> <p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p> <p>The guy behind the counter at Subway is as likely to be accurate at predicting political outcomes as Dick Morris. Dick Morris, however, is far more entertaining.</p>",
  "<p>It's the Middle Class, Stupid!, the <a href=\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2012/07/09/james-carville-on-his-new-book-it-s-the-middle-class-stupid.html\" title=\"\">new zeitgeist book</a> by grizzled Clinton-era advisers Stan Greenberg and James \"Ragin' Cajun\" Carville isn't your standard fare by former political insiders. It's less a retrospective and more an argument about reversing the declining fortunes of middle America: not only should this be the defining issue of this year's presidential election but the struggle of a generation. Their unsparing opening line \u2013 \"We failed and that isn't good enough\" \u2013 serves as a stark warning to the political elite on both sides of the Atlantic that more of the same thinking won't revitalise the prospects of a faltering middle class.</p> <p>Their theme chimes with Barack Obama's impassioned plea to the middle class that he is their best hope for greater economic security today as well as shared prosperity tomorrow \u2013 a pitch that will be remorselessly repeated in every stump speech, will dominate September's Democratic convention and will be rammed home in October's presidential debates.</p> <p>Leave to one side the virtual airbrushing of the \"working class\" from American political discourse and accept the assumption that middle America is where this election is going to be won and lost. It's a view that underpins the edginess of the race. Despite his <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2012/president/us/general_election_romney_vs_obama-1171.html\" title=\"\">narrow overall lead</a>, polling shows Obama trails Mitt Romney among that sought-after group: households with an income of $35k to $90k.</p> <p>If the Obama message is clear, the policy to back it up remains less so. Given the chosen election strategy you might have expected a detailed middle-class economic manifesto to have emerged. Which is not to make light of the relative success of the administration's post-crisis economic management and focus on jobs. Nor is it to indulge the fantasy that there aren't stark differences between the candidates: Romney's Dubya-esque tax plans would give the rich jaw-dropping tax cuts (while increasing the burden on the vast majority of taxpayers); Obama favours a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/apr/10/obama-millionaire-tax-breaks-romney\" title=\"\">tax rise for \"millionaires and billionaires\"</a>.</p> <p>Yet there is a growing sense that more needs to be on offer from the president than a commitment to avoid the wilder lurches of his opponent. As Jared Bernstein, who formerly led the <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/strongmiddleclass/about\" title=\"\">White House's middle class taskforce</a>, says: \"Middle-class economic security is the right agenda but what's needed now is a plain-spoken policy debate so these voters can hear not just that their vote is being courted, but that there is a plan in place to reconnect economic growth and middle class prosperity.\"</p> <p>Bernstein could just as easily have been talking about Britain, where the highly precarious economic position of a large chunk of the working population already hangs heavily over the next election. Typical wages have been flat or falling for nearly a decade. Home ownership has moved out of the reach of a fast-growing swath of the working population, and rents are climbing fast. <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-17155411\" title=\"\">Fewer than half of employees are in an employer's pension scheme</a>, a figure that drops to a third in the private sector. A worryingly high proportion of households are so drenched in debt they risk going underwater when interest rates eventually return to normal levels.</p> <p>Of course, some things get lost in translation in any comparison with the US. There, the middle class has always had a hazier and more inclusive feel, lacking the social affectations and exclusivity that the term is freighted with in the UK. (Consequently British political leaders continually strain to find the right language, whether it be \"hard-working families\", \"the squeezed middle\", \"strivers\" and \u2013 remember this one? \u2013 \"<a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-12149705\" title=\"\">alarm clock Britain</a>\".) Nor have low- and middle-income households \u2013 let's sidestep the \"class\" word \u2013 experienced the severity of wage squeeze, or the recent collapse in house prices, that has afflicted their US counterparts. And, mercifully, the NHS removes one of the most brutal sources of American insecurity as well as alleviating the downward pressure on wages that employer-based healthcare generates.</p> <p>For all these differences there will nonetheless be intense pressure here, as in the US, for a pragmatic and plausible plan for higher living standards. The risk is that limited resources \u2013 and imaginations \u2013 result in some of the favoured myths of contemporary politics being recycled as answers.</p> <p>Let's hope not. A \"modern industrial policy\" may well be vital for a more balanced and export-oriented economy, but it will never result in significant rises in manufacturing employment or lead us to steady wage growth in our service-dominated economy. First-time buyer schemes will bring cheer to the lucky few who benefit, but aren't any sort of replacement for the massive housebuilding programme so desperately needed. And, yes, there's a role for efficiency drives in government, but please let's not pretend they will reduce the need for tax rises or spending cuts.</p> <p>It's hardly a surprise that the rhetoric of a presidential campaign \u2013 even in world-weary 2012 \u2013 soars above hum-drum policy. And make no mistake, if Obama succeeds in defying the plight of other post-crisis incumbents by winning in November, it will be a historic feat. But the cold reality is that the middle-class families he talks about so passionately have been going backwards. Should he secure a second term, it will take Rooseveltian policy ambition to re-wire US capitalism so that the middle class rises along with GDP.</p> <p>As with the Clinton-Blair era, elements of whatever agenda emerges will find an echo here. For better or worse the fate of the US middle class is likely to reveal something about what is in store for Britain.</p>",

  "<p>It's fairly clear that President Obama holds a healthy-sized lead in the race for president. A look at the <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2012/president/us/general_election_romney_vs_obama-1171.html\">RealClearPolitics average</a> has Obama by about 4 percentage points, with some polls higher and some lower. That's what we'd expect given random sampling. <a href=\"http://poughies.blogspot.com/2011/05/predicting-elections-is-like-nfl-we.html\">Averages work</a> because the center of a bell-curve is usually right.</p> <p>Yet, it is the pollsters who are showing the closest races \u2013 that is, in this contest, those the friendliest to Mitt Romney \u2013 who are, not surprisingly, receiving the most attention from conservatives. One of the two pollsters with consistently good Mitt Romney numbers compared to the average has been Rasmussen Reports.</p> <p>Rasmussen polls are <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/wp/2012/09/17/rasmussen-the-gops-cure-for-the-common-poll/\">mostly ignored</a> by the mainstream media. Whether it is because of Scott Rasmussen's <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/blogs/news/96984054.html\">Republican connections</a>, a <a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/11/04/rasmussen-polls-were-biased-and-inaccurate-quinnipiac-surveyusa-performed-strongly/\">Republican bias</a> in 2010, or the pollster's usage of <a href=\"http://www.nationaljournal.com/njonline/the-case-for-robo-pollsters-20090914\">interactive voice response</a> instead of live interviews (which I personally think is a <a href=\"http://poughies.blogspot.com/2010/02/another-argument-against-ivr-polling.html\">bogus reason</a> for lack of attention), Rasmussen remains polling's version of the black sheep of the family.</p> <p>The other poll consistently favorable to Romney has an illustrious history. The Gallup poll has been around longer than most of us have been alive. <a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/corporate/21364/george-gallup-19011984.aspx\">Starting in 1935</a>, Gallup has surveyed in over <a href=\"http://thrive.gallup.com/2012/07/womens-health-and-wellbeing-worldwide.html\">140 countries</a> on many different issues. You could argue that the word Gallup is to polling as Coke is to soda.</p> <p>Gallup passes the press's tests for a \"legitimate\" poll, which Rasmussen fails. You don't see Gallup editor-in-chief Frank Newport going on conservative cruises as Scott Rasmussen does. Gallup uses live interviewers. Gallup calls <a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/poll/110383/does-gallup-call-cell-phones.aspx\">cellphones</a>.&#xa0;One prominent Washington political analyst I've spoken to has called the Gallup tracking poll the political horse-race equivalent of \"crack\".</p> <p>The question is whether Gallup deserves the outsized attention it is receiving this year? The answer in my opinion is an unequivocal no. Here are three reasons why:</p> <p><strong>1). Gallup has if anything been less accurate in the past than other pollsters in presidential elections</strong></p> <p>Sometimes, certain pollsters know something others don't (for example, <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2011/11/friday-interview-the-polling-guru-of-the-iowa-caucuses/249036/\">Ann Selzer and the Iowa Caucus</a>). I went back into the record books, thanks to the <a href=\"http://ncpp.org/?q=node/101\">National Council on Public Polls</a> and <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2004/president/us/general_election_bush_vs_kerry-939.html\">Real Clear Politics</a>, to see if Gallup works the national equivalent of Selzer's Iowa magic. The answer is no, and it's not even close. Here's Gallup's record over the past five presidential elections:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396685508\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/25/1348609601886/Galluppolling_220.jpg\" alt=\"Gallup polling\" width=\"220\" height=\"91\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Gallup has been worse than than the average pollster in three out of the last five elections. On average, Gallup has been worse by 1 percentage point. </p> <p>The average of all the polls (as opposed to comparing Gallup to each pollster, we pool all the pollsters, including Gallup's data, together to form a RealClearPolitics-like average) has had an even better record. The aggregate of all polls beats in Gallup four out of the last five elections. Its average error has only been 2 percentage points \u2013 nearly a point and a half better than Gallup.</p> <p>Gallup has, in other words, been below average compared to other pollsters and is almost always beaten by aggregate of all the polls.</p> <p><strong>2). Gallup in 2010 also had a Republican tilt and it was wildly off-the-mark</strong></p> <p>We've all heard the saying \"Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me.\" In the <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/other/2010_generic_congressional_vote-2171.html\">2010 midterm elections</a>, Gallup projected the Republicans would run up a 15-point margin in the national House of Representatives vote. Only two other pollsters were even close to this prediction of a mammoth lead: Fox News at 13 points, and Rasmussen at 12. Though the majority of evidence pointed away from Gallup, Gallup's previously <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/harry-enten/converting_gallups_generic_bal_b_728492.html\">solid record</a> in House elections meant it couldn't be ignored.</p> <p>The election result was a Republican win by 6.8 percentage points, which means Gallup was off by a little over 8 points.</p> <p>Gallup has, apparently, done little to change its polling methods since. They included cellphone surveying in 2010 and still do. Its 2010 demographic samples were, according to Gallup, <a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/poll/143468/likely-voters-demographically-typical-skew-conservative.aspx\">typical of a midterm election</a>. They have <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/aug/30/race-2012-election-more-demagogics-demographics\">fewer minorities</a> than other samples in 2012, but that hadn't previously impacted the accuracy of their polls. Overall, Gallup seems to be doing most everything right.</p> <p>Yet, why should we trust Gallup and its Republican House effect, when they showed the same effect in 2010 and it was so inaccurate?</p> <p><strong>3). Gallup leans more Republican than you think</strong></p> <p>Gallup is currently one of the most pro-Romney polls in the RealClearPolitics average, but it's the only poll whose population is registered voters. The registered voter population tends to <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/07/18/mitt-romney-polls_n_1680827.html\">lean more Democratic</a> than the actual election day electorate that pollsters try to measure through \"likely voters\". Even with <a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/poll/156194/Democratic-Voting-Enthusiasm-Down-Sharply-2004-2008.aspx\">sky-high Democratic enthusiasm</a> in 2008, Gallup's likely voter model was still <a href=\"http://pollingreport.com/wh08gen.htm\">2 points more Republican</a> than its registered voter results. Gallup's likely voter model was <a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/poll/154559/US-Presidential-Election-Center.aspx?ref=interactive\">3 and 4 more points Republican</a> in 2000 and 2004, respectively.</p> <p>When Gallup turns on its likely voter screen, past experience dictates that, instead of the tied race it currently sees, Gallup will find Romney ahead by a few points. That would make it the most pro-Romney polling data by a few points. That would also make it more friendly to Romney <em>than Rasmussen</em>.</p> <p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p> <p>Both Gallup and Rasmussen continue to show a close race that most other pollsters don't see. That doesn't mean they should be ignored; they should be examined as part of a larger pool of polls that indicate a clear Obama lead.</p> <p>Gallup was a pioneer in the polling industry, but first doesn't equal best. Gallup may have the right ingredients, yet the sauce is just a little off. There's no reason to think they are right this time around while everyone else is wrong.</p>",

  "<p>Barack Obama and Republican challenger Mitt Romney have been crisscrossing America on the campaign trail for months but seldom turn up on the same day at the same event. They did Tuesday at Bill Clinton's annual international aid conference.</p> <p>It was a rare opportunity to compare and contrast, a clash in New York of the White House incumbent and the challenger. </p> <p>Obama is still the bigger draw, with long lines forming 90 minutes before to hear him. Romney did not come close to matching that, although this might have been in part because he was speaking early in the morning, just after 9am, with people still making their way from breakfast.</p> <p>Romney, under huge strain after a series of campaign disasters and polls showing him trailing Obama, rose to the occasion. Normally a poor speaker, often dismissed as 'wooden', he was surprisingly poised and relaxed and his delivery relatively smooth. He also dispensed with his normal stump speech and largely avoided attacks on Obama, instead making a case for tying international aid to free trade deals and stimulating the private sector.</p> <p>By contrast, Obama looked tired, as if he is the one that should be under strain in the election race rather than Romney. But, even tired, Obama is a better speaker than Romney. </p> <p>He devoted his speech to human trafficking, an emotional plea to tackle what he described as \"barbaric\" problem, modern-day slavery. He sounded as if he was addressing a much bigger theme than Romney's, and with passion.</p> <p>Both were speaking at the Clinton Global Initiative conference, the aid foundation set up by the former president which delivers millions of dollars to the developing world each year. Those attending are a mixture of leaders from the developing world, philanthropists, corporate representatives and the heads of non-governmental organisations.</p> <p>The conference audience leans more towards Obama than Romney. Romney received a standing ovation at the start of his speech. Obama received one at the beginning and end.</p> <p>On the face of it, the conference was potentially awkward for Romney, given that it is being hosted by Clinton, who delivered a widely admired speech of the Democratic convention in which he made the case against a Romney presidency. That speech helped contribute to Obama's campaign bounce. </p> <p>But Clinton, introducing Romney, was cordial and Romney smiled as the two stood at the podium. The two shook hands and Romney was on.</p> <p>It was not only that Romney's delivery has improved, he also managed to laugh at himself.</p> <p>\"I appreciate the kind words and your invitation here today. If there's one thing we've learned this election season, it's that a few words from Bill Clinton can do any man a lot of good \u2026 After that introduction, I guess all I have to do is wait a day or two for the bounce.\"</p> <p>The core of Romney's speech was international aid, promising that as president he would tie it to encouraging the private sector in the developing world and to free trade deals, what he called a Prosperity Pact.</p> <p>\"For American foreign aid to become more effective, it must embrace the power of partnerships, access the transformative nature of free enterprise, and leverage the abundant resources that can come from the private sector,\" he said.</p> <p>The closest he came to criticising Obama was saying that Americans were \"troubled\" by events in the Middle East. He also, without naming him, described the Iranian leader Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, attending the UN general assembly, as \"a voice of unspeakable evil and hatred\".</p> <p>When Obama arrived, Clinton went one better than a handshake, giving the president a hug. Obama, returning the favour, praised not only Clinton's speech to the Democratic convention but Hillary Clinton for her grace and grit that he said had made her one of the finest ever secretaries of state, a tribute that helps in building her up for a potential 2016 presidential run.</p> <p>Obama, who has opted for more sober, downbeat speeches this year, offered glimpses of the speaker he had been in 2008, making an emotional plea for an end to worldwide human trafficking. He put it in the context of the Emancipation Proclamation, a copy of which was hanging from the wall of his office in the White House.</p> <p>Human trafficking, Obama said, \"ought to concern every person, because it's a debasement of our common humanity. It ought to concern every community, because it tears at the social fabric. It ought to concern every business, because it distorts markets. It ought to concern every nation, because it endangers public health and fuels violence and organised crime. I'm talking about the injustice, the outrage, of human trafficking, which must be called by its true name \u2013 modern slavery.\" </p> <p>He promised the US would tackle the problem more vigorously than it was at present and announced a few measures. In reality, though, the US does little, as Clinton acknowledged after the speech, noting that most of the work is done by non-governmental bodies rather than governments.</p> <p>Obama has attended the conference every year he has been president and Romney, towards the end of his own speech, said: \"A year from now, I hope to return to this meeting as president.\" </p> <p>If he had delivered speeches throughout the year with the same apparent conviction as he did at the Clinton conference, he might stand a more realistic chance of fulfilling that hope.</p>",
  "<p>Not voting in the age of Obama has become almost a taboo subject among African Americans. After record black voter turnout helped elect the nation's first black president in 2008, the decision not to vote is regarded by many as an affront to the ancestors who died and activists who bled to exercise this right.</p> <p>\"They are not worth the color if they don't vote. They oughta give us their color back. Their African-American credentials should be snatched if they don't vote,\" proclaimed an impassioned Representative Emanuel Cleaver (Democrat, Missouri) in his address to the 42nd annual legislative conference of the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation before the <a href=\"http://www.c-spanvideo.org/program/308294-1\">\"voting rights and new age discrimination\"</a> panel.</p> <p>The sense of community responsibility to vote is all the more palpable leading into the November presidential election \u2013 as 17 states passed voter identification laws that would place restrictions on the quarter of the black population that does not hold a form of government-issued ID. In 2012, voting rights have become a resurgent civil rights issue, <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/09/22/michelle-obama-congressional-black-caucus-speech_n_1906631.html?ncid=edlinkusaolp00000003\">prompting First Lady Michelle Obama to call</a> it \"the march or our time\" and \"the sit-in of our day\". While attempts to obstruct voting by African Americans attest to the community's voting power, voter suppression laws serve as painful reminder of the disenfranchisement they perpetually face, even 150 years after the Emancipation Proclamation.</p> <p>Institutional discrimination has historically driven black voter apathy, which remains an intangible, submerged fact permeating the lives of African Americans unable to see how their voice matters in America. The current challenges for black Americans \u2013 an above-average 14% unemployment rate, more than 27% living in poverty, violence and crime increasing steadily, alongside mortgage foreclosures and debt, and racialized law enforcement initiatives such as \"stop-and-frisk\" \u2013 lead some to feel the need for survival may usurp the right to vote. <a href=\"http://www.theroot.com/users/josiepickens\">Writer and Ebony.com contributor Josie Pickens says</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"That apathy is more common than we'd care to admit- that feeling of powerlessness \u2026 we must also examine a political system that makes its own citizens feel unrepresented and ignored.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>The poll taxes and literacy tests that discouraged the \"negro vote\" in a segregated country a century ago have mutated into the voter ID laws and recessionary pressures that deter African Americans from exercising their voting rights in an increasingly polarized political environment. Besides apathy, there is also active resistance from black Americans, who abstain from participating in a flawed political system in which they believe each party serves to oppress and not empower its citizens. Ferrari Sheppard, artist and independent journalist, expresses his reasons for not voting thus:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"The United States [is] run by banks and global elite, presidents and other so-called elected officials are nothing more than customer service representatives, entertaining and lulling the masses to sleep. I refuse to play their game.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Disillusionment with the system finds historical resonance in the political evolution of the renowned African-American scholar, WEB Du Bois, who pivoted from advocating the vote in 1903, to abstentionism in 1956. In his essay, <a href=\"http://www.blackeconomicdevelopment.com/why-i-wont-vote-by-web-du-bois-the-nation-20-october-1956/\">\"Why I Won't Vote\"</a>, published in the Nation in 1956, Du Bois' scathing critique of corporate greed and its influence on politics, of the lack of affordable healthcare, of racial disparities, and of warmongering reads like a manifesto for modern-day popular <a href=\"http://www.officialoccupythehood.org/\">movements like Occupy the Hood</a>. </p> <p>While the abstentionist critique of voting is rooted in a tradition of black American radicalism, it remains \u2013 along with apathy \u2013 a hotly-contested topic of community discussion, as was recently evidenced by the <a href=\"http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1694167/lupe-fiasco-roland-martin-voting-twitter-debate.jhtml\">Twitter debate</a> between Chicago rapper Lupe Fiasco and CNN contributor Roland S Martin. Tweets variously denouncing Lupe as a \"clown\", praising this decision to abstain, and supporting his political freedom to choose, exposed a myriad of diverging opinions on how African Americans can create substantive change inside and outside of government.</p> <p>In his famous speech <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9BVEnEsn6Y&amp;feature=related\">\"The Ballot or the Bullet\"</a>, Malcolm X simultaneously encouraged blacks Americans to form a unified bloc that could serve as a swing vote and expressed skepticism that voting could bring about equality.&#xa0;That lecture, delivered nearly 50 years ago, still captures much of the complexity of the black voting landscape today.</p> <p>For many African-American non-voters, whether they are alienated into apathy or willfully abstain, the legacy of black inequity is inescapable, even in the era of an African-American president. So some still ask: we are in this country, but are we of this country?</p>",
  "<p>As America's elections approach, with President Barack Obama slightly in front of his Republican challenger, former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney, pollsters still rate the races for control of the presidency and the United States Senate too close to call, with the House of Representatives likely to remain in Republican hands. The differences between the candidates are considerable, and highly consequential for American economic policy and the global economy, although enactment of their programmes will depend on the makeup of Congress.</p> <p>The most important differences between the two candidates can be summarised as follows:</p> <p><strong>Spending</strong>: Obama has dramatically increased spending. He would likely continue many of his temporary programmes (as Milton Friedman once observed, \"There is nothing so permanent as a temporary government programme.\"); double down on having government pick winners and losers in green energy; expand spending on education and infrastructure; and substantially reduce defence expenditures.</p> <p>Romney, by contrast, favours limiting overall federal spending, currently 24% of GDP, to 20%, and keeping defence at 4%. He wants private markets, not government, to choose winning firms and technologies.</p> <p>Democrats oppose most non-defence spending cuts, arguing that reductions would cause the economy to contract. That case is strongest if the spending reductions are large and abrupt in a weak economy. If phased in over a multi-year period as the economy recovers, as Romney proposes, thrift would likely be expansionary. For example, federal spending relative to GDP fell by five percentage points from the mid-1980s to the late 1990s in the US, and by an even larger margin in recent decades in Canada \u2013 that is, through periods of strong economic growth.</p> <p><strong>Taxes</strong>: Obama would raise the top marginal tax rates on wages, capital gains, dividends, interest, and estates, especially on higher-income individuals and small businesses. Yet he has never proposed comprehensive reform of either the personal or corporate income tax.</p> <p>By contrast, Romney would reduce America's corporate tax rate (the highest in the OECD) to 25% and tax American multinationals on a territorial, rather than a worldwide, basis in order to increase their tax competitiveness. He would also lower personal tax rates by 20%, and make up lost revenue by limiting tax deductions and credits, particularly at the upper end, thereby raising about 18.5% of GDP, just above the historical average, at full employment. Romney's fiscal plan thus reduces deficits sufficiently to decrease the debt-to-GDP ratio. He favours a balanced budget amendment to the constitution, and hopes to balance the budget over eight years.</p> <p>Obama, by contrast, would run larger deficits \u2013 his spending increase is much larger than his tax increase \u2013 which imply large tax hikes in the future. Moreover, he would run far larger debt ratios than Romney, because the main driver of the debt is entitlement spending.</p> <p><strong>Entitlements</strong>: Obama has remained silent about reform of Medicare and social security, whose long-run deficits are several times the national debt. Vice President Joe Biden has even said that \"no changes\" to social security are to be made.</p> <p>Romney supports gradually increasing retirement ages, a premium-support model for Medicare, and shifting Medicaid (health insurance for the poor) to the states via block grants. The Obama campaign is pummelling Romney on Medicare, and the Romney campaign is hammering Obama for his refusal to negotiate or even propose a solution.</p> <p>The Obama policy would thus lead to ever-higher deficits and debt ratios well over 100% of GDP, a level that numerous studies imply would reduce US economic growth by one-third or more and might induce a sovereign debt crisis. Some observers suggest that Obama's unspoken plan is ever-growing entitlements eventually paid for by a European-style value-added tax.</p> <p><strong>Trade</strong>: Obama is the first US president in a long time who has not played a leading role on global trade liberalization. The Doha Round of global trade talks remains stalled, and Obama delayed the three bilateral free-trade agreements that awaited approval when he came into office. Romney is a proponent of free trade, but has said that he would be tougher on China's trade practices and currency policies.</p> <p><strong>Regulation</strong>: Obama wants to expand federal command-and-control regulation further (though the courts have stopped his extension of some regulatory powers). Romney vows an economically balanced approach that would reform Obama's major health-care, environmental, and financial-services regulations.</p> <p><strong>Appointments</strong>: Every US president appoints thousands of officials, many with considerable power. Romney has said that he would not reappoint Ben Bernanke as Fed chairman (likely candidates: economists Glenn Hubbard, Greg Mankiw, John Taylor, and Martin Feldstein). Other presidential appointees exert considerable influence on firms, industries, or the entire economy. For example, Obama's appointees to the obscure National Labor Relations Board tried to prevent Boeing from expanding in South Carolina, despite the state's anti-union \"right to work\" legislation.</p> <p>These policies would affect US economic growth, the budget deficit, national saving, and hence global trade and capital flows. With larger deficits under Obama than under Romney, America would need more capital from Europe, Latin America, and Asia, while higher taxes and debt would impede US growth and thus undermine these regions' exports. Obama would steer America in the direction of European social-welfare states; Romney's agenda is designed to prevent that.</p> <p>Whoever wins, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/aug/02/imf-us-fiscal-cliff-global-economy?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">a fiscal cliff looms at the end of 2012</a>. Previous legislation, if not reversed, will lead to large abrupt tax hikes and spending cuts, which the Congressional Budget Office forecasts would likely cause a recession in 2013. While a post-election, lame-duck session of Congress will address the fiscal cliff, the deep differences between Republicans and Democrats on taxes and spending remain wide and difficult to bridge.</p> <p>With uncertainty plaguing Europe's finances and China slowing, the last thing the global economy needs is a stagnant or shrinking US economy. But it will take strong leadership by the president-elect to avoid it.</p> <p>Copyright: <a href=\"www.project-syndicate.org\" title=\"\">Project Syndicate</a>, 2012.</p>",

And this year's election feels like an eating contest to beat all others.</p> <p>As the internet explodes with images of Barack Obama and Mitt Romney traveling from coast to coast (or rather from swing state to swing state) enjoying old-fashioned local snacks and bags of fast food, one wonders: is this race man versus man, or <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/tv-and-radio/2012/jun/16/man-v-food-adam-richman\" title=\"\">Man v Food</a>? What a strange horror! Here you are, with what you think are some really smart ideas about changing the course of history through holding America's highest office. But to get there, you have to consume all of the country's lowest foods on camera? It's punishing.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396840743\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/25/1348575259255/Barack-Obama-001.jpg\" alt=\"Barack Obama\" width=\"210\" height=\"246\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Buying a chili bowl in Washington. Photograph: AP Photo/Gerald Herbert </span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gerald Herbert/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Some time ago I decided that there are two kinds of people in the world: people who will eat two dinners in one night, and people who will not. Not by coincidence, I decided this on a night when I was suffering the effects of having eaten two dinners. An error of scheduling happened and when I found myself in the second location facing the second plate, I thought: \"Would it be worse to eat again and feel disgusting or to hurt this person's feelings?\" I picked feeling disgusting, because a two-dinner person cares more about her companions than her digestion.</p> <p>And ever since that unpleasant evening I've understood that overeating to make other people happy is not just an exercise in gluttony; it's a measure of one's generosity of spirit. Every time another American patriot hands a presidential candidate another deep-fried regional dish for his delectation, knowing fully he's just had to eat a burger down the street, the gesture isn't just saying: \"Welcome to town, try this local thousand-calorie delicacy\"; it's a crucial and maybe even cruel test, saying: \"What's more important: your acid reflux, or America's feelings?\"</p> <p>You would hope that noshing doesn't really swing votes. If Obama came round to my home and declined a piece of pie (apple, obviously), I guess I would feel a little put out, but I'd still vote for him. And even if Romney could <a href=\"http://www.buzzfeed.com/mckaycoppins/mitt-romney-struggles-to-identify-a-donut\" title=\"\">correctly identify a doughnut</a>, I would find him appalling. But it's only human to spare a thought for both of them in the face of their unremitting onslaught of snacks.</p> <p>When Ann Romney declared the other day that Republicans who think her husband's not trying hard enough should \"get in the ring\", some would have thought that she was trying to use a boxing metaphor. But I bet she was really thinking about Nathan's Famous Hot Dog Eating Contest. And thus, while I can't stomach his views on policy, I raise a glass (small plastic measuring cup) of Pepto-Bismol to Romney and the road he's travelling. For I suspect it's paved not just with failure, but with indigestion.</p>",
  "<p>The UK government has spent millions of pounds on training military, police and security personnel from oppressive regimes that have arms embargoes in place, the Guardian has learned.</p> <p>In the last five years, Sudan and the Democratic Republic of the Congo have received from the UK government \u00a32.4m between them in training and support for military and defence personnel.</p> <p>Sudan is the only country in the world where the sitting president, Omar al-Bashir, has been indicted for genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity by the international criminal court, while in Congo extensive human rights abuses, including extra-judicial killings and torture, have been documented.</p> <p><a href=\"http://enoughproject.org/\" title=\"\">The Enough Project</a>, which works with the American actor George Clooney to expose human rights abuses in both Sudan and Congo, says the two countries are the scene of some of the world's most serious mass atrocities.</p> <p>In information revealed in a <a href=\"http://www.mod.uk/DefenceInternet/FreedomOfInformation/DisclosureLog/\" title=\"\">freedom of information response from the Ministry of Defence</a> a total of \u00a375,406 has been spent on providing 44-week courses at the elite Royal Military Academy Sandhurst for Sudanese and Congolese forces. Other support includes military logistics, advanced command and staff courses, strategic intelligence and evaluating challenges to state sovereignty.</p> <p>A total of \u00a3952,301 was spent on international peace support, which includes border security and stabilisation.</p> <p>Much of the current focus of concern about human rights abuses in Sudan centres on conflict in the border areas with the newly formed country of South Sudan, such as Blue Nile, Nuba Mountains and South Kordofan, and the ongoing conflict in Darfur, where documented genocide shows 300,000 Darfuris have been killed and up to 4 million displaced. The Sudanese government has refused humanitarian aid access to the border areas.</p> <p>In Congo many and varied human rights abuses have been documented, especially against opponents of the president, Joseph Kabila. A UN report earlier this year highlighted \"serious human rights violations, including killings, disappearances and arbitrary detentions\" during last November's presidential elections. At least 33 people were killed by government forces during the elections, and hundreds were arrested and said they had been tortured. A delegation of UK officials has been investigating claims of torture in Congo and is due to report back shortly.</p> <p>A leading Sudanese exile based in the UK, Dr Gebreil Fediel from Darfur, is challenging the legality of the UK government's relationship with Sudan in the high court next month.</p> <p>His legal team is bringing enforcement proceedings against the government for failing to provide him with protection under the refugee convention and travel documents to enable him to attend peace talks around the world. These talks aim to bring an end to the appalling human rights situation in Sudan. He is the leader of a major Sudanese opposition movement, the Justice and Equality Movement.</p> <p>The high court judge Mr Justice Wyn Williams described the government's approach to Fediel as \"unreasonably restrictive\" in January of this year.</p> <p>In a statement to the court Fediel accused the government of failing to provide him with protection because there was a deal between the two governments.</p> <p>\"I believe the government of Sudan is requesting the UK government to treat me like this for political reasons. Their decisions to exclude and restrict me are underpinned by political and intelligence considerations.\"</p> <p>He expressed concern about the military support and training provided by the UK: \"If it was and is the intention of the UK authorities to teach Sudan's police and security officers how to conduct these matters in a democratic manner, it has failed. The brutality and genocidal activities of government of Sudan state organs against its own citizens is widely documented.\"</p> <p>In July the Foreign Office minister Lord Howell admitted about Sudan: \"There is ample evidence that the military tactics being used raise concerns that the most serious crimes of concern to the international community may be being committed.\"</p> <p>Fediel said that as well as the UK's provision of military support to his government the UK had also been providing support and training to Sudanese police and security officials. He said that in May a group of senior police officers came to the UK for training.</p> <p>A letter from the former Foreign Office minister Ivan Lewis in 2010 stated: \"The UK has a large police support programme in Democratic Republic of the Congo.\"</p> <p>Aaron Hall, the associate director of research for the Enough Project, said: \"We would hope that any nation providing military and security support to these countries would have conditions attached to that support based on the adherence to international human rights laws and standards. If credible evidence exists that shows violation of those laws and standards whether within those countries borders or externally, we would urge those governments providing support to immediately suspend that support, and further to work with international and regional partners to hold those responsible for human rights abuses accountable for their actions.\"</p> <p>Jovanka Savic, Fediel's solicitor, said: \"There is an obligation under international law that requires states to bring to an end breaches of international law through legal means. This new evidence suggests that the UK is not helping to do this but is instead giving aid and assistance to the Sudanese government in a way that could be in breach of its international legal obligations. It is very concerning that support is being offered to DRC where many human rights abuses have been documented.\"</p> <p>She said the UK's actions against Fediel, in preventing or restricting him from attending peace talks around the world, was helping to prolong the human suffering and conflict in Sudan.</p> <p>\"They are making this man's life very difficult for political and arguably illegal reasons,\" she said.</p> <p>The government provided a response from four departments \u2013 the Home Office, the Ministry of Defence, the Foreign Office and the Department for International Development.</p> <p>A spokesman said: \"Strict criteria are applied to any training to ensure that it complies with overseas security and assistance human rights guidance. For each funding decision an assessment of the risk of human rights abuses is carried out. Her Majesty's government conducts continual assessment of its programmes and human rights compliance is a cardinal criterion of this.</p> <p>\"UK officials have contact with international criminal court indictees only when this is considered essential and on a case-by-case basis. No contact with President Bashir has come about as a result of these programmes.\"</p> <p>However, the spokesman confirmed that some meetings had taken place between the previous and present ambassador to Sudan and Bashir. \"The main occasions are when a British ambassador leaves or takes up their post in Khartoum.\"</p> <p>The spokesman said that international peace support was delivered to UN peacekeeping missions in Sudan and South Sudan and funding was provided for the African Union panel leading the talks aimed at ending the conflict.</p> <p>He confirmed that nine senior national police officers from Sudan visited London in May to learn about policing and human rights in the UK, two of whom held the rank of major general. \"The officers met the Sudanese ambassador at his London office as a protocol courtesy.\" He said that community policing initiatives had been set up following the officers' return to Sudan.</p> <h2>The reaction from Africa </h2> <p>Studies have shown that Congolese soldiers are responsible for at least 60% of reported rapes in the country. Last year the UN implicated them in the rape of at least 121 women over three days in the village of Nyakiele, in South Kivu province. This came after the gang-rape of at least 47 women by government troops in North Kivu.</p> <p>The UN's high commissioner for human rights has said: \"The Congolese army remains responsible for a significant number of human rights violations, including sexual violence.''</p> <p>The opposition Union for Democracy and Social Progress (UDPS) was at the sharp end of last year's election crackdown and claims soldiers were used to intimidate voters and interfere with ballot papers. It expressed concern at the use of British resources to train and support the military.</p> <p>Albert Moleka, the party's cabinet director and spokesman, said: \"Training is a normal part of the co-operation of our two countries but we might say it is the responsibility of the DRC to use those who have been trained properly. That can only be done by a legitimate political authority. Unfortunately we don't have a legitimate political authority. There is a huge gap of mistrust between the army and the population.\"</p> <p>He added: \"In our experience it is the elite troops with the best equipment who are used against the population. I think military co-operation should be attached with strict conditions that ensure force is never used against the people. That is difficult for outside countries to monitor.\"</p> <p>Moleka said there was a long tradition of Congo's military elite studying at academies in Britain and other foreign countries. \"But when they come back, what functions do they occupy? How can they help their country? They're not given the opportunity to bring what they learn to change the attitudes and behaviour of the army.\"</p> <p>The Congolese army, badly paid and fed, is still struggling to maintain discipline after the integration of a Tutsi rebel militia following a 2009 peace treaty. Yet the international community, including the world's biggest UN peacekeeping operation, has put faith in it to quell violence in the country's war-torn east.</p> <p>In May, Human Rights Watch reported that Sudanese government forces were carrying out indiscriminate bombings and abuses against civilians in southern Kordofan. It called on Sudan to investigate the discovery of a cluster bomb in the region. Witnesses interviewed in Blue Nile also described serious abuses by the armed forces. The onslaughts have <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/africa/new-arrivals-in-south-sudan-tell-of-worst-war-crimes-since-darfur-7965160.html\" title=\"\">created tens of thousands of refugees living in appalling conditions</a>.</p> <p>John Ashworth, a church adviser who has lived in Sudan and South Sudan for three decades, said: \"While one might argue that helping an army to maintain professional standards could improve their human rights record, this is clearly not the case with the Sudanese army, which continues to commit atrocities against civilians in Darfur, the Nuba Mountains and Blue Nile, and continues to threaten its new neighbour, South Sudan.\"</p> <p>Ishag Mekki, a Darfur refugee in Britain who campaigns for the region, said: \"It is shame that the UK government behaves irresponsibly and assists a war crime government. It is an ethical matter not to stand firmly with victims of both countries. I am annoyed seeing ministers and government officials visit the UK on a regular basis for various businesses, but to train them is shocking. It means the people of Darfur will have to wait very long to persuade this government to change their mind.\"</p> <p>Pascal Kambale, DRC country director of the Open Society Initiative for West Africa, said: \"I don't think this is appropriate at all. The Congolese army badly needs complete reform and western donors \u2013 including the UK \u2013 have completely failed on their promise to help the Congolese government's effort to reform its army. Throwing this kind of big money into training not only is not in line with security sector reform programmes. It is also counterproductive because it comforts the Congo government into its lack of interest in reforming its army.\"</p>",

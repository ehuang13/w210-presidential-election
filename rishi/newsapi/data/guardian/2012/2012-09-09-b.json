  "<p>Some senior Taliban figures are ready to negotiate a ceasefire and might be ready to accept a long-term US military presence in Afghanistan as part of a comprehensive peace deal, according to a report to be published on Monday based on interviews with Taliban officials and negotiators.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.rusi.org/talibanbriefing2012\" title=\"\">The report</a>, published by the Royal United Services Institute, finds that the Taliban is determined to make a decisive break with al-Qaida as part of a settlement and is open to negotiation about education for girls, but is adamantly opposed to the constitution which it sees as a prop for President Hamid Karzai's government.</p> <p>The Taliban insurgents will not negotiate with the Karzai government largely because of its record of corruption. They do not trust Kabul to run fair elections, which suggests that, even if the moderates interviewed in the study prevailed within Taliban circles, serious obstacles to a peace deal would remain.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.rusi.org/talibanbriefing2012\" title=\"\">The institute's report</a>, entitled Taliban Perspectives on Reconciliation, is the product of interviews with four unnamed figures, two of whom were ministers in the former Taliban government and are still close to the inner circle of leadership. One is described as being \"closely associated\" with Mullah Mohammad Omar, the Taliban leader. A third is portrayed as \"a senior former mujahideen commander and lead negotiator for the Taliban\", although not part of the movement itself, and the fourth is said to be \"an Afghan mediator with extensive experience negotiating with the Taliban\".</p> <p>The report concludes: \"The Taliban would be open to negotiating a ceasefire as part of a general settlement, and also as a bridge between confidence-building measures and the core issue of the distribution of political power in Afghanistan.</p> <p>\"A ceasefire would require strong Islamic justification, obscuring any hint of surrender,\" it adds.</p> <p>Even more surprising, in view of the official Taliban propaganda portraying it as leading a struggle against foreign invaders, the report says the insurgents are \"prepared to accept a long-term US military presence in Afghanistan\".</p> <p>According to one interviewee, described as a founder member of the Taliban, a settlement that left US troops operating out of five primary military bases \u2013 Kandahar, Herat, Jalalabad, Mazar-e-Sharif and Kabul \u2013 might be acceptable as long as the US presence \"does not impinge on our independence and religion\". In other words, the Taliban might accept continuing US counter-terrorist operations targeting their former ally, al-Qaida, as long as the bases were not used as a launching pad for attacks on other countries or for interference in Afghan politics.</p> <p>The report even suggests that the Taliban would co-operate in tracking down al-Qaida members, noting that the leadership and base \"deeply regret\" their past association with the global jihadist group.</p> <p>Michael Semple, one of the report's co-authors and a former EU envoy to Afghanistan, said that interviewees represented a significant but not yet dominant strand in Taliban views. \"We are not saying that this is some kind of poll that says three out of four Taliban members are in favour of a ceasefire,\" he said. \"But there is a part of the movement who see there is no prospect of a military victory and so ceasefire would make sense. This is not the official line, but rather the outer fringe of Taliban thought. It's not mainstream yet.\"</p> <p>Semple, now at Harvard University, <a href=\"http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/politics/2012/07/taliban-commander-i-was-relieved-death-osama?quicktabs_most_read=0\" title=\"\">interviewed another Taliban commander in July</a>, who also admitted there was no prospect of an insurgent victory, but he said that commander was not part of the institute's study.</p> <p>Contacts between US officials and Taliban representatives have stalled largely because of failure to conclude a confidence-building deal to exchange five Taliban prisoners held at Guantanamo Bay for a US soldier captured by insurgents. Substantive talks, which were due to be held in Qatar, are expected to remain on hold until after the US presidential election in November, but senior US officials said they were holding discussions this week with Pakistan, where the Taliban leadership is based, about the safe passage of insurgent officials for future peace talks.</p> <p>\"Reconciliation remains a key component of our strategy,\" a senior US official said. \"The safe passage working group was meeting this week alone as a piece of that, and Ambassador [Marc] Grossman [the US special envoy for Afghanistan and Pakistan] will embark on an upcoming trip at some point to continue to pursue this in a very robust manner.\u2026\"</p> <p>Another senior official stressed that the official US designation on Friday of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/07/haqqani-network-terrorist-hillary-clinton\" title=\"\">the Haqqani network</a>, a Taliban faction based in the Pakistani tribal area of Waziristan, would not rule out future talks with the group, and would not lead to the financial sanctions against Pakistan. The official disowned <a href=\"http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/politics/2012/07/taliban-commander-i-was-relieved-death-osama?quicktabs_most_read=0\" title=\"\">allegations made last year</a> by Admiral Mike Mullen, the outgoing chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, who described the Haqqani network as \"a veritable arm\" of Pakistani intelligence.</p> <p>\"I want to just unequivocally state that this in no way is the consensus, unanimous view of this administration; that we are making absolutely no effort to begin a process to designate Pakistan as a state sponsor of terrorism,\" the US official said.</p> <p>Semple said he did not think the designation of the Haqqanis would have any serious impact on future peace talks.</p> <p>\"The US have already given them a good few chances to to do politics,\" he said. \"They are really at the heart of the nastiest part of the armed struggle.\"</p>",
  "<p>As Republicans were <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/aug/29/republicans-hurricane-mitt-romney-ann\" title=\"\">promoting themselves as a multiracial party</a> from the platform in Tampa two weeks ago,&#xa0;an ugly incident on the convention floor suggested not everyone had got the memo. From the podium a range of speakers of Haitian, Mexican, Cuban and Indian descent spoke of how their parents had overcome huge barriers so they could succeed in the US. In the audience, a successful black woman who works for CNN was being <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/29/republican-national-convention-race-tampa\" title=\"\">pelted with peanuts</a> by a convention-goer, who said: \"This is how we feed the animals.\"</p> <p>The tension between the <a href=\"http://www.thenation.com/article/169746/behind-gops-diversity-display\" title=\"\">projection of a modern, inclusive, tolerant party</a> and the reality of a sizeable racially intolerant element within its base pining for the restoration of white privilege is neither new nor accidental. Indeed, it in no small part explains the trajectory of the Republican party for almost the last&#xa0;half century. In his diary, Richard Nixon's chief-of-staff, Bob Haldeman, described how his boss spelled out the racial contours of a new electoral game-plan to win southern and suburban whites over to the Republican party in the wake of the civil rights era. \"You have to face the fact that the whole problem is really the blacks,\" Nixon told him. \"The key is to devise a system that recognises that while not appearing to.\"</p> <p>This could be the final hurrah for what became known as Nixon's southern strategy in what is shaping up to be the most racially polarised election ever. Black support for the Republican party literally cannot get any lower. A recent <a href=\"http://firstread.nbcnews.com/_news/2012/08/21/13399788-nbcwsj-poll-heading-into-conventions-obama-has-four-point-lead NBC/\" title=\"\">Wall Street Journal poll</a> had 0% of African-Americans saying they intend to vote for Romney. At 32%, <a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/poll/154559/US-Presidential-Election-Center.aspx\" title=\"\">support among Latinos is higher</a> but still remains pathetically low given what Republicans need to win (40%) and what they have had in the past \u2013 in 2004 George W Bush won 44%. As a result, the party of Lincoln is increasingly dependent on just one section of the electorate \u2013 white people. To win, Romney needs 61% of the white vote from a white turnout of 74%. That's a lot. In 2008, John McCain got 55% from the same turnout. \"<a href=\"http://www.nationaljournal.com/thenextamerica/politics/obama-needs-80-of-minority-vote-to-win-2012-presidential-election-20120824\" title=\"\">This is&#xa0;the last time anyone will try to do this</a>,\" one Republican strategist told the&#xa0;National Journal. And Republican consultant Ana Navarro <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/news/politics/la-pn-republican-minority-party-20120829,0,3047039.story\" title=\"\">told the Los Angeles Times</a>: \"Where his numbers are right now, we should be pressing the panic button.\"</p> <p>There are two main reasons for this panic. The first is that the \"system\" Nixon referred to is now recognisable by most \u2013 particularly with a black president in the White House. As people have become more attuned to the frequency of the dog whistles, the tone has necessarily become more shrill. During the primaries, <a href=\"http://www.thenation.com/article/165576/gops-blatant-racism\" title=\"\">Rick Santorum told a crowd in New Hampshire</a>: \"I don't want to make black people's lives better by giving them somebody else's money; I want to give them the opportunity to go out and earn the money.\" Newt Gingrich branded Obama \"<a href=\"http://www.businessweek.com/news/2012-01-25/gingrich-calling-obama-food-stamp-president-draws-critics.html\" title=\"\">the food stamp president</a>\". Just a few weeks ago, in a clear nod to the \"birthers\", who insist Obama was not born in the US, the party's nominee, <a href=\"http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/08/24/romney-makes-a-birther-joke-while-campaigning/\" title=\"\">Mitt Romney, went to Michigan and joked</a>: \"No one's ever asked to see my birth certificate. They know that this&#xa0;is the place that we were born and raised.\" This is rhetorical peanut throwing. When everyone can hear it, you've transitioned from a dog whistle to a straight-up whistle.</p> <p>Second, with <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/09/us/politics/obama-may-still-have-an-ally-in-wisconsin-demographics.html\" title=\"\">white people destined to become a minority</a> in a few decades, the strategy is no longer an anchor but a millstone. Tying Republican fortunes to the white vote made electoral sense in the early 1970s. Since 1980, the white share of the electorate has fallen in every consecutive election bar one \u2013 1996, when Ross Perot ran. The more black and Latino voters the Republicans alienate, the more white voters they need to replace them. The trouble is they are fishing for a larger number in a smaller pool, which demands ever more juicy bait. \"The demographics race we're losing badly,\" said Senator Lindsey Graham, acknowledging the problem. \"We're not generating enough angry white guys to stay in business for the long term.\"</p> <p>But that's not for want of trying. In just one example, the New York Times' <a href=\"http://campaignstops.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/08/27/making-the-election-about-race/\" title=\"\">Thomas Edsall analyses</a> a Romney ad lambasting Obama's healthcare reform. The ad states: \"<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4gPvToKTWU\" title=\"\">You paid into Medicare for years</a> \u2013 every pay check. Now when you need it, Obama has cut $716bn from Medicare. Why? To pay for Obamacare. The money you paid for your guaranteed healthcare is going to a massive new government programme that is not for&#xa0;you.\"</p> <p>Leave aside the fact that the ad is <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2012/aug/20/mitt-romney/romney-says-obama-cuts-716-medicare-pay-obamacare/\" title=\"\">judged by Politifact as only half true</a> and that the Republican vice-presidential candidate <a href=\"http://articles.latimes.com/2012/aug/15/news/la-pn-romney-paul-ryan-medicare-cuts-20120815\" title=\"\">Paul Ryan has proposed a budget</a> that would cut a similar amount from Medicare without healthcare reform. More than three-quarters of Medicare recipients are white; more than half those without health insurance are not white. By linking the two in this way, \"Obamacare\" thereby becomes a transfer of resources from hard working white retirees to indigent minority ethnic people. Meanwhile, Larry McCarthy, who produced the now infamously racist <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EC9j6Wfdq3o\" title=\"\">Willie Horton ad</a> for George HW Bush's campaign in 1988, is working for one of the Super Pac's backing Romney.</p> <p>Describing the evolution of the Republicans' racial appeal, the late Lee Atwater, one-time chair of the Republican National Committee and member of the Reagan administration, <a href=\"http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C04E6DF1E30F935A35753C1A9639C8B63\" title=\"\">said in 1981</a>. \"You start out in 1954 by saying, 'Nigger, nigger, nigger'. By 1968 you can't say 'nigger' \u2013 that hurts you. Backfires. So you say stuff like forced busing [and] states' rights. You're getting so abstract now [that] you're talking about cutting taxes, and all these things you're talking about are totally economic things and a byproduct of them is [that] blacks get hurt worse than whites \u2026 obviously sitting around saying, 'We want to cut this' is much more abstract than even the busing thing, and&#xa0;a hell of a lot more abstract than 'nigger, nigger'.\"</p> <p>Reflecting on her experience in Tampa, Patricia Carroll, the CNN camerawoman who had peanuts thrown at her said: \"<a href=\"http://mije.org/richardprince/cnn-camerawoman-not-surprised-peanut-throwing#Carroll\" title=\"\">I can't change these people's hearts and minds</a> \u2026 This should be a&#xa0;wake-up call to black people \u2026 People were living in euphoria for a while. People think we're gone further than we&#xa0;have.\"</p> <p><em>Twitter </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/garyyounge\" title=\"\"><em>@garyyounge</em></a><em> </em></p>",
  "<p>Republican presidential hopeful Mitt Romney said Sunday he will keep some of Barack Obama's controversial healthcare reforms if he wins November's election, breaking from a prior whole-scale rejection of the plan.</p> <p>\"Of course there are a number of things that I like in healthcare reform that I'm going to put in place,\" he said in an interview broadcast Sunday on NBC's Meet the Press.</p> <p>Republicans have pledged to repeal \"Obamacare\" \u2013 legislation that has become the focus of a furious backlash from Republicans. Paul Ryan, the party's vice-presidential pick, has described the affordable care act as a \"Ponzi scheme that would make Bernie Madoff proud\". Romney himself has described the legislation as a \"job killer\" that \"puts the federal government between you and your doctor\".</p> <p>But the former Massachusetts governor said Sunday there were a number of pieces of the legislation he would keep if elected, including making sure that people with pre-existing conditions can get insurance. Romney also said he would allow young adults to keep their coverage under their parents' health insurance.</p> <p>\"I say we're going to replace Obamacare. And I'm replacing it with my own plan,\" Romney said. \"And even in Massachusetts when I was governor, our plan there deals with pre-existing conditions and with young people.\"</p> <p>The interview came as it emerged that Obama had received a larger boost than Romney in the polls following their respective conventions. According to Scott Rasmussen's latest poll Obama now leads Romney 49% to 45%, his biggest lead since March 17 and his best approval rating of the year. Obama also has a four-point lead in the most recent Gallup and Reuters/Ipsos polls.</p> <p>Rasmussen said: \"The president's bounce began the night after Bill Clinton spoke to the convention and received rave reviews. Sixty-six percent of voters nationwide have a favourable opinion of the former president. Democrats overwhelmingly believe Clinton and Obama have similar views on how to fix the economy, but few Republicans and unaffiliated voters share that assessment.\"</p> <p>He said the president had made significant gains in voters aged 40-64.</p> <p>The poll Sunday comes even after <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/07/obama-jobs-figures-us-election-chances\">disappointing jobs figures released Friday</a> that showed the US added just 96,000 jobs in August. Obama has spent the weekend defending his record on the economy and attacking Romney's plans. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/08/obama-romney-campaign-battleground-states\">In the swing state of Florida on Saturday</a> Obama summed Romney's platform up as: \"Tax cuts, tax cuts, gut a few regulations, some more tax cuts.\"</p> <p>In an interview aired Sunday on CBS's Face the Nation, Obama further criticised his opponent for refusing to consider tax increases on America's super-rich as a way to help reduce the deficit.</p> <p>He said:\"You can't reduce the deficit unless you take a balanced approach that says, 'We've got to make government leaner and more efficient, but we've also got to ask people \u2013 like me or governor Romney, who have done better than anybody else over the course of the last decade and whose taxes are just about lower than they've been in the last 50 years \u2013 to do a little bit more.\"</p> <p>Romney attacked Obama's record on the economy on Sunday, stating: \"This does not look like a recovery.\"</p> <p>He also tackled Democratic claims that his tax policies will favour the rich. \"We're not going to have high-income people pay less of the tax burden than they pay today. That's not what's going to happen,\" he said.<br>Romney said he would keep taxes down by closing loopholes but declined to provide an example of a loophole he would close.</p> <p>\"I can tell you that people at the high end, high-income taxpayers, are going to have fewer deductions and exemptions. Those numbers are going to come down. Otherwise they'd get a tax break. And I want to make sure people understand, despite what the Democrats said at their convention, I am not reducing taxes on high-income taxpayers,\" Romney said.</p>",
  "<p>The Republican White House ticket sought to neuter the perceived foreign policy edge of the Obama electoral campaign on Sunday, attacking the president's record whilst bragging of their own experience overseas.</p> <p>The current administration was guilty of failing to halt Iran's nuclear ambitions, Mitt Romney claimed during an interview with NBC's Face the Nation. Meanwhile, in a separate TV appearance, his running mate, Paul Ryan, was attempting to make the claim that he is better versed in foreign policy matters than Obama was four years ago, by virtue of Ryan's longer public service record in Washington.</p> <p>It represented a two-pronged approach to countering what is seen to be a Democratic advantage going into this year's election. Obama's campaign team have made much of the president's decision to pull troops out of Iraq and embark on military drawdown in Afghanistan, as well as highlight the assassination of Osama bin Laden.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Romney has made a somewhat clumsy opening gambit as a potential overseas ambassador for the US.</p> <p>In his first foreign trip as a White House candidate he offended one of America's closest allies, the UK, by criticising efforts to prepare for the Olympic Games and drew fierce criticism for suggesting while in Israel that the Palestinians' relative poverty was due to cultural differences.</p> <p>Compounding the view that Obama has an edge in terms of perceived handling of foreign policy, the Republican hopeful opened himself up to mockery in his recent convention speech in Tampa by suggesting that Russia remained the US's \"number one geo-political foe\".</p> <p>Vice-president Joe Biden has said the comment showed Romney was \"stuck in a Cold War mindset\".</p> <p>But speaking on CBS's Face the Nation, Ryan defended his running mate's comments.</p> <p>\"I think what he was saying was among the other powers, China and Russia, that Russia stands a great threat,\" he said, adding: \"Iran is our biggest foreign policy threat today\".</p> <p>The Republican vice-presidential pick also sough to push his own foreign policy credentials, boasting that he had more experience than Obama had in the run up to 2008's election.</p> <p>Challenged on what made him better qualified, considering then-senator Obama had sat on the Senate foreign relations committee, Ryan cited his 14 years in Congress.</p> <p>He added: \"I've voted to send men and women to war. I've been to Iraq and Afghanistan. I've met with our troops to get their perspectives. I've been to the funerals, I've talked to the widows, I've talked to the wives, the moms and the dads. That's something. That matters.\"</p>",
  "<p>The French president, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, will have 25 minutes on primetime television on Sunday evening to convince his nation that he will keep his election pledges and drag his country out of the economic mire.</p> <p>The French leader hopes the interview will halt his slide in the polls, which suggest more than half of voters are dissatisfied with him.</p> <p>Hollande is expected to talk about specific economic and social issues. He will also reassure voters that he will press ahead with controversial election pledges, including higher taxes for the rich. French newspapers suggest the president may also announce new taxes to bring in an extra \u20ac15bn (\u00a312bn).</p> <p>\"The tone will be serious,\" a member of the presidential entourage told the Journal du Dimanche (JDD). \"He has about a half an hour to convince the French there's a chief at the head of state who has a vision, a destination and a timescale for getting there.\"</p> <p>Hollande's popularity has plummeted, with the majority of French people having lost faith in his election promises, according to a poll in le Parisien newspaper on Sunday. The president's rating has dropped 22 percentage points to 40% from a previous poll two weeks after he took up office on 16 May, it found. Dissatisfaction with his leadership has risen to 59%, the survey added.</p> <p>Hollande sold himself to the French electorate as \"Monsieur Normal\", a contrast to the hyper-presidency of his predecessor Nicolas Sarkozy. En route to an official engagement a week ago, he ordered his chauffeur to stop at a petrol station so he could have a coffee and chat with lorry drivers to gauge the national mood. Now, however, his determination to appear ordinary has been interpreted as a symptom of chronic indecision and inaction.</p> <p>Some have suggested the president needs to appear more pushy.</p> <p>On Friday, the Socialist government insisted that key election pledges, including spending cuts and reforms that would see a 75%tax rate for anyone earning more than \u20ac1m a year, were not being watered down. The high tax rate was a \"symbolic measure that people expect and that means a lot to the country\", said a presidential aide.</p> <p>Hollande will remind voters that his country's stagnant economy and the eurozone crisis make it vital for France to reduce its public deficit to 3% of gross domestic product next year or risk a loss of investors' trust and a possible credit rating downgrade.</p> <p>\"The French know that difficult decisions have to be made. They want to hear their president,\" the adviser said. \"He is obliged to raise French people's concerns, which are real, and to say: 'Here is what I am doing, here is what is being done, here is where I am taking you.'\"</p> <p>Elys\u00e9e advisers say the president hopes to dispel the impression that he is \"immobile\" in the face of the country's economic woes, but may not make any specific new policy statement. In the interview he will stress that he has only a \"small spade\" to dig the country out of its economic problem, they said.</p> <p>\"The French approve of what he is doing, but they are perplexed about where it's going, that's to say the direction and what it means, and it is this he will try to address,\" one of the president's team told the JDD.</p>"

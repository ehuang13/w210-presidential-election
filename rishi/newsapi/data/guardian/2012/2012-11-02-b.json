  "<p>This time next week, we'll know. I hesitate to say we'll know by Wednesday morning: any journalist who covered the Bush v Gore Florida photo-finish of 2000 knows better than to tempt fate. But, barring a repeat of that freak event, it should be clear enough soon enough.</p> <p>Now is the moment the two duelling campaigns contemplate their destiny. What if Mitt Romney loses, as most of the blue-chip polling analysis says he will? It'll be a bitter personal defeat for a man who has been plotting this campaign since the moment his last one ended in failure. Seven days after he dropped out of the Republican primary race of 2008, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/30/us/politics/setback-leads-mitt-romney-to-reinvention.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0\" title=\"\">Romney gathered his allies around a boardroom table</a>, handing out a single-page memo he'd written about himself, detachedly laying out his own strengths and weaknesses and plotting the path to 2012.</p> <p>Some will say he has been running much longer, the ambition rooted in the crushing of his father's presidential hopes in 1968. Now Mitt Romney will be twice defeated with no chance of coming back. The stellar career in high finance that beckoned four years ago will surely beckon again \u2013 and this time with no nosy reporters demanding to know how much he pays in tax. (<a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/2012/09/21/pf/taxes/romney-tax-return/index.html\" title=\"\">14%</a>, since you ask.)</p> <p>But the consequences of a Romney defeat would go much wider than the job prospects of one supremely wealthy man. The Republican party would have to stare itself long and hard in the face. A loss on Tuesday would mean the party had won the popular vote only once since 1988, when George W Bush beat John Kerry in 2004. In the five other elections, the Democrats would have beaten them. That is a shocking record that lays bare a deep, structural problem.</p> <p>Its base is shrinking before its eyes. The old \"southern strategy\" pioneered with such success by Richard Nixon, in which Republicans commandeered the white vote, often by playing on racial anxieties, worked wonders for decades. But now that white vote accounts for too small a share of the electorate: Romney is on course to win about 60% of it, but it's still not enough. <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/as-republican-convention-emphasizes-diversity-racial-incidents-intrude/2012/08/29/b9023a52-f1ec-11e1-892d-bc92fee603a7_story.html\" title=\"\">As the Republican senator Lindsey Graham so memorably</a> put it: \"The demographics race we're losing badly. We're not generating enough angry white guys to stay in business for the long term.\"</p> <p>The problem is that Republicans have not compensated for that decline in white numbers with gains elsewhere. Steve Schmidt, campaign manager for John McCain in 2008, put it starkly when we met: \"We have been horrific\" towards Hispanic-Americans, he said, adding that the party needed to start speaking to that rising population with \"respect\". George W Bush made an effort in that direction with some results, but any progress has been reversed this time. Obama is expected to win as much as <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/news/politics/la-pn-race-polarized-electorate-20121031,0,2198469.story\" title=\"\">75% of the Hispanic vote</a>.</p> <p>That problem with minorities \u2013 and one poll showed Romney's black support at <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/08/21/mitt-romney-black-vote_n_1820329.html\" title=\"\">a striking 0%</a> \u2013 is both cause and effect of its shrinking base. If only \"angry white guys\", or Tea Partiers and evangelical Christians, are taking part in presidential primaries, that is bound to have a distorting effect. Romney is a case in point. In theory, he could have been a candidate with crossover appeal: a moderate, proven businessman who had won in Democratic Massachusetts. But to win the Republican nomination he had to change, becoming what he called a \"severe conservative\", dropping his previous stances in favour of abortion rights and gun control and, in order not to be outflanked on his right, telling undocumented immigrants, most Hispanic, to \"self-deport\".</p> <p>This is the Republicans' existential problem. They have retreated ever deeper into an ideological laager, shaped by a narrow, nationally unrepresentative Christian right, until they have reached the point where anyone acceptable to them is unacceptable to the rest of the country. Romney was the only plausible candidate on offer from the freakshow they had to choose from \u2013 but competing in the freakshow turned him into someone implausible.</p> <p>If Romney loses on Tuesday, Republicans will have to acknowledge that they threw away an election that, by rights, should have been theirs. They faced an incumbent with low approval ratings and weighed down by an unemployment rate hovering around 8%: no US president since Franklin Roosevelt had been re-elected with such a high jobless number. This was their election to lose. If they lose it, they will need to contemplate the most profound change.</p> <p>And what if the polls in the critical swing states don't hold up and Obama loses? The brutal truth is that neither American politics nor history looks kindly on one-term presidents. They&#xa0;are instantly deemed failures. Jimmy Carter had to undertake a 30-year penance of good works in order to rehabilitate his reputation and absolve the grave sin of losing. Many Democrats would be similarly embarrassed by a defeated Obama, unsentimentally branding him a non-person. Many will say the party made a grave mistake and that it should have gone for Hillary in 2008, a view that will be nourished by this week's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/nov/02/hillary-clinton-mitt-romney-poll\" title=\"\">YouGov poll finding that Clinton would have beaten Romney</a> by a comfortable six points.</p> <p>The last four years will be regarded as an aberration, <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/charles-krauthammer-the-choice/2012/11/01/59b5bed0-2445-11e2-9313-3c7f59038d93_story.html\" title=\"\">\"a historical parenthesis, a passing interlude of overreaching hyper-liberalism, rejected by a center-right country that is 80% nonliberal,\"</a> according to the ultra-conservative commentator, Charles Krauthammer. Everything Obama did \u2013 his Keynesian stimulus, his bailout of the car industry, his reform of healthcare \u2013 will be condemned as a mistake, including by many Democrats who will succumb to the right's critique and fault Obama for veering too far left. Only the killing of Osama bin Laden will earn him any credit.</p> <p>Worse, and this will rarely be articulated out loud, too many Americans will see the first black presidency as a kind of failed experiment: we tried it, but it didn't work out. In a silent way, the bar for non-white candidates, already so high, will be even higher.</p> <p>The world outside America is backing Obama, the polls show it, but without the fervour of four years ago. Some on the left see little difference between him and Romney, on, say, drones, civil liberties or the Middle East; the odd nuance, perhaps, but otherwise they are&#xa0;Tweedledum and Tweedledee.</p> <p>Big mistake. Some of us heard the same refrain in 2000: no difference between Gore and Bush, who cares who wins? And we all know how that worked out.</p> <p><em>Twitter: </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/j_freedland\" title=\"\"><em>@j_freedland</em></a></p>",
  "<p>\u2022\u2009One curious sideshow of this campaign has been the war waged by certain pundits \u2013 whose job is to predict the election based on gut feelings \u2013 against those who prefer to use maths. In the gut instinct world of cable news, the race is neck-and-neck \u2013 a state of affairs that, coincidentally enough, fuels a demand for further gut-based punditry. For statisticians such as the <a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com/\" title=\"\">New York Times' Nate Silver, </a>meanwhile, the steadiness of Barack Obama's slight lead in crucial states makes a Romney victory, though far from impossible, fairly unlikely. What explains this disagreement? Pundit after right-wing pundit insists it must be Silver et al's dodgy numbers. (\"It's hard to blame conservatives for wondering if he might be working the refs,\" muttered <a href=\"[http://dailycaller.com/2012/10/19/nate-silver-vs-the-world/\" title=\"\">the Daily Caller's Matt Lewis</a>, seemingly unaware that Silver just plugs publicly available polling numbers, day after day, into the same unchanging computer model.) Now, in these last days of the race, other \"better than maths\" theories are emerging. Do you realise, asks the influential conservative site Breitbart.com, that Republicans <a href=\"http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2012/10/30/The-Streak-Republicans-Have-Won-Every-November-6th-Presidential-Election-Since-1860\" title=\"\">have won every election held on November 6 since 1860</a>? (That's true enough, but you can find patterns to prove anything: the mens' grooming website Grooming Lounge has shown that <a href=\"http://www.groomingguys.com/grooming-tips/the-presidential-eyebrow-index-super-graphic/\" title=\"\">the candidate with the better-kempt eyebrows usually triumphs</a>, which favours Obama.) But there's encouragement for Romney from New Jersey, where <a href=\"http://www.mnn.com/earth-matters/politics/stories/animals-predict-a-win-for-romney\" title=\"\">a cockroach named Mitt beat a cockroach named Obama</a> in the New Jersey Pest Management Association's traditional election-season Running of the Roaches. The NJPMA boasts an 84% success rate \u2013 so what do you make of <em>that</em>, fancy \"statistician\" types? The cockroach named Nate Silver, one assumes, just sat in the corner, weeping quietly for his country.</p> <p>\u2022\u2009<a href=\"http://news.yahoo.com/errant-gingrich-email-obama-going-win-174518235.html\" title=\"\">An email arrives</a> from zoo-loving space-colony enthusiast Newt Gingrich \u2013 or, to be precise, from an advertiser who has apparently paid real American dollars for access to his mailing list, Gingrich Marketplace. \"The truth is, the next election has already been decided. Obama is going to win,\" it begins. That's quite a concession from the camp of a prominent Republican. What's the argument? \"It's nearly impossible to beat an incumbent president.\" Well, no, but do go on: \"What's actually at stake right now is whether or not he will have a third term.\" Woah, what? That's right: according to <a href=\"http://pro.stansberryresearch.com/1210THIRDLIA/LPSINA33/\" title=\"\">an astonishingly long-winded audio presentation</a> linked from the email \u2013 which robbed your diarist, a human with a finite lifespan, of a quarter-hour he'll never get back \u2013 \"an enormous economic force\" will turn Obama into an idol, permitting him to rewrite the Constitution. A disclaimer explains that these wacky views aren't necessarily Newt's own, and to be fair, he's probably far too busy finalising blueprints for his nuclear-powered moon zoo to pay attention to what goes out under his name. Don't mock: once Obama installs himself as world dictator, you'll be grateful for Gingrich's outpost in space. Especially if you like zoos.</p> <p>\u2022\u2009There's bad news for a mainstay of campaign journalism in <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/blogs/ombudsman/2012/11/01/164107070/election-coverage-2-to-kill-the-man-on-the-street\" title=\"\">the findings of an audience research project</a> conducted by National Public Radio. Listeners generally admire NPR's coverage, it finds, but they can't abide those man- or woman-in-the-street interviews with voters. It's traditional to supplement discussion of candidates and policies with \"vox pops\", but as one respondent put it: \"I really don't care what some random dude in Florida thinks.\" \"Nothing is more frustrating for me,\" adds another, \"than hearing/reading/seeing know-nothing voters expose their utter ignorance.\" NPR's ombudsman says he partly concurs. But not everyone does. \"I quite like quotes from random people that add nothing substantive,\" said Betty Adams, a 32-year-old from Adelphi, Ohio, who works at a factory making teleportation devices. \"Also, it offers an easy way for journalists to conclude their articles.\"</p>",
  "<p>What is it like for Americans to watch the US election from Britain? Two US citizens, comedian Rich Fulcher and literature professor Sarah Churchwell, discuss media coverage, distance \u2013 and&#xa0;how to explain to Brits why the Republicans are a serious threat. Emine&#xa0;Saner listens in.</p> <p><strong>Rich Fulcher: </strong>Over here, I still see how pro-Obama everyone is. Some seem incredulous that it's even a close race.</p> <p><strong>Sarah Churchwell: </strong>There's a presumption that Americans are uninformed yahoos. The suspicion is that if they don't like Obama, it's because they're yahoos, not because they have arrived at&#xa0;that decision for rational reasons.</p> <p><strong>RF:</strong> Or they're from the south, or carry&#xa0;guns.</p> <p><strong>SC:</strong> Or they're evangelicals. Also, there doesn't seem to be any notion that you can object to Obama from the left \u2013 he's extended Bush's foreign policy, not shut Guant\u00e1namo, abrogated civil liberties \u2013 there are many ways one could object to him, and it doesn't make one Sarah Palin.</p> <p><strong>RF:</strong> Ultimately it boils down to whether you want Romney or Obama, despite Guant\u00e1namo. It's the lesser of two evils. Also, people here don't understand the electoral college. But who does? People here think swing states are where they have those parties with the car keys.</p> <p><strong>SC:</strong> There is this idea that the electoral divide is coastal, and it's east and west coast versus the heartland, and it's not. I&#xa0;think it's rural versus urban, and that's what people outside America don't understand. Obama's decision to bail out the auto industry has affected the midwest and bought him a lot of votes that were otherwise going to be dubious.</p> <p><strong>RF:</strong> And now Romney is claiming he has the same plan. He's like a little kid: \"No,&#xa0;that was my plan too!\"</p> <p><strong>SC:</strong> I'm pretty sure he wrote an editorial that said to let them go bankrupt, that this is the moral hazard of capitalism.</p> <p><strong>Emine Saner: </strong>Do you think Europeans are bewildered by the popularity of the Republican party? I couldn't imagine them existing here in any serious way.</p> <p><strong>RF:</strong> David Cameron couldn't exist in the Republican party, he's much too liberal.</p> <p><strong>SC:</strong> Nobody really knows what Romney thinks, but his record in Massachusetts is pretty moderate. He takes a lot of credit he doesn't deserve by saying he worked across the aisle with Democrats \u2013 but that's because 87% of his senate was Democrat, so he didn't really have a choice. It's hard to say what he would do if he were operating in a vacuum. The way the Republican party is currently working is by mobilising their base, which seems to me to be bonkers, because the birthers are never going to&#xa0;vote for Obama. Romney does not have to pander to them, he has to win the centre. I think it's a little unfair of Europeans who say it wouldn't happen here or in Europe \u2013 Le Pen exists in France, the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2012/oct/26/golden-dawn-greece-police-video\" title=\"\">Golden Dawn</a> exists in Greece. In America, they have a slightly different face, but the story is the same: anti-immigrant, ideologically extreme, religiously or politically.</p> <p><strong>RF:</strong> In the Republican primaries you ask the question, \"How many of you believe in Darwinism?\" and nobody raises their hands. Romney may be moderate but he's carrying with him a bandwagon of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/may/30/donald-trump-birther-mitt-romney\" title=\"\">birthers</a> and extremists. Look at the way he stood up for [Republican Richard] Mourdock, who said it was God's will if you have a baby after being raped.</p> <p><strong>SC:</strong> So many people do not love Obama any more. Republican strategists seem not to understand that to swing that far right they're alienating people who would be willing to vote against Obama. People say to me here: \"It seems clear from Obama's many failures that one person's power to change the country is limited, so how much does it matter?\" It&#xa0;matters a lot, not least because of the supreme court, which is going to have between one and four vacancies in the&#xa0;next election cycle, and certainly within the next eight years. Some of the decisions they have made have not just been unconscionable to liberals, but have been historically unprecedented \u2013 absolutely out of the bounds of what the&#xa0;constitution gave them the powers to do. The consequences of having Romney in power, who will need to appease his Republican base by appointing a conservative court, is terrifying, because that's not just eight years, that's a generation.</p> <p><strong>RF:</strong> It's a great job, by the way. You get to sit down all the time.</p> <p><strong>SC:</strong> Really cool robes. To go back to the point about how the British view it, I&#xa0;have had more than one person say to me that it's entertainment, or theatre, which you feel sort of immune to.</p> <p><strong>RF:</strong> We look at politics now like sports \u2013 it's like, \"This guy got benched.\"</p> <p><strong>SC:</strong> I love entertainment, but the difference between something that has real consequences and something that doesn't is genuine. There are polls showing we haven't been as polarised as this since the civil war, and you know who I blame? Rupert Murdoch. In 1987, Reagan abolished the Fairness Doctrine, and in 1988 Murdoch started Fox News, and it was made legal because they no longer had to have balanced viewpoints. In the UK, that rule you still have here about balance. Some people might think is a bit tedious, I would say: \"Get rid of it and then you get Fox News.\"</p> <p><strong>RF:</strong> My parents are sucked into the Fox News bubble and they will never leave it. They're trying to get out, and I try to open the door for them, but it doesn't work. It's a right-wing prism. In the second presidential debate, Obama did very well \u2013 but not to them.</p> <p><strong>SC:</strong> What's hard to explain is why it feels&#xa0;like a civil war sometimes. I cannot talk about politics with one of my best friends because she is that kind of kneejerk Republican, and she thinks I'm&#xa0;a kneejerk liberal. I keep saying I&#xa0;would vote Republican if there were a Republican who was going to be good for the country, be moderate, protect reproductive rights. I'm socially liberal, but fiscally conservative, and that's not an unusual thing to find in America.</p> <p><strong>ES:</strong> Does the US election make you homesick?</p> <p><strong>SC:</strong> Homesickness comes up with Halloween and Christmas. I don't want to watch [the election] there; I think I&#xa0;would be more disheartened than I am.</p> <p><strong>ES:</strong> You've both lived here for several years. Do you feel people have been warmer to you as Americans during Obama's presidency? Can you imagine that changing?</p> <p><strong>SC:</strong> I've certainly encountered a lot less anti-Americanism than when Bush was in power. Not long after they invaded Iraq, I was in a bar with a friend and some&#xa0;guy kept pushing into us. I&#xa0;turned and politely asked him to give us some space and he said: \"Why don't you fuck off back to America?\"</p> <p><strong>RF:</strong> When Bush was president, I was \"Canadian\". It solved a lot of problems. If Romney wins I'm going to have to be Antarctican.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.sohotheatre.com/whats-on/rich-fulchers-special-u-s-election-show/\" title=\"\"><em>Rich Fulcher's Special US Election Show</em></a><em> featuring Scott Capurro and Hadley Freeman is at Soho theatre, London W1, on 5 November at 7.30pm. </em></p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 4 November 2012 to correct the spelling of Sarah Churchwell's name in the picture caption.

  "<p>In <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/nov/02/112263-stephen-king-review\" title=\"\">Stephen King's remarkable time-travel novel 11.22.63</a>, the central character, Jake, journeys back from the America of 2011 to the America of the early 1960s. While he is there, a woman challenges him to tell her one good thing about the future. \"I'll give you two for the price of one,\" Jake eventually replies. \"The cold war is over and the president is a black man.\" The woman's jaw drops. \"You're serious?\" she stammers in disbelief. \"Yes, I am,\" Jake replies. The woman ponders this almost inconceivable news from the future. Finally she asks, very haltingly: \"Is he \u2026 doing a good job?\" Jake explains that opinions of the president vary but, \"If you want mine, he's doing as well as anyone could expect, given the complexities.\"</p> <p>Mr King has surely got <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/barack-obama\" title=\"\">Barack Obama's</a> first term about right. The record is certainly not perfect, but he has done about as well as anyone could reasonably expect, given that the economy has been in decline, the banks in crisis, America at war and the Republican party out to destroy him. Leading America through and out of such crises would be a formidable set of challenges at the best of times, but they have been made infinitely more difficult by the Republicans' single-minded commitment to eviscerating the Obama presidency. At a time when the economic role of government has been more important than at any time in a generation, the Republicans have been set on blocking, subverting and dismantling just about every programme that Mr Obama has promoted. In many cases they have succeeded. It is to Mr Obama's credit that he has achieved what he has \u2013 most notably the historic reform of healthcare and the economic stimulus package of 2009, their genuine imperfections rightly overshadowed by the substance of what they contained in spite of congressional resistance. And since the Republican recapture of Congress in 2010, US politics has been dominated by people who do not just despise Mr Obama, but by people who also despise government itself.</p> <p>The election of 2012 was never going to be a repeat of the election of 2008. Four years ago, Americans had the opportunity to repudiate the Bush years \u2013 so uniquely calamitous both at home and abroad \u2013 and to make a historic choice by electing Mr Obama. Even four years ago, never mind when seen from the <a href=\"http://www.pbs.org/wnet/jimcrow/\" title=\"\">Jim Crow</a> era, the 2008 contest was a jaw-dropping, almost redemptive, American moment. Expectations were incredibly high. Even in the best of times, it would have been hard to fulfil them. Mr Obama has fallen short of some important goals. Guant\u00e1namo Bay remains open. The Middle East peace process has got nowhere. Progress on climate change, though not negligible, has been slow. The Iraq war is over and torture has been ended, but the conflict in Afghanistan continues, waged increasingly through drone attacks that solve neither military nor political problems.</p> <p>Four years later, the 2012 contest may lack the glamour of 2008. But it is in every way at least as important. Partly, that is because of what a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/mittromney\" title=\"\">Mitt Romney</a> victory on Tuesday might mean \u2013 the destruction of welfare safety nets, a free pass for the tax-avoiding rich, indifference to the environment, the dismantling of healthcare, reactionary moves on women's and gay rights, and the chance to stuff the supreme court even more solidly with justices of the anti-government right. More than that, however, it is because the re-election of Mr Obama would be an act of collective national seriousness by Americans who believe in good government not no government and who possess a concern for community that goes beyond material self-interest. This is America's election, not ours, and some Americans think the rest of us have no right to an opinion. But <a href=\"http://yougov.co.uk/news/2012/10/31/euro-opinion-us-election/\" title=\"\">our part of the world is clear that it prefers Mr Obama</a> to have four more years in the White House and on Tuesday we hope that Americans will use their votes to ensure that he does.</p>",

This is his last election, he's really energised.\"</p> <p>And so he was. I haven't heard Obama as fired up at a rally like this one since 2008. In the events I've seen him at this year he's always been 10% reserved, 20% professorial. A pale reflection of the \"hope and change\" merchant of four years ago. But this time he was back to the firebrand of 08, his speech belching out of him like it came from the gut.</p> <p>I know it's become unfashionable to talk about Obama the orator \u2013 he over did it with the promises and the rhetoric four years ago and to no small extent he's been paying the price ever since. But when he turns it on, it still sends electricity through the crowd, and it did here.</p> <p>The anger towards Romney was palpable. \"The folks at the top in this country don't need another champion in Washington. They already have a seat at the table,\" he said. Romney didn't represent change, or the future. \"To make sure no matter who you are or where you come from you can make it in America, that's the future.\"</p> <p>It is stating the obvious that Obama's supporters in the crowd loved him. But actually, at this late stage in the election, that is of huge importance. His mission here was to fire up the base so that they get out this weekend knocking on doors and getting out the vote. With poll margins razor-thin in Ohio, the candidate that has the edge in inspiring his faithful followers over the next four days in this crucial battleground state is likely to be the next occupant of the White House.</p> <p>So it matters that Pam Bishop, 60, looked at the end of Obama's speech as though she'd just seen an angel, and vowed to work hard from now to the end of election day. \"I think he is amazing. I think he gets what the country needs and he's willing to work for every single one of us.\"</p> <p>And it particularly mattered that Rick McCurdy, 59, said he found the speech \"very motivating\". McCurdy is one of the one in eight Ohioans who work in the auto industry, in his case for Honda US, and he says without the auto bailout he might have lost his job. \"I'm not ready to go backwards,\" he said, echoing one of Obama's mantras. \"I want to see him moving forwards with the recovery.\"</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-11-02T17:04:45.923Z\">at 5.04pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5093e897b579f74bac764970\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-11-02T15:36:55.379Z\">3.36pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Mitt Romney</strong> appears to be doing his greatest hits here in West Allis, but the latest jobs figures don't get much attention from Romney:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Unemployment is higher today than the day Barack Obama took office.</p> </blockquote> <p>Yes, that is technically true, given that the January 2009 jobs report had 7.8% unemployment, and Obama was inaugurated on 20 January.</p> <p>And here we go with the five-point plan to create jobs.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-11-02T15:42:59.996Z\">at 3.42pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5093e753b579f74bac76496f\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-11-02T15:31:31.175Z\">3.31pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">MItt Romney speaks in Wisconsin</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Now <strong>Mitt Romney</strong> takes the stage in <strong>Wisconsin</strong>, and he also starts off by mentioning the impact of Sandy.

One of Romney\u2019s senior strategist set out the basics of the campaign, some of which turned out as planned, such as a strong debate performance.</p> <p>Crucial to the strategy were the unemployment figures in September, coming at the end of the Democratic convention, and again in October. But these figures today were to have been the killer, with just four full days of campaigning left.</p> <p>It has not worked out like that, mainly because the figures have gone down, dropping below the symbolically-important 8%. It is not just that the figures have gone down but that voters have not attached as much importance to them as the Romney campaign had hoped. Americans have been living with unemployment for four years: it is a fact of life, and the monthly unemployment figures have been largely discounted.</p> <p>These figures are good for the Obama campaign, the 171,000 new jobs higher than expected. The Obama campaign can claim that the trend is going in the right direction.</p> <p>The Romney campaign is almost certain to say that the unemployment rate is still too high, that the rate is not coming down fast enough, that all that stimulus money has failed to make an impact. But these figures are not the game-changer the Romney campaign had predicted two months ago.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5093c3cfb579f74bac764956\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-11-02T13:00:00.104Z\">1.00pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>On the point about the <strong>unemployment rate</strong> at the start and end of Barack Obama's first presidential term:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/damianpaletta/status/264349507238633472\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Obama trying to join Reagan and GW Bush; won reelection with unemployment higher than day took office.

Similarly, a total below that will suggest the opposite, especially if the new jobs total dips below 100,000.</p> <h2><strong>2. Will the unemployment rate stay at 7.8%?</strong></h2> <p>Even a slight uptick in the headline rate of unemployment will become ammunition for the Romney campaign \u2013 all the more if the rate goes to 8% or above.</p> <h2><strong>3. Will revisions to previous months add or subtract?</strong></h2> <p>September's positive jobs report may be subject to heavy revision, possibly raising the unemployment rate in retrospect. Look out for revisions to previous months.</p> <h2><strong>4. What about the numbers below the headline figures?</strong></h2> <p>After the job creation total and unemployment rate, the report includes a wealth of other data. The key statistics include hours worked and hourly pay: strong increases in both are signs of an improving labour market, and a better guide to how those in work are faring.</p> <h2><strong>5. What will be the impact from Hurricane Sandy?</strong></h2> <p>The storm's devastation may have come too late in the month to have much impact on October's jobs numbers. But its influence, if any, is likely to be negative, as well as a possible source of confusion.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-957d65a3-fac3-4146-b624-6d4496d331fd\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/online/2012/10/31/1351690402591/Downed-power-lines-after--007.jpg\" alt=\"Downed power lines after superstorm Sandy at Seaside Heights island\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Downed power lines at Seaside Heights, New Jersey.

But for Obama and his supporters, the real question is how October's figures stack up alongside the rosy economic data received recently, and whether September's decline in the headline rate of unemployment \u2014 to 7.8% from 8.1% \u2014 was merely a blip or part of an improving trend.</p> <p>Mitt Romney, meanwhile, has put jobs at the centre of his pitch for the White House, regularly boasting that he \"knows how to create jobs\" while citing the 23m Americans estimated to be out of work. A lacklustre report could reignite his campaign in the final four full days of campaigning before polls open on 6 November.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-11-02T14:14:44.913Z\">at 2.14pm GMT</time></p>  </div>",
  "<p>The people who are gaming out what New Jersey Governor Chris Christie's praise of Obama means for 2016 are the ones with all the power. And I mean this literally: they have power, because no one camping out with candles and kerosene heaters is thinking about 2016. If you're thinking about 2016, you also have time on your hands from giving up on the poll-average pundit Pictionary in favor of cost-free speculation about the inner life of a man who seems pretty willing to let it all hang out.</p> <p>Take off the binoculars, and pick up a Twitter stream or a Facebook feed \u2013 the ones where people are asking for, and sometimes offering, gas, food or electricity. (One of the most moving pictures of the past day was of someone hanging an extension cord off their fence with the invitation to \"charge your phones!\" That says a lot about the reality of social networks as lifelines; it also suggests we'll need a new hobo chalk sign vocabulary for the post-post-infrastructure age.)</p> <p>Go without power for a while and see if five days doesn't seem like forever \u2013 four years from now is a pleasant daydream. If Christie <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/video/watch/?id=50134316n\">really was riding alongside Obama in Marine One</a> looking at the hurricane's devastation thinking to himself, \"This will make a great ad,\" he's a moral monster. And if he wasn't thinking mostly about getting some sleep, then he's a better person than I am. Rush Limbaugh probably didn't mean it as a compliment when he said Christie was playing the role of a \"<a href=\"http://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2012/10/31/chris_christie_plays_role_of_greek_column_for_the_obama_reelection_campaign\">Greek column</a>\" during Obama's visit, though it would be a nice gloss over the governor's silhouette. More to the point, it's the president who's offering support to Christie.</p> <p>The chin-scratchers in their warm and dry perches are, apparently, too far away to see that the Christie-Obama \"bromance\", while certainly transactional, wasn't a feel-good exchange of airy endorsements. Christie didn't laud anything as ineffable as leadership or hopefulness, he pointed to specific actions: the calls Obama made, the pledges of quantifiable support. In an election year, we tend to forget that campaigning isn't the point; it's what comes after. And Christie <a href=\"http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Elections/President/2012/1031/As-Obama-Christie-survey-storm-damage-politics-is-unavoidable-video\">boiled it down</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"We're doing the jobs that people elected us to do.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>It's not cynical to point out that such praise can co-exist with genuine ideological differences. You can be grateful for Fema aid while still believing in a more decentralized federal government. I mean, your argument is going to have to be a lot more <em>detailed</em> \u2013 and you'd be wise <em>not</em> to call for <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2012/10/30/romney_right_on_the_button_to_dismantle_fema_says_gop_strategist/\">the dismantling of, say, Fema</a> \u2013 but accepting government assistance never means you have to approve of everything the government does. Thank God. Christie doesn't have to turn in his Republican badge, and he can run against Obama without being a hypocrite.</p> <p>Christie's pointed plaudits to the president <em>do</em> undermine the kind of cheap plays on stereotypes that made up pretty much all the non-Christie portions of his Republican convention keynote address. As Jon Stewart pointed out, a recent Christie speech accused the president of <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/11/01/jon-stewart-applauds-hurricane-sandy-response_n_2057024.html\">fumbling</a> for the \"light-switch of leadership\"; post-Sandy, as Stewart quipped:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"Yeah, I guess he found that fucking light switch, huh?\"</p> </blockquote> <p>A better metaphor might be to point out that, with the power out, all cats look alike in the dark. Christie is a decent governor and a real person, and I think his appearing with Obama \u2013 and his pleading for help \u2013 was the shortest of short-term thinking for him, shouting \"fire\" in a theater that was, in fact, on fire.</p> <p>How will Christie's pragmatism itself play politically? The questions cascade. If he's not thinking about running for president, fine \u2013 but what about the people who are thinking about him thinking of running for president? Can someone so willing to put aside politics in favor of personal action (rather than personal gain) attract the support of the GOP's fevered base? Could a Christie nomination pull the GOP to the middle?</p> <p>The thing about the Republican party of recent years is that it seems to do the pulling. Sure, Christie was a heavily-courted possible contender, even as Romney was in the middle of molting his moderate feathers. But was that evidence of GOP thought-leaders being willing to compromise on their own dearly-held, unpopular positions on such as climate change, or was it a sign of their confidence in a presidential nominee as a placeholder? Christie is an attractive candidate no matter what shade the rest of the party is, but who would change their colors more?</p> <p>Christie's weight has been the much-mocked obstacle to his rise in national politics, but would the Republican party require him to shed beliefs, as well as some pounds? When Romney decided to mold himself into whatever he needed to be to gain the party's nomination, it was relatively easy: there was no original form to change. For Christie to undergo such a transformation, in whatever way, though, he'd only become half the man he used to be.</p>",
  "<p>The memory of Bush versus Gore will be hanging over next Tuesday's election like a black cloud. Could it be possible that, as in 2000, we wake up on Wednesday morning with the next occupant of the White House still undecided?</p> <p>Quite possible, says Professor Edward Foley, an expert in election law at Ohio State University. He estimates, based on his knowledge of the legal landscape and his reading of the polls, that there could be up to a 1% chance of the outcome of the election still being in the balance beyond next Tuesday.</p> <p>He goes further. He says that the US should embrace the possibility of a delayed result as a necessary and healthy part of the electoral process in the advent of a very close race. \"Just because we are forced into overtime on 7 November doesn't automatically mean we are in crisis,\" he says. \"Such uncertainty is not a reason for panic.\"</p> <p>Here are some possible doomsday scenarios that could leave us still guessing next Wednesday morning:</p> <h2>Storm Sandy</h2> <p>As the fallout of the storm continues to play out across several north-eastern states, the question arises could major disruption to voting centres cause a delay. It's possible, though highly unlikely, that Congress could pass legislation postponing the election. Federal officials have indicated that individual states should decide. Those most affected by the storm, notably New Jersey and New York, are so firmly Democratic that there is no doubt about their outcome. Virginia is the only battleground that has been heavily affected, yet latest estimates suggest power should be restored in most areas of the state by Friday.</p> <h2>Too close to call</h2> <p>It's possible that a state whose crop of electoral votes could determine the identity of the next president \u2013 Florida with 29 votes, perhaps, or Ohio with 18 \u2013 could be so close that either candidate refuses to concede and demands a recount. Florida's recount debacle in 2000 famously went all the way to the US supreme court and was finally awarded to George Bush by just 537 votes. It's also possible that several states are too close to call, leading to a multiple agony of indecision. That happened in 1916, with America's position in the first world war hanging on the election, when so many states were exceptionally close that Woodrow Wilson's victory over Charles Hughes was delayed for many days. In 1876, four states were in dispute, pushing back the victory of Rutherford Hayes for months to the eve of his March inauguration.</p> <p>If a recount happened in Ohio next week it could delay the final result of the presidential race until 11 December.</p> <h2>Provisional ballots</h2> <p>In an attempt to avoid the 2000 snarl-up repeating itself, Congress passed the 2002 Help America Vote Act to try and modernise the system. That has increased the role of provisional ballots, which are cast by voters where there is a question mark over their eligibility and are counted after election day. Several swing states \u2013 for instance Colorado, Florida, Nevada and Virginia \u2013 have had substantial numbers of provisional ballots in recent elections. The phenomenon is particularly acute in the key battleground state of Ohio where more than 200,000 provisional ballots were cast in 2008. Were sufficient provisional ballots cast this year in Ohio to put a close result in jeopardy, then the outcome in Ohio and thus potentially in the entire presidential race <a href=\"http://moritzlaw.osu.edu/electionlaw/freefair/index.php?ID=9905\">could be delayed until 17 November</a>.</p> <h2>Absentee and military ballots</h2> <p>It is conceivable that a dispute could erupt over absentee or military ballots in a very close race. Consider what happened in Minnesota in 2008, where Al Franken's eventually successful challenge to the incumbent senator Norm Coleman was delayed by more than seven months by wrangling over absentee ballots.</p> <p>Colorado, Florida and Virginia all have large military bases and are therefore likely to have a substantial number of military ballots which could be important in a razor-close vote.</p> <h2>A 269-269 tie</h2> <p>It takes 270 electoral votes <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2012/sep/28/us-electoral-college-explained\">to earn the keys to the White House</a>. It is theoretically possible that there could be a tie between Obama and Romney of 269 votes to 269. In that event, the House of Representatives would choose the president in a ballot to be held in January in which each state delegation in the House would have one vote. The vice-president would be chosen by the Senate. <a href=\"http://articles.latimes.com/2012/oct/28/opinion/la-oe-klotsche-electoral-college-apocalypse-20121028\">Pundits have had a lot of fun</a> envisaging the remote prospect that Mitt Romney is elected Republican president with Joe Biden as his Democratic vice-president.</p>",
  "<p>If the political postings you've seen lately on Facebook and Twitter seem particularly outrageous, it's because they are.<br> From the beginning of the political conventions to the eve of the final debate, social media and blog postings about US presidential candidates Barack Obama and Mitt Romney have been relentlessly negative, <a href=\"http://www.journalism.org/analysis_report/winning_media_campaign_2012\">according to a new Pew study.</a><br> \"We found social media very harsh,\" Tom Rosenstiel, director of Pew's Project for Excellence in Journalism, told the Guardian. \"We also found it fairly insensitive to events. It moved some but was pretty relentlessly negative about both candidates, particularly Romney.\"</p> <p>There is no doubt mainstream media coverage influences what is being said on social media, especially on Facebook, where users tend to be more politically engaged and often more partisan. In the Pew analysis, two outlets in particular were clearly slanted in opposite directions: for every 23 stories published by MSNBC about Romney, only one is positive. At Fox News, only about one in every eight stories published about Obama is positive.<br> With coverage of this campaign markedly more negative than 2008, it's leaking over into what we're sharing. By all accounts we're going stir crazy: everything's offensive, outrageous, or both at once. And, sometimes, the constant pot-stirring results in the breakdown of friendships between people of differing political stripes. The tension is especially palpable on Facebook. Pew's team found that conversation about both candidates hit overdrive on the social network after the 3 October presidential debate, an event considered a solid victory for Romney. Since that evening, the conversation has gotten decidedly less civil, perhaps because social media conversation is <a href=\"http://www.ritholtz.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/enhanced-buzz-wide-31489-1341954714-11.jpg\">already more partisan</a> than what is found in public opinion or in mainstream media, according to Rosenstiel.<br> When this writer posed a question about political clashes on Facebook, Chicago attorney Walker Lawrence said Thursday he'd been \"unfriended\" for \"my support for Obama \u2026 happened this year and in 2008.\" As for Twitter, a comparatively smaller, more self-selecting network, negative statements about Obama outweighed positive by less than 2-to-1. For Romney it was close to 4-to-1. \"It is a great way to learn about events,\" Rosenstiel added, \"but it is not, certainly at this point in history, a proxy of the electorate.\" Patience is boiling over on both networks as Americans near the end of a marathon election cycle. Earlier this year, Pew's Internet and American Life project found that 18% of users have unfriended or blocked someone online due to political issues. With only a few days to go until the election, don't be surprised if the number rises \u2013 if only just until sometime in mid-November. But even as tempers flare this week and next, an increasingly rare story sparked by social media is bringing people together instead of tearing them apart. After many months without anything like it, a viral video of Fort Collins toddler Abigael Evans emerged on YouTube this week.  \"I'm tired of Bronco Bamma and Mitt Romney,\" the red-eyed four-year-old blubbered into an NPR reporter's camera, and charmed <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjrthOPLAKM\">millions of jaded YouTube </a>viewers as she was literally bored to tears.<br> Thousands of exhausted people smiled knowingly and hit the share button.</p>",

Fighters from the Salafi Dawood brigade overran the camp and captured the soldiers. Initially there were only ten of them so they could not take the soldiers captive, and had to kill them immediately. No trial could be held because the fighting was still going on. This is guerrilla warfare.</p> <p>The soldiers there included snipers who had shot four fighters from the Dawood brigade. </p> <p>The Dawood brigade and the Suqur Al-Sham organisation do not answer to any military council affiliated to the FSA. They work independently and have their own leader whom they call Ameer and his name is Abu Issa.</p> <p>Yesterday we had a demonstration in Jebal al-Zawiyia and we raised banners in response to Hillary Clinton's statement that Assad's end is imminent. We said: \"al-Qaida arrival\u2019s in Syria is imminent too.\"</p> <p>We do not wish to turn Syria into another Afghanistan, but we can't stop these extremists groups. We are really worried about the future of Syria. We need weapons and media support, but there is nothing on the ground.</p> <p>We have four Salafi groups who are fighting in Idlib province. The biggest group is Jabhat al-Nusra which has members all over Syria. There is also the Ansar al-Islam group, the Majless al-Shura group and Suqur al-Sham group.</p> <p>These Salafi groups are gaining support in Idlib province as they are well equipped unlike the FSA brigades. People also admire their bravery.</p> <p>They are tough fighters and when they get hold of soldiers, they kill them at once.</p> <p>They are getting more powerful and in in the future could start forcing people to follow sharia law.

  "<p>Saudi Arabia is funding a $100m mosque and Islamic education centre in Kabul that will teach thousands of students a year and help bolster Saudi influence in Afghanistan as the west withdraws.</p> <p>Work on the sprawling 30-hectare (75-acre) hilltop complex is due to be completed by early 2016, when Afghan security forces will likely be trying to hold off the Taliban with little Nato support.</p> <p>\"This Islamic centre has several aims, one is to ensure good relations between Afghanistan and Saudi Arabia,\" said the acting Saudi minister of hajj and Islamic affairs, Dr Dayi al-Haq Abed.</p> <p>Afghanistan's neighbours and allies have been jostling for power in the country for years; spending millions of dollars on aid, education, TV and radio channels.</p> <p>Efforts to secure a stake in Afghanistan's future are intensifying with the 2014 Nato withdrawal deadline looming, and a presidential election to chose the first new leader in more than a decade set for April that year.</p> <p>But Abed said the centre was a decade-old project conceived by Saudi Arabia's late King Fahd, not a hasty effort to bolster the Gulf state's role in Afghan affairs.</p> <p>\"It's not a political centre, its an independent centre,\" he told the Guardian. \"This centre will never try to work against the interests of Afghanistan or Saudi Arabia. It is firstly a place for prayer and secondly for education.\"</p> <p>A university with a library, lecture halls, gym and dormitories for 5,000 students will sit on a hill overlooking Kabul, next to the tomb of the last Afghan king, Mohammed Zahir Shah. The nearby mosque will hold up to 15,000 worshippers, making it one of the largest in the country.</p> <p>Saudi Arabia has been one of the key players in the turbulent decades since the Soviet invasion at the end of 1979, influencing both religion and politics in Afghanistan.</p> <p>The Saudis were a major funder of mujahideen in Afghanistan, sending millions of dollars to Pakistan-based groups to pay for weapons and other supplies. When civil war broke out it helped sponsor a peace deal, even bringing top Afghan commanders to Mecca to swear they would respect the agreement \u2013 although it fell apart almost immediately.</p> <p>After the rise of the Taliban, Saudi Arabia was one of only three countries to recognise the hardline regime, but since its fall in 2001 it has remained a generous donor to the western-backed government of Hamid Karzai. More recently it helped lay the groundwork for efforts to negotiate an end to the war. Saudi diplomats have kept a lower profile than others though.</p> <p>The new centre will likely have a large pool of applicants. Religious schools mostly funded by private individuals and Saudi institutions have spread the kingdom's strict Wahhabi branch of Islam inside Afghanistan and Pakistan \u2013 and all Afghans hope to travel there on the hajj pilgrimage at least once in their lifetime.</p> <p>The Afghan government has donated the land, and basic engineering work is already completed. A joint committee of Saudi diplomats and Afghan officials from the ministry of Islamic affairs will oversee the centre once it is up and running.</p> <p>\"Its a big achievement for the Afghanistan government and the ministry of hajj and Islamic affairs,\" Abed said, adding that he hoped it would pave the way for more Afghan students to further their education in Saudi Arabia.</p> <p><em>Additional reporting by Mokhtar Amiri</em></p>",
  "<p>An army of thousands of lawyers is quietly amassing in the key swing states ahead of next Tuesday's presidential election in preparation for the largest legal ground operation to be fought in any American election.</p> <p>Hundreds of paid lawyers employed by the Obama and Romney campaigns, backed by a reserve force of thousands of volunteer attorneys who are jetting into the battleground states this weekend, will be monitoring polling stations on 6 November. Their job will be to prevent the rival side gaining an unfair advantage, and to be at hand to litigate should the vote be too close to call.</p> <p>\"Thousands and thousands of lawyers will be out on election day ferreting out any problems with voting rights,\" said Joseph Sandler, who led the Democratic party's legal team for 15 years until 2008. The attorneys will be on the look out for irregularities such as malfunctioning polling equipment, election officials failing to follow rules, or irregular opening hours at the polling stations, he said.</p> <p>The presidential election of 2012 will herald the largest and most intricate legal ground game yet seen. \"Very sophisticated operations have been put together in the swing states by both main parties, and my sense is that if they do go into battle they will be evenly matched,\" said Professor Edward Foley, who runs an election law centre at Ohio State University.</p> <p>Over the past decade, the legal aspect of presidential elections has moved from a sideshow to being central to the campaigning process. The impetus for the shift was the 2000 election and the notorious legal fight that followed the disputed Florida result.</p> <p>The events of that year, which ended up with the US supreme court blocking a recount and handing George Bush the presidency, caught both Republicans and Democrats off guard. Both sides have vowed never again to be put in that invidious position.</p> <p>Sandler, who was a key adviser to Al Gore in his unsuccessful attempt to force a Florida recount in 2000, has watched the legal operation grow into a veritable army since that highly contentious election. By 2004, paid lawyers were already in place well in advance of election day, and by 2008, Barack Obama had developed a sophisticated network of lawyers that is likely to be the model in future elections.</p> <p>This year that model is being followed again, \"but this time it is much more extensive,\" Sandler said.</p> <p>At its most dramatic, the army of lawyers assembled by both presidential campaigns could be called upon to litigate in the event of a battleground state returning so close a result that one of the candidates refuses to concede and demands a recount. In 2004, lawyers for John Kerry came close to challenging the result in Ohio but backed off after they realised that Bush had accumulated sufficient votes to win the state, and with it the presidency.</p> <p>\"When you have an incredibly close election as next Tuesday looks like it might be, it increases the chances of legal disputes and delays in announcing the winner,\" said Lawrence Norden, a voting rights experts at the Brennan Center for Justice within New York University.</p> <p>On the Democratic side, paid and voluntary lawyers will be keeping a particularly beady eye out for any signs of intimidation or disenfranchisement of voters in the wake of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jul/26/florida-assault-voting-rights\">a slew of attempts by Republican legislatures to restrict voting practices this year</a>. Most of the new voter suppression laws have been stayed by the courts, but Obama's legal army will be watching out for any residual foul play.</p> <p>The lawyers leading the respective armies are two of the biggest shots in election law in the US. The Republican operation is led by Benjamin Ginsberg, who headed Bush's legal team in the 2000 Florida recount dispute.</p> <p>A former newspaper reporter with the Boston Globe, Ginsberg went on to become pre-eminent in election law. After his success in 2000, he commanded the army of attorneys deployed in Bush's in 2004 re-election, and has been at the legal helm of Romney's run on the White House both in 2008 and this year.</p> <p>His counterpart for Obama is Bob Bauer, former White House counsel who returned last year to his private law firm Perkins Coie so he could spearhead the president's re-election bid from outside government. Bauer has been giving Obama legal advice ever since Obama came to Washington as a US senator in 2005.</p> <p>Bauer and Ginsberg are at the top of a pyramid structure that will see lawyers for both presidential candidates in place right across the battleground states come election day. Both teams have been working for months on preparing for whatever eventuality fate throws at them next Tuesday.</p> <p>\"You never know what comes up on election day. If the operation has done its job right, election day will be relatively uneventful as all the heavy lifting is done before then,\" said Sandler.</p> <p>As the legal armies have grown since 2000, they have come to rely increasingly on volunteer attorneys flying in to the key swing states for election day. The Obama for America campaign has used its digital organising tool, Dashboard, to mobilise lawyers, paralegals and law students and direct them to the polling stations where they are needed most \u2013 <a href=\"https://dashboard.barackobama.com/groups/1664-victory-counsel-\">a project called Victory Counsel</a>.</p> <p>A campaign official said: \"While it is easy to vote and we expect the election process to run smoothly, Obama For America has a team of legal volunteers and professionals prepared in case any difficulties do emerge.\"</p> <p>Philip Raible, a commercial litigator with the New York firm Rayner Rowe, is flying at his own cost to Cleveland, Ohio, on Saturday to volunteer for Obama's legal team. On Sunday he will spend three hours in a training session on election law, before being dispatched on election day to a precinct of Cleveland to monitor the poll.</p> <p>Coming from out of state, Raible is not able to enter a polling station, issue proceedings or appear before Ohio judges himself, so he will be acting in a purely supporting role to local lawyers on the campaign. But he thinks the effort will be worthwhile.</p> <p>\"I'm doing it because as a Democratic resident of New York, a Democratic state, my vote has very little impact on the election nationally, whereas if I can help Obama win Ohio it will have a much greater impact,\" he said.</p> <p>While lawyers will be fanning out through all the crucial swing states \u2013 including Colorado, Iowa, Nevada, Wisconsin and Virginia \u2013 the most intensive efforts will be in Florida and Ohio given their history of litigation in 2000 and 2004 respectively.</p>",
  "<p>Poverty is America's economic Hurricane Sandy. Close to <a href=\"http://thinkprogress.org/economy/2011/11/21/373432/vitter-food-stamp-cap/?mobile=nc\">50 million Americans</a> \u2013 a number equal to the populations of the states hardest hit by the devastating storm \u2013 are below the poverty line. But one wouldn't know it from the <a href=\"http://www.thenation.com/blog/170749/home-foreclosures-missing-presidential-debates\">silence of Barack Obama and Mitt Romney</a> on the topic. In contrast to the physical storm, neither presidential candidate has promised the full resources of the government that they wish to lead in turning the tide on this searing issue. Their dual muteness is shocking given what's at stake.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.npr.org/2012/09/12/161013227/poverty-rate-unchanged-but-still-historically-high\">One in six Americans is poor</a>. Due to the ravages of the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression, their ranks have grown to the highest level in almost a generation. Most of those in poverty are the working poor \u2013 those employed but who don't earn enough to live \u2013 and their children. Though the poor are overwhelmingly white, poor people are disproportionately black and brown. <a href=\"http://www.npc.umich.edu/publications/policy_briefs/brief16/index.php\">One in three African Americans</a> is poor, as is <a href=\"http://latino.foxnews.com/latino/lifestyle/2012/09/12/one-in-every-4-us-hispanics-lives-in-poverty/\">one in four Latinos</a>. Though poverty has grown, when it comes to actual discussion during this year's presidential race, you can hear a pin drop.</p> <p>Neither during the campaign nor his term in office has President Obama given one speech dedicated to poverty. In his second run for the presidency, besides the <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/10/04/mitt-romney-47-percent_n_1941423.html\">wayward \"47%\" comment that the poor \"did not take responsibility for their lives\"</a>, Mitt Romney hasn't either. Poverty was barely discussed during any of the presidential debates. The topic is nowhere to be found on either candidate's website. </p> <p>An absence of real talk on poverty is not a surprise. Ronald Reagan successfully fused the issue of poverty with racial animosity in his first bid for the White House. In 1976, the \"Great Commnunicator\" \u2013 playing off of southern white resentment of economic and social change in the 1960s and 1970s \u2013 falsely labeled America's poor as black \"<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/19/opinion/19krugman.html\">welfare queens</a>\". Ever since, this distortion of poverty has served as an effective way to get votes from the white working class.</p> <p>The issue became radioactive for Democrats and remains so. Republicans even managed to jujitsu President Bill Clinton into <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2012/11/what-it-will-take-for-barack-obama-to-become-the-next-fdr/264195/\">dismantling the program of federal assistance</a> for the poor instituted by Franklin D Roosevelt. </p> <p>Reagan's poverty slight-of-hand worked so well that Mitt Romney, in a tight race, tried it himself. Trailing among white women, Romney unleashed a summer-long attack on welfare. Romney <a href=\"http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/columnists/ct-oped-0812-page-20120812,0,5718812.column\">falsely accused</a> Obama of secretly rolling back the program's work requirement and five-year cap instituted under Clinton. \"Under Obama's plan \u2026 they just send you your check,\" the ad bogusly asserted. But the president never did such a thing, and the lie was eventually exposed.</p> <p>Romney's attempt to gain votes through racial division consequently ran out of gas. But that wouldn't stop the campaign from trying again.</p> <p>Last week, in a move also aimed at white women, Republican vice-presidential-nominee Paul Ryan <a href=\"http://thinkprogress.org/health/2012/10/25/1087591/paul-ryan-contraception-threat/\">gave a speech on the poor</a>. Ryan pledged his ticket's support for \"upward mobility\" to end poverty. While laying out his vision, he faulted America's expansion of racial and economic justice programs under Democratic President Lyndon Johnson for the current iniquities. Oddly, he claimed that the best way to increase economic opportunity for the poor is to end the very education, health, and work-support programs that poor men and women use to exit impoverishment.</p> <p>Polls taken in the speech's wake show that Ryan's desire to pull up the economic ladder didn't fare well. Like the first attempt, the latest political push on the poor ran out of gas.</p> <p>Though neither presidential candidate may have addressed it straight on as a public policy issue, poverty <em>can</em> be rolled back and millions lifted it from it. In the last 50 years, poverty has come down during periods when strong economic growth meets aggressive government policies to catapult the poor into the working and middle classes. These programs \u2013 specifically in education, health, housing, transportation, work-skill development and racial discrimination \u2013 are what's truly needed to make America an economically fairer place.</p> <p>America has <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/16/business/economy/a-slow-recovery-but-its-all-relative.html\">slowly started to recover from recession</a>. It's time that the country get back to the business of focusing on the poor.</p> <p>But instead, what we've gotten is the continuation of policies which extend the 30 year-long reorientation of government from the needs of the many towards the needs of the super-rich. The numbers show it. Poverty is at a record high, but <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/26/us/politics/top-earners-doubled-share-of-nations-income-cbo-says.html\">so is the top 1%'s share of national income</a>. Poverty and income inequality are moving in tandem, in the wrong direction. Only renewed action to make the economy work for everybody will reverse it.</p> <p>Sadly, instead of redirecting the economic winds to everyone's benefit, both candidates are all too eager to continue to ride the waves of economic and political inertia.</p>",

For that price, they get unlimited access to the site and its various mobile apps. The company says this has helped boost circulation revenues by 7.4% year on year, to <a href=\"http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=105317&amp;p=irol-newsArticle&amp;ID=1749986&amp;highlight=\" title=\"\">$235m in the third quarter</a> of 2012.</p> <p>TMG executives have studied different models adopted by rival newspapers for months, driven by the belief that online advertising will never sustain online journalism in the long term.</p> <p>They opted for this model because of its simplicity, emphasising that readers can still access a generous chunk of Telegraph material online for free before they are asked to hand over a modest amount of money.</p> <p>TMG executives did not want price to be a barrier, nor did they want to restrict the amount of material available for free, but are understood to be open to amending the model depending on its success.</p> <p>A win for the Telegraph would be a boost in digital subscriptions \u2013 currently in excess of 300,000 for the smartphone and iPad products \u2013 and more data about the newspaper's most loyal readers.</p> <p>Advocates of the metered model reject the idea that media groups cannot charge for content online, pointing to new digital music services such as Spotify and Deezer.</p> <p>The backdrop to the Telegraph metered paywall launch on Thursday was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/nov/01/online-paid-contect-rise-8-billion-pounds\" title=\"\">a report by research group Forrester</a> that forecast online paid-content to grow 65% to \u00a38bn a year by 2017, driven bythe growth of smartphones and tablet computers.</p> <p>Darika Ahrens, the analyst behind the report, said that consumer spend on news content would grow by 77% from \u20ac158m (\u00a3126m) this year, to \u20ac279m in 2017, including digital subscriptions to newspapers such as the Financial Times, New York Times, Wall Street Journal Europe, the Times, Sunday Times \u2013 and now the Telegraph.</p> <p>Asked what she made of the Telegraph's move to charge online users, Ahrens said: \"Finally. We've been recommending newspapers start monetising with subscription models since 2009.</p> <p>\"Online subscriptions from overseas visitors alone are unlikely to offset the decline newspapers have experienced in advertising revenues. This should be just one part of a multi-channel monetisation strategy.\"</p> <p>She added: \"Shifting consumers who are used to free [access] over to paying customers is tough. The Times and Sunday Times risked it and went cold turkey, but this approach allows the Telegraph to develop the right payment models with a smaller user base, then refine the model to offer wider packages to UK users.\"</p> <p>The timing for the introduction of the paywall is bold, coming just a week before the US presidential election and in the aftermath of superstorm Sandy that has dominated headlines since the weekend.</p> <p>There had been talk internally that the paywall would be launched ahead of the London Olympics, but that idea was canned and the paper benefited from the predictable rise in traffic that boosted most UK national newspaper websites.</p> <p>The digital vision for the Telegraph is quite clearly international, following the lead of the Daily Mail's Mail Online, and Guardian US.

It's a fun intellectual game, which actually only highlights how unpredictable and strange the unemployment figures have become.&#xa0;</p> <p>Now, it's more clear that the economy is going up \u2013 at least, most of the useful economic indicators we have are pointing that way. And if there's any fairness in the world, horse-race economic thinking should come to an end: the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2012/nov/01/jobs-figures-us-economy\">economy seems to be well on its way to recovery by most measures</a>.&#xa0;</p> <p>So, perhaps, Superman (in the form of the BLS) is starting to put an end to the horse-race guesses of whether the economy is improving or not, and what that means for politicians, who, realistically, have no individual control over whether people are employed or not. It's become hard to doubt that a real, if modest, recovery in the economy is definitely happening.&#xa0;</p> <p>Josh Brown, a <a href=\"http://about.me/joshuamorganbrown\">blogger and analyst with Fusion Analytics</a>, put it best when he joked in a fake headline:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Economic recovery threatens \u2026 handwringing industry.</p> </blockquote> <p>And for Governor Mitt Romney, these jobs numbers, coming so close to the election, will naturally undercut his argument that the economy is bad \u2013 even though the jobs numbers are notoriously vague and inconclusive. That might leave him saying another famous quote from the Simpsons:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>D'oh!</p> </blockquote>",
  "<p>On the BBC a few weeks ago the New York Times pundit David Brooks explained to his British audience that American voters are \"looking for an excuse to vote against the president\". Spot on, I thought. Voters are disappointed in the promise that Barack Obama represented in 2008, but Mitt Romney has been making it hard for swing voters to elect him president instead.</p> <p>Since then it's looked as if next Tuesday's ballot may swing Romney's way after all. But no. As hurricane Sandy roared up the US eastern seaboard, fate may have tipped the balance back in Obama's direction by showing him quietly in charge and reminding folks the government \u2013 local, state or federal \u2013 isn't always the enemy of Tea Party fantasy.</p> <p>Overnight we've also learned that New York's mayor, Michael Bloomberg, the little guy with the sign language aide at his side, soft-spoken but reassuring and on top of the detail, is backing Obama and by implication the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/nov/01/bloomberg-obama-endorsement-vote-big-government\" title=\"\">benign power of government</a>.</p> <p>That's quite a big deal, like Boris Johnson endorsing Ed Miliband \u2013 don't hold your breath, Ed \u2013 at the 2015 election here. Except that Bloomberg is an ex-Republican independent, a self-made billionaire who has the gravitas that Boris lacks, though he generally makes worse jokes.</p> <p>Hizzoner \u2013 as Americans call their big city mayors \u2013 is shrewdly political enough to praise Romney as a \"good and decent man\" who has done good things. Alas, \"he has reversed course on all of them\", including the healthcare model he created as governor of Massachusetts, the mayor noted in a statement. But the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/nov/01/bloomberg-endorses-obama-climate-change\" title=\"\">clincher for Bloomberg is Romney's hostility to climate change</a>.</p> <p>This week's devastation \"may or may not be\" a result, but the risk requires \"immediate action\", Bloomberg concludes. That's spot on too. When I <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/blog/2012/oct/30/frankenstorm-sandy-monstrous-media-hysteria\" title=\"\">mocked CNN's hysterical buildup</a> to hurricane Sandy here this week I got it partly wrong. The <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/nov/01/east-coast-normalcy-hurricane-sandy\" title=\"\">havoc and death it actually wreaked</a> \u2013 as opposed to the spine-chilling advance publicity \u2013 was more severe than I initially grasped, as we all now know.</p> <p>But one of my complaints, which remains valid, was the widespread reluctance of many Americans to concede that manmade climate change may be a crucial driver of its increasingly turbulent continental weather. The daily US weather map that most newspapers carry can be extraordinary, a Wagnerian drama which piles two feet of snow on Idaho on the same day that oranges are ripening in Florida sunshine. Floods, snow, twisters, droughts; it's never dull.</p> <p>Yet it remains an article of faith with many Americans that they can master nature as they mastered their vast land \u2013 chopped down its forests, dammed its rivers, cultivated its deserts, drilled for its oil, tamed its forest fires. Herman Melville's classic MobyDick told them otherwise \u2013 the sea always wins \u2013 but it's not a message everyone wants to hear. Obama's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/nov/01/bloomberg-climate-change-closet-romney\" title=\"\">strategy</a> has been to let events talk for themselves.</p> <p>Bloomberg knows it \u2013 if you take a look at the storm, be careful, nature is stronger than us, he warned New Yorkers this week. After all, the great port city is surrounded by water \u2013 Manhattan, Long Island and Staten Island are just that \u2013 and the East and Hudson rivers are close to the vast Atlantic swell. The Thames Barrier, a mighty undertaking, currently protects London. It would not be enough to protect New York as water levels rise.</p> <p>The polarised ideological gridlock of Washington politics, far more severe than in post-cold-war Europe, exaggerates disagreements and damages politics: the failure to reach a compromise on federal taxes and spending still threatens the economic recovery, whoever wins on Tuesday. It needn't be that way. Just look at the courteous way Obama and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Christie\" title=\"\">Chris Christie</a>, admired Republican governor of New Jersey, have treated each other in this week's crisis.</p> <p>None of this plays Romney's way or the way Tea Party types want to see the world. I hesitate to say it's clinched re-election for the president. When Romney made his coarse assessment of the Democratic electoral base \u2013 the 47% of people who depend on benefits from the state \u2013 in September <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/sep/18/mitt-romney-video-leak-gaffe\" title=\"\">I suggested it might</a> \u2013 might \u2013 be the turning point, ensuring the challenger's defeat.</p> <p>So it might have done, but for Obama's strikingly feeble performance in the first presidential debate. It was precisely the sort of event which \u2013 to quote Brooks \u2013 gave wavering voters an excuse to vote him out. If he looked so disengaged that he didn't seem to want the job, why not let the other fellow have a go?</p> <p>After all, he had not lived up to expectations, though in fairness to Obama a kind reader on Twitter draws my attention to <a href=\"http://nymag.com/daily/intel/2012/10/barack-obama-is-a-great-president-yes-great.html\" title=\"\">this robust defence</a> of the president's record by Jonathan Chait in the New York magazine. In the later debates Obama fought back \u2013 and now the hurricane has played to his strengths.</p> <p>Does it matter who wins? At the Cambridge Festival of Ideas last weekend I heard a panel of experts on Asia \u2013 one Korean, one Japanese and one Chinese \u2013 saying there is less interest than usual in the contest on their side of the Pacific. The US focus is tilting towards China (60% of US warships are now in the Pacific, we were told) but the anti-China rhetoric \u2013 formerly anti-Japanese \u2013 over unfair trade is much quieter in 2012.</p> <p>Whoever wins won't change US policy much (whatever aggressive pledges Romney is making) seemed to be east Asia's verdict. Well, maybe.</p> <p>I'd still say it matters quite a lot. Romney may plan to govern from the centre if he becomes president and Republican forces in Congress and the country allow him to \u2013 as they denied much scope to Obama. But it is certainly not what he's been saying.</p> <p>On climate change, denial is dominant. Republicans still want to deport millions of illegal immigrants, they would cut spending on benefits for those layabout Democrats \u2013 healthcare and stuff \u2013 while increasing defence spending AND cutting taxes for everyone. A constitutional curb on gays rights, the outlawing of abortion etc etc.</p> <p>A pre-emptive attack on Iran's nuclear plants, support for more West Bank settlements, the list is a long one \u2013 and scary. What we know from the record, two Bushes and Ronald Reagan, is that Republicans are better at cutting taxes, mostly for the rich, than cutting spending the way they promise to cut it. That's why the US has a crippling debt problem, a more serious budget imbalance than our own, possible only because of the residual prestige (for now) of the dollar.</p> <p>Add all that to the superior organisational power of the Democratic machine \u2013 the Obama team's better grasp of social media as campaign tools that offset the billionaire bank-rolling of Romney \u2013 together with the changing demographics of the US, and it points me to the same conclusion.</p> <p>Obama's crowds are much smaller than in 2008, but they're multiracial. That's America's future, black, white, Hispanic, Asian. Indeed the insurgency of the Tea Party, which was forced to settle for Romney (Paul Ryan, a consolation prize who could prove an error), may be the last hurrah of the old all-white hegemony.</p> <p>If they can't beat a disappointing incumbent, they may have to come to terms with the new realities at home and abroad. Modernisation of the Republican party is long overdue. Obama to scrape home after all.</p>",
  "<p>An overwhelming majority of Israelis entitled to vote in the US presidential election have cast their ballot for Mitt Romney, according to a poll conducted by an organisation aimed at maximising turnout.</p> <p>Eighty-five percent of the 80,000 American-Israelis who registered to vote through <a href=\"http://ivoteisrael.com/\" title=\"\">iVoteIsrael</a> backed the Republican candidate, the survey indicated. The organisation claimed that in states where the race is tight, expatriate voters from Israel could make a significant difference. Around 7,500 Israelis are registered to vote in Florida, and 3,500 in Ohio.</p> <p>But <a href=\"http://www.democratsabroad.org/group/israel\" title=\"\">Democrats Abroad Israel</a> dismissed the poll as \"slanted and extremely partial\" because it was based on surveys carried out only at polling stations set up by iVoteIsrael. The acting chairman Hillel Schenker told the Israeli newspaper Haaretz: \"All they're doing is providing information about the people they polled at their polling stations, in places where there are predominantly Orthodox and rightwing Jews.\"</p> <p>The campaign group says it is non-partisan and its only interest is to maximise the vote among eligible Israelis. It said voter participation had quadrupled from the 20,000 Israelis who voted in 2008, and that between 20% and 25% of all overseas votes this year would come from Israel.</p> <p>Israel's prime minster, Binyamin Netanyahu, has been accused of favouring a Romney victory in next week's election. Relations between Netanyahu and Barack Obama have been severely strained over the issue of the Iranian nuclear programme. Romney is perceived to be more sympathetic to Netanyahu's view that military action may be needed to halt the programme.</p> <p>Romney has consistently sought to portray Obama as failing to maintain the traditionally close ties between the US and Israel. Almost eight in 10 Jewish Americans voted for Obama in 2008, and a majority are expected to vote Democrat in this election.</p>",
  "<p>Confetti still litters the floor of the modest campaign headquarters and the victorious candidate is obviously exhausted, but for Maya Fern\u00e1ndez Allende the real hard work is just about to begin.</p> <p>Allende was just one year old on 11 September 1973 when <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2009/sep/12/from-the-guardian-archive?INTCMP=SRCH.\" title=\"\">a rightwing coup d'etat</a> led to the death of her grandfather \u2013 Salvador Allende, the then Chilean president. The family fled to Cuba and for three decades the heir to one of Chile's most illustrious and controversial political fortunes was out of the limelight.</p> <p>All that changed last Sunday, when Fern\u00e1ndez Allende <a href=\"http://www.nunoa.cl/conozca/\" title=\"\">won the mayorship of \u00d1u\u00f1oa</a> \u2013 a district of the capital, Santiago. But in addition to the pressures of office will come the pressure of assuming the Allende legacy.</p> <p>\"It makes me proud but [is also] a responsibility,\" she told the Guardian. \"My grandfather was a grand man, he was loyal with his people until the end \u2026 that is a principle, a value that is not often seen in politics.\"</p> <p>A week ago, Fern\u00e1ndez Allende's victory was not even discussed as a possibility, as the district had long been held by rightwing politicians. Her opponent Pedro Sabat had been re-elected three times by wide margins and held office for 16 years.</p> <p>But Chile has undergone a transformation over the past 18 months. Citizen groups fighting hydroelectric dams in Patagonia and demanding free university education have sprouted online and filled the streets with dozens of big marches \u2013 gathering up to 150,000 students. The upshot was the narrowest of wins for the challenger \u2014 by less than 100 votes out of more than 75,000 cast.</p> <p>Fern\u00e1ndez Allende put her victory down to a longstanding family tradition: hitting the streets. \"I walked the entire district twice,\" she said as a steady stream of giddy volunteers entered and left the one-storey, four-room office.</p> <p>\"When you enter a campaign, you enter to win, not to make a decent stand \u2026 I put all my heart into this and it was difficult, versus a mayor who had high voting support, but even before the final announcement I felt it was a victory, nobody had even come close to being that competitive with Sabat. We did this with a team, with a field operation.\"</p> <p>Students battled regularly with Sabat by occupying his office and shutting down numerous schools with strikes that lasted for as long as six months. Sabat faced strong condemnation for his assessment that a high school seized by female students had degenerated into \"a whorehouse\".</p> <p>Fern\u00e1ndez Allende said: \"That comment really shook people up. Even people who did not support the [striking] students thought that was too much.\"</p> <p>Apart from a whiteboard, the only office decoration was the official photograph of Salvador Allende wearing the Chilean presidential sash and his trademark thick black glasses. \"I would have loved to have known him in a more humane way, as a grandfather,\" said Fern\u00e1ndez Allende.</p> <p>\"I don't remember him, I was too small. But I am always entertained by the stories of his life that people tell me. Especially that despite his huge responsibilities, he had a great sense of humour. Always [there] with a wisecrack. That kept him going.\"</p> <p>Fern\u00e1ndez Allende, who lived in Cuba for nearly 20 years, added: \"The political bug bit me late in life.\" Even upon her return to Chile in 1992, she did little on the political front besides joining the Socialist party. But in 2008, she won her first election as a <em>concejal</em>, or neighbourhood representative, who works closely with the mayor.</p> <p>She also began to tap into the vein of goodwill still held by her grandfather and was elected to the Socialist party central committee in 2010. But it was the sudden outpouring of anger on the street that really galvanised her career \u2013 a sign that her grandfather's legacy of a humane socialist revolution lived on.</p> <p>\"The dictatorship did not allow you to express yourself, you might talk and then be disappeared, so people stopped talking,\" Fern\u00e1ndez Allende said. \"For 20 years nobody talked to anybody, you did not know who was a spy. There was lots of silence. People became more introverted. [Now] this generation has changed, it has come back to the street, to knock on the door, to bang the table.\"</p>",
  "<p>In an economy obsessed by innovation, we're always on the lookout for cool little startups, clever new ways technology is changing our culture, and smart new software that comes out of nowhere to show us a better way of doing things. When you watch the evolution of popular digital culture \u2013 and observe which services people love and are loyal to, which they get infatuated and then bored with, which they ignore, which they actively resent \u2013 you get fascinating results.</p> <p>The era of services accessed through mobile phones has shown us that people really respond to tools configured around (to quote Apple) \"solving life's little problems, one app at a time.\" With this resounding user-focused lesson in mind, maybe the next big thing for us is something a little grander. Perhaps we should strive towards a world where we can promise an operating system for life. Not as an immediate practical aspiration, but as an idea that new examples of digital products and services ultimately take us closer towards.</p> <p>The Oxford English dictionary says an operating system is: \"A set of programs for organising the resources and activities of a computer\" \u2013 today, people respond to and embrace software that in some way organises their resources (like time and money) and activities (like work and play). Even a smartphone game you play in the supermarket is organising your resources, in this case time, by giving you an activity, sparing you a feeling of watching time pass by.</p> <p>This week we launched <a href=\"http://www.nike.com/us/en_us/c/training/nike-plus-kinect-training\" title=\"\">Nike+ Kinect Training</a>, where an ongoing exchange of fine-tuned data gives people an evolving, precise and truly personal training system, improving health and fitness. In September, California's governor Edmund Brown signed the bill that legalised autonomous vehicles \u2013 also known as self-driving cars. Doing so wasn't just about space-age headlines, but a response to the findings of initial research by companies such as Google, which suggest computer-controlled drivers can be safer and more efficient than humans.</p> <p>Luddites might see such developments as the machines taking over, but the rest of us should be able to embrace this example of technology making efficient use of our time and resources. Here's the proof: Nissan recently unveiled early developments from its own autonomous vehicle research program. One part of the technology uses sensors and cameras to understand the spatial terrain around the car and respond accordingly, so drivers can't mistakenly move into too-small spaces, bump into unseen objects, and won't have to correct driving lines. The second key innovation is the replacement of all the mechanical components between steering wheel and front wheels with electronics, for a much quicker, more responsive, and driver-aware experience.</p> <p>Back in the early 60s, Marshall McLuhan wrote an essay called <a href=\"http://home.roadrunner.com/~lifetime/UM-4-A.htm\" title=\"\">The Gadget Lover: Narcissus as Narcosis</a>. In it he surveyed the new boom in consumer electronics in America over the previous decade and identified a new archetype: the gadget lover. McLuhan wasn't overly enthusiastic about this emerging obsession, seeing it as a way for consumers to offload the information overload and psychic stress of modern life. The gadget was kind of cyborg extension of the individual that helped them cope by putting them into a kind of trance (narcosis). Though the gadget lover sang the praises of the latest gadget for its innovations, he or she actually, unwittingly, loved it because it reflected his or her own interests and personality back, like a mirror.</p> <p>We often want help, because we like to do things more easily and quickly, to better manage our resources and activities. We invest ourselves and our personalities in our technology \u2013 that's when it becomes interesting and relevant. We like technology to help do more useful and fun things, to make boring things less painful, to save us time, money and misery.</p> <p>People have become accustomed to having hardware and software working for them, and the internet has made everybody accustomed to having their say and expecting solutions at speed. If we love gadgets and software, it's precisely because we know they reflect our lives. We're not the deluded slaves of new gadgets, we're their impatient masters. New technologies give us more knowledge and control than we are used to. If I go to a firm like <a href=\"https://www.23andme.com/\" title=\"\">23 And Me</a> and pay $299 (\u00a3185) to get my genes analysed, that's not because I want to outsource my identity to machines \u2013 it's because the information they give me from a saliva sample will help me learn all sorts of interesting things, from past ancestry to future health problems, that I couldn't have accessed before.</p> <p>In September, thinktank <a href=\"http://www.demos.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Demos</a> issued a report on people's attitudes to sharing data in the digital world. \"The Data Dividend\" was written on the assumption that, used properly, big data can help all of us \u2013 at home, in healthcare, in civic life, in science \u2013 but thanks to high-profile losses of confidential information, expensive IT projects gone wrong, perceived heavy-handedness and newsworthy errors in its past application, many people are exceptionally cautious about the risks involved, and the likelihood of promised benefits materialising.</p> <p>What organisations need to do, then, is be modular and responsive. To use the data now generated by people's choices and behaviours to keep refining and improving their systems and making them more responsive. This means combining data with small, speedy manoeuvres \u2013 combining clear, reassuring, deeply-held principles with agility and enough leeway for an organisation's employees to use the realtime data available to improve the services they offer.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theyworkforyou.com/\" title=\"\">Theyworkforyou.com</a> is the address where you can cut through the promotional materials and see how your MP acted where it counted, at key parliamentary votes. In a digital era where 'service' is the key aspiration for anybody hoping to continue engaging with people, organisations should take that message to the heart. It may be too late for the US 2012 presidential election, but it's surely a more sensible way to re-engage voters in the data-rich, increasingly transparent world we inhabit today. Put technology to work for people and you're already taking steps towards that inspirational near-future aspiration: creating an operating system for our lives.</p> <p><em>Ajaz Ahmed is founder of </em><a href=\"http://www.akqa.com/\" title=\"\"><em>AKQA</em></a><em> and author of </em><a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Velocity-Seven-Laws-World-Digital/dp/0091947561/\" title=\"\"><em>Velocity: Seven New Laws For a World Gone Digital</em></a><em> \u2013 find out more about Nike+ Kinect Training </em><a href=\"http://www.nike.com/us/en_us/c/training/nike-plus-kinect-training\" title=\"\"><em>here</em></a></p> <p><strong>To get more articles like this sent direct to your inbox, </strong><a href=\"https://register.theguardian.com/media/\" title=\"\"><strong>sign up for free membership</strong></a><strong> of the Guardian Media Network.

  "<p>The impact of the superstorm Sandy was felt directly on the presidential election on Thursday when the popular mayor of New York, Michael Bloomberg, threw his support behind Barack Obama, citing Republican challenger Mitt Romney's failure to back climate change measures.</p> <p>Bloomberg combined his endorsement of Obama with a devastating attack on Romney for reversing his positions not only on climate change but on immigration, guns, abortion rights and healthcare.</p> <p>His endorsement came as Obama received plaudits for his handling of the storm that has devastated New Jersey and New York and also hit Connecticut and West Virginia.</p> <p>The mayor, writing about the damage caused to New York by Sandy, praised Obama for having made some progress towards tackling climate change. He noted that Romney, too, had supported climate change moves in the past but has since backed away from them.</p> <p>In a powerful passage that can only hurt Romney, Bloomberg went on to write: \"I believe Mitt Romney is a good and decent man, and he would bring valuable business experience to the Oval Office. He understands that America was built on the promise of equal opportunity, not equal results.</p> <p>\"In the past he has also taken sensible positions on immigration, illegal guns, abortion rights and healthcare. But he has reversed course on all of them, and is even running against the healthcare model he signed into law in Massachusetts.\"</p> <p>Obama said he was honoured to have Bloomberg's endorsement. \"I deeply respect him for his leadership in business, philanthropy and government, and [I] appreciate the extraordinary job he's doing right now, leading New York City through these difficult days,\" the president said.</p> <p>\"Mayor Bloomberg and I agree on the most important issues of our time \u2013 that the key to a strong economy is investing in the skills and education of our people, that immigration reform is essential to an open and dynamic democracy, and that climate change is a threat to our children's future.</p> <p>\"Just as importantly, we agree that whether we are Democrats, Republicans, or independents, there is only one way to solve these challenges and move forward as a nation \u2013 together.\"</p> <p>Bloomberg's support comes after New Jersey governor Chris Christie praised Obama for his handling of Sandy. Although Christie is a Republican and a prominent supporter of Romney, he went out of his way this week to repeatedly praise Obama's leadership in responding to the crisis.</p> <p>Bloomberg is an independent who had originally been a Democrat before switching to the Republicans in 2001. He won the mayorship as a Republican but fell out with the party in 2007.</p> <p>He considered running as an independent in the 2008 White House election and commissioned polls in all 50 states, dropping the idea after finding insufficient support.</p> <p>In his op-ed, Bloomberg brings climate change, largely ignored by Obama and Romney during the campaign, back to the fore.</p> <p>\"The devastation that Hurricane Sandy brought to New York City and much of the north-east \u2013 in lost lives, lost homes and lost business \u2013 brought the stakes of Tuesday's presidential election into sharp relief,\" he wrote.</p> <p>He added: \"Our climate is changing. And while the increase in extreme weather we have experienced in New York City and around the world may or may not be the result of it, the risk that it might be \u2013 given this week's devastation \u2013 should compel all elected leaders to take immediate action.\"</p> <p>Obama had taken major steps to reduce carbon consumption and Romney too had a history of tackling climate change but had reversed course.</p> <p>He said he was disappointed with Obama on many issues, listing among them healthcare reform.</p> <p>\"When I step into the voting booth, I think about the world I want to leave my two daughters, and the values that are required to guide us there. The two parties' nominees for president offer different visions of where they want to lead America,\" he writes.</p> <p>\"One believes a woman's right to choose should be protected for future generations; one does not. That difference, given the likelihood of supreme court vacancies, weighs heavily on my decision.</p> <p>\"One recognises marriage equality as consistent with America's march of freedom; one does not. I want our president to be on the right side of history.\"</p> <p>He concluded: \"Presidents Bill Clinton and Ronald Reagan both found success while their parties were out of power in Congress \u2013 and President Obama can, too. If he listens to people on both sides of the aisle, and builds the trust of moderates, he can fulfil the hope he inspired four years ago and lead our country toward a better future for my children and yours. And that's why I will be voting for him.\"</p> <p>The Economist, which has a wide readership in the US, said in an editorial it had backed Obama four years ago and was doing so again. It regretted that Romney was too far removed from the centre.</p> <p>\"This newspaper yearns for the more tolerant conservatism of Ronald Reagan, where 'small government' meant keeping the state out of people's bedrooms as well as out of their businesses. Mr Romney shows no sign of wanting to revive it,\" it says.</p> <p>It concludes: \"For all his businesslike intentions, Mr Romney has an economic plan that works only if you don't believe most of what he says. That is not a convincing pitch for a chief executive. And for all his shortcomings, Mr Obama has dragged America's economy back from the brink of disaster, and has made a decent fist of foreign policy. So this newspaper would stick with the devil it knows, and re-elect him.\"</p> <p>Fellow Republicans downplayed the significance of Bloomberg's endorsement. \"It's not surprising to me. Bloomberg is a very liberal political figure,\" said George Pataki, the former Republican governor of New York.</p> <p>Pataki also argued Romney would be \"far better\" than Obama in dealing with climate change.</p> <p>Pataki during his time as governor was one of the creators of a regional carbon trading system \u2013 which is in partial collapse since Christie pulled out last year. </p> <p>He said of Romney's position: \"I think he is far better than Obama, who embraced the Markey-Waxman bill. That is the fear when you allow people like Pelosi and Reid and Obama to draft national legislation that is not so much aimed at climate change but at expanding government power and government revenue. I think Romney would be far better.\"</p>"

Ohio is perhaps the most crucial state in the election, its 18 electoral college votes fiercely contested by both parties who know those votes could be needed to squeeze past the 270 required for victory. No Republican has ever won a presidential election without taking the state, and McPherson was well aware of Romney's need to appeal to his fellow Ohioans.</p> <p>\"I want to hear Governor Romney continue to talk about what he's been talking about for this past year and a half,\" he said. \"And that is how he is going to turn this country around and create jobs and strengthen this economy so that America can return to the glory that it has possessed for so many centuries.\"</p> <p>It is expected to be close in Colorado, too. The Centennial State went to George W Bush in 2000 and 2004 <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/election/2012/ecalculator?hpt=po_r1#_ \">but swung to the Democrats in 2008</a>, with Obama winning by almost 9%. </p> <p>Bob Beauprez knows as much as anyone about the politics of the state \u2013 the Colorado delegate, and former congressman, was the Republican nominee for governor in 2006, losing out to Democrat rival Bill Ritter.</p> <p>\"Mitt Romney has got to make the connection with people that he can not only be our nominee and be a credible candidate, but that he can fix our economy that's been struggling so badly,\" Beauprez said.</p> <p>\"I like Mitt Romney because of his practical experience. Everywhere he's been in life he's been a fix-it kind of guy. He's turned around the Olympics, he turned around Massachusetts, he did it in the private sector when he was at Bain Capital.\"</p> <p>Beauprez said he knows Romney personally, and said he is a \"remarkably humble man\".</p> <p>\"That's his background, that's the family that he came from, that's the way he's lived his life. Sometimes people see that humbleness as a detachment. I think it's a misread of Mitt and Ann Romney and I think you're going to see some of that more human side, the warmer side, at this convention.\"</p> <p>DeLena May, from Gainesville, Florida \u2013 \"we have 50,000 students there, most of them liberal, unfortunately\" \u2013 is another delegate from a crucial swing state. Obama won Florida by 2.82% in 2008, and it is no coincidence that Republicans chose the state for the convention.</p> <p>\"What I want to hear from Mitt Romney is 'We're gonna straighten this crap out,'\" May said. \"I'm a business person, I'm a person who lived the American dream and my children have no chance to live the American dream in this socialised mess that has evolved in the last 20 years or so. I know that Mitt Romney will be able to straighten it out because he's as conservative as I am. And he understands what it takes to fix things that are broken \u2013 primarily national healthcare.\"</p> <p>Pennsylvania has been Democrat territory in all recent elections, but is seen as having an outside chance of swinging for Romney given that the vote there tends to be close to the national average. For Margo Hunt, from Bucks County, Pennsylvania, Romney needs to describe how he will \"help our economy, keep our armed forces strong, and reverse what's going on in this country\".</p> <p>\"We have got to save our country,\" Hunt added, with scrapping \"Obamacare\" high on her list. Romney has pledged to repeal it on the first day of his presidency.</p> <p>In addition to persuading independents in swing states, however, Romney must also use his speech to appeal to Republicans in GOP strongholds for help with campaigning and, crucially, donations.</p> <p>\"I want to hear from Governor Romney the good things he's going to do for our country to bring us back to less government and to have the great leadership that I know he can do,\" said Lisa Ritchie, from Witchita, Kansas \u2013 one of those strongholds. Ritchie, who had dressed as a witch \"to showcase our great state\", runs two businesses, selling dancewear and providing \"dinner theatre\", making her exactly the kind of small business owner that Romney tries to appeal to when he talks of lower taxes and less government interference.</p> <p>\"The economy is just sorry right now,\" she said. \"And I have a couple of small businesses and I don't want him to tell me that I have to pay so much if I have 50 employees \u2026 there's so many things.\"</p> <p>Georgia delegate Ginger Howard, from Atlanta, campaigned for Rick Perry during the Iowa caucuses, but said she was \"100%\" behind Romney now, and looking forward to his address on Thursday night. \"I think that he needs to really show the sharp contrast between his vision and the vision of the current president, and talk about how far even more in debt [we are] than we were four years ago.\" </p> <p>\"He needs to lay out his plan, he needs to make it very clear, he needs to articulate it and he also needs to personalise himself.\"</p> <p>Jerry Miller, from Kentucky, was roaming the convention floor on Wednesday night, looking to collect pin buttons from as many different states as possible as unnoticed luminaries took to the stage to heap praise on the 2012 nominee. \"Mitt Romney has to show that he has a plan, that its not just rhetoric, or who do you like the most,\" Miller said. \"The most important issue is jobs and the economy, without a doubt. Many of us are concerned about our debt.\"</p> <p>As for his button collection, Miller had pins from 12 of 50 states as of Wednesday evening. \"I must have met people from about 24 states, but many people don't have buttons\", he said. Mitt Romney will be hoping for a higher conversion rate come 6 November.</p>",
  "<p>Today, we're going to talk about race. That might have some of you heading for the exit, but rest assured: this is not about race relations. Rather, we are going to talk about race and the demographics of the 2012 electorate.</p> <p>Race matters in US politics for the simple reason that whites tend to vote Republican, while Latinos and especially African Americans tend to vote Democratic. If the proportion of the electorate that is white were to go up just 2 percentage points, that would bode very well for Mitt Romney. If the electorate were to become 2 points \"more Latino\", then President Obama would be in much better shape.</p> <p>There have been <a href=\"http://decoded.nationaljournal.com/2012/04/four-recent-national-polls-inc.php\">some arguments</a> that the percentage of whites in this year's electorate will fall from its 2008 level. That's based on the belief that Latino communities are a growing segment of the American electorate. There is just one problem with that hypothesis: it's not happening.&#xa0;</p> <p>Latinos <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2012/04/20/counting_minorities_are_poll_sampling_complaints_legit_113904.html\">have made up</a> a consistent 8% of the electorate since 2004, according to exit polls. Given <a href=\"http://firstread.nbcnews.com/_news/2012/08/22/13415554-obama-leads-big-with-latinos-but-enthusiasm-still-lags?lite\">low Latino enthusiasm</a>, and the possibility of second- and third-generation Latinos identifying as \"white\", instead of ethnic Hispanic, the percentage of self-identifying Latinos may actually decrease.</p> <p>But let's agree, for the sake of this article, that the electorate will mirror 2008's. That's why the <a href=\"http://nymag.com/daily/intel/2012/08/why-is-obama-so-confident.html\">percentage of white voters expected</a> is being put at 74%, instead of the 72% predicted earlier this year, when some were modelling for a higher Latino percentage of the electorate. (That 74% comes from the percentage of voters who identified as white, non-Hispanic in the 2008 election, according to exit polls.)</p> <p>There is a problem with this 74% number, however. It was only the election night exit polls that pegged whites at 74%. The <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/images/wysiwyg_images/Untitled-419.gif\">updated and final exit poll data</a> put whites at a slightly higher 75%. So, if we're going to take the exit poll data from 2008 as gospel, then 75% should be the percentage of whites we'd want to use as a benchmark.</p> <p>Does that mean we should assume any pollster who doesn't mirror this 75% (plus or minus 1%, given the margin of error) is incorrect? Apparently, the Obama campaign folk feel quite confident because they work off the exit polls and regard the telephone polls such as those conducted by ABC/Washington Post and Gallup as \"too white\". The reality is that exit polls are surveys, just like telephone polls. They all have sample biases.</p> <p>The most exhaustive study of exit poll biases is <a href=\"http://poq.oxfordjournals.org/content/71/4/588.short\">Michael McDonald's 2007 article, \"The True Electorate\"</a>. McDonald studied voter registration files, exit polls, and the Current Population Survey. All of these sources have their own pros and cons, but they disagree on age and race.</p> <p>Exit polls tended to report an electorate that is younger and less white than the other post-election surveys. This is not to say that the exit polls are incorrect, but rather that there are multiple \"right\" answers.</p> <p>Some surveys in 2008 matched the exit poll percentages quite well. <a href=\"http://www.pollster.com/blogs/dcor110208fq21.pdf\">Democracy Corps (pdf)</a>' final poll put whites at 76% of the electorate and had Obama winning by 7 points. NBC/Wall Street Journal's <a href=\"http://msnbcmedia.msn.com/i/msnbc/sections/news/081103_NBC-WSJ_Poll.pdf\">final poll (pdf)</a> registered about 74-75% for non-Hispanic whites, and had Obama winning by 8 points. Obama actually won by 7.3 points.</p> <p>Other polls in 2008 were slightly different than the exit polls. <a href=\"http://pollingmatters.gallup.com/2012/04/whites-and-non-whites-in-gallups.html\">Gallup</a>, whose weighting practices were the subject of a seminal Mark Blumenthal <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/06/17/gallup-poll-race-barack-obama_n_1589937.html\">inquiry</a>, found whites to be 78% of the electorate. An ABC/Washington Post poll likewise put whites at 78%. You might expect that would lead them to underestimate Obama's margin; in fact, not \u2013 because they overestimated how well he would do among white voters. Thus Gallup predicted Obama's margin of victory would be 3.7 percentage points higher than it actually was, while the ABC/Washington Post did so by 1.7 points. </p> <p>But if we were to weight the Gallup and ABC/Washington Post surveys to match the exit polls' percentage of non-Hispanic whites in the electorate, they would have produced an even greater pro-Obama bias. For that reason, I'm extremely wary of making adjustments to some polls based on what other surveys say the percentage of the electorate that is white is likely to be.</p> <p>Instead, I tend to place more trust in pollsters whose numbers (concerning race) look relatively consistent with their 2008 data. If a pollster had whites at 75% of the electorate in 2008, then I expect them to have them at 75% for 2012 \u2013 plus or minus a few points, given the margin of error. The demographics are just not going to have changed that radically.</p> <p>Pollsters whose survey demographics on race were close to the 2008 exit polls seem to be adhering to this rule.&#xa0;<a href=\"http://www.democracycorps.com/attachments/article/906/dcor.nat.polt.082812.pdf\">Democracy Corps (pdf)</a> is finding around 74% to 75% of the electorate to be non-Hispanic white \u2013 right around its 2008 number of 76%. I estimate that <a href=\"http://msnbcmedia.msn.com/i/MSNBC/Sections/A_Politics/_Today_Stories_Teases/August_NBC-WSJ_Int_Sched.pdf\">NBC/Wall Street Journal (pdf)</a> has non-Hispanic whites at about 72% (among registered voters) right now, but that percentage will almost certainly rise to a level near or slightly above 2008's 74-75% once NBC goes over to surveying likely voters.</p> <p>Pollsters whose predicted electorates were slightly \"whiter\" in 2008 than the exit polls said they were have retained that bias: Gallup has whites at 76% of registered voters, so that percentage, too, will rise to near its 2008 figure of 78% (after the switch to likely voters). Meanwhile, ABC/Washington Post's current registered voter model pegs whites at 78%, matching its 2008 likely voter percentage; a 2012 likely voter estimate will move that up slightly (though not as much <a href=\"https://twitter.com/electionate/status/239944374581075968\">as we might expect</a>) \u2013 in which case, the ABC/Washington Post's predicted percentage of white voters should still be hovering around its 2008 levels.</p> <p>I know the people at both the NBC Political Unit and Washington Post polling team, and both are top-notch. The <a href=\"http://www.pollster.com/blogs/rating_pollster_accuracy_predi.php?nr=1\">accuracy ratings agree with me</a>. The two outfits, though, do happen to arrive at slightly different answers on the presidential contest right now: NBC finds Obama up 4 points, but the Washington Post sees Romney ahead by 1. One factor behind this discrepancy might be race (or rather, what the demographic surveying is telling each of them), but the past history recalled above argues otherwise. <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2012/08/29/minority_turnout__the_racial_breakdown_of_polls.html>As Sean Trende, who has similar quibbles to mine about polling and race, notes&lt;/a>, slight differences in the predicted composition of the electorate by race make little difference. Other demographic differences, or simply random sampling error, are more likely the culprit. I'd expect the numbers from NBC and Washington Post polling respectively to converge as election day nears.&lt;/p>&lt;p>For now, let's not get too bogged down in the demographic weeds. The &lt;a href=\" http: www.theguardian.com commentisfree 2012 aug 24 why-next-two-weeks-make-break-romney-ryan\">polling aggregates</a> indicate this election is tight \u2013 with perhaps a slight edge for President Obama.</p>",
  "<p>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/29/ukraine-court-rejects-tymoshenko-appeal?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">rejection of Yulia Tymoshenko's appeal</a> against a conviction for abuse of office by a three-judge panel of the Ukrainian high specialised court for civil and criminal cases is only likely to further entrench the domestic and international divisions that surround the case. A vice prime minister, Sergei Tigipko, <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/ukraine/9507147/Ukraine-minister-insists-Yulia-Tymoshenko-broke-the-law.html\" title=\"\">said the verdict confirmed Tymoshenko's criminal guilt</a> while the EU reaffirmed its opposition to what it called politically motivated selective justice.</p> <p>The twice former prime minister who was the linchpin of the Orange revolution in 2004 was detained on remand in August 2011 part way through a trial for abuse of office centring on the signing of a gas contract between the country's state-owned gas company, Naftogaz, and Russia's Gazprom in January 2009. Tymoshenko was found guilty in October 2011 and sentenced to seven years in prison, disqualified from participation in future elections and ordered to pay $190m compensation to the gas company. During her imprisonment Tymoshenko has claimed to have been mistreated and is currently held in a hospital in Kharkiv where she is receiving medical treatment for back problems.</p> <p>Tymoshenko's defence claimed the case amounted to political persecution by Ukraine's president, Viktor Yanukovich, and his ruling Party of Regions, motivated by a desire to exclude its most potent opponent from the political landscape. If this was indeed the aim it has failed miserably as the case has become a cause celebre inside and outside the country. The EU and its member states have been vocal in their criticism. The EU has placed on hold the ratification, after five years of negotiations, of an association agreement and a free trade agreement with Ukraine. Yanukovych has warned the west not to interfere in its domestic affairs, and division within the EU over how far it dare distance itself from Ukraine given Russia's strategic interest means it is unlikely to follow up its threats with sanctions.</p> <p>Now two courts have found that while she was prime minister, Tymoshenko ordered Naftogaz to sign a contract with Gazprom without having the legal authority of the cabinet of ministers. They also discovered that Tymoshenko illegally threatened to replace the company's director if he failed to sign the contract.</p> <p>The case centres on a puzzling \"gas war\" between Ukraine and Russia in January 2009 which halted the flow of gas to Ukraine and the EU for three weeks in the middle of winter. Tymoshenko, then prime minister, appeared to have entered into a new agreement with Russia only to renege on signing an acceptable fixed-price contract by the year-end at the last minute. After a three-week stand-off, Tymoshenko, presumably under enormous pressure from the EU, ordered the signing of a less advantageous 10-year variable-price contract which imposed punitive conditions on the Ukrainian side.</p> <p>It has been suggested that Tymoshenko's generous approach towards the Russians in negotiations may have been due to a conflict of interest stemming from the allegation that she owes $400m to Russia from previous private business dealings in the 1990s when she was a gas trader. However, this interpretation hardly tallies with the west's heightened sensitivity to her conviction. It is at least plausible that Tymoshenko was a pawn in a western geopolitical gambit designed to discredit Russia as an energy supplier, to sour relations between Ukraine and Russia and to re-align Ukrainian domestic politics.</p> <p>In one sense the west is quite correct that the case against Tymoshenko is political but this is more to do with the way her defence and supporters have appealed to the court of public opinion than vindictive political persecution by the authorities. Tymoshenko has initiated a case in the European court of human rights, but ultimately her fate will depend on the country's electoral politics.</p> <p>The case has reunited and reinvigorated the opposition, which will contest the parliamentary elections at the end of October as one list and is currently narrowly leading in opinion polls. Meanwhile, despite a late pre-election spending splurge, the ruling Party of Regions' popularity has dipped having followed an IMF austerity programme. Equally, the Russian government has so far refused to renegotiate the gas contract, which the Ukrainian government claims cost it $6bn in 2011, thereby damaging an already weak economy.</p> <p>Should Tymoshenko's exclusion from parliamentary elections prompt the west to declare them as not free and fair then the next presidential election, scheduled for March 2015, will, as in 2004, be cast in stark terms of democrats verses authoritarians and will be a case of winner takes all. Whether Tymoshenko will once again be a participant or a most interested observer remains to be seen.</p>",
  "<p>Wednesday night, the GOP's nominee for vice-president, Paul Ryan, delivered a speech loaded with pure, fundamental deceit on its core claims. The New Republic's Jonathan Cohn has the <a href=\"http://www.tnr.com/blog/plank/106730/ryan-most-dishonest-convention-speech-five-lies-gm-medicare-deficit-medicaid\">clearest and most concise explanation</a> of those falsehoods.</p> <p>Reflecting the pure worthlessness and chronic failure of CNN, however, <a href=\"http://talkingpointsmemo.com/archives/2012/08/great_moments_in_cnn_euphemisms.php\">here is how</a> that network's lead anchor, Wolf Blitzer, reacted after the speech was finished:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"So there he is, the Republican vice-presidential nominee and his beautiful family there. His mom is up there. This is exactly what this crowd of Republicans here, certainly Republicans all across the country, were hoping for. He delivered a powerful speech, Erin, a powerful speech. Although I marked seven or eight points, I'm sure the fact-checkers will have some opportunities to dispute if they want to go forward; I'm sure they will. As far as Mitt Romney's campaign is concerned, Paul Ryan on this night delivered.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Blitzer's co-anchor, Erin Burnett \u2013 who, the night before, <a href=\"http://www.mediaite.com/tv/erin-burnett-i-had-a-tear-in-my-eye-listening-to-ann-romney-talk-about-her-husband/\">described how she</a> \"had a tear in [her] eye\" as she listened to Ann Romney's convention speech \u2013 added this journalistic wisdom:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"That's right. Certainly so. We were jotting down points. There will be issues with some of the facts. But it motivated people. He's a man who says I care deeply about every single word. I want to do a good job. And he delivered on that. Precise, clear, and passionate.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>As Gawker's Louis Peitzman <a href=\"http://gawker.com/5939136/cnn-correspondents-praise-ryans-speech-acknowledge-seven-or-eight-factual-errors?&amp;/5939136/cnn-correspondents-praise-ryans-speech-acknowledge-seven-or-eight-factual-errors\">wrote</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"'A powerful speech' with only 'seven or eight' facts to dispute? Sounds like a winner \u2026 [I]n the end, isn't 'precise, clear, and passionate' more important than truthful?\"</p> </blockquote> <p>As perfect an exhibit as that is of the empty, rotted wasteland known as \"CNN\", when it comes to conveying the self-parodying inanity of The Most Trusted Name in News, nothing will ever top <a href=\"https://twitter.com/wolfblitzer/status/238028881104351232\">this tweet</a>, from Blitzer last week:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395429294\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/30/1346329514108/blitzer.png\" alt=\"blitzer\" width=\"502\" height=\"209\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>What could ever be better than that? The tagline for Blitzer's show, <a href=\"http://situationroom.blogs.cnn.com/2012/08/20/politicians-skinny-dip-in-sea-of-galilee/\">including on the Sea of Galilee story</a>, boasts that he \"delivers the most important news and political stories of the day\".</p> <p>But mocking CNN is to pick low-hanging fruit. The real issue is that CNN's vapid fixation on the dreaminess of our political leaders and \"their beautiful families\" dominates political discourse generally, especially during the nation's presidential election cycle, which drags on for a seemingly interminable 18 months \u2013 more than one third of the president's term \u2013 and drowns out virtually all other political issues. </p> <p>The reason I write so little about the presidential election is that it's the ultimate expression of the CNN-ization of American politics: a tawdry, uber-contrived reality show that has less to do with political reality than the average rant one hears at any randomly chosen corner bar or family dinner. That does not mean the outcome is irrelevant, only that the process is suffocatingly dumb and deceitful, generating the desire to turn away and hope that it's over as quickly as possible. </p> <p>I happened to be traveling last month and was involuntarily subjected to a television <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6mBXDF9QFA\">showing President Obama speaking</a> in Maumee, Ohio as part of his \"Betting on America\" campaign bus tour. He was wearing a regular-guy plaid short-sleeved shirt, and speaking (literally) in front of a house draped with a huge American flag and framed by a white picket fence. The \"Betting on America\" sign was printed in a font of vintage 1950s Americana. I recall marveling at the level of sheer cynicism one must wield in order to be a successful American campaign consultant.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395429295\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/30/1346340294445/obamastump_460x276.jpg\" alt=\"Barack Obama stumping in Ohio, 2012\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>It was with good reason that the advertising industry chose the 2008 Obama campaign as the recipient of its most prestigious awards, including <a href=\"http://adage.com/article/moy-2008/obama-wins-ad-age-s-marketer-year/131810/\">Marketer of the Year</a> and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2009/jun/29/barack-obama-cannes-lions\">various advertising honors</a>. The brand \u2013 Obama \u2013 was expertly crafted and packaged.</p> <p>Strong and rational though it may be, the temptation to ignore entirely the election year spectacle should be resisted. Despite its shallow and manipulative qualities \u2013 or, more accurately, because of them \u2013 this process has some serious repercussions for American political life.</p> <p>The election process is where American politicians go to be venerated and glorified, all based on trivial personality attributes that have zero relationship to what they do with their power, but which, by design, convinces Americans that they're blessed to be led by people with such noble and sterling character, no matter how much those political figures shaft them. (Wednesday, President Obama, during his highly-touted \"Ask Me Anything\" appearance on Reddit, predictably ignored the<a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z1c9z/i_am_barack_obama_president_of_the_united_states/c60mo7c\"> question from Mother Jones's Nick Baumann</a> about Obama's killing of the American teenager Abdulrahman Awlaki, in favor of answering questions about the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RT_America/status/240918644182380544\">White House beer recipe</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AriMelber/status/240918860386144257\">his favorite basketball player</a>.)</p> <p>The election process is where each political party spends hundreds of millions of dollars exploiting the same trivial personality attributes to demonize the other party's politicians as culturally foreign, all to <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2010/09/13/democrats_48/\">keep their followers in a high state of fear</a> and thus lock-step loyalty.</p> <p>It's the supreme propaganda orgy, devoted to aggressively reinforcing the claim to American exceptionalism: the belief that even when things look grim, America will forever be that special God-favored land of freedom, opportunity, and prosperity, and all citizens should therefore be deeply grateful \u2013 quietly and passively so \u2013 for the privilege of residing in such a land, no matter how wretched are their circumstances and how pervasive is the corruption.</p> <p>It's what inculcates many Americans to believe that they enjoy vibrant political debate and stark democratic choice, even as so many of the policies that are most consequential and destructive for their lives \u2013 the \"war on drugs\", the supremacy of the covert national security and surveillance states, vast inequalities in the justice system, crony capitalism that rapidly bolsters the oligarchy that owns the political process \u2013 are steadfastly ignored because both parties on those matters have exactly the same position and serve the same interests. (Watch how often Obama supporters will defend their leader from conservative attacks by proudly arguing that Obama's policies are actually <a href=\"http://thinkprogress.org/security/2012/07/03/510322/senor-romney-obama-iran-policy/\">the same as that which conservatives advocate</a>: <em>he's severely cut government spending <a href=\"http://thinkprogress.org/economy/2012/03/19/446990/obama-bush-reagan-government-spending/\">even more than Bush and Reagan</a>! <a href=\"http://thinkprogress.org/economy/2012/06/22/504853/corporate-profits-all-time-high/\">Wall Street and corporate profits are at an all-time high</a>! <a href=\"http://thinkprogress.org/report/obama-foreign-policy-successes/\">He's killed and killed and killed some more</a>! <a href=\"http://thinkprogress.org/politics/2010/04/10/90621/heritage-romneycare/\">His healthcare plan comes from a rightwing thinktank</a>! <a href=\"http://thinkprogress.org/security/2012/07/30/610531/peres-barak-obama-israel/\">Nobody has been more faithful to Israel than Obama</a>! <a href=\"http://thinkprogress.org/report/obama-foreign-policy-successes/\">He's severely harmed Iran with sanctions and isolation</a>!</em> etc.)</p> <p>It's where the candidates pretend to believe in a whole litany of base-pleasing and populist policies that enable their loyalists to claim there are vast differences between them, even though such campaign pronouncements have virtually no predictive value in determining what they will do in office \u2013 as the New York Times's Peter Baker, writing about foreign policy campaign platforms, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/30/us/politics/romneys-foreign-policy-intentions-hard-to-gauge.html?hp\">put it today</a> with great understatement: \"the relationship between what presidential candidates say on the campaign trail and what they do once elected can be tenuous.\"</p> <p>It's where the handful of important issues on which there are genuinely sharp and clear differences \u2013 social issues, reproductive rights, jurisprudence philosophy, a few social program and tax policies \u2013 are endlessly exploited to heighten cultural divisions and, more importantly, to obscure the similarities on everything else.</p> <p>The election year process could and should be a meaningful opportunity for real political debate: the one time every four years when the majority of the population that is too busy or uninterested to pay much attention becomes engaged and thus informed. Instead, the process is the ultimate deceit. And the ultimate distraction.</p> <p>It somehow manages simultaneously to be relentlessly insipid, yet genuinely destructive. As Blitzer and Burnett put it last night:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"So there he is, the Republican vice-presidential nominee and his beautiful family there. His mom is up there \u2026 He's a man who says I care deeply about every single word. I want to do a good job.\"</p> </blockquote>",

John McCain took the stage to lament the wars he didn't get to start after losing the 2008 presidential election, fervently hoping Mitt Romney will make up for lost time. Republicans you have never heard of enjoyed their 15 minutes of fame, though it often seemed much longer.</p> <p>In the early going, the only positive moments were an artfully done (even if foreign policy-free) video tribute to Ron Paul, a cautious but well-received address by his son Rand Paul, and George HW Bush doing an impression of <a href=\"http://www.danacarvey.net/\">Dana Carvey</a> doing an impression of him. (If you're curious, the 41st president nailed it.)</p> <p>But as the program moved toward prime time, the speakers picked up the pace. Mike Huckabee started slow, as if Romney's censors had edited out the former Arkansas governor's charm. But his attack on the Obama administration's HHS contraceptive mandate was powerful, and his attempt to rally evangelicals behind a Mormon and a Catholic was sincere. Condoleezza Rice gave one of the strongest speeches of the convention. Susana Martinez, the first-term governor of New Mexico, was likeable, down-to-earth, and impressive.</p> <p>Paul Ryan, nevertheless, remained the star of the show. Ryan is still honing his skills as a big event speaker and attack dog, but he did a good job delivering some of the most effective and specific anti-Obama barbs heard yet in Tampa.</p> <p>\"College grads shouldn't have to live out their 20s in childhood bedrooms, staring up at fading Obama posters,\" he zinged. \"There is no shortage of words from the White House. What is missing is leadership from the White House,\" was another good Ryan line. Finally, on Barack Obama's tendency to blame his predecessors: \"The man assumed office nearly four years ago. Isn't it time he assumed responsibility?\"</p> <p>You could quibble with some facts: the GM plant Ryan mentioned actually closed down before Obama took office, though Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker has pointed out that the president said he would save it. The line itself serves as a reminder that Ryan himself voted for the auto bailout. But overall, Ryan did what he needed to: he galvanized the conservative base without frightening swing voters, all while amplifying the ticket's attack on Obama's economic policies.</p> <p>The biggest blunder of the night was spending so much time reliving George W Bush's presidency. Bush himself appeared in an innocuous video. McCain channeled Bush on steroids. And for all Rice's rhetorical talent, she was essentially promoting warmed-over Bushism and a revisionist take on the 43rd president's \"forward strategy of freedom\", which didn't grapple with the general failure of his foreign policy in the Middle East.</p> <p>Romney and Ryan should want to get clear of Bush.</p> <p><em>James Antle is editor of the Daily Caller News Foundation</em></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/michael-cohen\">Michael Cohen</a>: 'Ryan's speech was a good example of just how far the GOP has strayed from the truth'</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395422721\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Observer/Columnist/Columnists/2011/8/6/1312655160523/Michael-Cohen-003.jpg\" alt=\"Michael Cohen\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Michael Cohen Photograph: Observer</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Listening to Paul Ryan's vice-presidential speech this evening, I think I came within an inch of having a full-blown aneurysm. Never have I heard a major political speech so brazenly and stunningly dishonest. Others will want to talk about Ryan's strong performance and the wild crowd reaction from the assembled GOP delegates, but I'll just spend a few minutes chronicling his cavalcade of lies.</p> <p>Ryan began with a doozy: implicitly blaming Obama for the closing of a General Motors plant in his town of Janesville, Wisconsin. First, that plant was closed when George W Bush was still president. (In fact, here's a <a href=\"http://paulryan.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=200270\">press release</a> from Ryan decrying the closure in June 2008, six months before Obama took office.) So, in a sense, Ryan was complaining that Obama didn't re-open it \u2013 a fairly amazing charge from a candidate and a party that have spent the last two days <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/aug/29/they-built-that-republicans-big-lie\">decrying the role of government in the private sector</a>. It's an even more amazing when you consider that Ryan's running-mate opposed the auto bailout and even penned an op-ed titled \"Let Detroit Go Bankrupt.\"</p> <p>Ryan then quickly pivoted to the stimulus, which he described as \"a case of political patronage, corporate welfare, and cronyism at their worst \u2026 What did the taxpayers get out of the Obama stimulus? More debt. That money wasn't just spent and wasted \u2013 it was borrowed, spent, and wasted.\"</p> <p>As <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/aug/27/why-obama-should-run-success-stimulus\">I wrote about a few days ago here</a>, what the stimulus did provide taxpayers with was 2.5m jobs and an economic boost out of the worst downturn since the Great Depression. This is not to mention all the long-term investments in healthcare, transportation, infrastructure and energy innovation. To argue that the stimulus was <em>wasted</em> is just a breathtaking bit of dishonesty.</p> <p>Then came Ryan's attack on Medicare. He lied about Obama taking money out of the program to pay for Obamacare. He lied about the fact that <em>his</em> budget has the exact same $716bn in cuts for which he attacked Obama. He vowed to protect and strengthen Medicare and honor its promise \u2013 even though his budget would end Medicare's federal guarantee and turn government-supported seniors' healthcare into a voucher program.</p> <p>And perhaps most amazingly, Ryan criticized Obama for creating a bipartisan debt commission and ignoring its recommendations \u2013 recommendations that Ryan voted against <em>as a member of the commission</em>.</p> <p>I could go on. The GOP has done more than create an <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/aug/29/they-built-that-republicans-big-lie\">alternate reality</a>; they have built it on a host of political lies, misstatements and untruths. Ryan's speech was a good example of just how far the GOP has strayed from the truth \u2013 and of how debased our political discourse has become.</p> <p><em>Michael Cohen is a US political columnist for the Observer and Guardian</em></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/jim-geraghty\">Jim Geraghty</a>: 'The bar is set extremely high for Romney this Thursday night'</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395422723\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Global/content/icons/2012/1/11/1326298456752/jimgeraghty_140x140.jpg\" alt=\"Jim Geraghty\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>It was a strangely imbalanced night in terms of quality: the early speakers were barely noticed by the conventioneers \u2013 even John McCain, who had some strong critiques of Obama's foreign policy \u2013 and worsened with a speech by near-veep Senator Rob Portman of Ohio (utterly forgettable) and other near-veep Tim Pawlenty (a seemingly endless stream of bad jokes, landing with one THUD after another). About halfway into Governor Mike Huckabee's remarks, it looked like the evening would be a cavalcade of bad-to-mediocre speeches, wondering if we needed even a third night to this abbreviated convention.</p> <p>And then Huckabee got better, with some funny lines and some warm lines \u2013 best was, \"I care less about where Mitt Romney goes to church than where he's going to take this country.\" But the unexpected grand slam was Condi Rice, who at first appeared to be speaking to check a few boxes: foreign policy speech, check; acknowledgement of the Bush administration, check. Instead, Rice offered perhaps the best speech on the country's problems since Lehman collapsed in late 2008, an acknowledgement that the country had stumbled badly and been bruised but was more than capable of picking itself back up and returning to greatness. It was a speech with vision, and the best of the convention.</p> <p>So, the bar was set high for Paul Ryan; yet he cleared it \u2013 with a distinctly different, personable, more intimate style. He started out shaky, but watchers observed that the turning point was discussing his mother \u2013 and then he seemed to relax, and recognize that he knew the story he wanted to tell. Some funny lines will stay with us \u2013 the fading Obama poster on the unemployed grad's childhood bedroom wall \u2013 and I suspect all of the \"granny-killing extremist\" charges are going to have a much tougher time sticking, because Ryan seems so normal: even-keeled and warm and pleasant.</p> <p>Wednesday night left two thoughts: one, the bar is set extremely high for Romney this Thursday night (remember, he's being introduced by Senator Marco Rubio, another one of the GOP's best speakers); and then \u2026 how do Democrats respond to this? Can they go negative and focus on tax returns and contraception and some Seamus jokes after the Republican message has been so focused, realistic, optimistic and bold?</p> <p><em>Jim Geraghty is a contributing editor to the National Review</em></p>",
  "<p>It was supposed to be Paul Ryan's night. The lineup of speakers was studded with the vice-presidential B listers from both Mitt Romney's first draft picks and the political writers' imaginations: Rob Portman, Tim Pawlenty, Condoleezza Rice, Susan Martinez, John Thune, Mike Huckabee.</p> <p>A major theme of the remarks was the disparagement of liberals' supposed desire to soothe feelings at all costs; Huckabee mocked the new-age parenting cliche of \"giving everyone a trophy for showing up\", but that is also a pretty apt description of how the night's slots seemed to be filled. One speaker actually won a prize for the night \u2013 unfortunately for the Romney campaign, it wasn't Paul Ryan. Former secretary of state Condoleezza Rice walked off the stage in a mist of wistfulness and applause as her passionate and positive message brought the convention to its feet and generated its first taste of unrehearsed, unexpected excitement.</p> <p>Paul Ryan gave a speech as well, and it delivered hormone-injected red meat to a hungry crowd, but it didn't show anyone anything new: In fact, he has been trotting out pieces of it to the stump ever since he accepted the position. The conventional wisdom always had it that Romney would select a \"boring white guy\", and, indeed, the men intended to warm up the stage for Ryan were warm-up speakers almost solely in the sense that their body temperatures may have heated the air around them. The reception they got was lukewarm.</p> <p>Huckabee, Pawlenty, Thune and Portman performed the same basic set of jokes and asserted the same slogans with such uniformity it was hard not imagine them as a single blurry white guy with an intermittent Southern accent, referencing Obama's lack of business experience, Romney revealing humble but generic origins.</p> <p>Again, there may have been a point to this homogeneity. By the time Huckabee got to his eighth recitation of the convention's slogan \u2013 \"We can do better!\" \u2013 one hoped that it was a more immediate assurance than a reference to whatever it is a Romney administration might plan. Sure enough, in the short term, the promise was fulfilled, spectacularly, by Rice.</p> <p>I cannot argue that her speech changed my mind about any of the policies she presented. She was an architect of Bush's pointless, tragic war in Iraq. The speech itself rolled out threats of further expansions in the conveniently ill-defined war on terror. Her economic and energy arguments were vague heralds of free market wish-fulfillment. But with the bar set low enough for Ryan to rise above it, Rice's rhetoric practically soared.</p> <p>Rice used the lens of her own unarguably audacious rise from a child in the deep south to focus on the kinds of ideas that inspire things besides rage. Whereas the generic humble beginnings narratives of the boring white guys filled in blanks, Rice filled hearts. Ironically, she articulated the vision of America that makes Romney's biography so discomforting. She said:</p> <blockquote> \"The essence of America \u2013 that which really unites us \u2013 is not ethnicity, or nationality or religion \u2013 it is an idea \u2013 and what an idea it is: that you can come from humble circumstances and do great things. That it doesn't matter where you came from but where you are going.\" </blockquote> <p>Rice ended \"on a personal note\" to reference \"a little girl grows up in Jim Crow Birmingham\" whose \"parents can't take her to a movie theatre or a restaurant\" but who make \"make her believe that even though she can't have a hamburger at the Woolworth's lunch counter, she can be president of the United States and she becomes the secretary of state\". The part about being in the cabinet and not the Oval Office sounds tacked on, but maybe I'm overly optimistic. But I'm not the only one with such a vision. After Rice spoke, Fox News confirmed that she delivered the speech without a prompter. For them, that is akin to printing \"CONDI 2016\" bumperstickers.</p> <p>Her speech suggested the kind of Republican who would truly \"raise the conversation\", and if it seems like settling to want an opposition party to simply not be so utterly vindictive, well, yes, I will settle for that. It might even mean that the Democrats would ratchet down their spite as well.</p> <p>Ryan's speech did not immediately follow Rice's \u2013 lucky for him. Susana Martinez, the governor of New Mexico, spoke after the secretary and in the context of Rice's ovation she did as well as one could possibly ask. That her first big applause line was for merely owning a gun did suggest that the convention was settling back in to its more familiar mode.</p> <p>Ryan picked up where the cliches before had left off. He only developed real energy as he tore his teeth into Obama, doing so with such delight that some <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2012/08/30/paul_ryans_brazen_lies/\" title=\"\">facts got mangled along the way</a>. There was the familiar lie about Obama's \"raiding\" of Medicare, and a repetition of the accusation that Obama \"closed\" a GM plant in Wisconsin in 2008 before he became president.</p> <p>Ryan's feistiness was probably the right note to end on. Whatever \"We can do better\" is supposed to mean, it's always best to keep focused on executing the next step ahead. For Romney and Ryan, that means ginning up as much antipathy for Obama as possible without making Americans feel stupid for voting for him in the first place. His image of \"college graduates \u2026 staring up at fading Obama posters and wondering when they can move out and get going with life\" is the kind of poignant conjecture that definitely sounds true.</p> <p>Ryan's fresh face and charm allow him to deliver the same old indictments in a way that makes them look like the revelations of someone who only just now realised they'd made a mistake. As a friend who has been disillusioned with Obama for some time now put it, \"He's the Boy Scout with a knife.\" Whether you're frightened or excited by that image tells you something about how you will respond to the Republicans' message on election day.</p>",

One image that resonated with the tens of thousands crowded into the convention centre was when Ryan spoke about students. \"College graduates should not have to live out their 20s in their childhood bedrooms, staring up at fading Obama posters and wondering when they can move out and get going with life,\" he said.</p> <p>\"Everyone who feels stuck in the Obama economy is right to focus on the here and now. And I hope you understand this too, if you're feeling left out or passed by: you have not failed, your leaders have failed you.\"</p> <p>The immediate reaction from senior Republicans, however, was positive. \"He did all he had to do. He introduced himself personally to the American people,\" said the former House Speaker and one-time Romney rival Newt Gingrich.</p> <p>Gingrich told the Guardian: \"Paul Ryan knows more than Joe Biden has remembered or confused.\" Addressing concern about his lack of experience, Gingrich pointed out that Ryan, 42, is only four years younger than Obama was when elected to the presidency and already has much more political experience than the then Democratic candidate.</p> <p>Ryan's was a measured speech that began nervously but got stronger as it progressed. He had two difficult acts to follow after former secretary of state Condoleezza Rice and the governor of New Mexico, Susana Martinez, delivered powerful addresses.</p> <p>He couched his speech in moral terms. \"We have responsibilities, one to another \u2013 we do not each face the world alone. And the greatest of all responsibilities is that of the strong to protect the weak. The truest measure of any society is how it treats those who cannot defend or care for themselves,\" he said.</p> <p>He added: \"Our rights come from nature and God, not from government.\"</p> <p>The focus now shifts to Romney, who now has to deliver the speech of his life to the convention, one that could determine whether he or Obama will be the next president. He has to win over not only conservatives at the convention, to ensure they turn out as volunteers and on election day, but more importantly an estimated television audience of more than 30 million.</p> <p>The convention in the early evening had been flat, lacking in energy, with delegates milling around, not listening to the speakers.</p> <p>Rice fired them up, accusing Obama of leading from the back in foreign policy. She brought the convention to its feet again towards the end of her speech when she spoke about how a girl who had been banned under the Jim Crow laws from eating a hamburger in her local Woolworth's store in her hometown, Alabama, and rose to become secretary of state.</p> <p>There was a brief protest when a small group of women unfurled a banner saying \"Vagina\", making their point about Republican policies on abortion and other issues related to women. To shouts of \"USA, USA\" from the delegates they left the hall.</p> <p>The divisions and tensions in the Republican party were exposed again when hundreds of supporters of the libertarian Texas Congressman Ron Paul \u2013 who accumulated a lot of delegates during his bid for the presidential nomination \u2013 walked out over rules changes they see as limiting grassroots rights.</p>",
  "<p>Ron Paul delegates at the Republican national convention in Tampa struck a note of noisy dissent for the second night running on Wednesday throwing another spanner in the party leadership's desire for a smooth trouble-free event.</p> <p>Though the convention has nominated former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney as its presidential candidate for 2012, an angry dispute with supporters of the libertarian-leaning Paul has repeatedly flared up.</p> <p>In the months leading up to the convention the Texan congressman's defeated presidential campaign ran a \"delegate strategy\" to exploit arcane party rules and bring as many supporters to Tampa as possible. However, the attempt was largely stymied by party officials and Romney-backed lawyers, leaving many Paul supporters angry. </p> <p>Rule changes pushed through for the 2016 nomination process \u2013 and aimed at preventing a repeat of the Paul delegate strategy \u2013 have also left many Paul backers and other conservative activists embittered. </p> <p>As the convention prepared to listen to Romney's running mate Paul Ryan speak, a group of Maine delegates walked out of the convention hall in protest at their treatment. Shouting \"Ron Paul! Ron Paul!\" they marched through the convention hall, engaging in fierce arguments with Romney supporters. </p> <p>Video of the moment quickly circulated on Twitter and showed Paul backers and Romney fans trying to drown each other out with chants. Some Paul fans shouted \"This convention is a farce\" and \"Shame on them.\" Others sang: \"As Maine goes, so goes the nation.\"</p> <p>Though the fight over Paul's supporters is a sideshow that has little real impact on the Romney team, it is no doubt an unwelcome distraction as the campaign seeks to present a united party to the nation and paint Romney as a sympathetic, warm president-in-waiting.</p> <p>It also does not seem to be a dispute that will settle down. Before the convention began Paul supporters held numerous events, including a mass rally at the Sun Dome sports arena. Ever since then Paul supporters have dotted downtown Tampa on each day of the convention wielding Paul campaign posters. Many of them, including some convention delegates, openly talk of not planning to vote for Romney in the coming November election.</p> <p>Ironically the latest protest came as the convention actually paid a video tribute to Paul, who is now retiring after 12 terms in Congress and several unsuccessful runs for the White House. The video paid tribute to Paul's hard-line fiscal conservatism but made no mention of his foreign policy, which is focused on bringing American troops home from abroad and closing foreign bases. </p> <p>It was then followed by a speech from Kentucky senator Rand Paul, who unlike his father, has publicly endorsed Romney. Paul is widely seen as a possible presidential candidate, following in his father's footsteps and sharing many of his views. When Paul spoke at the Sun Dome rally he was greeted with cries of \"Paul 16!\" referring to the 2016 race. However, Paul played by the rules in his convention speech and endorsed Romney. </p> <p>But his speech also struck many of the key points that Ron Paul runs on, including advocating military spending cuts that are usually anathema to Republican audiences. He also spoke about the risks of losing vital civil liberties in the name of fighting terrorism: another favourite topic for his father. </p> <p>\"We must never ever trade our liberty for any fleeting promise of security,\" Rand Paul said.</p>"

  "<p>Barack Obama referred to the death of four Americans in the attack on the US consulate in Benghazi as \"not optimal\" during a taping of the Daily Show, according to the White House pool report.</p> <p>The fallout from the tragic events in Libya, which saw US ambassador Christopher Stevens killed, is already a major campaign theme as Republicans have sought to portray the Obama team as covering up a terrorist attack by blaming the incident on a local mob incited by an anti-Islamic video.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Democrats have accused Republicans of seeking to politicise the deaths of the four Americans and score points in the presidential election. During Tuesday's debate, Obama and Republican challenger Mitt Romney verbally sparred over the issue in heated exchanges eventually causing the debate moderator, Candy Crowley, to try and step in.</p> <p>Obama used the phrase \"not optimal\" \u2013 which some conservatives quickly sought to portray as a major gaffe \u2013 after Stewart asked about the White House's apparent confusion as to what happened in Libya and who was behind the attack. \"I would say, even you would admit, it was not the optimal response, at least to the American people, as far as all of us being on the same page,\" Stewart said to the president.</p> <p>In response, Obama said: \"Every piece of information that we get, as we got it, we laid it out to the American people. The picture gets fully filled in.\" He then added: \"Here's what I'll say: when four Americans get killed, it's not optimal. We're going to fix it. All of it.\"</p> <p>Obama has been a frequent visitor on the Daily Show. This last taping was his sixth visit overall since 2005 and his second since taking office as president.</p> <p>During the interview, Stewart's questions ranged over his usual terrain of the trivial and the funny to serious policy issues. Obama admitted that he had an \"off night\" during the first presidential debate in Denver, when he turned in a performance that was widely panned, including by Stewart on his show.</p> <p>He also said that he still wanted to close the controversial prison camp at Guant\u00e1namo Bay: a 2008 campaign promise that remains unfulfilled. \"I still want to close Guant\u00e1namo. We haven't been able to get that through Congress \u2026 one of the things we have to do is put a legal architecture in place, and we need congressional help to do that,\" he said. On a lighter note, Obama also joked with Stewart about the steamy literary hit Fifty Shades of Gray.</p> <p>Stewart also told the president that he was was making a campaign scrapbook, and showed Obama two photographs from the debate. One showed first lady Michelle Obama looking at him angrily onstage after a debate, and the other showed her smiling broadly at him afterward. \"Do you know which debate was which?\" Stewart asked. \"Cute. Cute, Jon,\" Obama replied.</p>",

Not just what happened in Benghazi, but what happened within. Because I would say, even you would admit, it was not the optimal response, at least to the American people, as far as all of us being on the same page.</p> <p><strong>Obama</strong>: Here\u2019s what I\u2019ll say. When four Americans get killed, it\u2019s not optimal. We\u2019re going to fix it. All of it. The government is a big operation and any given time something screws up. And you make sure that you find out what\u2019s broken and you fix it. Whatever else I have done throughout the course of my presidency the one thing that I\u2019ve been absolutely clear about is that America\u2019s security comes, and the American people need to know exactly how I make decisions when it comes to war, peace, security, and protecting Americans.

The Constitution gives each state delegation to the U.S. House one vote, meaning a small state such as Idaho has vastly more proportional clout than a big state like California.

  "<p>A freshly aired audio recording in which Mitt Romney asks business owners to talk with employees about the upcoming election sounds at first like a throwback to the bad old days of voter clientelism. That's the term academics use for the time-honored American practice of trading something nice for political support.</p> <p>Voters used to be able to get a shot of whiskey or a pair of boots. Now, in the era of expanding corporate rights, you might just get a half-promise not to be fired \u2013 as long as you vote the right way.</p> <p>Romney was speaking on a conference call that was sponsored by the <a href=\"http://www.nfib.com/advocacy/item?cmsid=58241\">National Federation of Independent Businesses</a>, as part of a series that had previously featured Newt Gingrich, Rick Perry and Michele Bachmann. He had been talking about why Barack Obama is bad for business. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuMHuVlIW0&amp;feature=player_embedded#t=26m44s\">Then he encouraged employers to \"make it very clear to your employees\" how they feel about the presidential race</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I hope you make it very clear to your employees what you believe is in the best interest of your enterprise and therefore their job and their future in the upcoming elections. And whether you agree with me or you agree with President Obama, or whatever your political view, I hope \u2014 I hope you pass those along to your employees. Nothing illegal about you talking to your employees about what you believe is best for the business, because I think that will figure into their election decision, their voting decision and of course doing that with your family and your kids as well.</p> </blockquote> <p>The recording, which was first spied by <a href=\"http://www.inthesetimes.com/article/14017/koch_industries_sends_45000_employees_pro_romney_mailing/\">In These Times</a>, has generated consternation on the left. It came to light in the same week that Mike Elk of In These Times reported that <a href=\"http://www.inthesetimes.com/Koch/KOCH1.pdf\">the Koch brothers, David and Charles, had sent 45,000 employees packets containing actual lists of candidates supported by Koch Industries</a>. At the top of the list of approved candidates was Mitt Romney.</p> <p>Is it legal to do this? On the conference call, Romney went out of his way to say that it is, when he said: \"Nothing illegal about you talking to your employees...\" </p> <p>Romney has drawn a similar distinction in describing his strategy for paying taxes, saying: \"I pay all the taxes that are legally required and not a dollar more.\" In Romneyland, legal compliance is a lofty moral paradigm.</p> <p>Romney also happens to be right: bosses can talk to employees about whom to vote for. Corporations can send political mailings to employees. And since the 2010 Citizens United Supreme Court decision, corporations appear to have new freedom to force employees to attend political events like the Romney rally in Beallsville, Ohio, <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0912/81421.html\">in which coal miners were forced to appear as campaign props</a>.</p> <p>Citizen United's generous interpretation of corporate speech means that employers \"may now be able to compel their employees to listen to their political views at [workplace] meetings on pain of termination,\" <a href=\"http://yalelawjournal.org/the-yale-law-journal-pocket-part/volume-120/addressing-political-captive-audience-workplace-meetings-in-the-post%11citizens-united-environment/\">wrote Paul Secunda, an associate law professor at Marquette University, in the Yale Law Journal</a>. \"Although federal law does still prevent employers from issuing explicit or implicit threats against employees who vote for the 'wrong' candidate, short of that, nothing prohibits employers from requiring employees to participate in one-sided political propaganda events.\"</p> <p>Employees have little real-life protection from aggressive attempts by employers to sway their votes, Secunda said in a phone interview Thursday.</p> <p>\"Workers are facing a constant stream of political pressure, 16 hours a day, a stream of literature,\" he said. \"This stuff has always taken place, especially in the blue-collar workplace. It's generally legal.\"</p> <p>The federal voter intimidation statute, which makes it illegal to \"intimidate, threaten, or coerce\" voters, is rarely called on to protect workers, he said.</p> <p>\"The devil's in the details,\" Secunda said. \"What does it mean to 'intimidate' as far as preventing the right to vote? An express type of threat? Some of these more implicit types of power dynamics don't explicitly meet this high standard.\"</p> <p>Some states have their own voter intimidation laws, Secunda said, but a paucity of relevant case law indicates a low level of enforcement.</p> <p>\"Employers are pretty much able to do what they want as far as putting pressure on employees to vote against a certain candidate,\" he said.</p> <p>Secunda said a new \"Federal Worker Freedom Act\" was needed, to prohibit employers from engaging in mandatory political indoctrination. A new law could comply with Citizen United's broad interpretation of corporate speech, he said.</p> <p>\"The focus is not on employers' speech,\" Secunda said. \"You can't interfere with that. The focus would be on regulating employer conduct.\"</p>",
  "<p>The president, Hamid Karzai, has said he will not accept foreigners on a key election watchdog, a move that risks undermining the credibility of a presidential poll in 2014.</p> <p>Karzai also said Afghans would not be willing to grant foreign troops immunity from prosecution while the country was at war, a position that could jeopardise plans for a long-term foreign military presence in the country.</p> <p>\"The presence of foreigners in the Electoral Complaints Commission [ECC] is against the sovereignty of Afghanistan,\" Karzai said at a news conference in Kabul with the visiting Nato chief, Anders Fogh Rasmussen, according to Reuters.</p> <p>The 2014 election coincides with the departure of Nato-led troops from Afghanistan, and is expected to lay the foundation for the country's future without the coalition or Karzai, who has ruled for a decade and cannot stand for the top office again under Afghan law.</p> <p>There are already concerns about the potential for fraud, after widespread corruption marred votes in 2009 and 2010. Rights groups warned that the ECC would be weakened by the loss of members best able to ignore internal political pressure.</p> <p>\"In the 2009-2010 elections the ECC was the only entity that was involved in the whole process who came out looking good \u2026 and that seemed to be due in no small part to the fact that they had internationals involved who didn't have a dog in the fight,\" said Heather Barr, Afghanistan researcher for Human Rights Watch. \"So it's really concerning to see that particular institution changed and possibly made less immune to external influence in the runup to what is going to be a very critical election.\"</p> <p>Karzai's spokesman Aimal Faizi said foreigners were still welcome as election monitors, but that the Afghan government was able to ensure the poll was fair.</p> <p>Rasmussen and Karzai also discussed a role for foreign troops after 2014. \"This will not be a combat mission. It will focus on training, advice and assistance. And we are actively planning for that mission\", Rasmussen said.</p> <p>The US and Afghanistan are involved in sensitive negotiations about the shape of a long-term military presence, expected to lay the groundwork for similar deals with other Nato countries. The most challenging detail is expected to be the legal status of US forces; the Iraqi government's refusal to grant immunity precipitated the final pullout of US troops there last year. Karzai said Afghans would not tolerate such protections either, unless the country became more secure.</p> <p>\"If Afghanistan is stable and peaceful, the Afghan people will not have much problem with immunity but if Afghanistan is not peaceful or continues to be in a state of war, the Afghan people will not see the benefit of partnership for them,\" Faizi said. \"Once they have security and peace they will agree with the issue of immunity and it will be easier for the president to go to the people and ask for immunity.\" <strong> </strong></p>",
  "<p>Americans for Prosperity, the Tea Party-aligned group part-funded by the billionaire Koch brothers, is building a state-of-the-art digital ground operation in Ohio and other vital battleground states to spread its anti-Obama message to voters who could decide the outcome of the presidential election.</p> <p>The group hopes that by creating a local army of activists equipped with sophisticated online micro-targeting tools it will increase its impact on moderate voters, nudging them towards a staunchly conservative position opposed to President Obama's economic and healthcare policies. Americans for Prosperity (AFP) is spending tens of millions of dollars developing its local strategy, already employing more than 200 permanent staff in 32 states.</p> <p>Classified a non-profit \"social welfare\" organisation, AFP is legally obliged to project itself as a non-partisan campaign that neither endorses nor opposes candidates for public office. But there is no disguising its targets, nor their political nature.</p> <p>In Ohio, volunteers are given a script which they follow when engaging voters. \"President Obama took office three years ago and promised to fix our economy,\" they say, \"yet unemployment is still high and our debt is up to $6tn.\"</p> <p>AFP has already spent $30m so far this election cycle in opposing President Obama and other prominent Democratic candidates and their policies. It says it aims to reach up to 9 million targeted voters in crucial swing states, through the efforts of its 2 million activists.</p> <p>But it is ambitions do not stop on election day on 6 November. \"The goal is to build a long-term grassroots infrastructure,\" its president, Tim Phillips, told the Guardian. \"We are not some election-year group desperately trying to ramp up attention \u2013 we are in this year-in year-out to make a difference in favour of economic freedom.\"</p> <p>AFP's growing influence is highly visible in Ohio, one of the most crucial battleground states upon which November's outcome depends. It now has 80 paid staff operating in the state out of seven permanent offices.</p> <p>Volunteers are empowered with mobile canvassing technology that directs them to the households that are most likely to be influenced by AFP's message of small government and tax cuts through software built on to handheld tablet computers. They are also equipped with the latest phone banking technology through which they have made 400,000 calls to Ohio's voters since May.</p> <p>AFP's funding status allows it to raise unlimited sums from undisclosed sources, among them David and Charles Koch, brothers whose oil, coal and plastics businesses have earned them personal wealth of $25bn each. David Koch is president of the organisation's foundation.</p> <p><a href=\"http://mediaproject.wesleyan.edu/2012/09/12/convention-or-ad-bounce/\">Research by the independent Wesleyan Media Project</a> has found that AFP is spending an astonishing $6m every two weeks on TV advertising that favours Mitt Romney's presidential candidacy. That pays for more than 7,000 TV ads to be served in the battleground states and outguns even Romney's own spending on political adverts.</p> <p>With the presidential race tightening across the country in the wake of Obama's widely denounced performance in the first TV debate earlier this month, all eyes have turned to Ohio, which Romney must win if he is to have a fighting chance of taking the White House. No Republican candidate in history has won the presidency without bagging Ohio's electoral college votes that today stand at 18 out of the 270 needed for victory.</p> <p>Polls vary widely in Ohio, making predictions difficult. But the latest tracking survey by Real Clear Politics has Obama two points ahead of Romney \u2013 a statistical tie.</p> <p>AFP is also waging an aggressive campaign against Sherrod Brown, the Democratic senator for Ohio, under the rubric: \"Has Brown worked for you?\" It has a fleet of vans bearing the senator's picture with the logo: \"Obama's rubber stamp for failure.\"</p> <p>Leading figures within the Ohio Democratic party have been watching the activities of AFP and other outlying conservative groups with mounting alarm. Ted Strickland, the former Democratic governor of Ohio, told the Guardian that in his view the activities of such groups had the capacity \"to move us from a democracy to an oligarchy where a handful of wealthy people use their money to try to control the political process\".</p> <p>Strickland said that Brown's struggle to get re-elected was a \"clear example of the corrosive influence of outside money. He should be 20 points ahead were it not for a massive amount of negative advertising coming from billionaires trying to buy a senate seat\".</p> <p>(Recent polls have put Brown and his Republican challenger, Josh Mandel, neck and neck, though the latest survey from the Columbus Dispatch shows the incumbent pulling ahead.)</p> <p>AFP's ground operation in Ohio and other states is built around an interactive online network that links its volunteers with a centralised database of information on millions of American voters. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/nov/07/koch-brothers-database-2012-election\">The database, called Themis after the Greek god of wisdom</a>, was created with the help of seed money from the Kochs.</p> <p>The database draws information on voters from a range of public and commercial sources to create a profile of their likely political behaviour. What you buy on Amazon; the magazines your subscribe to; your friends on Facebook; your age, neighbourhood, occupation and house value; what petitions you have signed; what church you belong to; whether or not you own a gun \u2013 all such data points and many more go towards the creation of your personal, albeit anonymous, voter file.</p> <p>That, in turn, allows AFP activists to micro-target households with a level of precision that could only be dreamed about in previous generations. \"This is an exponential leap forward for our side \u2013 with Themis as our crucial partner, we are able to leverage our dollars and refine our message,\" Phillips said.</p> <p>Much media attention has been paid this election cycle to the avalanche of billionaires' money, including that of the Koch brothers, that has been spent on negative TV adverts. But in the longer term, the creation of this local lattice of activists able to identify key voters through online micro-targeting could prove to be a far more effective political weapon.</p> <p>In AFP's case, its interactive database serves up what the group calls an \"affinity score\" for each voter. He or she is awarded a number from 0 to 1. Those registering 0 on the scale being so leftwing and pro-government in outlook that, from the organisation's perspective, they are not worth bothering with.</p> <p>Those showing a 1 are equally worth bypassing because they are already so in favour of tax and spending cuts that to talk to them would be preaching to the converted. The technology is interactive, so that if a volunteer discovers that the affinity score of a voter on the doorstep is inaccurate \u2013 he or she is found to be more or less fiscally conservative than the rating suggests \u2013 it can be instantly corrected. The information is sent back at the push of a button to Themis, which is thus constantly updated and improved.</p> <p>The target group for AFP are those voters who fall between 0.4 and 0.6 on the affinity score \u2013 those moderate voters deemed by its digital planners to be \"persuadables\". \"Our goal is to get everybody into the 0.7 to 1 zone. We want to move the center towards economic freedom, to drive the debate through word-of-mouth marketing,\" says Matt Seaholm, the national field director of AFP.</p> <p>He added that in his view it was working; that AFP were driving the debate to the right. \"Cap-in-trade is now a dirty word. Stimulus is now a dirty word. Debt and spending are at the forefront. These were things that were not talked about in the past.\"</p> <p>AFP began testing its new micro-targeting gadgetry in Wisconsin last year, where it used the technology to energise its 120,000 activists in a succession of volatile recall elections. The group's efforts were one factor behind the survival of the Tea Party-backed governor, Scott Walker, in his recall vote this June.</p> <p>Phillips rejects the argument that AFP and other conservative outside groups are having a pernicious impact on the democratic process. \"We are proud to have the support of the Kochs. They have every right to be involved in the political process \u2013 they have been steadfast in this area for four decades.\"</p> <p>He added that for Obama and other Democrats to complain about corporate money entering politics was \"hypocrisy at its greatest. It's laughable, and most Americans know it. Obama receives tens of millions from Hollywood and the entertainment industry \u2013 so that is good money, and other money is bad?\"</p>",

And in a perfect world, I'd get to join the group whenever I wanted.\"</p> <p>Fifteen years later, the show has spawned dozens of imitations around the world \u2013 Loose Women is its British incarnation. For presidential candidates (and their wives) who want to appeal to undecided women in swing states, it has become as essential a stop on the campaign trail as small-town diners in Iowa or Ohio. Last month's joint visit by Barack and Michelle Obama garnered a whopping 4.3 million viewers.</p> <p>This election year, the political segment is called Red, White and View. On Thursday it was Ann Romney's turn to take her place on the blue couch. She was supposed to be accompanied by her husband, Republican presidential candidate Mitt, <a href=\"http://nymag.com/daily/intel/2012/10/mitt-romney-cancels-on-the-view.html\">but he cancelled his appearance earlier this week</a>. (A decision that presumably looked pretty smart after his <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/oct/17/binders-full-women-reconsider-voting-mitt-romney\">\"binders full of women\" remark during Tuesday's second presidential debate</a> spawned such derision).</p> <p>Romney came out wearing her signature scarlet dress, to standing applause, and sat on the center of the couch, to be confronted immediately by Walters. [Mitt] said he didn't want to come on with us \"because we are high risk and we are sharp tongued,\" she said.</p> <p>\"He said sharp and <em>young</em>,\" countered Mrs Romney, smiling brightly. Score one to her.</p> <p>Without missing a beat, Walters moved on to Romney's shifting position on abortion. \"I wonder what your views are,\" she asked.</p> <p>\"The good news is I'm not running for office and I don't have to say what I feel,\" said Mrs Romney, sunnily. Score two.</p> <p>\"Mitt has always been a pro-life person,\" she added, explaining that her husband was against embryo research. \"This is an issue that is so tender. The most important thing we can do is have respect for each other.\"</p> <p>Then she went in for the kill. The difference between what women were talking about when Romney campaigned four years ago and now was \"heart-breaking, Barbara. This year what I hear... 90, I would say 95% of what I hear is, 'Help, please help'.\"</p> <p>\"Economic help, you mean,\" offered Walters.</p> <p>\"Absolutely,\" said Mrs Romney, with all the conviction provided by her uncheckable number. Score three.</p> <p>Whoopi Goldberg tried to have a go at the fact that Mitt Romney did not serve in Vietnam because he was on a Mormon mission, but she got her facts mixed up and the fumble gave Mrs Romney the opportunity to point out that although neither her sons nor her husband had served in the military, they had all served on church missions; she added that one of her sons is a doctor who treats military veterans. Cue loving applause from the audience.</p> <p>Score four.</p> <p>After another commercial, Elisabeth Hasselbeck, whose professional credentials consist of being a 2001 contestant on Survivor and marrying the American footballer Tim Hasselbeck, turned to Mrs Romney and asked if there had been a moment when she and Mitt had almost broken up.</p> <p>\"Well, not according to him,\" was the smiling reply.</p> <p>However, she said, early on in the relationship, when he was on his mission and they were apart for three and a half years, she dated a lot and came close to breaking his heart.</p> <p>The questions were getting softer and softer.</p> <p>In the early days of The View, the show was the perfect forum for political debate. But the host lineup has changed dramatically \u2013 gone are the empathetic Meredith Vieira and the colorful Star Jones. In are Goldberg and the token conservative, Hasselbeck. Walters, older and less with it, drifts in and out. The intelligence has been diluted and the shoutiness amplified. More often than not, the hour of The View resembles a Real Housewives reunion without the moderator.</p> <p>Mrs Romney's appearance finished against a vast photo of Ann and Mitt, all the kids and the 18 grandkids. The picture was of an all-American family who make dinner, clean up and share the household chores when together. Yes, all of that takes place at the family's \"Lake House\", but no-one bothered to comment on that. There was no mention of binders of women, either.</p> <p>The Romney segment closed with the ladies of The View slumped against the couch while their guest remained perky and upright.</p> <p>'You are a wonderful advocate for your husband,\" Walters had said.</p> <p>She got that right.</p>",
  "<p>Kang Il-chul was 16 when Japanese military police arrived at her home in South Korea and told her she was being conscripted. The year was 1943, and her country was just two years away from liberation after 35 years of brutal Japanese colonial rule.</p> <p>Kang spent the remainder of the war in occupied China, as one of tens of thousands of Asian women forced to have sex with Japanese soldiers in frontline, makeshift brothels. \"I was put in a tiny room and made to sleep with about 10 to 20 soldiers a day,\" says Kang, pausing to display the scars on her head \u2013 the result of frequent beatings by the military police. \"I was punched and beaten so much that my body was covered in bruises. I still get headaches.\"</p> <p>Almost 70 years after Japan's defeat, the treatment of such \"comfort women\" still haunts its relations with South Korea as the region, embroiled in long-standing territorial disputes, once again confronts the legacy of Japanese militarism. Lingering resentment over atrocities committed during the second world war \u2013 and the perception that Japan has failed to show enough remorse for its actions \u2013 help explain the periodical outbreaks of anti-Japanese rage in the region, and the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/18/japanese-mps-war-shrine-china-korea\" title=\"\">angry reactions to high-profile visits to Yasukuni, the controversial war shrine in Tokyo</a>.</p> <p>\"Historical grievances in Korea do not depend on who is in charge in Japan,\" says Jeff Kingston, director of Asian studies at Temple University in Tokyo. \"They simmer on and on until every once in a while they boil over. Tokyo is living in a dream world if it believes that these matters are resolved and not worth addressing,\" he said.</p> <p>Earlier this week, South Korea repeated its demand that Japan acknowledge its use of former sex slaves and compensate them. \"Japan's legal responsibility has not been settled,\" the country's deputy chief envoy to the UN, Shin Dong-ik, told a UN committee. \"Those acts were a crime against humanity.\"</p> <p>Those grievances came to the fore again recently when <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/10/south-korea-japan-disputed-islands\" title=\"\">South Korea's president, Lee Myung-bak, made a politically charged trip</a> to Dokdo \u2013 a pair of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/aug/18/japan-south-korea-disputed-islands\" title=\"\">remote, rocky islands also claimed by Japan</a>, where they are known as Takeshima. The visit was not just intended to demonstrate his country's de facto control over the territory. Lee linked his visit to Tokyo's failure to apologise for the use of sex slaves, and challenged Japan's emperor, Akihito, to issue a mea culpa on the country's behalf.</p> <p>Japan retaliated last week by deciding <a href=\"http://uk.reuters.com/article/2012/10/09/uk-korea-japan-swap-idUKBRE89805W20121009\" title=\"\">not to renew a $57bn (\u00a335.5bn) currency swap with South Korea</a> \u2013 a measure designed to protect both countries against financial crisis \u2013 although officials in Seoul and Tokyo said the decision was made on economic grounds and the territorial dispute was not a factor.</p> <p>Lee's remarks were in part a vote-winning exercise for his conservative Saenuri party <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jul/10/park-geun-hye-korean-president\" title=\"\">before December's presidential election</a>, but also proof that wartime history still weighs heavily on the South Korean national psyche \u2013 and finds voice in an enduring suspicion of Japan.</p> <p>There is disagreement on the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/jun/14/worlddispatch.secondworldwar\" title=\"\">exact number of women forced into prostitution by Japan</a>. Campaigners believe between 50,000 and 200,000 women \u2013 mostly Koreans, but also Chinese, south-east Asians and a small number of Japanese and Europeans \u2013 were forced or tricked into working in military brothels between 1932 and 1945.</p> <p>Fearing ostracism in their own countries, most took their secret to the grave. But in 1991, Kim Hak-soon, a South Korean, became the first to testify about her wartime forced prostitution experiences in public. \"We must record these sins that were forced upon us,\" she said.</p> <p>Since then, more than 230 women have identified themselves as former sex slaves. Only about 60 are still alive. Eight, including Kang, live at the <a href=\"http://www.nanum.org/eng\" title=\"\">House of Sharing,</a> a facility that opened in 1992 in the hills south of Seoul.</p> <p>The women, most of whom are in their 80s and 90s, say they have yet to receive an official apology or compensation from Japan over their treatment.</p> <p>The Japanese government initially denied the existence of \"comfort stations\", as the brothels were known. But in 1993 Yohei Kono, the-then chief cabinet secretary, acknowledged and apologised for the first time for Japan's use of sex slaves during the second world war.</p> <p>Japan refused to directly compensate the women, saying all claims were settled by postwar peace treaties. In 1995 it set up the privately run <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asian_Women%E2%80%99s_Fund\" title=\"\">Asian women's fund</a>, which drew on donations, but many women rejected any redress unless it came directly from the Japanese state. The fund was disbanded in 2007.</p> <p>Kono's statement infuriated Japanese conservatives. They recently gained an ally in the country's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/aug/30/japan-yoshihiko-noda-prime-minister\" title=\"\">supposedly progressive prime minister, Yoshihiko Noda</a>, who, despite conceding that individual testimony indicated the coercion of Asian women into sexual slavery, claimed no documentary evidence existed.</p> <p>His main opponent in the next general election, the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/26/japanese-nationalist-tipped-pm-china\" title=\"\">Liberal Democratic party leader, Shinzo Abe</a>, has even called for the Kono statement to be revised.</p> <p>The spread of frontline brothels followed the Japanese imperial army's sweep through large parts of China and south-east Asia. As colonial ruler of the Korean peninsula since 1910, Japan had easy access to local women, targeting poor, uneducated and single females aged between 13 and 19.</p> <p>On display in a museum near the women's residence are photographs, documents and exhibits that shed light on their wretched existence before they were abandoned by fleeing Japanese troops at the end of the war.</p> <p>Typically, they were forced to have sex with 10 to 30 men a day in dimly lit rooms furnished only with beds. Condoms were washed and re-used and offered little protection against sexually transmitted diseases. Medical examinations were infrequent, and many women became addicted to the mercury 606 used to treat syphilis. Forced abortions were commonplace.</p> <p>Surprisingly, the Japanese comprise about two-thirds of the estimated 15,000 people who visit the House of Sharing every year. In the past, the residents were happy to meet members of the public, but in recent weeks some have refused to talk to Japanese visitors. \"They wonder why Japanese visitors don't go home and tell everyone the truth about the comfort women,\" said a Japanese member of staff who did not wish to be named.</p> <p>After the war, Kang settled in north-west China where she married a local man and worked as a nurse. She did not return to South Korea until 2000, and these days speaks her native tongue with a heavy Chinese accent.</p> <p>She and other former comfort women have maintained pressure on Japan during weekly demonstrations outside its embassy in Seoul. Last December they conducted their 1,000th protest.</p> <p>The 85-year-old, who was given the Japanese name Tamako Okada while working in military brothels, said Japan's recent backpedalling would only prolong the agony of former sex slaves. \"To hear Japan's leaders accuse us of being liars makes me sad and angry,\" she said. \"I have nothing against ordinary Japanese people. This is their government's fault. The prime minister says there is no proof that we existed. But I am living proof.\"</p> <h2>Japan's war apologies</h2> <p>Earlier this month, a large billboard appeared in Times Square in New York. Beneath the question, \"Do you remember?\" is a black-and-white photograph from 1971 of the former German chancellor Willy Brandt kneeling before a monument to victims of the Warsaw Uprising. That simple gesture, the signs says, \"promoted reconciliation in Europe\".</p> <p>It continues: \"In 2012, Korean women forced to work as sex slaves for Japanese soldiers during WWII are still waiting for a heartfelt apology from Japan.\"</p> <p>Japan is often accused of never matching Germany's remorse for its wartime conduct. In fact, Japanese leaders, and its current emperor, have issued several apologies and expressed remorse. In addition to compensation agreed in postwar peace treaties, Japan points out that it has since extended generous aid and development packages to its former victims.</p> <p>On the 50th anniversary of the end of the war in 1995, the then socialist prime minister, Tomiichi Murayama, said: \"Japan, through its colonial rule and aggression, caused tremendous damage and suffering to the people of many countries, particularly those of Asia.</p> <p>\"In the hope that no such mistake will be made in the future, I regard, in a spirit of humanity, these irrefutable facts of history, and express here once again my feelings of deep remorse and state my heartfelt apology.\"</p> <p>Two years earlier, Yohei Kono, then the chief cabinet secretary, acknowledged that the Japanese military had coerced Asian women into sexual slavery.</p> <p>The Kono statement, according to a recent editorial in the Korean press, deserves praise for \"extending its sincere apologies and remorse to all those who suffered immeasurable pain and incurable physical and psychological wounds as comfort women\".</p> <p>But it is the nature, and perceived insincerity, of the apologies that continues to trouble China and South Korea.</p> <p>For the 60 or so surviving comfort women, previous expressions of remorse do not go far enough; instead, they are demanding an official apology and compensation directly from the Japanese government.</p> <p>In 2007, they won support from the US House of Representatives, which passed a resolution urging Japan to \"formally acknowledge, apologise, and accept historical responsibility in a clear and unequivocal manner\" for the coercion of young women into sexual slavery.</p> <p>Demands for a formal apology and compensation will continue, at least as long as Japan, in Lee Myung-bak's words, refuses to summon the \"courage and wisdom to look squarely at history\".</p>"

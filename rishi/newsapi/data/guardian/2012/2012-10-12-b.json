  "<p>The lone vice-presidential debate is in the books. Joe Biden <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LaughinJoeBiden\">laughed</a>, while Paul Ryan had a <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2012/08/15/paul_ryan_meet_eddie_munster/\">full head of hair</a>. But did either candidate emerge with an edge that could aid their candidates President Obama and Mitt Romney?</p> <p><strong>Who won the debate?</strong></p> <p>The two scientific polls taken after the debate indicate a split on who won. The <a href=\"http://www.scribd.com/doc/109840433/top13\">CNN/ORC</a> poll of debate watcher pegs the margin at 48% for Paul Ryan to 44% for Joe Biden. That's well within the margin of error. It was slightly tilted by the fact that more Republicans watched the debate than Democrats, though a larger percentage of the overall electorate is Democratic. Even so, it seems likely that both Democrats and Republicans were satisfied with their man's debate performance.</p> <p>The other scientific poll, from <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-250_162-57531059/poll-biden-takes-debate-over-ryan-uncommitted-voters-say/\">CBS/Knowledge networks</a>, had Biden winning among undecided voters by 50% to 31%. The poll did have more Democrats than Republicans, but even allowing for that, it seems Biden won among undecideds in this poll. These undecideds also stated that their view \"for the better\" of Biden increased at a greater rate than they did for Ryan.</p> <p><strong>Will the debate make a difference among undecideds?</strong></p> <p>Among undecideds, the CBS poll found that Romney had led, by 28% to 23%, among those who said they leaned toward voting for one candidate or the other before the debate. After the debate, it was only 33% to 32% in Romney's favor. This change, again, is within the margin of error. And considering the low percentage of undecideds in the electorate, this 4-point closing of the margin makes a difference of maybe 0.3 percentage points in the overall race. That's really nothing.</p> <p><strong>Will the debate fire up Democrats?</strong></p> <p>The reason Mitt Romney can win this election is because polls constantly indicate that Republicans will make up a <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/oct/10/romney-v-obama-mixed-signals-polls\">greater percentage of the election day electorate than they do of all registered voters</a>. The first debate helped to feed this likely voter v registered voter gap, to the point where Romney is leading in the vast majority of likely voter polls, while trailing in the majority of registered voter surveys. </p> <p>The issue that argues against believing that this debate will close the gap is that Democratic enthusiasm was at the same levels before the first presidential debate as it was afterwards. Public Policy Polling surveys in both <a href=\"http://www.publicpolicypolling.com/main/2012/10/obama-leads-by-3-in-virginia.html\">Virginia</a> and <a href=\"http://www.publicpolicypolling.com/main/2012/10/obama-lead-down-to-2-in-wisconsin.html\">Wisconsin</a> indicate that it was Republican enthusiasm that rose, thanks to the first debate. The Democrats are at the baseline that they have been at all year.</p> <p><strong>What does history tell us?</strong></p> <p>\"You're no Jack Kennedy\" was probably the most devastating put-down in debate history: uttered by Democrat Lloyd Bentsen, the line is still remembered to this day. Yet, Democratic presidential nominee Michael Dukakis made no ground thanks to that VP debate; in fact, polls had him trailing by a wider margin, post-debate.</p> <p>This finding matches other past vice-presidential debates. There has actually been <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oftc66c-Fyfr-LxD6KpWssZLNtLSa5h2NIsrN_FnwtU/edit\">a slight negative correlation</a> between winning a vice-presidential debate and the top of the ticket gaining in the polls.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397684796\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/12/1350072232328/veepdebates_460.jpg\" alt=\"VP debates' effect in polling\" width=\"460\" height=\"262\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>It's certainly possible that historical experience will be proven wrong. I tend to doubt it, though, in this case, as there wasn't really anything outstandingly good or bad for either side. </p> <p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p> <p>Like all debates, the vice-presidential debate was fun for those who follow this sort of thing. I got a good chuckle over Joe Biden's teeth and Paul Ryan's Eddie Munster-like haircut. The whole affair, however, is likely not to have much of an effect on the presidential contest.</p>",

  "<p>Barack Obama embarked on four days of intensive preparation for next week's showdown with Mitt Romney as he sought to capitalise on Joe Biden's dominant debate performance on Thursday night.</p> <p>Biden eased the pressure on Obama in his clash with Romney's running mate Paul Ryan in Kentucky, overwhelming proceedings with a combative approach that will have lifted Democratic morale but that could risk alienating swing voters.</p> <p>But there is no sign that Romney's surge since the first debate is going away. The latest national Gallup tracking poll released on Friday gave the Republican a two-point, 49-47%, lead over the president. </p> <p>The second clash between Obama and Romney on Tuesday night in Long Island is now shaping up into a 90-minute contest that could decide the race for the White House.</p> <p>Biden overwhelmed opponent Ryan with the kind of aggression that was lacking in Obama's disastrous debate with Romney in Denver last week. But his demeanour in the first half of the contest, which showed him laughing, smirking, talking over and interrupting as Ryan spoke, may have grated with some of the tens of millions of television viewers.</p> <p>Ryan, over breakfast on Friday in Lexington, Kentucky, told reporters he felt great about his own performance and had not felt overwhelmed by Biden. \"No, it was what I expected,\" he said.</p> <p>Obama cleared his diary on Friday, apart from honouring a commitment to dinner with campaign donors, the prize in one of the Democratic party's fundraising drives.</p> <p>He is devoting Saturday, Sunday and Monday almost exclusively to debate preparation for the clash in Hempstead, New York, the second of three presidential debates before election day on November 6.</p> <p>His chief adviser, David Axelrod, speaking in the Spin Rooom in Danville, Kentucky, minutes after the Biden-Ryan debate ended, said: \"The president is looking forward to meeting Governor Romney again next week.\"</p> <p>Asked about the risk of Biden's laughter being seen as rude and irritating to independent voters, Axelrod insisted laughter was inevitable \"when you are debating an opponent who is seriously evading and distorting facts. You react to that.\"</p> <p>The Republican national committee issued a a new web video after the debate, showing clips of Biden laughing, in contrast with a serious Ryan. One of Romney's senior advisers, Ed Gillespie, on Fox television Friday, said: \"I thought it was very disrespectful to the American people.\"</p> <p>Republicans compared it to the 2000 presidential debate in which the Democratic challenger Al Gore lost voters irritated by his sighing and rolling his eyes while George Bush was talking.</p> <p>The architect of the Bush victories, Karl Rove, described Biden as looking \"unhinged\".</p> <p>Democratic congressman Chris Van Hollen, who played the part of Ryan during Biden's debate preparations, told MSNBC: \"I don't think [Biden] was over the top. I thought what you saw was Joe Biden's passion for these issues.\"</p> <p>Before the vice-presidential debate, Republicans had been eagerly anticipating that Congressman Ryan, who has a reputation for being cerebral \u2013 he is the author of a Republican House plan for bringing down the deficit \u2013 would overcome the gaffe-prone and long-winded Biden. But Ryan seemed overcome by Biden's cajoling, forceful debating style.</p> <p>While Biden's performance will have cheered Democratic activists and supporters, it was not a game-changer capable alone of arresting the slide in Obama's fortunes. The consensus among US commentators was that the debate was a draw.</p> <p>The US electoral map has changed dramatically in the week since the Denver debate, with Obama's poll ratings sliding and Romney now marginally ahead or at least even with the president nationally and in most of the eight swing states. The Real Clear Politics website, which averages out the daily polls, has Romney on 47% and Obama on 46% nationally. Romney is three points ahead in North Carolina and two in Florida, with Obama three points ahead in Iowa. But the two are statistically tied in Ohio, Virginia, New Hampshire, Nevada and Colorado.</p> <p>Apart from Biden's facial expressions, Republicans claimed the vice-president had made a major gaffe when he denied that there had been a request by US security forces in Libya to retain or increase protection staff at the embassy and the consulates. The state department admitted at a Congressional hearing on Wednesday there had been such a request.</p> <p>In the debate, Biden was adamant: \"We weren't told they wanted more security there. \"We did not know they wanted more security.\" This comes after a series of conflicting statements from the Obama administration over what happened at the Benghazi consulate attack in which US ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans were killed.</p> <p>Former House Republican speaker Newt Gingrich, told CBS television: \"Biden on Benghazi was so wrong last night. It's going to haunt them from now until the next debate.\"</p> <p>During the Kentucky debate, Biden, talking about Iran and Syria, tried to portray the Romney-Ryan ticket as leaning towards taking the US into another conflict, one that war-weary Americans did not want. \"Facts matter,\" he said, lecturing Ryan on the details of Iran's nuclear programme, saying it was not yet close to achieving a weapons capability.</p> <p>On domestic policy, Biden pushed Ryan on plans to cut the tax bills of the wealthy, saying they did not need it, and also questioned how Ryan could get the deficit down. Biden said no one in history had managed to do this.</p> <p>\"Jack Kennedy lowered tax rates, increased growth,\" Ryan said. \"Oh, now you are Jack Kennedy?\" Biden asked sarcastically.</p> <p>It was a refrain of the most famous vice-presidential debate quote in US political history when the Democratic nominee Lloyd Bentsen, told Dan Quayle he was \"no Jack Kennedy.\"</p> <p>At several points in the night, Biden dismissed points made by Ryan as \"malarkey\".</p> <p>Ryan got in a hit when he got personal, noting that unemployment in Scranton, Pennsylvania \u2013 Biden's hometown \u2013 had risen. But when Ryan went on to say, \"That's how things are going all across America,\" the vice-president interrupted. \"That's not how things are going. You don't read the statistics,\" he said, referring to the drop in unemployment to 7.8% announced last Friday.</p> <p>Biden raised the secret video in which Romney was dismissive of 47% of the population as freeloaders, a line that Obama singularly failed to bring up last week, to the dismay of Democrats. Ryan said the 47% remark was not what Romney had meant to say.</p> <p>Biden may join the race for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2016, a race that could pit him against Hillary Clinton, and this performance will have helped him with the constituency that matters, Democratic activists. If Romney fails to win next month, Ryan is among potential Repbublican contenders in 2016. While Biden dominated the debate, Ryan made no gaffes and did not harm to his chances in 2016.</p>",
  "<p>There was, perhaps, only ever going to be one winner of our public poll of the buildings shortlisted for the RIBA Stirling prize. On one hand there was the Olympic Stadium, the building beamed daily on to the nation's screens, as a setting for untrammelled joy and delirium. On the other, there were five thoughtful, well-crafted, middle-sized projects, tucked away in various more-or-less obscure parts of various cities all over the country.</p> <p>The projects in Wakefield, Belfast, Cambridge and Glasgow are all in parts of their cities that take a bit of finding. Even the Rothschild HQ, which is in the centre of the City of London, tries to be as unobtrusive as a glass banking tower can be.</p> <p>So, it is like a choice between a big chocolatey pile of profiteroles from the sweet trolley to finish your meal, or a slice of one of the subtle, complex, geographically inventive offerings from the cheese board. Put like that, it is striking that the cheese vote, albeit split five ways, beats the profiteroles 62 to 38.</p> <p>It is also striking that top of the non-stadium votes is the Hepworth in Wakefield, a building whose uncompromising grey exterior seems to go out of its way to earn the label \"bunker\" or \"concrete monstrosity\" in the local press. It succeeded in attracting both epithets before it was built, but now visitors seem to appreciate that there can be a virtue in plainness, especially as a prelude to a rich and satisfying sequence of interior spaces.</p> <p>Nonetheless, as far as the Stirling prize itself is concerned, the stage would seem to be set for a classic face-off between popular and professional taste. Most architects and critics I know seem to regard a victory for the stadium as almost as shocking a prospect as one by Mitt Romney in the US presidential election. They see a somewhat basic structure, with a kitschy coronet of triangular lighting fixtures on top, versus works of artistry and depth, which reveal more the more you look at and experience them.</p> <p>I wouldn't share their horror if the stadium won. It seems to me to do its job well, with a pleasing directness and economy. My quibbles would be that, although it looks like a work of the \"new austerity\", its price (\u00a3130m) was not especially austere. Also, that it was designed to be demounted, which is a nice idea, but for political reasons this will almost certainly not happen.</p> <p>But it would still be an opportunity lost if the judges chose the stadium at Saturday night's prize-giving dinner. There are not enough chances to recognise artistry, depth etc, and things like the extraordinary quality with which the Sainsbury Laboratory is made, or the spatial richness of the Lyric theatre. Part of the value of awards like the Stirling should be that they point out qualities that are not immediately obvious, that they do more than reinforce what everyone already knows.</p> <h2>Our poll results:</h2> <p>Olympic Stadium, London \u2013 38%</p> <p>The Hepworth, Wakefield \u2013 28%</p> <p>Lyric theatre, Belfast \u2013 14%</p> <p>Maggie's Centre, Gartnavel Glasgow \u2013 8%</p> <p>The Sainsbury Laboratory, Cambridge \u2013 8%</p> <p>New Court, Rothschild Bank, London \u2013 4%</p>",
  "<p>Republicans have gone on the offensive over Joe Biden's insistence during the vice-presidential debate that the Obama administration was unaware of any request for more security in Libya before the fatal 9/11 attack on the US consulate in Benghazi.</p> <p>The Romney campaign is smelling blood over the remarks in which Biden protested that there had been no knowledge of a security problem before the assault in which the US ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans were killed. \"We weren't told they wanted more security, we did not know they wanted more security,\" the vice-president said.</p> <p>In an otherwise bullish and assured performance, Biden's comments left him exposed to post-debate criticism from conservatives intent on sustaining the past week's surge of the Romney campaign. The vice-president's position appeared to be contradicted by evidence presented to the congressional oversight and government reform committee just a day earlier.</p> <p>Newt Gingrich, a failed candidate for the Republican nomination now backing Romney, predicted on CBS television Friday morning that Biden's remarks on Benghazi would \"haunt them from now until the next debate\".</p> <p>On Tuesday the committee was presented with a diplomatic cable sent on 2 August by Stevens to the state department in Washington asking for an additional 11 security personnel to be added to the rotation of 24. Though the 11 were to replace temporary security staff who were leaving, Stevens made clear in the cable that violence and terrorism were a threat amid a volatile political landscape.</p> <p>He wrote: \"Due to the level of threat in regards to crime, political violence and terrorism, post feels this is an appropriate number of LES [locally employed staff] security personnel needed to further embassy diplomatic outreach missions. Violent security incidents continue to take place due to the lack of a coherent national Libyan security force and the strength of local militias and large numbers of armed groups.</p> <p>\"Host national security support is lacking and cannot be depended on to provide a safe and secure environment.\"</p> <p>The Republican-controlled committee also heard from two former US security chiefs in Libya who testified that they had found it impossible to get the message across back home that security was a critical problem.</p> <p>Andrew Wood, former head of a US military team in Libya, told the committee that \"the security in Benghazi was a struggle and remained a struggle throughout my time there\". He added that the head of US security in the region had pushed for more people \"but was never able to attain the numbers he felt comfortable with\".</p> <p>Eric Nordstrom, the former security chief for US diplomats in Libya, said that in his view he had been fighting a losing battle over numbers in which \"we couldn't even keep what we had\". Pointedly, he said that he concluded after contact with state department bosses that \"we were not going to get resources until the aftermath of an incident\".</p> <p>During the debate, Paul Ryan, Mitt Romney's running mate, accused the Obama administration of having an \"unravelling\" foreign policy and pressed Biden hard on Benghazi, saying: \"This was Libya, a country we knew had al-Qaida cells. And we did not give our ambassador in Benghazi a marine detachment?\"</p> <p>By protesting \"we weren't told\", Biden may have referred to the White House or the president and his immediate circle, in which case it may be consistent with the revelations about requests to the state department for additional Libyan security. But he will now come under pressure to clarify his position, which could extend the Benghazi controversy for one or more news cycles, causing further headaches for the Obama re-election campaign.</p> <p>It also leaves him vulnerable to the accusation that the administration was out of touch with what was happening on the ground in Libya. That was seized upon by the Romney campaign, whose senior adviser, Dan Senor, questioned the administration's grasp of vital national security issues. He said Biden's statement had pointed to \"the larger failures of the administration to be completely transparent about the terrorist attacks in Benghazi and the security situations leading up to the attacks\".</p>",

  "<p>There are two gestures now essential to understanding South African politics. One is a rolling hand motion as practised by football fans when calling for a player to be substituted. The player they want yanked off is the president, Jacob Zuma.</p> <p>The other is the cupping of a hand at a downward angle to represent a shower head \u2013 a mocking reference to Zuma's six-year-old gaffe about <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/4879822.stm\" title=\"\">showering after having sex with an HIV-positive woman</a>, of which the cartoonist Zapiro constantly reminds him.</p> <p>Both these gestures were prominent, accompanied by much singing and stomping, at Thursday night's launch of the <a href=\"http://mg.co.za/article/2012-10-10-deep-read-zuma-regime-kgalemas-hopes-and-concerns\" title=\"\">authorised biography </a>of Kgalema Motlanthe, Zuma's deputy and his only credible challenger in an African National Congress (ANC) leadership contest in December.</p> <p>Indeed, this was less a book launch with wine-sipping literati than a raucous anti-Zuma rally attended by top dissidents Tokyo Sexwale, Mathews Phosa and rebels from the ANC youth league. In the absence of US-style presidential debates in South Africa (Zuma v Thabo Mbeki a few years ago would have been an amusing clash of styles), this was the closest thing the rank and file could get to a proper look at Motlanthe.</p> <p>For it could be argued that Motlanthe's principal strength in the presidential race is that he isn't Zuma. The 63-year-old is a private man and opaque politician; few voters would be able identify a clear Motlanthe agenda. He is the tabula rasa on to which the \"anyone but Zuma\" campaign can project their hopes and, perhaps, wishful thinking.</p> <p>The publication of his biography, therefore, risks letting in daylight upon magic. At the launch in the great hall at Johannesburg's Wits University, Ray Hartley, editor of the Sunday Times, said: \"I think this book does introduce South Africa to Kgalema Motlanthe for the first time.</p> <p>\"It does give us our first detailed picture of the deputy president. Those of us in the fourth estate have been scratching around to try to work out who is the man who was the third president of South Africa.\"</p> <p>Third president? Yes, Motlanthe was a kind of caretaker president for seven months after Mbeki was ousted and before Zuma won the 2009 general election. But president he was. The record will always show that he wore the crown and so does my memory. On <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/apr/14/david-smith-south-africa\" title=\"\">my first day covering Africa for the Guardian</a>, I attended a press conference with President Motlanthe specifically for foreign journalists (more than three years later, we are still waiting for Zuma to do the same).</p> <p>In fact, South African journalists mining advance copies of the biography are yet to come up with a blockbuster revelation. There have been tales about Motlanthe saving Zuma from expulsion from the party, Motlanthe disagreeing with the decision to expel the youth leader Julius Malema and Motlanthe expressing discontent over various government failings. But still little to fire up voters either way.</p> <p>\"The man is truly a biographer's delight,\" the author, the former trade unionist Ebrahim Harvey, told the audience on Thursday night, implying that Motlanthe will not be losing much sleep over its contents.</p> <p>Harvey said he had spent almost 200 hours with the politician over three years (adding that Mbeki only gave his biographer 45 hours). \"He decided to open up his mind both personally and politically in this biography,\" he said. \"It was a very courageous step.\"</p> <p>Motlanthe is a man with nothing to hide, he continued. Even when a newspaper falsely claimed that Motlanthe was having an affair with a 24-year-old, not once was he \"morose, dejected, looking troubled\", but instead showed \"amazing fortitude\".</p> <p>Harvey insisted that the timing of the book's publication, just two months before the leadership election in Mangaung, was pure coincidence. But then he took a swipe at the ANC over its response to the deadly unrest sweeping the country's mines. \"The ANC pretence that we don't have a social crisis in this country is quite ridiculous. In that respect the timing for me is much more important than Mangaung.\"</p> <p>Next up was the man himself \u2013 like Zuma, a former inmate on Robben Island. Motlanthe was, as ever, charming and cerebral but not exactly charismatic. \"I thought a political biography has got to be written by someone who is going to be critical and make an assessment of the work we do, the positions we adopt and so on,\" he said. \"I did not want a book that is only about positive issues.\"</p> <p>He then told a story about a trip to Italy where he was impressed by a new teaching method. \"Things are always changing,\" he observed innocently, prompting the biggest roar of the night from a crowd that could see only the subtext of leadership elections.</p> <p>Motlanthe paused. Against whoops and whistles, he continued: \"For me the irony is already lost because I'm talking about \u2026 This is science. It's not about names of places. I can see that you are trapped within the geographic names of Mangaung (where the leadership election will take place). There are many other important things about Mangaung than just the ANC elective conference.\"</p> <p>He ended on a somewhat sombre note. \"I've told my comrade Trevor [Manuel, the planning minister], in my will, I leave very clear instructions when I pass, my obituary or tombstone \u2013 if anybody believes I deserve a tombstone \u2013 should say: 'Others made suggestions and he implemented.'\"</p> <p>Which, in the ranks of political epitaphs, is never going to challenge Abraham Lincoln or Winston Churchill. That apart, we still didn't learn much about the man who would be king (again). The wild cheers seemed to be driven more by out-with-the-old desperation than desire for the new.</p> <p>\"More bloody riddles from the masters of spin, smoke, mirrors and obfuscation,\" remarked one journalist on the way out. \"What does this guy really stand for except ABZ \u2013 anyone but Zuma?\"</p>",

He was animated in making his points in a way that Obama failed to do and the laughter may have been deliberate, to try to belittle Ryan.</p> <p>On Iran and Syria, Biden tried to portray Ryan as leaning towards taking the US into another conflict, one that war-weary Americans did not want. \"Facts matter,\" he said, lecturing Ryan on the details of Iran's nuclear programme, saying it was not yet close to achieving a weapons capability.</p> <p>On domestic policy, Biden pushed Ryan on plans to cut the tax bills of the wealthy, saying they did not need it, and also questioned how Ryan could get the deficit down. Biden said no one in history managed to do this.</p> <p>\"With all due respect, that's a bunch of malarkey,\" Biden said of Ryan and Romney's plans in general. \"Not a single thing he said is accurate.\"</p> <p>Ryan got in a hit when he got personal, noting that unemployment in Scranton, Pennsylvania \u2013 Biden's hometown \u2013 had risen. But when Ryan went on to say, \"That's how things are going all across America,\" the vice-president interrupted. \"That's not how things are going. You don't read the statistics,\" he said, referring to the drop in unemployment to 7.8% announced on Friday.</p> <p>Biden raised the secret video in which Romney was dismissive of 47% of the population as freeloaders, a line that Obama singularly failed to bring up last week, to the dismay of Democrats. Ryan said the 47% remark was not what Romney had meant to say.</p> <p>But Biden failed to unnerve his younger opponent or to force him into making any gaffes. Ryan even succeeded in forcing Biden into making one error, potentially serious, in relation to the Benghazi attack that left a US ambassador dead along with three other Americans. </p> <p>Biden said the Obama administration had been unaware that there had been a request by security on the ground in Libya to at least keep the size of protection team intact and preferably increase it. But a state department official, giving evidence in front of a Congressional committee on Wednesday, confirmed there had been such a request.</p> <p>Ryan scored another point when he asked why the US ambassador to Paris was protected by a marine detachment but not the ambassador in Libya. \"Our ambassador in Paris has a marine detachment guarding him. Shouldn't we have a marine detachment guarding our ambassador in Benghazi, a place we knew there was an al-Qaida cell with arms?\" Ryan asked.</p> <p>Republicans afterwards focused on Biden's behaviour, in particular what they described as his incessant grinning and smirking, as potentially a vote-loser. Brendan Buck, Ryan's press officer, in the Spin Room, said: \"The big takeout tonight is Joe Biden's dental work. There is a time for laughter. It is not endearing to see a person laughing in a serious debate ... I do not think it will play well with people who saw it on a splitscreen.\"</p> <p>The pressure now switches to Obama to produce an equally good performance against Romney when the two meet in the second of three presidential debates on Tuesday in Long Island, New York. The president, who watched the debate on board Air Force One, said: \"I'm going to make a special point of saying that I thought Joe Biden was terrific tonight.\"</p> <p>Democratic party activists badly needed a lift after a week in which they have expressed dismay and puzzlement over Obama's failure last week and the subsequent dramatic and continuing slide in the polls.</p> <p>The instant snapshots after the debate were mixed. CBS awarded the night to Biden by 50% to Ryan's 31% but CNN put Ryan on 48% to Biden's 44% and CNBC 50% to Ryan and 36% to Biden. These polls tend to be unreliable.</p> <p>Both teams will now anxiously await the first serious polls, though it is unlikely that a vice-presidential debate will make much impact on voter intentions. The main benefit for Democrats is as a morale-booster.</p> <p>Obama's main strategist, David Axelrod, claimed it was a clear win for Biden. \"It was like looking at the school principal debating the student president.\"</p> <p>Asked about the risk of Biden's laughter alienating independent voters, Axelrod insisted laughter was inevitable \"when you are debating an opponent who is seriously evading and distorting facts. You react to that.\"</p>",

And nothing was heard of either of them again.\"</p> <p>It says something about what's going on the top of the ticket that so many would want to hear from the two <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/video/2012/oct/12/us-election-2012-biden-ryan-video\">vice-presidential contenders</a>. After seven years of running for office, Mitt Romney only managed to introduce himself to the American public in a favourable light last week, and needed to build on that. After six years building a reputation as a formidable orator, Barack Obama managed to come across as a distracted lightweight just over a month before polling day. Since then, erratic polls suggest a volatile electorate which is neither sufficiently satisfied with the incumbent, nor sufficiently impressed by his opponent, to make up its mind. And in a situation where anything can happen, everything matters. Even vice-presidential debates.</p> <p>Both Joe Biden and Paul Ryan were tasked with different goals for the night underpinned by one basic maxim: do no harm. For Biden, known for his logorrhoea, that meant no gaffes; for Ryan, unknown still to most Americans, that meant presenting himself as a plausible candidate to be a heartbeat from the presidency. Both achieved that, though Biden came closest to blowing it.</p> <p>Beyond that, however, Ryan had to continue the upward trend his boss started last week, while Biden had to dig his team out of the hole his boss dug last week. Neither achieved that, although Biden came closest to achieving it.</p> <p>By far the most impressive person on the stage was the moderator, Martha Raddatz. Asking incisive questions, pushing for cogent answers, calmly prodding for clarity and brevity. She kept them in line and, as much as is possible, on point.</p> <p>That was no mean feat. Biden was so combative that at times he appeared thuggish. He badgered, bulldozered, hectored and harassed. At some moments, the debate appeared to owe more to WWE than CNN. This was probably Biden overcompensating for his boss's lacklustre performance last week.</p> <p>Occasionally he overdid it. Where some had questioned whether Obama had taken a sleeping pill, Biden looked like he was on steroids. For much of the evening, this worked. But his digs could be gratuitous, and his exasperation overly theatrical. \"You're Jack Kennedy now?\" he said after Ryan once mentioned the former president. At times the age difference, along with the smirking, eye rolling and forceful interventions, made him look like an angry father taking his impudent son to the woodshed.</p> <p>Ryan parried this well. He was competent, knowledgeable and likeable enough. He broke no hearts and swung no votes. But he turned no stomachs and lost no votes, either.</p> <p>For Biden, however, it was a high-risk strategy to come across so angry, particularly at a time when Democrats are losing women voters. But while he lost some with his aggression, there were others he undoubtedly won over with his authenticity. \"Just get out the way!\" he told Ryan at one point. \"Stop talking about how you care about people and show me something!\"</p> <p>Ryan, though, was so evasive at times that it would have been rude for Biden not to intervene. Asked specifics, either by Raddatz or Biden, Ryan would talk only in generalities. Asked what he would do differently, he would simply offer a marginally different talking point. There were moments when he was so on message that you expected him to end his contribution with the words: \"my name's Paul Ryan and I approved this message.\"</p> <p>No debacle was anticipated and none occurred. No breakthrough was anticipated and none occurred either. They fought to a bloodied draw in which Biden won on substance and Ryan won on style. Now both can sail off to sea, never to be heard of again.</p>"

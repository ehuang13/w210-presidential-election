  "<p>Barack Obama deftly fended off Mitt Romney's attempt to pin accusations of a cover-up over the Benghazi killings on him at the presidential debate on Tuesday, with the Republican candidate emerging worse for the encounter. </p> <p>But there are still difficult questions over the death of the US ambassador to Libya, Chris Stevens, and three other Americans that the Republicans can be expected to ensure haunt the president up until the election. </p> <p>Although there is so far little evidence that the issue is having a noticeable impact on voters more concerned with the state of the economy and unemployment, it does eat at Obama's characterisation of his Middle East policy as a mix of growing success against terrorism while championing freedom in the Arab world.</p> <p>There are two key questions the president has not addressed. One was posed by a member of the audience at the debate and sidestepped by Obama: who was responsible for turning down the requests from US diplomats in Libya for greater security?</p> <p>Hillary Clinton, the secretary of state, said the buck stops with her but said the actual decision lay with security officials. Obama responded to a Republican call to \"man up\" and accept responsibility by accepting responsibility at the debate. But he did not address how it was that Stevens was left so vulnerable to an attack. </p> <p>The answer appears to lie in a mix of poor intelligence after a series of earlier relatively minor attacks, financial pressures caused by Republican cuts to the state department security budget and the reality that it's almost impossible to be prepared everywhere. Look at the 1983 US marine barracks bombing in Beirut which killed 241 Americans or the 1998 bombing of the US embassy in Kenya that left 223 dead. </p> <p>Internal state department memos reflect a friction between security officials and diplomats on the ground in Libya pressing for more resources and state department officials in Washington balancing a budget greatly shrunk by the Republican-controlled Congress.</p> <p>Perhaps the more difficult question for Obama is the one Romney botched in the debate: why was the administration was so hesitant to call the Benghazi assault a terrorist attack?</p> <p>The day after the attack, Obama made a reference to \"acts of terror\" in speaking about the death of Stevens and the three other Americans. He said: \"No act of terror will dim the light of the values that we proudly shine on the rest of the world, and no act of violence will shake the resolve of the United States of America.\"</p> <p>Conservatives have tried to say that Obama was talking about attacks in general, including 9/11, not Benghazi in particular. But both speeches were framed by events in Libya and most Americans are likely to accept that is what the president was talking about.</p> <p>But it does not explain why his senior officials shied away from similar language, most notably the US ambassador to the UN, Susan Rice, who was sent on the television talk show circuit to characterise the attack as growing out of a spontaneous anti-American demonstration over a hateful video that denigrated the Prophet Mohammed. </p> <p>Even by the time Rice was speaking, it was clear that even if the demonstration had provided cover for the attack, the assault on the US consulate in Benghazi was by a group of well organised and well armed men who kept the attack up for hours. </p> <p>While administration officials said the attack was spontaneous, Republicans argued that it was a planned al-Qaida plot. State department officials conceded that it was clear the assault was planned. But probably in hours to take advantage of a volatile situation in the region over the video, not over days and weeks. And, they noted, not all armed Islamists are al-Qaida. In fact, there is only tangental evidence of an al-Qaida connection. </p> <p>Clinton has said the initial statements were the result of poor intelligence over what happened in a bloody and confusing night of fighting. </p> <p>Republicans have described that explanation as a cover-up. They say the Benghazi assault is evidence that Obama's claim to have al-Qaida on the run after the killing of Osama bin Laden is hubris and that his Middle East policy is in a shambles. </p> <p>But the president's critics may be pushing too hard. When Romney tried to accuse him of a cover-up, Obama lashed out.</p> <p>\"The suggestion that anybody in my team, whether the secretary of state, our UN ambassador, anybody on my team, would play politics or mislead when we lost four of our own, governor, is offensive,\" he said.</p> <p>Many Americans will believe it.</p>",

Here's a summary of where things stand:</p> <p><strong>\u2022 President Obama and Governor Romney raced back to the campaign trail after their alpha-male showdown Tuesday.</strong> Snap polls said Obama \"won\" the debate. CNN's poll said Romney \"won\" the discussion on the economy. We'll see what the polls say next week.</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Nearly as many people watched last night's debate \u2013 65.6 million at-home TV viewers \u2013 as watched the first debate, 67.2 million.</strong></p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Romney opened up a 48-46 lead among registered voters in Gallup's 7-day rolling average poll.</strong> The governor chalked up a 51-45 lead among likely voters in the poll. A Marquette University poll found Obama to be a one-point favorite in the battleground state of Wisconsin. None of the polls incorporated post-debate views.</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Unemployment declined to 7.3% in the middle of October, Gallup reported.</strong> Meanwhile US home construction jumped 15% in September to hit a four-year high, according to government figures.</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Much energy was expended today on fact checking</strong> Mitt Romney's claims about binders full of women, Barack Obama's claims about gangbangers and Candy Crowley's claims about what Obama said about the Benghazi attack.

One is his tendency to argue pointlessly with the moderator and his opponents over the rules of order. The other is his habit of pressing his advantage too far, seeking a kind of alpha-male moment that can seem bullying instead of strong. (His attempt at a $10,000 bet with Rick Perry was the paradigmatic example.)</p> <p>He gave in to both temptations this time around. The candidates each bickered with CNN\u2019s Candy Crowley about turns and time allotments, but Romney went at it earlier and more often \u2013 sometimes justifiably, but never successfully. He also tried too hard to pre-empt the president\u2019s increased aggression with aggression of his own, which doesn\u2019t work well in a town-hall format, where the candidates are already circling one another like sharks.

Romney, the president said, is more conservative, particularly on social issues:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><strong>Obama:</strong> But the last point I want to make is this. You know, there are some things where Governor Romney is different from George Bush. George Bush didn't propose turning Medicare into a voucher. George Bush embraced comprehensive immigration reform.

There were more than 40 organizations involved with the Massachusetts Women's Political Caucus (also bipartisan) as the lead sponsor.</p> <p>They did the research and put together the binder full of women qualified for all the different cabinet positions, agency heads, and authorities and commissions.

The case seemed brick-strong.</p> <p>For weeks after the Benghazi attack the Obama administration disseminated a misleading version of events. Secretary of State Clinton and President Obama both said the anti-Islam video produced in California played a role in precipitating the attack. The official version of events described a protest outside the Benghazi mission that gave way to armed assault.&#xa0;</p> <p>Then we were abruptly told there was no protest. It was all made up, and it came out of the secretary of state's mouth. The<a href=\"http://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2012/10/198791.htm\"> US State Department background briefing</a> in a conference call last week described a quiet night that suddenly gave way to explosions. It is self-evident that security at the mission was inadequate, despite official requests for more security support.</p> <p>Romney's argument should have been a strong one. The Obama administration had had to retract similar early inaccuracies in its account of the death of Osama bin Laden. But Romney decided to try to catch the president in what he thought was a misstatement. He jumped out of his chair and nearly charged at Obama. Here's the transcript:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><strong>CROWLEY:</strong>&#xa0;Governor, if you want to reply just quickly to this, please.</p> <p><strong>ROMNEY:</strong>&#xa0;Yeah, I \u2014 I certainly do. I certainly do. I \u2014 I think it\u2019s interesting the president just said something which is that on the day after the attack, he went in the Rose Garden and said that this was an act of terror. You said in the Rose Garden the day after the attack it was an act of terror? It was not a spontaneous demonstration?</p> <p><strong>OBAMA:</strong>&#xa0;Please proceed.</p> <p><strong>ROMNEY:</strong>&#xa0;Is that what you\u2019re saying?</p> <p><strong>OBAMA:</strong>&#xa0;Please proceed, Governor.</p> <p><strong>ROMNEY:</strong>&#xa0;I \u2014 I \u2014 I want to make sure we get that for the record, because it took the president 14 days before he called the attack in Benghazi an act of terror.</p> <p><strong>OBAMA:</strong>&#xa0;Get the transcript.</p> <p><strong>CROWLEY:</strong>&#xa0;It \u2014 he did in fact, sir.</p> <p>So let me, let me call it an act of terrorism...</p> <p><strong>OBAMA:</strong>&#xa0;Can you say that a little louder, Candy? (Laughter, applause.)</p> </blockquote> <p>Romney hung himself out to dry. Somehow he made the discussion of Libya into a farce that ended with the audience laughing at his expense. You couldn't have predicted that.</p>  <p><strong>Update:</strong> the White House transcript of the president's remarks in the Rose Garden following the Benghazi attack <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2012/09/12/remarks-president-deaths-us-embassy-staff-libya\">is here</a>.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-10-17T15:13:01.596Z\">at 4.13pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-507eb9fa58f91d7bbadac7ad\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-17T14:00:26.465Z\">3.00pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Do you count yourself among those who don't think it's possible to <strong>declare a debate winner</strong>?

There can be little doubt when watching, listening to and reading the media that they are ready to declare that <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/oct/17/obama-win-second-presidential-debate\">Obama was back in style</a>. The issue is that many sources also seemed to suggest that, in the words of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/chucktodd/status/258396461845315584\">NBC's Chuck Todd</a>, \"Romney seemed to be ready for it.\" That would seem to suggest more of a tie than anything else.</p> <p>The question over whether this narrative becomes a solid Obama victory will likely revolve around video playback of the many confrontations between the candidates.</p> </blockquote> <p>Video playback has changed politics.

Did you watch? It was a humdinger. Here's a summary of where things stand:</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>In a confrontational joint appearance, an energized President Obama and a pugnacious Governor Romney went to the mat</strong>, not quite literally, over energy policy, job creation, taxes, trade policy, women's health, Libya and more. The possibility for a knockout punch had the fighters swinging big all night long.</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Gone was the halting, listless Obama of the first debate</strong>. He repeatedly lashed out at Romney, starting by calling him an \"oil guy\" and ending by bringing up the 47% when Romney had no more time to speak. The governor sought to repay the president in kind, accusing him of shutting down oil drilling on federal land and personally investing in China. Were voters turned off by all the fighting? Or was the televised smackdown impossible to turn off? The debate went over time and was still going strong at the end.</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>The supposed debate rules were shredded</strong>. Moderator Candy Crowley asked multiple follow-up questions and performed spot-checks of fact, making for some of the richest exchanges of the night. Most prominently she corrected Romney on Libya, saying that Obama had in fact described the Benghazi attack as an act of terror, over the governor's statements to the contrary. As a result Romney was widely seen as having fumbled the point.&#xa0;</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Crowley nobly struggled to enforce time limits</strong>, prompting several moments of babbling cross-talk as Romney, in particular, sought to finish a point or make a last rebuttal. Meanwhile the president gently clung to the mic all night, and he finished with a 3-minute-plus advantage over the governor in speaking time.&#xa0;</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>The exchanges felt personal</strong>. Romney sought to cross-examine Obama like a prosecutor. Obama accused Romney of being to the right of George W. Bush. The governor accused the president of investing his pension in China. The president accused the governor of being a pioneer of outsourcing. Romney seemed angry, Obama seemed annoyed.</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Who won? The polls say the president</strong>. <a href=\"http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2012/10/16/breaking-cnn-poll-obama-edges-romney-in-debate/?hpt=hp_t1%20\">A CNN snap poll</a> gave the debate to Obama 46-39. <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-250_162-57533850/poll-obama-edges-romney-in-second-debate/?tag=MaxDeep;leadHed\">A CBS poll</a> said the president won 37-30 (with a large proportion of respondents apparently opting for neither).&#xa0;</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/grossdm/status/258556931336183809\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Oh dear.

  "<p>Michael Bloomberg is setting up a Super Pac through which he intends to plough millions of dollars of his own money in an attempt to support political candidates prepared to tackle such contentious issues as gun control and same-sex marriage.</p> <p>The mayor of New York is preparing to invest up to $15m of his personal fortune backing candidates from both main parties who in his view are prepared to buck the trend towards increasing partisanship and dissension in American politics. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/18/nyregion/bloomberg-forming-super-pac-to-influence-2012-races.html\">According to the New York Times</a> which revealed the creation of the Super Pac, Bloomberg is particularly keen to encourage great debate in the areas of gun control, same-sex marriage and reform of public schools.</p> <p>As the mayor approaches the end of his term in January 2014, he is increasingly focusing his energies on outside political interests of which his new Super Pac is likely to form part. It will stand in stark contrast to most Super Pacs operating in this election cycle \u2013 though they are dominated by billionaires like him, they have tended to be devoted to furthering right-wing causes.</p> <p>Top of the lists of concerns of the new Super Pac appears to be gun control, a passion of Bloomberg's that he pursues through Mayors Against Illegal Guns, a coalition of 700 mayors from across the country in favour of greater measures to combat gun violence. In the wake of the second presidential debate on Tuesday night, Bloomberg was scathing about the comments of both Barack Obama and Mitt Romney during their exchange over firearms.</p> <p>He criticised Obama for failing to live up to the promise he made during the 2008 race for the White House to reintroduce a federal ban on semi-automatic assault rifles, and he equally lambasted Romney for saying he was opposed to any new laws related to the possession of weapons. \"One candidate has had four years to do something and hasn't, and the other candidate says he won't even do what he once did,\" Bloomberg said.</p> <p>He was particularly caustic about the attempt of both presidential candidates to relate gun violence back to inadequate education in US cities, with Romney even pointing the finger at single-parent families. \"They had all this gibberish talking about education,\" Bloomberg said. \"That education is the solution to stop the killing. My recollection is that the Aurora theater shooter was a PhD candidate. The Virginia Tech massacre was committed by a student at a first-class university.\"</p> <p>The Super Pac, the New York Times reports, will be headed by Howard Wolfson, a senior adviser to Bloomberg who was Hillary Clinton's communications chief in the 2008 battle for the Democratic presidential nomination. Candidates who will receive support from the funding body are said to include Bob Dold, a Republican member of Congress from Illinois who has pushed for gun controls and Angus King, an independent running for the US Senate in Maine.</p>",
  "<p>Did you listen in to the overnight news from America a little apprehensively on Wednesday morning? Log on to your favourite news website not quite knowing what you would read about the second presidential debate? I don't think I can have been the only one.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/oct/04/presidential-debate-romney-winner\" title=\"\">Barack Obama's seriously lacklustre performance in the first debate</a> two weeks ago was a shock at the top end of the political Richter scale. It was felt across the world, not just in America. But a careful daytime watching of Tuesday's debate absolutely confirms the initial verdict carried by Wednesday's early bulletins. Obama is back in the contest. This was partly a matter of performance; Obama turned up this time. He was combative and engaged. A fortnight ago he had given the impression his mind was elsewhere.</p> <p>But the key thing was his focused message on the central economic questions. Obama's number one task was to destroy Romney's new claims to be a moderate. He had to remind viewers of the things Romney has said all through the race for the nomination. He had to shine the light on the deeply conservative Republican party platform on which Romney stands. On that, Obama could hardly be faulted. You can feel the sighs of Democratic relief from all the way across the Atlantic.</p> <p>So is it game on again? Round one to Romney. Round two to Obama. And does everything now rest on round three next Monday in Boca Raton, the emblematic affluent Florida Geriatrica resort in which Romney made his infamous <a href=\"http://thinkprogress.org/election/2012/09/17/862281/romney-writes-off-low-income/?mobile=nc\" title=\"\">attack on 47% of Americans</a> in May? That's the way the media would like to frame it. Having been desperate for Romney to turn the campaign into a contest not a procession, the media has a collective interest in keeping the contest alive.</p> <p>But let's just pause a moment. Let's ask ourselves whether the right way to read the contest for the White House is through these debates? After all, that has rarely been true in the past. It certainly was not the case in 2008. Indeed before this year's election finally reached what Americans call the home stretch, the conventional wisdom was that the 2012 televised debates would not be decisive.</p> <p>This seemed at the time to be an overdue and welcome recognition of reality. Down the years the debates have always been built up as pivotal moments. But they haven't often delivered on the promise. The contest between Obama and John McCain four years ago was a case in point. Instead, as Alistair Cooke observed in this newspaper after the <a href=\"http://www.jfklibrary.org/Asset-Viewer/LYj_UVJ9gEyA5U9buPW8Hg.aspx\" title=\"\">first Kennedy-Nixon debate in 1960</a>, the TV confrontations have mostly confirmed viewers in the views which they had already formed.</p> <p>But then came the 3 October debate between Obama and Romney in Denver. Not for the first time, the Washington conventional wisdom was turned on its head. Romney turned in a winning performance, tacking dramatically to the centre, while Obama never really looked engaged. Ever since, the old wish for the debates to dominate the election campaign has sprung back to life. But what if the debates aren't really as important as the media \u2013 and indeed the candidates \u2013 actually think? What if the contest is being settled by other, deeper things?</p> <p>It is worth remembering our own experience in 2010 here. Britain had never had party leader debates until two years ago. Given the novelty, it isn't surprising that they had the British political class spellbound. Nick Clegg's accomplished performance in the first debate was the talk of the country. Lib Dem poll ratings briefly went off the grid.</p> <p>And then? In the end, the debates seem to have had less impact than everyone, including the leaders, thought at the time. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/apr/16/cleggmania-david-cameron\" title=\"\">Cleggmania</a> quickly ebbed and the Lib Dems ended up losing seats overall. Labour rallied a little in spite of Gordon Brown's poor showing. David Cameron did enough to come out on top but not enough to overcome wider doubts about the Tory party.</p> <p>In short, the debates provided a huge story. But they had little lasting impact on the election result. They were not the turning point. That ought to be a sobering thought for British political leaders as the 2015 election looms into view. Debates absorb a disproportionate amount of campaign resources, including the party leader's time, for a large part of our month-long campaigns. Prepping, taking part, then dealing with the outcome leaves little room for pursuing a policy agenda. Leaders won't have time for much else.</p> <p>Good thing or bad? Wrong question. Now the genie is out of the bottle, televised debates in British elections are with us to stay. Yet some of the most interesting behind-the scenes-conversations at the recent UK party conferences were about the form of the 2015 debates. I'd say there is a latent consensus in all three parties in favour of just one leaders' debate next time, instead of 2010's three. Good if so. Journalists ought to support such a plan. It would stop the domination of the campaign by the debates. The problem is rivalry between the broadcasters. If there is just one debate, who gets to ask the questions?</p> <p>Britain is not America, nor America Britain. There is nevertheless a common pattern. Televised debates are necessary but not sufficient elements in an election. They can take over, or appear to take over, from wider argument about what the country needs and from the campaign on the ground. But this is where elections are more often settled, like it or not.</p> <p>In America's 2008 election, the political class thought that John McCain either won or drew all three debates against Obama. Post-debate polls painted a very different picture in Obama's favour. But Obama didn't win in 2008 because he out-debated McCain. He won because the mood in the early economic downturn was for change and because he had superior organisation on the ground.</p> <p>This time is different. The economy still struggles. The mood is edgier. Obama is less romantic than four years ago. He has not been able to wave a magic wand. The Republicans are fired up for fanatical solutions. American demographics are going against them.</p> <p>These things were true before the debates and they will be true after they are over. Televised election debates are more a confirmatory exercise than a contest in brilliance. Their impact is limited. The public mood and the great questions of the day matter more. This is as it should be. This was always going to be a very tight election indeed. And it still is.</p>",
  "<h2><strong>October 2009</strong></h2> <p><strong> </strong></p> <p>George Papandreou's Pasok government comes to power in Greece to find the previous centre-right New Democracy administration has been cooking the books to disguise the parlous state of the nation's finances. This one will run and run.</p> <p>Herman Van Rompuy, the Lisbon treaty's freshly minted president of Europe and summits chairman, has (self-promoting) ambitions for EU leaders' get-togethers to be held much more often than the regular four times a year. He'll never get a better opportunity.</p> <h2><strong>11 February 2010</strong></h2> <p><strong> </strong></p> <p>First of countless emergency summits, distinguished by the lofty intent to take \"determined and co-ordinated action to safeguard financial stability in the euro area\". Not the last time we'll hear this. But bailouts are illegal \u2013 Berlin says nein.</p> <h2><strong>25 March</strong></h2> <p><strong> </strong>A summit. By now Greece is in effect insolvent, its borrowing costs a staggering 10%, its budget deficit nudging 13%. Berlin and bailouts \u2013 nein. Instead the Germans are pressing a new regime of fiscal rigour on the (then) 16 eurozone countries.</p> <h2><strong>2 May</strong></h2> <p><strong> </strong>The bailout taboo is broken. Eurozone finance ministers agree Greece&#xa0;will get \u20ac110bn (\u00a388.84bn), paving the way for a following weekend of extraordinary drama.</p> <h2><strong>7 May</strong></h2> <p><strong> </strong>Another special summit (Van Rompuy can't believe his plot would bear fruit so quickly) instructs finance ministers to rush to Brussels to cobble together the eurozone's first bailout fund. By the small hours of the following Monday, they exceed expectations by announcing a \u20ac440bn pot which, with IMF and European commission add-ons, becomes \u20ac750bn \u2013&#xa0;in addition to the \u20ac110bn for Greece. Crisis over?</p> <h2><strong>7 June</strong></h2> <p><strong> </strong>The bailout fund becomes the European financial stability facility, based in Luxembourg, and the talk turns to eurobonds or pooled eurozone debt issuance \u2013 the thickest of many red lines for Berlin.</p> <h2><strong>October</strong></h2> <p><strong> </strong>Angela Merkel, having been defeated on bailouts, is by now focused on dictating the terms of those defeats. Revenge. At a Normandy beach resort with Nicolas Sarkozy, she bends the then French president to her will.</p> <h2><strong>26 October </strong></h2> <p>Merkel uses French acquiescence to push through tough draft rules for a permanent bailout fund and insists on losses for private creditors to Greece, sparking an almighty fight with the European Central Bank. Ireland comes under pressure to be the new Greece.</p> <h2><strong>28 November</strong></h2> <p><strong> </strong>Despite trying to resist as its banks go belly-up, Ireland becomes bailout number two, forced to take \u20ac85bn.</p> <h2><strong>17 December</strong></h2> <p><strong> </strong>A pre-Christmas summit prevaricates.</p> <h2><strong>4 February 2011</strong></h2> <p><strong> </strong>Another special summit focuses on Merkel's \"competitiveness pact\", common fiscal and economic rules for the eurozone with more intrusive powers for Brussels. This leads to \u2026</p> <h2><strong>11 March</strong></h2> <p><strong> </strong>\u2026 another summit, and the Germans introduce their notion of a eurozone fiscal pact with obligatory debt ceilings for all, constitutionally enshrined. Oh, and Portugal needs a bailout.</p> <h2><strong>24 March 2011</strong></h2> <p><strong> </strong>The centre-left Portuguese government collapses. A summit has leaders focus on the fine print of the new permanent bailout fund, the European Stability Mechanism.</p> <h2><strong>16 May </strong></h2> <p>Portugal becomes supplicant number three and gets a \u20ac78bn bailout, despite the absence of IMF chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn, detained in New York.</p> <h2><strong>24 June</strong></h2> <p><strong> </strong>Another summit, another bailout. Admission Greek medicine has failed. The dose is increased massively by \u20ac120bn.</p> <h2><strong>21 July </strong></h2> <p>Another summit, another emergency, heated tempers, major squabbling over the terms of the new Greek bailout. Euro meltdown in prospect. A retooling of the bailout fund begins, making it much more flexible in what it can do as a pre-emptive instrument. By this stage, Europe's leaders are pulling back from mutually assured destruction to strike last-minute compromises. There must be a better way to manage crises.</p> <h2><strong>Autumn 2011</strong></h2> <p><strong> </strong>The stakes gets higher, the Americans are alarmed at the failures and fecklessness of European leadership. As the questions get bigger, the proposed answers also get bigger: fiscal union, a eurozone federation. No quick fixes here, but we're looking to the future.</p> <h2><strong>9 December </strong></h2> <p>Another middle-of-the-night peak in the drama, with Merkel pushing her draconian fiscal pact as the eurozone's new rulebook and David Cameron deploying his nuke, a veto on the new treaty because Britain has been refused \"safeguards\" concerning the EU single market and the interests of the City of London. All but two, the UK and the Czech Republic, push ahead with Merkel's pact as an international treaty outside EU law. UK gets nothing; the Tory backbenches feel good. The start of a serious parting of the ways \u2013 the eurozone going one way, Britain in the other direction.</p> <h2><strong>2012</strong></h2> <p><strong> </strong>The year opens with Spain and Italy, the eurozone's third and fourth biggest economies, as the too-big-to-fail worries.</p> <h2><strong>30 January</strong></h2> <p>Summit signs off on Merkel's fiscal pact, with the British and the Czechs outside, but the German leader looks increasingly isolated and resented.</p> <h2><strong>Spring 2012</strong> </h2> <p>Squabbling over the detail of Greece's second bailout and the losses of private creditors \u2013 Merkel's policy \u2013 which she now privately admits was wrong.</p> <h2><strong>February-March</strong></h2> <p><strong> </strong>Greece staring default in the face, austerity takes a devastating toll, and euro leaders bicker. European Central Bank under the new leadership of Mario Draghi buys some respite by delivering a \u20ac1tn of in cheap, short-term loans for EU banks.</p> <h2><strong>2 March </strong></h2> <p>Summit seeks to shift the terms of the argument, focusing on growth rather than austerity. Few are fooled, but the shift is an admission of sorts that the policies are either not working or not seen to be working.</p> <h2><strong>30 March</strong></h2> <p><strong> </strong>Meeting in Copenhagen, governments agree to temporarily pool both bailout funds to create a firewall of \u20ac700bn to \u20ac800bn, depending on whose figures you believe. Lots of claims, but little substantive change.</p> <h2><strong>6 May </strong></h2> <p>Fran\u00e7ois Hollande wins French presidential election, marking a big shift in the terms at Europe's top table. At his first EU summit on 24 May, the divisions with Germany are plain over policy to save the euro. France, Spain and Italy, all under relatively new leaderships, are now seriously challenging Merkel.</p> <h2><strong>29 June</strong></h2> <p><strong> </strong>One of the three or four really big summits to have taken place through amid the endless crisis management. A surprise defeat for Merkel. Spain is about to get a \u20ac100bn bailout and the summit agrees that the bailout fund can be used to recapitalise banks directly without going through a supplicant government.

  "<p>Mid-morning on a clear autumn day at the Elys\u00e9e palace, and the wing housing the French president's gold office, the salon dor\u00e9, was quiet. Downstairs, under the chandeliers, there was little to signify the urgency of the hour, save for the ticking of a clock shaped like a classical Greek urn.</p> <p>Outside, the fountain was in full flow and the roses in bloom in the gardens where, this summer, President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande took the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, for a stroll before sitting down on the terrace for a private discussion about Europe's future. That seems a long time ago. Hollande's honeymoon period did not last long.</p> <p>Up the marble staircase, past the portraits of Pompidou, Chirac and Mitterrand, the president was running late. Eventually, he bounded from his office, true to the Mr Normal label that has become one of France's most successful political branding exercises. The French press was quick to remark, when the socialist was elected, that he had a tendency to open his own gilt doorhandles at the presidential palace rather than wait for white-gloved butlers. He is still doing it.</p> <p>The smile, brisk handshake, eye contact and \"Are you well?\" is a reminder of his days as a rural MP, canvassing markets, when he was known as one of the most prolific palm-pressers of his era. Calm and upbeat, he showed no sign of concern at his apparent flagging popularity.</p> <p>Adjoining his office, in the green room where Nicolas Sarkozy married Carla Bruni, Hollande settled into a lush dining chair, more elaborate than the rest around the meeting table. A miniature gold carriage clock had been placed at his table setting, but he still checked his wrist \u2013 modest shirt buttons, no cufflinks, under a sober black suit \u2013 for his slightly battered brown wristwatch, a far cry from Sarkozy's famously expensive timepieces.</p> <p>Hollande has never moved into the Elys\u00e9e palace, and sleeps rarely in Sarkozy's old apartments, which have not been redecorated. He still commutes from the west Paris flat he shares with his partner, Valerie Trierweiler. His Elys\u00e9e office, too, has changed little since his predecessor moved out. There are pictures on the mantelpiece of Hollande and Trierweiler on election night and certainly a change in reading matter, with works on Obama, Hollande's own election win, and a book by a Socialist party MP on state spending, subtitled Waste Less to Spend Better.</p> <p>It is five months since Hollande won the election and proclaimed from a stage in his rural fiefdom of Tulle: \"I'm sure in a lot of European countries there is relief, hope that at last austerity is not an inevitability any more.\" He said then that his mission was to demand measures for \"growth, jobs and prosperity\" from European leaders. That mission is ever more pressing now because, back at home, things are already looking tough for the new president. In France, growth is almost nonexistent, unemployment has topped 3 million, and the 2013 French budget is the harshest in 30 years in order to bring the deficit down to the figure required by Brussels.</p> <p>Hollande must not only tighten belts while promising to avoid the pain of cuts, but also studiously avoid the word \"austerity\". He also faces difficult choices on how to tackle labour reform, competitiveness, resurrect moribund industry and protect France's generous social welfare system. He is dropping in the polls: the latest, in the Nouvel Observateur, found only 40% had a good opinion of him.</p> <p>It was against this backdrop that Hollande agreed to speak to the Guardian and its partners in the Europa project, for what was his first interview with a British newspaper since his election.</p> <p>The socialist, who grew up hearing both his grandfathers' harrowing stories of the trenches of the first world war, and was once a political protege of Jacques Delors, one of the founding fathers of the single currency, was always pro-European. But that's a difficult path to tread on the French left. The French parliament's recent ratification of the fiscal treaty drawn up by \"Merkozy\" before him was a fraught process, with those on the left of his party rebelling and others on the left taking to the streets. The Socialists are still scarred by splits over the 2005 European constitution referendum and France's \"no\" vote.</p> <p>\"It was a serious warning, it wasn't listened to,\" Hollande said. Now, people had to regain trust in themselves and Europe, he added. \"What's threatening us is not the nation, it's nationalism. It's not Europe, but its absence.\" He said the biggest threat to the European Union was \"no longer being loved. Only being seen as at best an austere cash dispenser or at worst a reform school.\"</p> <p>While Hollande cautioned Merkel not to play to her national audience, he has his own delicate game to play at home in France, a country deeply attached to its sovereignty.</p> <p>Hollande said there was no question of backing down on shrinking the French deficit, not just because of promises to Europe but because from 2007 to 2012 \u2013 under Sarkozy \u2013 public debt leapt from 62% to 90% of GDP. \"Continuing that trend was not sustainable.\"</p> <p>Asked about his working relationship with Merkel, he praised her propensity for straight talking. \"She's clear, she spells things out \u2026 That saves time. And I have the same approach. After that, we're looking to find the best point of arrival from our departure points. It's much easier with explicit departure points, rather than ambiguity. And no one can accuse Angela Merkel of being ambiguous.\"</p> <p>Later, in a warning to David Cameron and other non-eurozone countries not to interfere in the single currency's political workings from the outside, he said: \"Certain countries don't want to join [the eurozone] \u2013 that's their choice. But why should they come telling us how the eurozone should be run? It's a pretension I hear but that I don't think meets the need for coherence.\"</p> <p>Asked if he would risk seeing Britain leave Europe, he said: \"I would like a UK fully engaged in Europe, but I can't decide in place of the British. I see that for the moment they want to be more in retreat. The British are tied by the accords they have signed up to. They can't detach from them. At least they have the merit of clarity. They aren't in the eurozone or budgetary union. I don't intend to force them.\"</p> <p>In a message to Germany that France would stand by the others, he said: \"France is the bridge between northern Europe and southern Europe. I refuse any division. If Europe has been reunified, it's not for it to then fall into egotism or 'each for one's own'. Our duty is to set common rules around the principles of responsibility and solidarity. As a French person, it's for me to ensure Europeans are conscious of belonging to the same group.\"</p> <p>Asked if he had said that to Merkel, he said: \"She knows it perfectly. That was the meaning of her trip to Athens.\"</p> <p>He also dismissed German concerns about the European Central Bank. \"I understand the weight of the memories of hyperinflation, passed down from generation to generation in Germany. The terms of the ECB's intervention avoid all risk of that nature, because the central bank comes in support of the decisions taken at the heart of the ESM. And what is the ESM if not a group of states? So the ECB won't create money when it comes in to support indebted countries. It will contribute to making monetary policy more efficient.</p> <p>\"I've taken on board the democratic arguments put forward across the Rhine. I perfectly admit that parliaments should be able to authorise the engagements demanded of countries both in the budgetary union and banking union. It's on those common principles that we can build solidarity. But there's no time to lose. France is ready.\"</p> <p>He added: \"I'll do everything for Greece to stay in the euro and have the resources it needs by the end of the year, without it having to be necessary to inflict new conditions other than these already admitted by the Samaras government.\" But Hollande said he also felt for the Spanish and Portuguese people \"who had paid dearly for others' excesses\".</p> <p>\"The time has come to offer a perspective beyond austerity,\" he said, adding that Spain must know the precise conditions for getting financing agreed in June. There was no reason to make its burden heavier.</p> <p>Asked if the worst was over, Hollande said: \"Yes, the worst \u2013 in the sense of the fear of the eurozone breaking up \u2013 is over. But the best isn't there yet. It's up to us to build it.\"</p> <h2><strong>Fran\u00e7ois Hollande on:</strong></h2> <p><strong>Britain: </strong>I would like a UK fully engaged in Europe, but I can't decide in place of the British. I see that for the moment they want to be more in retreat. The British are tied by the accords they have signed up to. They can't detach from them. At least they have the merit of clarity. They aren't in the eurozone or budgetary union. I don't intend to force them.</p> <p><strong>Angela Merkel: </strong>She's very sensitive to questions of internal politics and to the demands of her parliament. I understand that, and can respect that. But we all have our own public opinion. Our common responsibility is to put Europe's interests first.</p> <p><strong>The Nobel prize: </strong>It was a tribute to the past and an appeal for the future.</p> <p><strong>Two-speed Europe: </strong>It's already the case Europe has several speeds.</p> <p><strong>Grexit: </strong>I'll do everything for Greece to stay in the euro and have the resources it needs by the end of the year, without it having to be necessary to inflict new conditions other than these already admitted by the Samaras government.</p> <p><strong>Light at the end of the tunnel: </strong>We are near, very near, to an end to the eurozone crisis \u2026 The worst \u2013 in the sense of the fear of the eurozone breaking up \u2013 is over.

  "<p>Given the importance of American national security, it was discouraging that the issue did not come up in 2012's \"town hall\" presidential debate until the last 30 minutes. Fortunately, however, when moderator Candy Crowley finally got around to it, the undecided voter's question was very specific, and quite likely on the minds of many other US citizens. Referring to Washington's denials of requests for additional security from our embassy in Libya, the questioner asked:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"Who was it that denied enhanced security and why?\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Short and to the point. And Barack Obama did not answer it.</p> <p>Instead, following his administration's gameplan on virtually every issue, Obama attacked Mitt Romney for allegedly politicizing the Benghazi attack. Romney responded by correctly noting that Obama and his surrogates had spent weeks erroneously blaming the assassination of four Americans on spontaneous demonstrators protesting the now-infamous Innocence of Muslims video trailer, rather than on a pre-planned terrorist attack.</p> <p>Here, it gets interesting. Obama argued, as his surrogates had several weeks ago, that he <em>had</em> described the 11 September attack as terrorism the day afterward. Crowley came to his defense. But Obama's explanation is nothing but post-facto rationalization, and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/17/candy-crowley-republicans-benghazi-interjection\">Crowley is simply, and embarrassingly, uninformed</a>. Her intervention, which she effectively admitted after the debate was wrong, was as offensive for its error on the facts as it was for its partisanship.</p> <p>We are not simply parsing words. <a href=\"http://www.forextv.com/forex-news-story/full-transcript-of-obama-s-rose-garden-speech-after-sept-11-benghazi-attack\">What Obama said on 12 September</a>, and what he and his aides said in the weeks after, tell volumes about his ideology and worldview, and why his foreign policy is in a state of collapse. On 12 September, Obama described the tragedy in Benghazi, placing it in the context of our painful remembrance of the first 11 September attacks. He spoke evocatively of walking through Arlington Cemetery on 11 September, honoring those who made the ultimate sacrifice in Iraq and Afghanistan. Only then did Obama say:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"No acts of terror will ever shake the resolve of this great nation \u2026\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Obviously, Obama was sweeping widely disparate acts of American courage and character on distant battlefields together in a message of determination, and well said it was. But it was by no means a declaration that the Benghazi attacks were undertaken by terrorists. Quite the contrary. Just a few paragraphs before, Obama had adumbrated the Muhammad video explanation, saying:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"Since our founding, the United States has been a nation that respects all faiths. We reject all efforts to denigrate the religious beliefs of others. But there is absolutely no justification for this type of senseless violence.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Romney's central point remains critical and unanswered by Obama.</p> <p>The real issue is why the administration persisted for weeks in its interpretation that a spontaneous demonstration over the Muhammad video had gotten out of hand. This was not a problem of conflicting intelligence estimates or \"the fog of war\" as Vice-president Biden, Secretary of State Clinton and a host of others have said. As the attack was actually underway, security personnel in Benghazi were on cellphones to the State Department describing the attack \u2013 with no reference, obviously, to a demonstration that had never taken place.</p> <p>On 12 September, the State Department's under-secretary for management, briefing congressional staffers, told them it was a terrorist attack. And a senior administration counter-terrorism official, testifying before Congress just a week after the attack, characterized it as terrorism. And yet, the president spoke before the world at the United Nations thereafter, still linking the assassinations of four Americans to the video.</p> <p>Some characterize Obama's line of argument as a cover-up, an accusation the president theatrically denied during the town hall debate. Willful and repeated misrepresentation is certainly consistent with a cover-up, but it is also consistent with a presidential ideology that is so powerful and pervasive that facts and reality that don't conform to the worldview derived from the ideology are simply rejected.</p> <p>Rather than facts changing the worldview, precisely the opposite happens for Obama. The discordant facts are screened from the president's consciousness and rejected.</p> <p>The Obama storyline is that the \"war on terror\" is over, al-Qaida has been defeated, and Gaddafi's overthrow and the Arab Spring are bringing democracy to Libya. This worldview is also, coincidentally of course, very helpful to the president politically. In fact, however, the reality is quite different from Obama's ideology on all three of these points, as tragically demonstrated in Benghazi on 11 September, notwithstanding the president's stubborn unwillingness to acknowledge it. </p> <p>Thus, Tuesday's debate hardly constitutes a rejection of the Romney assessment, which is solidly grounded in facts, and is being constantly reinforced as new facts come to light. Candy Crowley and her media colleagues may have taken a momentary delight in coming to Obama's side in the debate, but the American people will ultimately not be deceived. The citizen questioner in Long Island has a question that remains unanswered, and there are many more like it. And there are still three weeks until the election.</p>",

Two competitors, each having enjoyed a spell in the lead, now even as they enter the final phase. In the battle of Mitt Romney and Barack Obama, it is 1-1 \u2013 and the decider looms.</p> <p>Officially, that comes on Monday, with the final presidential debate in Florida. The duelling rivals prepare for that with a claim to one win each, Obama's coming at the second time of asking, making up for what had been an awful drubbing a fortnight ago. The momentum will be with him as he prepares for the last face-to-face encounter.</p> <p>And yet politics is not sport. Next week's debate is unlikely to provide the cathartic satisfactions of a fifth set or penalty shootout. For one thing, it is confined to foreign policy, which will prevent the candidates airing fully the argument on which the 6 November election surely turns: what do these two men plan to do in the next four years to turn around an economy that is still ailing?</p> <p>For another, television debates can suffer from the law of diminishing returns. The initial excitement partly comes from the novelty of seeing two men, so long kept apart and having talked only about each other, suddenly standing on the same stage and talking to each other. By Monday, the Obama and Romney Show will almost be looking familiar.</p> <p>Which is not to say the spectacle is anything but compelling. The latest clash at Hofstra University confirmed that both men are unusually skilled debaters. That should go without saying about the president, who was assured even in 2008 when he did not yet have the gravitas of four years in the White House. But it counted as news this time, given the disaster Obama inflicted on himself at the first TV debate in Denver.</p> <p>There he had been lethargic, inert and passive, his head down, his expression glum. The <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/culture/2012/10/cover-story-the-first-presidential-debate.html\" title=\"\">cover of the New Yorker magazine</a> depicted Romney debating with an empty lectern, as if Clint Eastwood's invisible Obama had shown up for the event. He was so listless, so absent, one former Democratic strategist revived in conversation with the Guardian a concern he had guiltily raised once before: could the president be suffering from clinical depression?</p> <p>That Obama vanished in the second debate, replaced by a man who looked like he truly wanted the job and was ready to fight for it. Whereas he had refused countless opportunities to get the better of Romney in Denver, this time he moved fast and aggressively, accusing his opponent of failing to tell the truth within the first exchanges.</p> <p>Eighteen minutes in, they were going mano a mano, standing in each other's space and squaring up to each other, all but puffing out their chests and baring their teeth. Audience members later admitted they feared the two men might come to blows. But Obama, once deemed too professorial for the gladiatorial demands of US presidential politics, stood his ground.</p> <p>Romney was no pushover, once again <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/decision2012/2012-presidential-debate-president-obama-and-mitt-romneys-remarks-at-hofstra-university-on-oct-16-running-transcript/2012/10/16/be8bfb9a-17dd-11e2-9855-71f2b202721b_print.html\" title=\"\">putting his case crisply and clearly</a>. Casting himself as the seasoned CEO and corporate turnaround artist ready to do for America what he had done for the beleaguered 2002 Winter Olympics. \"I know what it takes to balance budgets,\" he said. \"I've done it my entire life.\"</p> <p>The result was a hard-fought and absorbing contest. The veteran conservative columnist George Will said he had seen every TV debate since the birth of the format in 1960, when Kennedy took on Nixon, and <a href=\"http://dailycaller.com/2012/10/17/george-will-hofstra-presidential-debate-immeasurably-the-best-in-american-history/\" title=\"\">\"this was immeasurably the best\"</a>.</p> <p>Now that the two men are even on debate wins, it's conceivable that one will deliver a knockout blow \u2013 or stumble with an irrecoverable gaffe \u2013 on Monday that will settle the matter. More likely is that the campaign will now be settled away from the cameras, by those less dramatic, less visible forces that can nevertheless determine the outcome of modern US elections.</p> <p>The first of these is what political operatives call the \"ground game\", the unglamorous, mechanical business of getting people to vote. In this, Obama holds a clear advantage, just as he did in 2008 when he stunned Hillary Clinton with the depth of his grassroots organisation. In the <a href=\"http://www.dallasnews.com/news/politics/national-politics/20121009-obama-romney-race-across-battleground-state-ohio.ece\" title=\"\">must-win state of Ohio</a> for example, without which no Republican has won the presidency, Obama has just opened his 120th field office. Romney is thought to have 36.</p> <p>Second is the under-appreciated fact that the US election is not strictly speaking just on 6 November. <a href=\"http://firstread.nbcnews.com/_news/2012/09/21/14016432-early-voting-half-of-us-begins-voting-by-tomorrow?lite\" title=\"\">It began in some states on 21 September</a> and has continued ever since, thanks to early, postal and absentee voting. Americans are able to cast their ballots now in at least 40 states.</p> <p>That, too, is a source of encouragement for Obama supporters, since much of that early voting will have happened before Romney's breakthrough debate performance, thereby locking in the advantage the president held at the time. A <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/10/14/us-usa-campaign-poll-idUSBRE8991FR20121014\" title=\"\">Reuters/Ipsos poll</a> shows Obama leading Romney by 59 to 31% among the 7% of the electorate who have already voted.</p> <p>There's another fact of modern US electoral life which might help the president. The TV debates have an afterlife \u2013 on YouTube, Tumblr or Twitter \u2013 that did not exist before. \"Any misstep is played over and over again. It gets amplified, expanding on impact like a dum-dum bullet,\" said one strategist.</p> <p>The current victim is Mitt Romney, watching as his curious reference to <a href=\"http://andrewsullivan.thedailybeast.com/2012/10/meme-of-the-day.html\" title=\"\">\"binders full of women\"</a> \u2013 referring to female applicants for jobs in his administration as Massachusetts governor \u2013 and the moment the debate moderator told him he had got his facts wrong on Libya both go viral.</p> <p>None of which, of course, helps the undecided voter to know who has the best plan for the next four years. But the number of such truly undecided voters is getting smaller by the hour. Winning this election may soon be less about persuasion than hard graft. Like many a sporting contest, this battle will not be settled by inspiration. It's perspiration that counts now.</p>",
  "<p>Mitt Romney's real success in the first presidential debate was to not emerge from the wings wearing horns and carrying a pitchfork, demanding that all the women in the audience <a href=\"www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/sep/22/republican-party-wrong-side-history-female-equality\">submit immediately to transvaginal ultrasounds</a> and relieving them of 23 cents for every dollar they happened to have on them. That is what the Obama campaign \u2013 with the help of many elected Republican officials who have been championing policies that slip easily into such shocking scenarios \u2013 prepared swing voters to expect.</p> <p>When, instead, he came off as genial and direct, a proclaimed lover of both Big Bird and green energy, a lot of Americans appeared to accept this version of Romney. Polling in the immediate aftermath of the first debate showed that the Obama-Romney gender gap, which had been as high as 20 points in some states, had shrunk to almost nothing. <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2012/10/15/swing-states-poll-women-voters-romney-obama/1634791/\">Democratic pollster Celinda Lake told USA Today</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"Women went into the debate actively disliking Romney, and they came out thinking he might understand their lives and might be able to get something done for them.\"</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/17/obama-campaign-trail-debate-romney\">In Tuesday night's second presidential debate</a>, however, Mitt Romney not only failed to further his case that he understood women's lives, he made the mistake of revealing exactly what it is he might be able to do for them: commission a \"binder full\" of their resumes.</p> <p>Right. I guess this is what makes him a \"small-government conservative\". Forget creating a law that allows women to sue for equal pay (the Ledbetter Act, Obama's first major piece of legislation); just personally hire a woman every once in a while.</p> <p>There were certainly moments that I found more offensive than Romney's unintentionally hilarious creation of a new collective noun (\"a binder of women\" \u2013 like, you know, a convocation of eagles), even though it edged right up to the margins of implying actual physical harm. (Binder? I hardly knew her!) There was, for instance, his weird insistence that traditional families could prevent gun violence \u2013 as everyone knows there were no mass shooting murders until gay marriage was invented in 2003.</p> <p>And there's the fact that Romney's whole \"binder full of women\" anecdote was completely bogus: he commissioned no such binder; it was provided to him by a bipartisan coalition of women's groups, which had created it prior to his election. Further, the number of women working in Massachusetts government actually <em>went down</em> during his tenure. I guess it wasn't really that full a binder.</p> <p>The biggest problem with making voters believe that Romney (or the Republican party in general) is conducting a \"war on women\" has been, up until now, that Romney and his colleagues just don't seem very scary. The children's show aficionado and advocate of cautious capitalism of the first debate is a case in point, but even the more combative presence in New York on Tuesday evening doesn't seem like someone that would do women any harm (though he would totally hit Obama if he could).</p> <p>But the war on women is something more pernicious even than a \"cold war\". Not only do we rarely see a true battle (exception provided by Todd Akin), but one of the major combatants doesn't really believe their actions count as aggressions. In a contest over civil rights, after all, the oppressor doesn't feel any pain until <em>they</em> start to lose. </p> <p>Romney just got a paper cut. We'll see if he can make the bleeding stop by election day.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Editor's note: this article originally referred to a \"convocation of owls\"; that collective noun correctly applies to eagles. The amendment was made at 3.30pm ET on 17 October</em></p>",

  "<p>Barack Obama hit the campaign trail only hours after coming out on top in a feisty debate with Mitt Romney that went a long way to calming the sense of panic that had begun to enter Democratic ranks.</p> <p>Obama, transformed from the listless, unfocused candidate who lost badly to Romney in the first presidential debate in Denver a fortnight ago, landed damaging blows on his Republican rival in telling exchanges over women's rights, the Benghazi consulate attack and tax proposals.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/17/romney-binders-full-of-women\">An odd, patronising remark Romney made</a> to \"whole binders full of women\", in reference to job appointments, may end up bringing to a halt a shift of women voters in Romney's direction that has been worrying the Obama campaign.</p> <p>It will be several days before reliable polls gauge the overall response to the debate but Democrats expressed confidence that Obama's showing would lift them.</p> <p>\"I don't know what the polls are going to say but I feel very, very good about going into the next 20 days or so,\" vice-president Joe Biden told ABC.</p> <p>However, although Obama was deemed to have won the second presidential debate in Long Island, it was not as lopsided as the first and so is unlikely to have the same dramatic impact on the polls. Since Denver, Romney has eaten into Obama's lead and the two are now tied nationally and in most of the swing states, suggesting a tight finish on 6 November.</p> <p>Romney had a few good moments of his own in the debate, especially over the economy, with an answer that might have resonated with voters. </p> <p>\"I think you know better,\" Romney told a questioner. \"I think you know that these last four years haven't been so good as the president just described, and that you don't feel like you're confident that the next four years are going to be much better either.\"</p> <p>Obama, after flying back to Washington from the debate on Tuesday night, left the White House at about 8am, heading for two swing states, Iowa and Ohio, the latter being the state that may in the end decide the election.</p> <p>As part of the push to hold Ohio that has seen Democrats flooding the state with volunteers, Bill Clinton and Bruce Springsteen are appearing together at a free concert in Parma.</p> <p>Romney also campaigned in a swing state, Virginia.</p> <p>He and Obama go into the third and final presidential debate, in Boca Raton, Florida, on Monday, having won one debate each. The Florida debate is devoted to foreign policy, which, in theory, should be easier for Obama, who as president deals with security and overseas issues daily.</p> <p>The Obama team, in the spin room next to the Long Island debating hall, were in better spirits than their Romney counterparts.</p> <p>Conservatives \u2013 some of them, anyway \u2013 reluctantly awarded the night to Obama. The conservative commentator Charles Krauthammer told Fox News: \"I think on points, if you were scoring it on points, Obama wins.\"</p> <p>On the same network Bush's former strategist, Karl Rove, who runs one of the biggest Super Pacs backing Romney, criticised Obama for failing to set out what he would do in a second term but also conceded that Romney had made mistakes. </p> <p>\"Governor Romney, in my opinion, made a mistake asking questions of President Obama. You never ask a question and give your opponent a chance to offer an answer,\" Rove said.</p> <p>In the 90-minute debate, watched by tens of millions of Americans, Obama appeared to have learned lessons from the previous debate, retaining eye contact with Romney, with the questioners and with the camera, instead of burying his head in a notebook.</p> <p>His personal hostility towards Romney was apparent during several exchanges when the two went head-to-head. He accused Romney of being more extreme on social issues than George W Bush and described his tax plans as \"a sketchy deal\".</p> <p>But the most politically damaging moment for Romney came when he bungled his attack on the Obama administration's handling of the assault on the Benghazi consulate in which the US ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans were killed.</p> <p>It should have been an easy one for Romney, after days of shifting accounts from administration officials who initially blamed the attack on a protest over an anti-Islamic film but have now conceded it was a pre-planned terrorist attack.</p> <p>Obama's response provided the most moving and powerful part of the night. \"The day after the attack, governor, I stood in the Rose Garden, and I told the American people and the world that we are going to find out exactly what happened, that this was an act of terror.</p> <p>\"And the suggestion that anybody in my team, whether the secretary of state, our UN ambassador, anybody on my team would play politics or mislead when we've lost four of our own, governor, is offensive. That's not what we do. That's not what I do as president. That's not what I do as commander-in -chief.\"</p> <p>When Romney tried to challenge the president over his assertion that he had described it as an act of terror, the moderator Candy Crowley intervened to say that Obama was correct. \"He did, in fact, sir,\" she told Romney, who was unable to counter-attack.</p> <p>Conservatives criticised Crowley's intervention, pointing out that Obama had been talking generally and ambiguously about an act of terror and it had not necessarily been a direct reference to Benghazi.</p> <p>Obama also hit home in an exchange over Romney's investments in China. When the Republican responded that Obama should look at the investments in his own pension, Obama, with his trademark grin, shot back: \"I don't look at my pension. It's not as big as yours.\"</p> <p>The power of the quip was that it encapsulated the image the Democrats have been labouring to put across of Romney as rich and elitist, in a different league from the majority of Americans.</p> <p>The two are battling hard for women's votes. Obama has for months enjoyed a bigger share of support among potential women voters but Romney has been closing the gap over the last fortnight. But he may have lost some with an odd comment about when governor of Massachusetts he was concerned about lack of women in his cabinet and asked women's groups for names. He said they came forward with \"whole binders full of women\".</p>",
  "<p>Britain is urging the Palestinian leadership to delay its bid for upgraded status at the United Nations general assembly, warning that the move is likely to be detrimental to US re-engagement with the peace process following next month's presidential election.</p> <p>Palestinian sources expressed anger at the British move, saying the UK had been recruited to US opposition to their bid. But they insisted they would press for a vote on their UN status by 15 November and were confident of winning a majority. At least 115 countries, and possibly as many as 150, out of a total of 193, are forecast to vote in favour of upgraded \"non-member state\" status.</p> <p>British diplomats have told Palestinian officials that a vote in the weeks following the US election would significantly decrease the chances of the next US administration taking steps to get peace negotiations re-started. They are also warning of potentially serious financial consequences for the Palestinian Authority if it goes ahead.</p> <p>They say they understand the Palestinians' frustration after at least a year of stagnation in the peace process while Israeli settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem have continued to expand, threatening the viability of a Palestinian state. \"There is a lack of a political horizon, lack of hope for their people and continued economic uncertainty. It's very bleak at the moment,\" said a diplomatic source.</p> <p>However, they added that a UN vote on upgrading the Palestinians' status would seriously complicate US re-engagement in the peace process, which British and other European countries are urging in the coming months. \"We want to see the US take a lead once the presidential elections are out of the way. The US role is key and we stand ready to help them,\" the source said.</p> <p>The US has clearly stated its opposition to the Palestinians' UN move. Its envoy, Susan Rice, said on Monday it would \"jeopardise the peace process\". The Palestinians counter that there is no viable peace process and they are pursuing an alternative peaceful and diplomatic international strategy.</p> <p>Last month, a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/01/us-warns-europe-palestinians-un\" title=\"\">US memorandum warned European governments</a> against supporting the Palestinian bid, saying such a move \"would be extremely counterproductive\" and threatening \"significant negative consequences\" for the Palestinian Authority, including financial sanctions.</p> <p>After last year's failed attempt to win full recognition for the state of Palestine, the US Congress froze $200m (\u00a3123m) in aid to the authority. The decision was later overturned, but diplomats say the money has yet to be dispersed while the US waits to see the outcome of this year's UN move.</p> <p>According to Palestinian sources, the US is also trying to raise the threshold for a successful vote at the general assembly from a simple majority to two-thirds. \"They are playing every card they can. But even if they do get it changed to two-thirds, we are still going to win,\" said a Palestinian official.</p> <p>Israel is also vehemently opposed to the Palestinian move. An upgrade from \"observer entity\" to \"non-member observer state\" would give the Palestinians access to bodies such as the international criminal court, in which they could seek to pursue legal cases against Israel over settlements, the occupation of the West Bank and the blockade of Gaza.</p> <p>Britain views 2013 as a critical year for the future of the Israeli-Palestinian peace process, warning that continued settlement expansion in East Jerusalem and the West Bank is jeopardising the prospects of a Palestinian state being created alongside Israel.</p> <p>\"We're trying to think creatively about how we move forward. But it's difficult if, in the same breath, we're having to think tactically about how to handle a UN bid. So our message to the Palestinians is that going to the UN straightaway could be counterproductive and that a bit more time will help us to help them,\" said a diplomatic source.</p> <p>Palestinian chief negotiator, Saeb Erekat, has been invited to London before the end of the month to discuss the UN bid with UK government officials.</p> <p>Hanan Ashrawi, a member of the Palestine Liberation Organisation executive committee, said: \"We are trying to do our best to rescue the two-state solution, prevent violence and bring international law to bear.</p> <p>\"The Americans are perfectly capable of doing Israel's work without recruiting the UK to help. The UK has a long history in this region and should be the first to recognise the damage it caused to the Palestinians in the past. They owe us at least the minimum of even-handedness.\"</p> <p>A spokesperson for the UK foreign office said: \"We have been clear that we see negotiations toward a two-state solution as the best way to meet the national aspirations of both Israelis and Palestinians. Along with EU and international partners we are urging both sides to focus on dialogue, to avoid steps that could undermine the prospects for peace and to work towards the resumption of direct negotiations without preconditions.</p> <p>\"If a [general assembly] resolution were to be put to a vote, we would need to consider our position. The UK would want to use its vote in a way that makes a return to talks more, rather than less, likely.\"</p>",
  "<p>It was the moment that women's issues finally took centre stage in a presidential debate, although probably not in the way Mitt Romney would have wanted. </p> <p>Within minutes of the Republican presidential candidate uttering his now-infamous line about \"binders full of women\", the phrase had unleashed its own hashtag, Twitter and Facebook account, and a binder full of bile from critics furious at its perceived patronising tone.</p> <p>Romney used the line to demonstrate his track record on pay equality for women, claiming that when he was governor of Massachusetts he was told the only applicants for positions in his state cabinet were men.</p> <p>\"And I said: \"Well, gosh, can't we \u2013&#xa0;can't we find some \u2013 some women that are also qualified?\" Romney told the debate audience. \"And \u2013 and so we \u2013 we took a concerted effort to go out and find women who had backgrounds that could be qualified to become members of our cabinet. I went to a number of women's groups and said: 'Can you help us find folks,' and they brought us whole binders full of women.\"</p> <p>Within minutes the phrase was trending on Twitter. But as well as being ripped apart on social media Romney also found the veracity of his claim being called into question. According to David Bernstein of the Phoenix, a Boston newspaper, the story Romney told an estimated 50-60 million viewers was untrue.</p> <p><a href=\"http://blog.thephoenix.com/BLOGS/talkingpolitics/archive/2012/10/16/mind-the-binder.aspx\">Bernstein reported</a> that there was indeed an effort in Massachusetts to find qualified women for cabinet positions.</p> <p>But Romney nor his staff, nor even his party, had anything to do with it, he said.</p> <p>\"What actually happened was that in 2002 \u2013 prior to the election, not even knowing yet whether it would be a Republican or Democratic administration \u2013 a bipartisan group of women in Massachusetts formed MassGap to address the problem of few women in senior leadership positions in state government,\" he wrote. \"There were more than 40 organizations involved with the Massachusetts Women's Political Caucus (also bipartisan) as the lead sponsor.</p> <p>\"They did the research and put together the binder full of women qualified for all the different cabinet positions, agency heads, and authorities and commissions. They presented this binder to Governor Romney when he was elected.\"</p> <p>Not only was Romney not involved in the effort to find qualified women, he did not pay much attention to the results, Bernstein said, debunking another of Romney's claims on the hot button topic of equality in the workplace.</p> <p>Romney told Candy Crowley, the moderator of Tuesday night's debate, of his pride at his achievements.</p> <p>\"I was proud of the fact that after I staffed my Cabinet and my senior staff, that the University of New York in Albany did a survey of all 50 states, and concluded that mine had more women in senior leadership positions than any other state in America.</p> <p>Now, one of the reasons I was able to get so many good women to be part of that team was because of our recruiting effort.\"</p> <p>Bernstein, who checked with several people involved in MassGap, who confirmed the reporters take on events, said:</p> <blockquote> <p>First of all, according to MassGAP and MWPC, Romney did appoint 14 women out of his first 33 senior-level appointments, which is a reasonably impressive 42%. However, as I have reported before, those were almost all to head departments and agencies that he didn't care about \u2013 and in some cases, that he quite specifically wanted to not really do anything. None of the senior positions Romney cared about \u2013 budget, business development, etc \u2013 went to women.</p> <p>Secondly, a UMass-Boston study found that the percentage of senior-level appointed positions held by women actually declined throughout the Romney administration, from 30.0% prior to his taking office, to 29.7% in July 2004, to 27.6% near the end of his term in November 2006.</p> </blockquote> <p>A <a href=\"http://www.boston.com/politicalintelligence/2012/10/16/fact-check-romney-record-hiring-women/r3gqpykaQudNNqigmLZfuJ/story.htm\">fact check in the Boston Globe</a> on Romney's hiring of women in the private sector also found his record there to be wanting. Romney did not have any women partners as CEO of Bain Capital during the 1980s and 1990s, it found.</p> <p>Romney has gained ground in opinion polls among women voters, a position Obama has traditionally held, since the first presidential debate.</p> <p>But his latest comments, which are unlikely to be forgotten if social media is anything to go by, will do him few favours.</p> <p>Women in a snap poll by the Democratic Lake Research Partners picked Obama as the debate winner by 56-34%. Men also gave Obama the victory, but by a narrower 49-43 percent, <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/10/17/us-usa-campaign-women-idUSBRE89G0AY20121017\">according to Reuters</a>.</p>",

But the Obama they wanted to see \u2013 aggressive, quick to paint Romney as a re-run of the worst of the Bush years, flashes of indignant fury that his administration's credibility is being questioned \u2013 may or may not be who those few remaining undecided voters wanted to see. Obama's performance Tuesday night will do wonders for Democratic morale, but we may not see much shift in the tracking poll numbers.</p> <p>CNN's coverage offers a fascinating live response from undecided voters: judging from the twin lines on the bottom of the screen (one for men, the other for women) both candidates did pretty well and voters didn't like it when either man attacked the other. Of course, candidates in races at all levels wouldn't use negative attacks if they didn't work; one wonders if the diving lines indicated the respondents genuinely didn't like the attacks, or whether they've just been conditioned to know they're <em>supposed</em> to express disapproval of them.</p> <p>The snap polls, too, pointed to an Obama win in the marginal-to-modest range: in CBS News' instant poll, 37% said Obama won the debate, 30% said Romney, and 33% said it was a tie. Interestingly, 65% said Romney won on the issue of economy, compared to 34% who said Obama. In CNN's poll of registered voters who watched the debate, 46% said Obama won the debate, 39% said Romney won the debate.</p> <p>Those results indicate it wasn't a bad night for Mitt Romney, and there was little chance he would equal the drubbing he dealt the president in the first debate. But a little more than an hour into the debate, he completely mishandled one of the most potent issues \u2013 how the administration characterized the attack on our diplomats in Benghazi, Libya. He seemed to know it, as his energy slid for the remainder of the debate.</p> <p>Between the questioners at the debate and Frank Luntz's focus group on Fox News, one of the lessons of the night is that very few people who claim to be undecided are genuinely undecided. The early questioner who mentioned that Energy Secretary Steven Chu has said that the overall goal of the nation's energy policy is not to bring down the prices of gas \u2013 no chance he's genuinely undecided. (<a href=\"http://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2012/10/09/dems_don_t_want_lower_gas_prices\">Conservative radio talkshow host Rush Limbaugh talked about the issue</a> and mentioned Chu last week.) One woman who asked the candidates about unequal pay for women \u2013 an easy lay-up for Obama to mention the Lilly Ledbetter Act. The majority of Luntz's focus group of allegedly undecided voters loathed Obama's performance, and during a furious denunciation of Obama's presidency, one panelist let slip the term \"bullshitting\" on the air. Are we to believe that guy really doesn't know who he's going to vote for in November?</p> <p>The \"town hall\" debate format has been around for 20 years, and it may be time to consider retiring it at the presidential level. The questioners tend to freeze under the lights; almost all of the queries are variations of \"what can you do for me?\"; the candidates have been conditioned to repeat the questioner's name and emote sympathy&#xa0; to the point of overacting; and way too much attention is paid to the candidates' body language as they get up and down off those high stools.</p> <p><em>Jim Geraghty is a contributing editor to the National Review and writes the Campaign Spot blog</em></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/michael-cohen\">Michael Cohen</a>: 'Romney's reliance on tired, substance-less talking points was startling'</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397925060\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Observer/Columnist/Columnists/2011/8/6/1312655160523/Michael-Cohen-003.jpg\" alt=\"Michael Cohen\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Michael Cohen Photograph: Observer</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Well, that was unexpected.</p> <p>Going into last night's second presidential debate I fully expected Barack Obama to do better than he did in the first debate in Denver. But what was so surprising was not just how good Obama was (and he was quite good), but how bad Mitt Romney was.</p> <p>It all started with the first question, posed by an undecided college student concerned about his job prospects after graduation. It was a softball, one that a candidate with an even the modicum of an economic plan could knock out of the park.</p> <p>And Romney whiffed on it \u2013 serving up meaningless platitudes like this:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"I know what it takes to create good jobs again. I know what it takes to make sure that you have the kind of opportunity you deserve. And kids across this country are going to recognize, we're bringing back an economy.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>There was not a single policy offered to support Romney's confidence. For a candidate whose entire candidacy is premised on the notion that he will fix the economy and create jobs, it was a glaring moment. It was like this the entire evening: Romney's lack of specificity and his reliance on tired, substance-less talking points was startling.</p> <p>For example, when asked how he would ensure women received equal pay in the workforce, Romney bragged about hiring women for his administration when he was governor of Massachusetts. It was an answer that reeked of tokenism. On taxes, he continued to offer vagueness about how he'll pay for his 20% across-the-board tax cut. And bizarrely, he cued up Obama to reference his 47% comment by saying he wanted to be president of 100% of Americans. It was like he handed the president the piece of two-by-four with which to hit him.</p> <p>But his worst moment came during a question on Libya when Romney claimed that the president had never called the recent assassination of the US ambassador in Benghazi \"act of terror\". Obama had, in fact, done just that \u2013 a point that moderator, Candy Crowley pointed out, embarrassingly for Romney. But what I found most striking about that particular exchange was what came right before \u2013 President Obama's initial response to Romney:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"The day after the attack, governor, I stood in the Rose Garden and I told the American people in the world that we are going to find out exactly what happened. That this was an act of terror and I also said that we're going to hunt down those who committed this crime. And then a few days later, I was there greeting the caskets coming into Andrews Air Force Base and grieving with the families.</p> <p>\"And the suggestion that anybody in my team, whether the secretary of state, our UN ambassador, anybody on my team, would play politics or mislead when we've lost four of our own, governor, is offensive. That's not what we do. That's not what I do as president, that's not what I do as commander-in-chief.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>This was a very different Obama than the one we saw in Denver \u2013 focused, passionate (but not strident), aggressive (but not obnoxious). On virtually every answer, Obama did exactly what he didn't do in Denver: he defended his record and then opened up a tough line of attack against his opponent. There was nothing more important for Obama to do last night than offer voters a clear contrast between the two candidates. On nearly every question, Obama did just that.</p> <p>It was a strong performance from a candidate whose back was against the wall; but it was one that's effectiveness was matched only by the failure of his opponent.</p> <p><em>Michael Cohen is a US political columnist for the Guardian and Observer</em></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/ana-marie-cox\">Ana Marie Cox</a>: 'The highlight was Obama's full-throated defense of reproductive rights'</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397925061\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2011/9/28/1317225418768/Annmarie_Cox.jpg\" alt=\"Ana Marie Cox\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>There were flashier moments in the debate \u2013 the Libya fact-check, the oil permits body-space infringement \u2013 but, for me, the highlight of the debate was President Obama's full-throated defense of the idea that reproductive rights \"are not just women's issues, these are family issues, they are economic issues.\" Up until now, even the Obama campaign has been leaning on the \"war on women\" meme as something that is somehow separate from the economy, that \"social issues\" are a kind of marginal voter-persuasion issue \u2013 on par with \"who you would rather have a beer with?\"</p> <p>I've argued before that almost every so-called social issue is wrapped up in economics (marriage equality and social stability help communities thrive, for instance), but contraception has been essential to women's <em>economic</em> equality for, well, probably ever. But <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/03/26/birth-control-access-womens-wages_n_1380250.html?ref=politics&amp;ir=Politics\">studies of recent history</a> are more concrete:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"About one-third of women's wage gains throughout the 1990s can be attributed to changing laws in the 1960s and 70s that lowered the age at which women could legally access the pill.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>I'm not sure if this means that <em>voters</em> will make the connection the president did \u2013 that Romney's policies would potentially undo that progress \u2013 but I'm grateful that at least one of the men on that stage understands what I think most women intuitively do: that when we talk about having control over our bodies, we're also talking about having control over our lives.</p> <p>Also, I've never been in a binder, but I am pretty sure I'd rather be able to sue for equal pay.</p> <p><em>Ana Marie Cox is the Guardian's senior US political columnist</em></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/jamesantle\">James Antle</a>: 'The most disastrous exchange for Romney concerned Libya'</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397925062\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2008/06/02/james_antle_140x140.jpg\" alt=\"James Antle\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Whatever else can be said, this was a much more spirited Barack Obama in the second debate. The president was much more willing to challenge Mitt Romney on his facts, on his record, and on his career in business.</p> <p>We heard about Bain, the 47%, and outsourcing of US jobs to China. Obama even unfavorably compared Romney to George W Bush, the president responsible for the next highest spending binge.</p> <p>But Romney remained spirited as well. He did not simply allow Candy Crowley to steamroll him and give the president favorable treatment. He contested Obama's most politically damaging claims.</p> <p>Romney was particularly effective in advertising the undeniable distance between the president's 2008 campaign promises and the rather less impressive 2012 record. Obama still was shy on details of what he would do in a second term, aside from continuing to present mediocrity as better than what a Republican would do in office.</p> <p>Yet the most disastrous exchange for Romney concerned Libya, where he concerned himself more with talking points and chest-beating than actual problems with Obama's interventionist approach. Indeed, Obama undermined Romney by unequivocally claiming full responsibility, rather than blaming Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.</p> <p>If that is any indication of how the third and final debate, focusing on foreign policy, will go, then Romney \u2013 the candidate who has appeared to commit himself to arming Syrian rebels, a more hawkish stance toward Iran, and disapproving of the the largely Iraqi-mandate withdrawal from Iraq\u2013 is in serious trouble.</p> <p><em>James Antle is editor of the Daily Caller News Foundation and a senior editor at the American Spectator</em></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/cheri-jacobus\">Cheri Jacobus</a>: 'Obama was testy, whiny, overly aggressive'</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397925063\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Global/content/icons/2012/1/3/1325610796868/cherijacobus_140x140.jpg\" alt=\"Cheri Jacobus\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>The question leading up to the second debate between Governor Mitt Romney and President Barack Obama was \"which Obama will show up tonight?\"</p> <p>The abysmal performance by Obama in the first debate was not something the president's supporters wanted to see repeated. Mitt Romney needed to match his performance from the first debate. Barack Obama needed to do significantly better than he did in the first debate.</p> <p>Both men achieved those objectives. Romney reminded voters of the poor Obama record of these past four years, and was armed with facts, while Obama claimed Romney was not telling the truth, yet did not seem equipped to articulate just where Romney was incorrect.</p> <p>While Obama at least seemed present and possessing a pulse in the second debate, he was testy, whiny, overly aggressive, and even asked for \u2013 and received \u2013 a highly inappropriate level of help and support from the debate moderator. Mitt Romney was presidential, just as he was in the first debate. He had command of the facts, but was repeatedly interrupted by Obama and the moderator.</p> <p>Obama claimed Mitt Romney was untruthful, but could not be not specific. However, Romney clearly and correctly stated that President Obama was, indeed, untruthful in his claims that federal oil production was up. Obama denied it, and the moderator did not step in to call him on it.</p> <p>Obama (and the moderator) also claimed he called the 11 September assassination attack in Benghazi that killed Ambassador Christopher Stevens and three other Americans a \"terrorist attack\" the following day in a Rose Garden speech. The transcript does not reveal that specifically, but in the days that followed, President Obama on numerous occasions claimed the attack was due to a video that was deemed insulting to Islam. He has since backed away from those comments and is now denying he made them, as part of his ever-shifting statements on Benghazi. The debate moderator let him get away with that one, too.</p> <p>While Obama likely succeeded in helping to clean up the mess he'd made with his disappointed base, Mitt Romney did not lose anything, and maintains the momentum from the first debate.</p> <p><em>Cheri Jacobus is a Republican political strategist, pundit and writer</em></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/nancy-goldstein\">Nancy Goldstein</a>: 'The relaxed, engaging Professor Obama connected the dots'</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397925064\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Global/content/icons/2011/6/8/1307540115667/nancygoldstein_140x140.jpg\" alt=\"Nancy Goldstein\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Mitt Romney isn't entirely to blame for last night's resurgence by Barack Obama.

When a young woman asked how his administration intends to address inequalities in the workplace, particularly around pay, it was the relaxed, engaging Professor Obama who connected the dots, moving easily from mentioning the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act his administration passed in 2009, to making the case that equal pay for equal work has moved from being a \"women's\" or \"family\" issue, to become a key issue for the middle class, period.</p> <p>Romney, who punted when asked earlier this year whether he supported the Ledbetter Act, could only squirm. Worse yet, his longwinded non-response was: a) a <a href=\"http://elections.americablog.com/2012/10/romneys-binder-full-of-women-story-was-a-lie.html\">lie</a>, and b) included the \"whole binders full of women\" comment that has, at last count, inspired over a dozen social media equivalents of cover bands including Tumblr accounts, Facebook pages,websites, and several Twitter feeds, with <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Romneys_Binder\">Romneys_Binder</a> leading the pack at 14,000+ followers.</p> <p>Like all great competitors, last night's Obama read the opposition well and created his own shot. While Romney tried to recover his Just for Men cool after flubbing the Ledbetter question, the president linked women's success in the workplace to healthcare; healthcare to contraception; and contraception (as well as mammograms and screenings for cervical cancer) to Planned Parenthood, which he supports and Romney actively wants to defund. Obama reminded his audience that while his healthcare plan mandates free contraception as part of standard insurance, Romney supports <a href=\"http://www.blogforchoice.com/archives/2012/03/romney-bosses-s.html\">repealing that provision through the Blunt amendment</a>.</p> <p>Obama's move was the debate equivalent of driving past an opponent to the basket, then dunking on him.

This was an extremely confronational encounter \u2013 <a href=\"http://p.nowthisnews.com/entry/192/\" title=\"\">both men were effectively calling each other liars</a> \u2013 but the president did not come over as unduly aggressive, because his relaxed appearance balanced his <a href=\"http://p.nowthisnews.com/entry/195/\" title=\"\">barbed words</a>. This is why he was able to get laughs from the audience, which Romney could not achieve.</p> <p>Do appearances matter in politics? Of course they do.

In 1960, <a href=\"http://www.history.com/topics/kennedy-nixon-debates\" title=\"\">Republican candidate Richard Nixon stood against Democrat John F Kennedy</a>; their televised debates were a disaster for Nixon.

The surprise of this US election is that, after the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-16416324\" title=\"\">far-right freakshow of the Republican nominations race</a>, Romney is a comparatively moderate candidate (on some issues) with a <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/news/politics/la-pn-romney-massachusetts-record-20121003,0,1950072.story\" title=\"\">bipartisan track record as former governor of Massachusetts</a>, which is not exactly Texas.</p> <p>But in their second debate, Obama made him look old and square. Romney started to <a href=\"http://p.nowthisnews.com/entry/199/\" title=\"\">seem more plastic and sound more synthesised</a>. Sometimes, appearances are truthful. It was not a flashy, contrived PR image that brought the president back into the race as he seeks a second term: it was an aura of authenticity. His visual self-presentation was powerful, stern and moving as he <a href=\"http://p.nowthisnews.com/entry/201/\" title=\"\">denounced his opponent's \"offensive\" remarks on Libya</a>.</p> <p>He looked, literally, an upright man.

The issue is that many sources also seemed to suggest that, in the words of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/chucktodd/status/258396461845315584\">NBC's Chuck Todd</a>, \"Romney seemed to be ready for it.\" That would seem to suggest more of a tie than anything else. </p> <p>The question over whether this narrative becomes a solid Obama victory will likely revolve around video playback of the many confrontations between the candidates. One, in particular, stood out \u2013 regarding Libya and whether the terrorist attacks on the US consul to Libya and others in Benghazi were or were not called a terrorist act by President Obama. It was a crucial moment in the debate and Obama claimed that he'd said on 12 September that it was a terrorist attack, while Romney disagreed. Moderator Candy Crowley, acting as impromptu fact-checker, mostly sided with Obama. The showdown left a \"mark\" on Romney, said Todd.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2012/10/16/fact-check-did-obama-really-call-consulate-attack-in-libya-act-terror/\">whole truth is fuzzier</a> than the debate let on. In his 12cSeptember remarks in the Rose Garden, Obama did use the word \"terror\", but he didn't refer specifically to the events in Benghazi when using the word. This has become <a href=\"http://www.buzzfeed.com/mckaycoppins/romney-campaign-will-litigate-libya\">a focal point</a> in a lot of post-debate discussion \u2013 and Republicans have fought back hard. How the media handles this Libya question and the American people's response could be key in determining \"who won\" the debate as a whole.</p> <p>Second, Obama's victory this time around doesn't match the scale of Romney's from the first debate in the polls. Romney won that debate by a recording-breaking 42 points in the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/oct/04/mitt-romney-won-debate-win-election\">CNN poll</a> and took undecideds by 24 points in the <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-250_162-57525698/poll-uncommitted-voters-say-romney-wins-debate/?pageNum=2&amp;tag=page\">CBS survey</a>. We also know that respondents in the CNN poll \u2013 by an 18 percentage point margin \u2013 were more likely to say they would vote for Romney over Obama thanks to the first debate, compared to a tie on this question after the second debate.</p> <p>And despite these massive wins, Romney picked up a comparatively small <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/oct/08/romney-debate-bounce-real-but-fading\">4 points nationally</a>. We can therefore try to determine how a smaller Obama win in the second debate insta-polls might predict how much ground he will gain. The ratio of winning the debate and picking up national support from the first debate was along the lines of 10.5 (a 42-point debate victory margin over a 4-point ultimate gain) in the CNN poll, and 6 (a 24-point debate victory margin over a 4-point ultimate gain) in the CBS poll.</p> <p>If these ratios hold for the second debate and given Obama's insta-poll margins, then Obama should gain, maybe, a single point nationally. This is not rigorous exercise, but suggests that Obama doesn't stand to gain too much ground. </p> <p>Third, it's unlikely that this debate will deflate Republican enthusiasm. Perhaps the biggest gains for Romney after the first debate came because he was able to take an already wide likely/registered voter gap and expand it <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/oct/10/romney-v-obama-mixed-signals-polls\">just a bit</a>. There's nothing in the data to suggest that Republicans were deflated by this performance. They are, for instance, standing strong with Romney on the Benghazi attacks, which tends to support the idea that Romney didn't do poorly so much as Obama did well. </p> <p>Fourth, Democratic enthusiasm will hold thanks to this debate, yet it likely never dropped. If you had any Democratic friends, you probably saw a few who held their heads low after the first debate. You probably saw more hardcore Democrats, however, who offered an impassioned defense of the president. The polls reflect that. After the first debate, Public Policy Polling surveyed Virginia and Wisconsin voters and found that Democratic enthusiasm was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/oct/12/joe-biden-teeth-paul-ryan-hair\">stable compared to pre-debate</a>. I guess it's possible that Democrats are more enthusiastic than ever, thanks to this debate, but I think the post-convention/pre-debate Democratic enthusiasm is as high as it's going to get. That means the registered/likely voter gap will remain. </p> <p>Fifth, Romney must remain favorable to the American public and probably will. Before the first debate, Romney was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/sep/30/mitt-romney-fault-loses\">seen unfavorably</a> by much of the American public. That <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2012/president/obama_romney_favorable_unfavorable.html\">changed dramatically</a> thanks to the first showdown. Obama, on the other hand, has had his favorable ratings stay relatively consistent for months. This suggests that Romney's gains were due to perceptions of Romney, less than they were due to Obama's performance.</p> <p>If that hypothesis is correct, then Obama probably can't gain back voters with a good performance. Romney can only lose them with a bad one. There's not a lot in the numbers to suggest he did. </p> <p>So, I'm not expecting much, if any, movement from this debate. If it does occur, it will be favorable towards President Obama. He'll take that, in this tight race, as every little bit counts. But remember that predictions about post-debate movements are not perfect and that any movements or lack thereof could be erased by <em>next week</em>'s debate.</p>",
  "<p>Jacob Susman is frustrated again. Sitting in the bright green conference room of his company's trendy industrial office, overshadowed by the Brooklyn Bridge, he's a clean-cut poster child for the \"green economy\": Since 2007, Susman's OwnEnergy, which installs wind turbines, has grown to be one of the nation's most prominent wind installers. But he's plagued by a recurring nightmare: \"Every few years the industry has to drop everything for six or nine months and focus exclusively on having the credit passed.\"</p> <p>He's talking about the Production Tax Credit, the federal subsidy for renewable energy that gives a 2.2-cent per kilowatt hour break to wind energy producers. Those pennies add up to about <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/21/business/energy-environment/as-a-tax-credit-wanes-jobs-vanish-in-wind-power-industry.html?pagewanted=all\">$1 billion per year</a>, no chump change for the burgeoning industry. Proponents of wind energy say since its inception in 1992, the PTC has been a crucial driving force behind the industry's rapid growth; critics of the PTC (including the fossil-fuel funded <a href=\"http://www.americanenergyalliance.org/2012/09/pyle-its-time-for-the-wind-ptc-to-end/\">American Energy Alliance</a>) say the industry has had ample time to take off its training wheels (never mind that fossil fuel subsidies historically <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/469723-energy-subsidies.html\">run about 13 times higher</a> than renewables).</p> <p>The subsidy has become a touchstone issue in the presidential campaign for <a href=\"http://www.eenews.net/public/EEDaily/2012/08/01/1\">windy swing states</a> like Iowa and Colorado: Mitt Romney has referred to the PTC as a <a href=\"http://www.eenews.net/public/EEDaily/2012/07/31/1\">\"stimulus boondoggle\"</a> and vowed to kill it, while President Obama has promised to <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/morningenergy/0812/morningenergy557.html\">give the credit</a> his support. Every one to three years, as the PTC reaches its expiration date, it must be taken up, re-debated, re-tweaked, and re-approved by Congress, exposing it to shifting political whims particularly in a general election year where the future party spread is far from certain.</p> <p>The PTC is set to expire at the end of this year, and uncertainty about whether Congress will extend it has led to <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/21/business/energy-environment/as-a-tax-credit-wanes-jobs-vanish-in-wind-power-industry.html?pagewanted=all\">layoffs and much anxiety</a> in the industry. And while 2012 was a big year for wind, with 10 gigawatts installed nationwide by August and another gigawatt predicted by year's end (only 0.9 percent of total new power in the US, but nearly double the wind installed in 2011), projections for 2013 are grim: Estimates range from half to a tenth of that.</p> <p>\"Next year is already going to be a crash year for the wind industry,\" said Michel DiCapua, an analyst with Bloomberg Energy Finance.</p> <p>But what happens next year is only the next iteration of a boom-bust cycle that has been the bane of the US wind industry for over a decade. The PTC has been allowed to expire three times in the past, and the industry has consistently tanked; even the <em>possibility</em> of expiration sends shivers up the spines of everyone from blue-collar factory workers to Manhattan investors. Breaking free of that cycle, Susman and other industry leaders interviewed by <em>Climate Desk</em> agree, is the industry's only hope for sustained long-term growth, and it starts with weaning the industry off the PTC once and for all.</p> <p></p> <p>\"The industry doesn't need the PTC forever,\" Susman said. \"We're ready to start talking about how to phase it down.\"</p> <p>But they still have a ways to go. Thanks to fracking, natural gas prices are through the floor. Although the cost of power from wind has <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/469722-2011-wind-technologies-market-report.html\">dropped 90 percent</a> since 1980, some investors are still spooked by the upfront expenses. And aside from a few exceptions, the state-level standards that mandate how much renewable energy must be brought into the mix are too low and thus oversupplied, meaning there's little incentive for utilities to seek out new wind projects. For those reasons, a swath of groups including the <a href=\"http://www.awea.org/newsroom/pressreleases/BICEPrelease.cfm\">American Wind Energy Association</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.ucsusa.org/clean_energy/smart-energy-solutions/increase-renewables/production-tax-credit-for.html\">Union of Concerned Scientists</a> have been pushing hard for Congress to extend the PTC once again.</p> <p>Still, said Andy Bowman of Austin-based wind installer Pioneer Green Energy, \"I do think there's more speculation than there ever has been that this might be the last extension.\" Bowman agreed with Susman that even worse than competing on uneven ground with fossil fuels was being handcuffed to a mercurial legislative process whose sights rarely reach farther than a few years. \"It's miserable,\" he said. \"All the projects we've been working on for the last three years are hanging in the balance.\"</p> <p>Bowman is among the wind industry veterans who have worked through several boom-bust cycles in the past. With just 14 employees, his small company is at the mercy of venture capitalists who are loathe to back any enterprise that lacks long-term stability; the PTC, he said, has never been more than a piecemeal solution.</p> <p>\"The expiration of the PTC casts a long shadow,\" he said. \"Removing it would provide a great deal more certainty, since we wouldn't have this big question mark.\"</p> <p>Industry leaders are counting on a combination of <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/richardfinger/2012/07/22/were-headed-to-8-00-natural-gas/2/\">rising natural gas prices</a>, tightening coal regulations, and ever-cheaper and more efficient turbines to give wind the competitive edge it would need to kick the PTC. They're also lobbying for a far-sighted national energy policy that favors wind, and higher targets for states' renewables goals. But it's not clear how long those goals will really take to achieve. So for now, all they can do is cross their fingers for one more shot.</p> <p>\"We're seeing the light at the end of the tunnel,\" Susman said. \"Wind should be able to stand on its own in a few years.\"</p> <p>\u2022 This article was first published by Guardian partner, <a href=\"http://climatedesk.org/2012/10/big-winds-recurring-nightmare/\">Climate Desk</a></p>",

That 3 October debate was dominated by Romney and started the president's poll slide, leaving the two in a dead heat less than three weeks from election day.</p> <p>Obama will have lifted Democratic morale and may have done enough to slow \u2013 or even arrest \u2013 the crisis.</p> <p>It will be several days before the first reliable polls appear but a snap poll by CNN awarded the debate 46% to Obama and 39% to Romney, while CBS put it as 37% Obama to 30% Romney.</p> <p>Obama, listless in Denver, was transformed in the second debate: focused, animated and combative. The president grew in confidence in the later stages of the night, while Romney, confident at the start, began to fade.</p> <p>Obama's campaign team said Obama turned in the peformance it had expected him to produce two weeks ago.&#xa0;</p> <p>The former White House spokesman, Robert Gibbs, reinstated to the Obama team as an adviser, said: \"The president knew he did not do well two weeks ago. &#xa0;He knew he had to step up his game tonight and Mitt Romney was left looking uncomfortable\".</p> <p>Republicans countered that nothing the president said will have changed the dynamic of the race.</p> <p>Romney and Obama now have a presidential debate victory apiece going into the final one, usually the most watched of the three, in Boca Raton, Florida, on Monday.</p> <p>The two men clashed in the second debate \u2013 at Hofstra University, Long Island \u2013 over tax, energy, women's rights, immigration and Libya.&#xa0;</p> <p>Obama taunted Romney over the vagueness of his plans for tax cuts and deficit reduction.&#xa0;\"If somebody came to you, governor, with a plan that said, 'Here, I want to spend seven or eight trillion dollars, and we're going to pay for it, but we can't tell you until maybe after the election how we're going to do it,' you wouldn't have taken such a sketchy deal, and neither should you, the American people,\" Obama said.</p> <p>But the most politically damaging moment for Romney came when he bungled his attack on the Obama administration's handling of the assault on the Benghazi consulate in which the US ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans were killed.&#xa0;</p> <p>It should have been an easy one for Romney, after days of shifting accounts from administration officials who initially blamed the attack on a protest over an Islamophobic film but have now conceded it was a pre-planned terrorist attack.&#xa0;</p> <p>Romney accused Obama of flying off on fund-raising trips the day after the Benghazi killings.&#xa0;</p> <p>But Obama came back forcefully, accepting the buck stopped with him, not with Hillary Clinton or anyone else in his administration. \"Secretary Clinton has done an extraordinary job. But she works for me. I'm the president and I'm always responsible, and that's why nobody's more interested in finding out exactly what happened.\" He described as \"offensive\" Romney seeking to suggest that as president he was acting out of political motivation over the deaths of four Americans.</p> <p>Then, when Romney tried to challenge the president over his assertion that he had described it as an act of terror on the morning after the attack, the moderator Candy Crowley intervened to say that Obama was correct. \"He did, in fact, sir,\" she told Romney, who was unable to counter-attack.</p> <p>Crowley, CNN's chief political correspondent and the first woman in two decades to moderate a presidential debate,&#xa0;went on to point out that it had taken two weeks for the administration to abandon the idea that the attacks were related to protests over the anti-Muslim video. But her intervention left conservatives furious, with one Republican strategist describing it as the most egregious error by a debate moderator ever.</p> <p>Obama also hit home in an exchange over Romney's investments in China. When the Republican responded that Obama should look at the investments in his own pension, Obama, with his trademark grin, shot back: \"I don't look at my pension. It's not as big as yours.\"</p> <p>The power of the quip was that it encapsulated the image the Democrats have been labouring to put across of Romney as rich and elitist, in a different league from the majority of Americans. &#xa0;</p> <p>In the final minutes, to the relief of Democrats, Obama also mentioned the secret video in which Romney dismissed 47% of American voters as freeloaders. The president had dismayed Democrats when he failed to raise it in the Denver debate.</p> <p>The format, a town-hall debate with questions from the audience, makes exchanges between the two awkward and supposedly encourages civil exchanges. From the start Obama and Romney dispensed with tradition, rising from their seats to engage first with the questioners and then one another.</p> <p>During a discussion about lack of drilling for oil on federal land, the two could barely contain themselves, confronting one another just a few feet apart, almost eye-balling one another, with Obama saying \"not true\" while Romney insisted it was \"absolutely true\".</p> <p>Until then it was thought the animosity between the two was confined to policy but it became apparent there is also deep personal antipathy. At one point Romney, almost contemptuous of the president, told him: \"You will get your chance in a minute. I am speaking.\" &#xa0;Republicans may view this as Romney standing up to Obama and what they regard as a representative of the liberal media, but the risk is that independents view it as rudeness.</p> <p>In the early exchanges Romney held his own, at one point witheringly telling Obama that whatever he said he would do in his second term, his first term suggested otherwise.&#xa0;</p> <p>But his difficulties began with a question from an audience member over what the candidates would do to improve conditions for working women. He replied by talking about his time as governor of Massachusetts when he appointed many women into cabinet roles and had commissioned a study on women leaders. But he then delivered an unfortunate line when he said that he had looked through \"whole binders full of women\" when seeking to recruit cabinet members as Massachusetts governor.&#xa0;</p> <p>Romney also clashed repeatedly with Crowley over the rules and how much time he was being given to answer questions.&#xa0;</p> <p>In the spin room afterwards David Axelrod, Obama's campaign adviser, said Romney had been \"cornered and ran out of the room. &#xa0;It was clear to the American people he was exposed tonight.\"</p> <p>Romney's adviser, Ed Gillespie, said: \"The momentum continues for Governor Romney.\" Asked about Romney's failure to control the debate as he had in Denver, he said: \"I don't think it changes the dynamic. This was never about style. It is about substance \u2013 jobs \u2013 and that has not changed.\"</p>"

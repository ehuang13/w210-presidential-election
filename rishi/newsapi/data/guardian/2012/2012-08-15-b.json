  "<p>Those of us who are forever fascinated by American politics can wheel out two standard quotations about the American vice-presidency. The first, elegantly uttered by the first holder of the office, George Washington's deputy John Adams, describes it as \"the most insignificant office that ever the invention of man contrived or his imagination conceived\". The second, saltier and better known, comes from John Nance \"Cactus Jack\" Garner, 32nd vice-president, who dismissed the job, which was his under Franklin Roosevelt from 1933 to 1941 as \"not worth a bucket of warm piss\".</p> <p>Not even the occasionally megalomaniac tenure of Dick Cheney from 2001 to 2009 has quite managed to transform the significance of the vice-presidency from the post described by Adams and Garner. Certainly Joe Biden's four low-profile years in the post under Barack Obama have confirmed it. They have been far less noteworthy than Cheney's \u2013 and historically far more typical. The old Washington line about the unfortunate mother who had two sons who were never heard from again \u2013 one was lost at sea and the other became vice-president \u2013 still holds true.</p> <p>Yet it was handy to be reading Robert Caro's latest volume of biography on Lyndon Johnson, a work which contains all the dismissive jokes about the vice-presidency just cited and several more besides, when news came through of the nomination of Congressman Paul Ryan of Wisconsin to be Mitt Romney's running mate. It was a useful corrective to the instinct to dismiss the post, since Ryan, the hugely influential House budget committee chairman who has been thrust to prominence by a combination of economic crisis and political polarisation, is one of the most powerful inside-the-Beltway Washington politicians to be offered a shot at the vice-presidency since Johnson himself ran with Jack Kennedy in 1960.</p> <p>Many of his contemporaries thought Johnson was crazy to exchange his unprecedentedly powerful role as majority leader in the Senate for the obscurity of the vice-presidency. Johnson being Johnson, however, there was immense calculation in the move since, as he himself said to Clare Booth Luce at the Inauguration Ball in 1961 with tragic prescience: \"Clare, I looked it up: one out of every four presidents has died in office. I'm a gamblin' man, darlin', and this is the only chance I got.\"</p> <p>Johnson was confident he would be&#xa0;able to shape the administration from&#xa0;the vice-presidency. One of his own&#xa0;favourite sayings, much quoted by&#xa0;Caro, was: \"Power is where power goes.\" It was the individual who mattered, in other words, not the office. As it turned out, Johnson miscalculated massively, because Kennedy marginalised his deputy. But the saying may yet turn out to be a useful aphorism&#xa0;if the focused, intelligent and powerful Ryan ever gets to be vice-president under the almost congenitally indecisive and equivocal Romney.</p> <p>That's because, if the two of them defeat Obama in November, America will have elected itself one of the most anti-government leaderships in its history, and it is likely to be one in which Ryan sets the tone and perhaps calls the shots. Ryan is a deeply serious fiscal conservative and anti-federal government politician. He is also a man in a hurry. He should absolutely not be underestimated. He wants Washington to get out of the pensions business and replace the existing Medicare system with vouchers. He has argued for the reduction of income tax to two rates \u2013 10% and 25%. He wants to repeal Obama's healthcare legislation and remove tax incentives for employers to provide health insurance. He sees America engaged in an existential struggle to avoid what he sees as an Obama-inspired slide into European socialism.</p> <p>By choosing Ryan, Romney has ensured that the 2012 election will be an ideological fight. It will be, <a href=\"http://blogs.ft.com/the-a-list/2012/08/13/americas-clear-choice-franklin-roosevelt-or-ayn-rand/#axzz23d2GgW9q\" title=\"\">as Simon Schama has put it</a>, a choice between the America of Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal institutions and the America of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/aug/13/paul-ryan-ayn-rand-romney\" title=\"\">individualist cult of Ayn Rand</a>, of which Ryan is an enthusiastic adherent. Europeans, accustomed to thinking that elections are won in the centre ground, by capturing independent voters, tend to assume \u2013 and hope \u2013 that the choice of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/aug/15/paul-ryan-paradox-us-politics\" title=\"\">Ryan will therefore be counter-productive</a>. But this is a dangerous assumption, even though some US commentators, even conservatives, also share it.</p> <p>It is dangerous because American voters have repeatedly upended that assumption, whether in the disputed presidential election of 2000, or in the congressional votes in 1994 and 2010. In&#xa0;an America where economic growth is fragile, job trends erratic, and the federal deficit massive (thanks primarily to George Bush not Obama), this distinctive American conservative strength, so unlike the politics of most of western Europe, but combined with the globally familiar anti-incumbent feeling of hard times, may be hard to stop. This isn't yet a rerun of 2008, when another reckless choice of running mate by another Republican presidential candidate whom the grassroots of the party did not like, effectively handed the election to the Democrats. Sarah Palin was ludicrous. Paul Ryan is serious. And this is a much tighter contest, in harder times, against an incumbent president who has disappointed some of his more naive supporters.</p> <p>The true importance of the 2012 US election as seen from outside America may rest on a different paradox. This is an immensely important election for Americans. But it is an election with surprisingly little resonance outside America. It is a contest between two candidates and parties which are so thoroughly shaped by exceptional American conditions and traditions \u2013 many of which come back, in the end, to the slow and domestically painful decline of American power \u2013 that it offers few of the lessons which the British political class loves to obsess about. Ryan is very unlike any significant British or continental European conservative politician.</p> <p>That is not to say that the outcome does not matter to non-Americans. Or that we don't have our preferences about who wins. But the reality is that both Obama-Biden (assuming that Biden remains on the ticket) and Romney-Ryan are focused on America first, and that their view of the world is one in which Europe is a source of problems to be avoided, not of models to be emulated. American politics is always irresistible entertainment. But Americans do not have the answers to Europe's problems, any more than Europeans have the answers to America's. Serious grownup politics for Europeans begins here in Europe, now more than ever.</p>",
  "<p>The US election campaign has descended into a particularly bitter phase, with Mitt Romney accusing Barack Obama of a willingness to \"do anything\" to stay in power and renewed controversy over a series of negative campaign ads from the president's camp.</p> <p>In an interview on CBS This Morning, Romney said the attack ads being run by the Obama team, and allied Obama-supporting Super Pac groups, had sought to divide the country.</p> <p>\"If you look at the ads that have been described and the divisiveness based upon income, age, ethnicity and so forth, it's designed to bring a sense of enmity and jealously and anger \u2026 the president seems to be running just to hang on to power. I think he'll do anything in his power to try and get re-elected,\" Romney said in the first solo interview since announcing Wisconsin congressman Paul Ryan as his running mate.</p> <p>One particularly controversial ad, produced by the Obama-supporting Super Pac Priorities USA Action, features a man claiming his wife died of cancer after losing her health insurance when his factory was closed by Romney's former firm Bain Capital. </p> <p>Despite a storm of criticism over the accuracy of its claims, the ad has now aired on a TV station in the key swing state of Ohio. However, a spokesman for the Super Pac has said the ad was aired via a \"station error\". That has cut little ice with the Romney camp. </p> <p>Matt Rhoades, Romney's campaign manager, said: \"They claim the station aired it by mistake. But if they didn't intend to air it, why would they ship the false ad to TV stations in the first place? President Obama once set the highest expectations and is now engaged in the lowest form of campaigning.\"</p> <p>The argument is the latest spat to roil a campaign been marred by fierce disputes over political attack ads and comments by vice-president Joe Biden. Speaking at a rally in Virginia, he told a mixed-race crowd that the Republicans were \"\u2026 going to put y'all back in chains\". </p> <p>That last comment led to Republican accusations that Biden had been race-baiting: something the Democrats denied by pointing out he had been talking about Wall Street and how Romney wanted to \"unchain\" the banking industry from regulations. </p> <p>But in the television interview Romney did not let the issue die down. \"These personal attacks, I think, are demeaning to the office of the White House and the comments yesterday by the vice-president, I think, just diminish the White House that much more,\" he said.</p> <p>Experts say that the 2012 campaign so far has been the most negative in recent memory in the US, spurred largely by the huge amounts of unrestrained cash flowing into the coffers of outside groups like Super Pacs. </p> <p>\"There is so much money and therefore the quantity of negative ads is so much more than we have ever seen. They know it is far more effective to tear someone down than build somebody up,\" said professor David Cohen, a political scientist at the University of Akron in Ohio.</p> <p>At the moment the negative campaigning seems to be working for Obama and his supporters. Most recent polls show Obama ahead of Romney in national polls with a narrow but firm lead. The situation in the key battleground states \u2013 where the election will be decided and where most negative ads have been running \u2013 often shows a stronger lead for Obama. </p> <p>Many experts believe that Romney's weekend pick of the firebrand Ryan as his vice-presidential candidate was a sign that the Republican believes he needed to shake up his campaign in order to stand a chance at the ballot box in November.</p> <p>But the Romney team's attempt to paint Obama as a negative campaigner may lead to allegations of hypocrisy. Romney's campaign, and the Super Pacs who back it, have not been shy of airing negative attack ads themselves. Romney also revealed a ruthless side during the Republican nomination race where he and his supporters unleashed a barrage of negative ads that helped beat off the challenges of former House speaker Newt Gingrich and former Pennsylvania senator Rick Santorum. \"Negative campaigning is very much coming from both sides,\" said Cohen.</p> <p>There are also other shadowy organisations beginning to get involved. On Wednesday a group called Special Operations Opsec Education Fund launched a 22-minute long video called Dishonorable Disclosures, a<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/15/us-special-ops-obama-bin-laden\">imed at attacking Obama for taking credit for the death of terrorist leader Osama bin Laden</a> and for security leaks from his administration. </p> <p>Though Opsec says it is an independent, non-partisan group made up of former special forces soldiers, the group's video explicitly goes after Obama. Its leader, former navy seal Scott Taylor, is also a former Republican congressional candidate. The group's formation has prompted comparisons to the Swift Boat campaign of 2004 which helped derail senator John Kerry's bid for the White House by questioning his service record in the Vietnam war.</p>",
  "<p>When it comes to using social media to engage a wired-in sector of the US electorate, one presidential candidate proves more adept at working the web to his advantage. </p> <p>Despite <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jun/14/romney-campaign-digital-data-obama\">efforts by Mitt Romney's camp</a> to close the digital gap \u2013 notable among them a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/us-news-blog/2012/jul/31/mitt-romney-vp-app\">contact-gathering smartphone app</a> \u2013 President Barack Obama's digital campaign still sees far more Facebook, Twitter and YouTube interactions from followers, according to a Pew study released Wednesday. </p> <p>Researchers at the Pew Research Center's Project for Excellence in Journalism analyzed over 3m total interactions, comprised of Facebook likes, Twitter retweets and YouTube comments, between the dueling campaigns and their followers. </p> <p>On one hand, the findings are obvious: as more potential voters start hanging out on and connecting via mobile to big-name platforms like Facebook and Twitter, the campaigns are going where they think the eyeballs are. On the other, research shows both camps are taking a more targeted approach to the web compared with 2008 \u2013 in other words, campaigns going where they know the eyeballs are. </p> <p>Allowing prospective voters to break down issues by topic and location on campaign websites is a tactic pioneered by Obama and emulated by Romney, according to project founder Tom Rosenstiel. </p> <p>\"The chance that [campaigns] are wasting time and effort is probably smaller,\" Rosenstiel told the Guardian. \"There's no question the more you can tailor your message in politics the more effective you are. We're seeing a lot more tailoring than four years ago.\" </p> <p>When it comes to sheer productivity, Obama's massive staff \u2013 in June, it was 750 compared with Romney's 87 \u2013 has maintained the president's lead by dwarfing Romney's postings on Twitter, out-blogging him on the Obama campaign website and matching Romney's activities on Facebook. </p> <p>\"I give nothing but credit to the Obama folks who run a very successful program with a very large staff that we are always amazed by,\" Zac Moffat, digital director of the Romney campaign, <a href=\"http://personaldemocracy.com/\">told</a> the Personal Democracy Forum in June. \"In size they are clearly ahead, but in terms of engagement, no, they are not.\"</p> <p>Indeed, in an election cycle that will go down in history for its fundraising gluttony, staffers spending time with the humble retweet or Facebook \"like\" isn't the sort of thing that raises money. As Moffat noted, the Pew report found that engagement is a problem, but with both candidates. (In fact, they're far more likely to mention each other than they are to mention individuals. A third of Romney's posts are about Obama.) </p> <p>However, with back-to-back party conventions looming, a candidate like Mitt Romney could easily help narrow the gap, according to a longtime party strategist. </p> <p>\"Live events are simply naturals for follower growth,\" Todd Herman, former new media director for the GOP, told the Guardian. \"So, if the two parties don't gain massive numbers of followers by truly integrating the viewer into the experience it will simply be due to a lack of creativity or an over-abundance of caution.\" </p> <p>Right now, Obama is the victor in terms of creating social media buzz \u2013 a value nearly as nascent now as it was in 2008 \u2013 but there's still the looming question of whether courting tweets, likes and comments actually leads to voter action. </p> <p>\"There's an old axiom in politics,\" Rosenstiel said, \"Half of what you do is probably a waste, but you don't know which half, so you do everything.\" </p> <p>Speaking of doing everything: when it comes to something like the \"Mitt's VP\" app \u2013 which, depending on who you ask, was either just ahead of or hours behind the press in putting Paul Ryan on display \u2013 beating the newshounds was never the goal. Gathering the information of a wired-in public, and closing that digital gap, was the objective. </p> <p>Herman calls it a great idea.</p> <p>\"I trust they have already thought of ways to leverage, not just the data they gained but, hopefully, to make that app useful as the campaign rolls on.\"</p>",
  "<p>Last year, the Pew Research Center released one of its occasional <a href=\"http://www.people-press.org/2011/05/04/beyond-red-vs-blue-the-political-typology/\">typological surveys of the US political landscape</a> \u2013 the fifth in total, and the first since 2005. The findings of \"Beyond Red v Blue\" were significant in the context of the present presidential election \u2013 and, not least, Mitt Romney's pick of Paul Ryan as his would be vice-president. What it uncovered was a volatile politics in the midst of a period of transition, changing in ways that, perhaps, confounded some of the narratives that the media had assumed.</p> <p>The political landscape, Pew assessed, had become more polarized and \"doctrinaire at both ends of the political spectrum\". That much, at least, is certain. At the same time, the survey observed, the space occupied by independents had expanded sharply since the last similar exercise, by some 7%. These are voters notable for holding strong views on individual issues while often defying old party orthodoxies and loyalties on others.</p> <p>For those who identified themselves as \"mostly Republican\", the survey broke down the voters into two groups: \"staunch conservative\", characterised as \"highly-engaged Tea Party supporters\", and \"Main Street Republicans\", who together accounted for 20% of the general public. It calculated 37% were on the \"mostly Democratic\" side of the equation, which it broke down into three categories. Most interesting and perhaps most diverse, however, was the final group \u2013 \"mostly Independent\" \u2013 at 33% of potential voters (including Libertarians, described as \"free-market, small government seculars\"; \"disaffecteds\", who are defined as \"downscale and cynical\"; and \"postmoderns\", who are \"moderates but liberal on social issues\").</p> <p>I think this survey explains some important things both about the Romney campaign, why he picked Ryan as his running-mate, and how that choice might play out.</p> <p>It is a general truism of more recent democratic politics, as true in Europe as in the US, that successful campaigns do not tend to move sharply away from their own political centre \u2013 the point at which they can ensure both the support of their base while also, crucially, attracting voters from outside of that core group. Indeed, as David McKay has noted in his book American Politics and Society in his chapter on the Changing Role of Political Parties (see <a href=\"http://www.blackwellpublishing.com/mckay/pdfs/chapter5.pdf\">chapter 5, pdf</a>):</p> <blockquote> <p>\"A defining characteristic of both the Democrats and the Republicans is that they have constantly sought to appeal to as wide a spectrum of voters as possible. As such, they have been obliged to promise general rather than specific benefits to voters.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>McKay, too, noted the same emerging paradox in US politics as the Pew survey does:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"[W]hile the parties are more ideologically divided than they used to be, many voters remain generally apathetic and uninterested in politics.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>If the present political environment is complex and toxic, characterised by a growing distrust of the political system, the present incarnation of Republicanism, the Pew survey argued, gifted at least some advantages \u2013 both in terms of its greater ideological homogeneity and in what it called an \"intensity advantage\" that delivered Tea Party gains in the 2010 midterms. Where it did identify an emerging Republican problem, however, was in \"maintaining solid support among the GOP-oriented groups in the centre\", not least among the \"cross-pressured 'disaffecteds'\" among the \"mostly Independents\", one of the groupings Romney needs to convince if he is to win.</p> <p>Which brings us to the choice of Paul Ryan.</p> <p>Faced with the challenges facing both Obama and Romney in persuading an electorate increasingly sceptical of both parties, one might have expected the Republican candidate to use his choice of vice-president to tick some boxes that would appeal outside of the core activist base. Indeed, only a few months ago, polling on Romney's vice-presidential pick \u2013 although hardly conclusive evidence of much \u2013 seemed to suggest that Ryan would not bring many advantages, compared with the likes of Marco Rubio, Jeb Bush or Chris Christie, to the Romney campaign, either in name recognition or in widening the ticket's appeal. So what, precisely, has Ryan brought to the party?</p> <p>The reality, as <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0812/79697.html\">Politico argued on Tuesday</a> after off-the-record interviews with over a dozen anonymous GOP activists, is a whole bundle of new worries. For while Romney has assiduously avoided many specifics that might turn off key voters, Ryan is all about them. A dogwhistle ideologue, his positions on everything from his dogmatic pro-life voting record to his small government stance and his economic prescriptions that would cut taxes for the wealthiest and benefits for the poorest appeal most to \"staunch conservatives\" and Tea Party activists.</p> <p>Confounding, too, is why Romney would have picked a running-mate whose views on an issue \u2013 his desire to reform the Medicare program \u2013 is likely to alarm strongly the group most over-represented even among \"staunch conservatives\": senior voters. As the Pew survey observed, older voters are represented \"disproportionately\" in the \"staunch conservative\" bloc where over 61% are 50 or older; yet, at least two polls have recently suggested that this same group (senior voters) is largely opposed to Medicare reform. This is doubly baffling as political strategy, as <a href=\"http://www.tnr.com/blog/electionate/106099/ryan-romney-seniors\">Nate Cohn argued in the New Republic earlier this week</a>, because you would think Romney would not want to risk alienating seniors, who are the one significant group among whom Obama has not made gains between 2004-2008 and ought to be a natural Republican-leaning constituency.</p> <p>But it is not just with seniors that Ryan brings risks to the Romney campaign. The Ryan Plan, his challenge to Obama's economic strategy which Romney has remarked flatteringly on and which has won broad backing from House Republicans, also seems out of step with the views of the wider electorate that Romney must win. For while \"Beyond Red v Blue\" noted that \"majorities in most typology groups say the country will need both to cut spending and raise taxes to reduce the budget deficit\", \"staunch conservatives\" alone remained the exception, saying the focus should be on cutting spending. Indeed, Ryan \u2013 most controversially of all \u2013 would actually cut taxes for the wealthiest Americans.</p> <p>With the Republican presidential campaign already facing an escalating offensive over Ryan's views and how much Romney endorses them, it seems rather bizarre that the party's presumptive nominee \u2013 who lags behind the incumbent by most indicators \u2013 would pick as a running-mate a controversial figure with limited appeal, whose views he is now being forced to defend. The reality, as \"Beyond Red v Blue\" has described, and others have noted since Ryan's pick, is that Romney is caught on the horns of a dilemma. A candidate who is not \"conservative enough\" for his own base but needs to attract both wavering Democrats and Independents, he has failed to find an overarching and widely appealing political pitch that would allow him to hedge his bets.</p> <p>Perhaps, in the present climate and configuration of the parties and where they stand, that was always impossible. But his choice \u2013 punting for Ryan to reassure the base \u2013 looks like poor politics and, potentially, an electorally fatal error.</p>",

  "<p>Today, India is celebrating the 65th year of its independence. To have sustained a functioning democracy with all its flaws for more than 65 years, in a country of more than a billion people who speak scores of different languages, is something of a miracle. Gone are the days of associating India with snake charmers and elephants.</p> <p>The country has prospered visibly. Despite the population growth, the per capita income has grown considerably in each of the past 15 years \u2013 more than ever before. On the technological front, India launches its own satellites and recently sent <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/science/2009/sep/24/discovery-water-moon-lunar-base?intcmp=239\" title=\"\">Chandrayaan</a>, a state-of-the-art spacecraft, to the moon. It also boasts of a massive cinema industry, which every year churns out several of the world's most widely watched films. And yet it continues to be weighed down by bureaucracy and political corruption.</p> <p>In terms of geographical spread, the Republic of India is the world's seventh largest country. It has the climatic extremes of the snow-clad Himalayas in the north, green, coastal Kerala in the south, the rain-fed forests of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_Sister_States\" title=\"\">Seven Sisters</a> in the north east, and the scorching sands of Rajasthan on its western flank. The single most important legacy of contemporary India is that it is the largest parliamentary democracy in the world.</p> <p>But the behaviour and character of its MPs inside and outside parliament has failed to live up to the aspirations of its founding fathers. <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/nehru_jawaharlal.shtml\" title=\"\">Jawaharlal Nehru</a>, India's first and longest-serving prime minister, spent his political career instilling in his people the habits of democracy: disdain for dictators, respect for parliamentary procedures and an abiding faith in the constitutional system. However, over the past three decades, bureaucratic and political corruption has served to weaken the roots of Indian democracy. As many as one third of members of the current parliament (out of a total of 543) have criminal charges against them.</p> <p>Criminality and dubious wealth combine to send to parliament men and women who are demonstrably unfit for public office, which is a blot on the respectability of the world's largest democracy. Despite the widespread perception that Indian politicians and bureaucrats are among the most corrupt and incompetent in the world, successive governments have done little to bring about even minimum reforms to the country's political and administrative systems.</p> <p>The breadth of the divide between the two Indias is dramatic, shocking and ever-increasing. People in urban areas \u2013 the rich, the middle classes and the educated \u2013 have all benefited from the country's economic growth. The ones who have missed out include the small farmers, the rural poor and the artisans.</p> <p>For this section of Indians, the situation has actually worsened. According to <a href=\"http://www.worldbank.org/en/country/india\" title=\"\">World Bank estimates</a>, 456 million people \u2013 just over 40% of India's population of 1.2 billion \u2013 now live on less than \u00a31 per day, the sum recognised as the international poverty line. Almost half of India's children are malnourished; thousands die from diarrhoea every day; hundreds of millions have no access to proper sanitation. These figures provide a grim counterpoint to the glitzy high rises and designer shopping malls that have sprung up throughout the major cities of the country. The gap between haves and have-nots is growing wider.</p> <p>Modern India is facing international and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/mumbai-terror-attacks\" title=\"\">domestic terrorism</a>, economic depression, price inflation and the loss of moral backbone among most of its politicians. For its survival, India will have to reappraise the process of its government. A presidential system, preferably an Indian model somewhere between the French and American system, might work best. Actually, in the early years of independent India, Clement Attlee proposed the presidential system of the United States as a model. Unfortunately, Nehru rejected it \u2013 ironically out of his Anglophilic delusion that the \"British system was the only real one for democracies\".</p> <p>The parliamentary system means the party system. In a general election in India, usually, there are more than 100 parties with several thousands candidates involved. Most political parties are engaged in an unseemly scramble for power \u2013 the perks of which can be a means of amassing illegitimate wealth \u2013 rather than good governance. With the needs and demands of one sixth of humanity to be met, India must have a democracy that delivers progress for its people. A presidential system may be the best way of ensuring a democracy that works.</p> <p>\u2022 Follow Comment is free on Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/commentisfree\" title=\"\">@commentisfree</a></p>"

[
  "<p>Barack Obama was due to tour some of the areas hardest hit by superstorm Sandy as he and his rival Mitt Romney sought to navigate the tricky political waters stirred up by disaster.</p> <p>With less than a week to go until the presidential election, Obama has left the campaign trail to focus almost exclusively on dealing with the aftermath of the disaster. He appears to be gaining an early political advantage from his handling of the crisis, with a prominent Mitt Romney supporter, New Jersey governor Chris Christie, describing the president's response as \"outstanding\".</p> <p>The White House said on Tuesday night that Obama will travel to New Jersey to inspect the storm damage with Christie. He is due to meet people recovering from the storm as well as members of the emergency services involved in the rescue operation.</p> <p>Romney, stuck on the sidelines in Ohio and frustrated over two lost campaign days, is to take a gamble by returning to the campaign trail on Wednesday in Florida. The risk is that he could alienate voters with partisan speeches at a time when most are still focused on the damage and deaths resulting from the storm.</p> <p>Wednesday could provide one of the striking image of the election: Obama touring the stricken sites in New Jersey alongside Christie, a Republican, contrasting with Romney campaigning in Florida. Obama can present an image of standing above politics as he co-ordinates rescue and clean-up operations.</p> <p>Sandy could turn out to have a decisive role in the outcome of next Tuesday's election in much the same way that the response of Obama and his opponent John McCain did in the face of the economic collapse in 2008.</p> <p>Although the early benefit appears to be going to Obama, there is danger, too, for the president if complaints begin to emerge of incompetence. The public mood could also quickly sour if there are long delays in restoring power to the millions across the east coast currently without electricity.</p> <p>Obama, after declaring New York and New Jersey to be disaster areas, which opens the way for federal aid, held a video conference from the Situation Room at the White House with members of his cabinet and the emergency services to ensure that help is getting to the stricken areas and that power will be restored as quickly as possible.</p> <p>A White House statement said: \"The president told his team that their top priority is to make sure all available resources are being provided to state and local responders as quickly as possible and directed them to identify and resolve any potential bottlenecks or shortfalls should they arise.\"</p> <p>Obama has been careful to avoid being overtly political, but his stress on the extent of federal aid going to the worst-hit states indirectly allows him to draw a distinction between himself and Romney.</p> <p>Romney, in a debate last year with other Republican candidates seeking the presidential nomination, advocated that the federal emergency management agency (Fema), which is overseeing the rescue and clean-up operations, should have its budget cut to help reduce the federal deficit.</p> <p>While Romney was advocating the transfer of some Fema powers to states and did not specifically say this would result in less money for emergency operations, the clip from the debate is being shown repeatedly on television and could harm him.</p> <p>It is fast developing into a potentially embarrassing campaign issue for the Republican challenger, with Democrats stressing the importance of the federal government's strategic overview.</p> <p>The New York Times, in an editorial, described Romney's plan as absurd. \"Those in Hurricane Sandy's path are fortunate that, for now, that ideology has not replaced sound policy,\" the editorial said.</p> <p>Romney was pressed 14 times on the issue by reporters shouting questions at him but all were ignored.</p> <p>The extent to which Romney has been sidelined by the storm was evident in the Dayton area, Ohio, where he held a hurriedly re-organised event on Tuesday.</p> <p>A 'victory rally' was changed into 'a storm relief' event, and Romney restricted his comments in a highly shortened five-minute address to praising the \"generosity of the American people \u2013 it's part of the American way\".</p> <p>Romney recalled how when he was governor of Massachusetts his state had welcomed refugees from the 2005 Katrina hurricane in New Orleans.</p> <p>CNN encapsulated Romney's problem. It broadcast barely a sentence or two of his speech before abruptly cutting away to its storm coverage.</p> <p>After speaking, Romney \"set to work\" packing up tins of food and bottles of juice that local people had donated to victims of the storm in New Jersey.</p> <p>While Romney in person showed notable restraint in fending off politics for the day, the same could not be said for his wider campaign. Radio adverts warning voters that \"Ohio cannot afford four more years of Obama's failed policies\" were still blazing across the state.</p> <p>Obama had been planning to visit Ohio on Wednesday but cancelled the trip.</p> <p>One of the biggest surprise endorsement for Obama's stewardship during the storm came from Christie, who at one time was being touted as a potential Republican presidential candidate.</p> <p>\"The federal government's response has been great,\" he told NBC, adding that he had been on the phone with Obama several times up to midnight Monday. New Jersey is one of the worst-hit areas.</p> <p>He had asked the president to designate New Jersey a disaster area and added: \"The president has been outstanding in this.\"</p> <p>In a separate television interview, Christie, who has been out campaigning regularly on Romney's behalf, said: \"The president has been all over this and deserves great credit.\"</p> <p>The Obama campaign used its mammoth email list of supporters, normally subjected to regular daily pleas for donations, to urge them to offer financial help to the American Red Cross.</p> <p>Although Obama is not campaigning personally, his campaign teams are carrying on as normal in the crucial swing states. The disruption has been worst in New York and New Jersey but neither are likely to have an impact on the election as they are both solidly Democratic.</p> <p>It is the eight or so swing states that will determine the outcome and, apart from Virginia, New Hampshire and North Carolina, they have been untouched by the storm. Elsewhere, Obama and Romney staff and volunteers were pursuing their schedules, rounding up potential supporters and trying to persuade them to vote early.</p> <p>Polling has been disrupted by the storm but the latest show the two neck and neck, with Romney enjoying a one- or two-point lead nationally, but Obama ahead in five of the eight swing states, Romney in two and the two tied in Virginia.</p>",
  "<p>Like the huge crane dangling precipitously above Columbus Circle in a New York City, the 2012 election has been left hanging by Hurricane Sandy, bringing the presidential campaign to a halt and silencing the chorus of polls and forecasts that had dominated the news until a few days ago.</p> <p>But while Sandy has dominated the nation's TV screens, away from the eastern seaboard it has been more like politics as usual. Both the Romney and Obama campaigns have been quietly revising their plans and plotting new strategies as the clock ticks down to polling day on 6 November, while congressional candidates have continued to grapple with their opponents in key Senate and House races around the country.</p> <p>Here's the biggest political news you may have missed while Sandy was doing its worst.</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Both presidential campaigns largely suspended active campaigning by their candidates</strong>, with Barack Obama staying in the White House and Mitt Romney electing to hold hybrid \"storm relief\" events with supporters instead, offering to collect donations of dry goods for those in the affected areas. But by Tuesday afternoon, as the flood waters receded on the east coast, <a href=\"http://www.mittromney.com/blog/memo-pennsylvania\">the Romney campaign announced an event</a> by the Republican candidate in Florida, suggesting that it was eager to return to full-throated campaigning as soon as possible.</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>The biggest political move of the week may be the Romney campaign's decision to throw resources into Pennsylvania</strong>, often seen as a solidly Democratic state but one which has lately shown less enthusiasm for Obama and Bob Casey, the Democratic senator struggling for re-election. After a long silence, the pro-Romney Super Pacs Crossroads and Restore Our Future have committed millions of dollars to the state, while the Romney campaign itself has been buying ad time for the last two days before the election, <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/blogs/burns-haberman/2012/10/romney-starts-reserving-time-in-pennsylvania-for-last-147690.html\">Politico reports</a>.</p> <p>While Democrats dismissed the Romney move as a head-fake, the Romney campaign points out: \"Over the past few years we have seen Pennsylvania voting for a Republican senator and a Republican governor, and Republicans win control of the state house in addition to the state senate.\"</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Both campaigns suspended some advertising on the east coast but further inland the ad wars continued</strong>. The Romney campaign debuted an controversial attack ad in Ohio, claiming: \"Obama took GM and Chrysler into bankruptcy and sold Chrysler to Italians who are going to build Jeeps in China. Mitt Romney will fight for every American job.\" With Chrysler's Jeep production line a major employer in Toledo, Ohio, <a href=\"http://www.detroitnews.com/article/20121028/POLITICS01/210280314\">fact-checkers leapt on the ad's claim</a>, and Chrysler itself released a statement: \"Jeep has no intention of shifting production of its Jeep models out of North America to China.\"</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>While Obama stayed near the Rose Garden, his high-profile surrogates Bill Clinton and vice-president Joe Biden made campaign appearances in Florida and Ohio</strong>. The pair made a combined apearance in Youngstown, Ohio on Monday, and both made heavy criticism of Romney's claims about Jeep production being moved to China.<a href=\"http://www.columbiatribune.com/news/2012/oct/30/biden-clinton-team-up-at-ohio-campaign-stop/\"> Clinton offered his own pungent interpretation of Chrysler's response</a>: \"That's the biggest load of bull in the world that they would ever shut down American operations.\"</p> <p>Biden said the Romney claims were bizarre: \"This guy pirouettes more than a ballerina.\"</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Minnesota may join Pennsylvania in being transformed into a battleground state during the last few days of the election campaign</strong>. Both the Obama and Romney teams had been buying advertising in the usually solid blue state but the news that <a href=\" http://www.startribune.com/politics/national/176263801.html\">Bill Clinton would campaign in the state on Tuesday</a> was a sign of Democratic nervousness. The former president attracted a crowd of 1,800 to his event at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis, with a later rally planned in Duluth.</p> <p><a href=\" http://www.dl-online.com/event/article/id/70854/group/homepage/\">Clinton also campaigned in Fargo, North Dakota</a>, for Heidi Heitkamp, the Democratic candidate for the US Senate who is running a surprisingly strong campaign. But despite Clinton's presence, Obama was only mentioned once at the rally in the heavily Republican state.</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Opinion pollsters have been hampered by the impact of Sandy</strong>, both in contacting voters in swing states directly affected and because their own call centres \u2013 concentrated in New Jersey in several cases \u2013 have been compromised by the storm. Gallup and Rasmussen both suspended their daily tracking polls for the duration of the storm. But those polls that have been done continue to show exactly what the pre-storm polls revealed: a close race between Mitt Romney and Barack Obama.</p> <p>A Pew Research national poll released on Monday had Obama and Romney tied on 47%. Another national poll, for NPR, also found a presidential race tied at 47% apiece, but showed a 50%-46% advantage to Obama in the battleground states of Nevada, Colorado, New Mexico, Iowa, Wisconsin, Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, New Hampshire, Virginia, North Carolina and Florida.</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Mitt Romney's previous comments about reforming or cutting Fema have been thrust into the spotlight by Sandy</strong>. In a GOP presidential primary debate, Romney appeared to say that Fema should be abolished and its funds provided to individual states or the private sector for disaster relief. Asked repeatedly by journalists to discuss Fema at his storm relief event in Ohio on Tuesday, Romney gave no response.</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>The closely-fought Senate election between Scott Brown and Elizabeth Warren in Massachusetts suffered from Sandy, after the final debate between the two was cancelled</strong>. Two new polls this week show it continues to be a neck-and-neck contest: a Boston Globe poll on Monday had Brown moving into a slender 45%-43% lead among committed voters, while a Suffolk University poll on Tuesday has Warren leading by 53% to Brown's 46%.</p>",
  "<p>Mitt Romney abided by his promise to suspend his bid for the White House for the day in respect for the victims of the east coast disaster, although behind the frontline his campaign kept up its attacks on President Obama through surrogates and media marketing.</p> <p>Romney eschewed an appearance on stage at Fairmont high school in Kettering, on the outskirts of Dayton, Ohio, choosing instead to stand on a humble bench in front of stacks of tinned food, rice and bottled drinks that had been donated by the local community. He didn't mention Obama or the election once, sticking to a script that was patriotic though not party political.</p> <p>\"We have heavy hearts,\" he began, referring in a speech shortened to just five minutes to the devastation in New Jersey, New York and other parts of the north-east. He then praised the generosity of local people which he called \"part of the American way.\"</p> <p>The event had initially been scheduled for Monday as a \"victory rally\", but was hurriedly shifted to Tuesday and recast as a \"storm relief\" event when the scale of the damage that would be wrought by Sandy became apparent. \"We won't be able to solve all the problems with our efforts this morning,\" Romney said, \"but one of the things I have learnt in life is that you though you can't solve all the problems you do whatever you can.\"</p> <p>While up front Romney kept to the spirit of the unspoken truce that has been declared between him and his presidential foe in the wake of storm Sandy, behind the scenes an aggressive and at times ugly campaign in the crucial battleground of Ohio showed no sign of letting up. John McCain, the previous Republican candidate to compete against Obama in 2008, was travelling around Ohio on Tuesday appearing at \"storm relief\" events.</p> <p>But he also went on conservative talk radio on Tuesday morning and accused the president of orchestrating a \"massive cover-up\" over the killing of the US ambassador and three other Americans in Benghazi. Romney's brother Scott and his niece Rhona were campaigning across Michigan; they too went on talk radio, openly criticising Obama's economic policies and advocating Romney's alternative plan without any attempt at restraint.</p> <p>Across Ohio, Romney campaign adverts continued to warn voters that \"Ohio cannot afford four more years of this failed presidency\". The adverts were being aired with as much apparent frequency as before the storm broke.</p>",

  "<p>We are a week out from the presidential election. We have just had 60 million Americans affected by a hurricane. Super Pacs have billions of dollars just sitting lying around.</p> <p>So, I have an idea.</p> <p>Super Pacs, how about you force the candidates to spend the next week campaigning on their own and spend some of your limitless funds on the relief effort? It's a win-win for you any way you look at it.</p> <p>First, for the Republican super pacs, you make Mitt Romney look good. Hell, you fulfill his dream! Remember, how he waxed on <a href=\"http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2012/10/29/romney-wants-more-responsibility-for-emergency-management-in-states/\">about dissolving the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema), and even said</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"If we can send it back to the private sector, that's even better.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Well, private-sector Super Pacs, <em>here is your chance</em> to show you do stuff better than the government!</p> <p>Second, it's a no-brainer. You are the party that hates waste right? Power is down in many areas, so why waste the money making attack ads no one will see?</p> <p>What's that? You aren't interested because there are only a few swing states affected by the storm? Hmm, that does present a problem. You shouldn't waste money helping those who won't vote your way. Wait \u2026</p> <p>I know! If you start fixing shit, you could plaster your name all over it! You rich guys love putting your name on shit, so people know when you did something good. And if it's stuff the moochers and takers like, then we just may do your bidding and vote against our interests!</p> <p>Think about it, <a href=\"http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/right-wing-billionaires-behind-mitt-romney-20120524\">David or Charles</a>, you could personally rebuild America's most beloved amusement park and bask in the glory as families next summer proudly proclaim, \"I'm taking the kids to Koch Island!\" Then, the 47% will know who is looking out for them!</p> <p>This is not a new idea. Philanthropic plutocrats have stepped up and finished stuff in less disastrous times. Remember, before Donald Trump replaced bedbugs as America's No 1 pest, he stepped up and forked out the cash to finally <a href=\"http://articles.nydailynews.com/2001-11-18/news/18354963_1_donald-trump-trump-tower-skating\">finish the skating rink in Central Park</a>?</p> <p>Seriously, Mr Adelson, you could <em>literally</em> bail out Wall Street and people would call you a hero and in return, you add your <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheldon_Adelson\">signature Vegas gambling flair</a> all over lower Manhattan. Hell, I'll bet you could rename it, \"Sheldon's Wall Street Casino!\" Wall Street loves being compared to a casino.</p> <p>And Karl Rove, you may have the greatest opportunity of all! You could spend a fraction of <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/blogs/itsallpolitics/2012/06/01/154168293/npr-analysis-crossroads-gps-funded-heavily-by-1-million-plus-donations\">your Super Pac gazillions</a> and clear all the fallen trees all over the tristate area. Then, with the zillions left over, you could still take out an ad:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"Crossroads GPS made it possible to cross roads and use your GPS.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>OK, that's kind of weak, but Karl, you, <em>you</em>,with all the millions in free speech dollars you have accrued, I know you could buy a better copy-writer!</p> <p>Look, I know I am a lonely voice in the political wilderness. But honestly, Johnny Super Pac, would it kill any of you to put your money where both sides of your mouth are? After all, you get to raise and spend all this money because the <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2012/07/thanks-citizens-united-for-this-campaign-finance-mess-were-in/260389/\">US supreme court declared you \"people\"</a>, so how about helping some people in a profound time of need?</p>",
  "<p><strong>Was it really a hurricane? </strong>No, by the time it made landfall in the US&#xa0;it had been reclassified to a post-tropical storm.</p> <p><strong>Why was it called </strong><a href=\"http://www.wmo.int/pages/prog/www/tcp/Storm-naming.html\" title=\"\"><strong>Sandy</strong></a><strong>? That seems a very fey 1920s name for a hurricane/tropical storm.</strong> There are six lists of names for tropical cyclones in the Caribbean, Gulf of Mexico and North Atlantic, with names chosen mainly for their pithiness. Sandy was on the 2012 list. But once a storm causes destruction on this scale, it is delisted. Like Katrina and Mitch, we have heard the last of Sandy.</p> <p><strong>How great was the death toll? </strong>In the US the number is put at 18 (though that may rise) \u2013 about the same number that died in the <a href=\"http://www.channel4.com/news/the-great-storm-of-1987-25-years-on\" title=\"\">great storm of 1987</a> in the UK. Sandy has killed several times that number in Cuba and Haiti. Hurricane Katrina, which devastated New Orleans in 2005, led to more than 1,800 deaths.</p> <p><strong>How will Sandy affect the presidential election? </strong>Obama hopes that by flying back to Washington ahead of a rally in Florida and declaring a disaster, he will look presidential. Pundits reckon the storm has blown away&#xa0;any momentum his Republican challenger, Mitt Romney, might have had. But it is also likely to deter early voters from turning out, and they tend to be disproportionately Democrat supporters.</p> <p><strong>Might the election have to </strong><a href=\"http://www.nj.com/us-politics/index.ssf/2012/10/could_hurricane_sandy_delay_th.html\" title=\"\"><strong>be delayed</strong></a><strong>? </strong>According to constitutional experts, this is a \"legal black hole\". It has never happened, and law-makers are eager to avoid a postponement, but some experts suggest states do have the right to delay if holding the election on the designated day (6 November) is problematic. If any did so, however, they could open themselves up to challenges by Congress. Given that there is still a week to go and the level of destruction appears to be containable, the odds are that no state will opt out.</p> <p><strong>Why did the lights in the </strong><a href=\"http://thewall.com/topics/51127-while-almost-everyone-else-is-dark-the-lights-are\" title=\"\"><strong>Goldman Sachs building</strong></a><strong> stay on while New York City hospital had to be evacuated when its back-up power system failed? </strong>Because Goldman Sachs is a global investment banking and securities firm, and a hospital is \u2013 in the last analysis \u2013 just a hospital.</p> <p><strong>What's happening to </strong><a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2012/10/29/how_sandy_hits_the_homeless/\" title=\"\"><strong>the homeless</strong></a><strong>? </strong>The New York City Department of Homeless Services relocated nine homeless centres, evacuated more than 1,000 people and made strenuous efforts to encourage the use of shelters, but some of New York's 50,000-plus homeless population preferred to take their chance on the streets, perhaps relying on reflected light from Goldman Sachs Tower.</p> <p><strong>Did the </strong><a href=\"http://uk.reuters.com/article/2012/10/30/uk-storm-sandy-crane-idUKBRE89S13X20121030\" title=\"\"><strong>dangling crane</strong></a><strong> next to the luxury apartment building near Central Park ever collapse? </strong>When last seen, it was still dangling. </p> <p><strong>Did no one think that a 50-metre-high crane might pose a risk? </strong>Mayor Michael Bloomberg said the crane had been inspected and deemed not to be a risk, but that God moved in mysterious ways. \"Just because it was inspected, that doesn't mean God doesn't do things or that metal doesn't fail.\"</p> <p><strong>What will the disaster cost? </strong>Storm damage is put at about $20bn, of which $8bn will be insured losses. Hefty sums, but only about a quarter of the cost of the damage wrought by Katrina.</p> <p><strong>How will the US economy cope? </strong>Rather well, bizarrely. Destruction is ultimately thought to be good for business, producing investment \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.680news.com/business/article/416736--sandy-may-slow-us-economy-in-short-term-but-areas-like-construction-will-benefit-in-long-run\" title=\"\">especially in reconstruction</a> \u2013 that more than offsets what has been lost.

Bloomberg said 6,400 people are being cared for in 76 shelters, many of which are in public schools in the city, all of which will remained closed tomorrow.</p> <p>There was little good news for the 220,000 ConEdison customers who are without power in Lower Manhattan. The CEO of ConEd, Kevin Burke, said it was the \"worst storm in ConEd's history\" and that it would take three to four days to fix up the substation at 14th Street and FDR Drive, which failed so catastrophically late on Monday. Better news for Staten Island: three substations there are back online. At 11am today,&#xa0;780,000 customers were without electrical service.</p> <p>It's clear that New York City will remain paralysed for days to come: seven East River railway tunnels are flooded; the Holland, Queens, Midtown and Brooklyn-Battery tunnels are also inundated. Five miles of water fill the Path tunnel between the World Trade Center and New Jersey \u2013 it will take three to four days to restore this link. I</p> <p>The partially collapsed crane in Midtown Manhattan has been secured and has been declared safe. As a precaution, some residents have been evacuated.</p> <p>Bloomberg said the New York City Marathon, due to take place on Sunday, was expected to go ahead. Confirmation of this would come in the morning. But the Greenwich Village halloween parade has been postponed until next week.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-10-30T22:25:33.603Z\">at 10.25pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-50904e3795cb49410b863b87\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-30T22:01:27.743Z\">10.01pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The Guardian's <strong>Gizelle Lugo</strong> has been out in badly affected Queens today and took these pictures.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-e8d2a8b6-7627-4e43-9e39-23d9cb28b1f5\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/30/1351634189850/-460.jpeg\" alt=\"Downed tree in East Elmhurst, Queens, after Sandy hit New York\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A downed tree in East Elmhurst, Queens, after Sandy hit New York City.

People are without power, and a few trees are down, but they have homes.</p> <p>In Loch Arbour, a tiny community neighbouring Asbury Park, it's a different story. A row of six houses that once proudly faced out to the Atlantic has been decimated by the storm.</p> <p>One of the homes, a two-storey wood-panelled building painted pink, is missing almost its entire ground floor. On one side the front wall has been swept away. Inside furniture is entirely missing too, replaced by three feet of sand. The back wall is also gone, with the surge having swept clean through the house and across two gardens behind. The home only has one full supporting wall left and has been cordoned off by police.</p> <p>Bill Gleeson, a funeral home director, owns the home next door. He's lived there with his family since 1986. His home has been more fortunate, most of the walls are intact, although inside there are water marks up to 5ft high in places. The floor is covered in a thick layer of sand.</p> <p>\"The water just washed right through,\" Gleeson said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/AdamGabbatt/status/263388826079207425\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Bill Gleeson's house in Loch Arbour suffered severe damage. 3ft of sand left inside. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search/%23sandy\">#sandy</a> cc @<a href=\"https://twitter.com/matthewwells\">matthewwells</a> <a href=\"http://t.co/4nJdinLt\" title=\"http://twitter.com/AdamGabbatt/status/263388826079207425/photo/1\">twitter.com/AdamGabbatt/st\u2026</a></p>&mdash; Adam Gabbatt (@AdamGabbatt) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AdamGabbatt/status/263388826079207425\" data-datetime=\"2012-10-30T21:16:04+00:00\">October 30, 2012</a></blockquote> </figure>  <p>In Loch Arbour, West Rekeda, 47, manager of Kassin Beach club, also said the ocean \u201ccame right through the building\u201d.</p> <p>The club is closer to the beach than the houses. There's not much left of it. The back wall is still intact but the interior of the one-storey white building has been swept away. Individual planks are missing from the large blue porch, leaving it looking like a cattle grid. All the walls at the front of the structure are missing.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s sad.

The main problem for the fire department on Tuesday afternoon was towing cars off the beach, as gawkers headed down to the coast to survey the damage.</p> <p>\"Extremely windy but we were pretty blessed not to get the rain because that would have made it a lot worse,\" said Virginia Ferraro, whose husband was engaged in digging out a fire rescue van that had got stuck trying to help out the driver of a white sedan.</p> <p>\"It was crazy windy,\" she said, but she suffered no damage to her property. \"But they warned us, they did a good job of warning us.\"</p> <p>Ferraro didn't have power, but had made chilli on the stove. \"It was pretty good,\" she said.</p> <p><em>Adam Gabbatt</em></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-10-30T21:33:58.846Z\">at 9.33pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-50903c96b57986a0fe1d497e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-30T20:46:14.415Z\">8.46pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The Guardian's Alexander Hotz takes a walk down Van Brunt Street in<strong> Red Hook, Brooklyn:</strong></p> <p>All businesses along the main commercial drag of Van Brunt Street were closed as owners struggled to clean out their buildings and restore power.

Bloomberg said the city was working with staff to move patients out.</p> <p>Television reporters at the scene described a race against time on Monday night as doctors and nurses carried newborns wrapped in blankets, their breathing tubes still attached, from the intensive care unit down multiple flights of stairs in the dark and into waiting lines of ambulances.&#xa0;</p> <p>Problems with telephone service meant that the families of patients were not being called to inform them that their relatives had been moved, the hospital said. It was left to the receiving hospitals, among them Mount Sinai and Sloan Kettering, to inform them, according to the hospital.</p> <p>On Tuesday, a spokesperson for the hospital said the facility, which has eight different generators, including one on a higher floor, was still trying to assess what went wrong.</p> <p>The spokesman told Stacey Sager from WABC that they do not think all eight went out but if in fact some are still working, it is not enough to power the whole hospital.</p> <p>NYU didn't anticipate such heavy flooding from Sandy, the massive storm that hit the coast on Monday. They decided not to evacuate all patients before the storm, in contrast to the procedure carried out by Irene as it did with a year ago, <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2012/10/30/health/sandy-hospital/index.html.\">according to CNN.</a></p> <p>Dr Andrew Brotman, senior vice president and vice dean for clinical affairs and strategy at the hospital told CNN that, between 7 and 7.45pm on Monday the hospital's basement, lower floors, and elevator shafts filled with 10 to 12 feet of water and the hospital lost its power.</p> <p>\"Things went downhill very, very rapidly and very unexpectedly,\" Brotman said. \"The flooding was just unprecedented.\"</p> <p>Emergency generators began, he said, but two hours later, about 90% of that power went out, and the hospital decided to evacuate patients, beginning with those critically ill.</p> <p>One report, <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-505263_162-57542362/inside-nyc-hospitals-near-disaster-during-sandy/?tag=socsh\">from CBS News</a>, said that the second backup device, on a low floor, was disabled by the water, while the primary backup, on the roof, was disabled when a fuel pump on a lower floor was flooded.</p> <p>Four of the newborn babies were on respirators which were breathing for them and when the power went out, each baby was carried down nine flights of stairs while a nurse manually squeezed a bag to deliver air to the baby's lungs.</p> <p>The hospital usually has about 800 patients, but hundreds of patients were discharged over the weekend in anticipation of the storm.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-7ebb0fc0-d76e-49ed-a3bf-8bcbbd019b91\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/30/1351615586962/2e28f91d-f01d-4f7c-8796-c512dd8822a8-460.jpeg\" alt=\"Hospital workers evacuate patient Deborah Dadlani from NYU Langone Medical Center during Hurricane Sandy.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hospital workers evacuate patient Deborah Dadlani from NYU Langone Medical Center during Hurricane Sandy.

He had been planning to hold events in Ohio but will remain at White House.</p> <p>In some ways \u2013 a big way \u2013 the storm is the biggest campaign event of all, an unexpected bonus for Obama. It allows him to appear presidential and casts Mitt Romney in a bit part .</p> <p>The praise from New Jersey governor Chris Christie for Obama over his handling of Sandy has been a big boost. The Romney campaign must be wondering what on earth Christie was thinking. It is one thing to acknowledge help from the White House but did he really have to go far as to describe this as \"outstanding\".</p> <p>Romney is the one on the defensive, reporters watching for whether he appearance at relief event in Ohio veers into campaigning.</p> <p>I spent an hour this morning speaking to Obama campaign workers on the ground in Iowa and other swing states in the Mid-West and West and they are unaffected by Sandy. They are going ahead as normal with campaign plans, stepping up, as scheduled, getting out the votes. This effort will intensify over the weekend, with volunteers working three-hour shifts from 8.00 am on Saturday through to 9pm and from noon to 9pm on Sunday.&#xa0;Predictions among some Obama campaign workers on the ground that Romney has North Carolina in bag, and will take Florida, Virginia and Colorado. Obama, they hope, will take Ohio, Iowa, Nevada and New Hampshire.</p> <p>Mitt Romney is to take a gamble by resuming campaigning on Wednesday. He has scheduled several campaign events in Florida: in Tampa, Coral Gables and Jacksonville. The danger for him is that people might not yet be ready by then to make the switch from focus on the storm to politics, and his speeches on the campaign trail may look petty compared with Obama still dealing with the storm aftermath from the White House.</p> <p><em>Ewen MacAskill in Washington DC</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-9b9c90e3-e0fb-455a-b23b-6a335342091f\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/30/1351615172227/2cbffcf6-7e87-4a88-8e37-9f09b6e4dd8f-460.jpeg\" alt=\"Barack Obama receives an update on the ongoing response to Hurricane Sandy on Tuesday, in the Situation Room of the White House.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Barack Obama receives an update on the ongoing response to Hurricane Sandy on Tuesday, in the Situation Room of the White House.

Four runners looked around surreptitiously as they squeezed around the metal barrier blocking the road that runs through the park at 79th street.</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019re idiots, some people just don\u2019t realise they are taking their lives in their own hands,\u201d said a park worker shortly after escorting a sheepish looking jogger over a low wall and onto the pavement of Fifth Avenue. \u201cThere is a lot of damage, a lot of limbs of trees down, and there could still be a lot that come down as the day goes on.

Water and debris has choked the entrance right up to the tunnel's roof, with flotsam bobbing just beneath a sign warning drivers that the clearance height is 12 ft 7ins.</p> <p>A maintenance truck lies almost entirely submerged on the sliproad down to the tunnel. There was no sign of the water receding in the 20 minutes I spent there.</p> <p>Many buildings in this southernmost part of Manhattan were inundated by the storm surge. Along Water Street, which runs parallel to the East River waterfront, a fire crew surveyed the damage to their station. Windows were smashed and sandbags proved useless against the flow of water. Inside, uniforms were strewn about the floor, which was still damp.</p> <p>Mandatory evacuations were in place in this part of the city, one of the most vulnerable places to a storms surge.</p> <p>The water poured into the entrance to the Whitehall ferry terminal, which provides a connection to Staten Island.</p> <p>An MTA employee told the Guardian that at 7.30am water was \u201cup to the platform\u201d in the terminal. He said some of the tunnels running under the East River from Manhattan to Brooklyn were entirely full of water, from roof to floor. The MTA was unable to pump out water quick enough because equipment was affected by power outages.</p> <p>Most people had heeded the extensive warnings and these streets were largely clear before the storm hit on Monday. But some people were caught out by the severity of the flooding. A new-looking white BMW 3 series car had been carried down a street close to the ferry terminal and dumped askew, partly on the road and partly on the sidewalk. A door had apparently been forced open by the storm, and pools of dank-smelling water had accumulated in the passenger footwells.</p> <p>Most of lower Manhattan below 24th Street was without power Tuesday morning. In Midtown, the damage was less from flooding and more from high winds, with branches and other foliage lining the roads. In some places there had been minor scaffolding collapses and tiles had smashed to the ground.</p> <p>There is a large police presence: squad cars with flashing lights were crawling around Manhattan, although the clean-up operation did not seem to have kicked in by 11am and the police seemed mostly to be reporting damage and acting as reassurance.</p> <p><em>Adam Gabbatt</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-ff0efab7-a541-4d26-beb3-e07281a88354\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/30/1351612279741/95325abd-cb27-487d-9737-475f82845650-460.jpeg\" alt=\"Hurricane Sandy floods reach the street level of the flooded Battery Park underpass, which leads to the Brooklyn-Battery tunnel in New York.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Water reaches the street level of the flooded Battery Park underpass, which leads to the Brooklyn-Battery tunnel in New York.

Riverside Park had a few downed trees, but the inconvenience was more caused by the downed branches, that numerous joggers jumped over as they went for their morning runs.</p> <p>Doormen and supers were hard at work hosing leaves from the sidewalks and curbs in front of their buildings. Some even had the time to put up Halloween decorations in their buildings lobbies.</p> <p>On Broadway, some stores lost their signs, which blew off in the wind.

This morning the man once seen as a likely Republican vice presidential pick has called president Barack Obama \u201coutstanding\u201d and blasted suggestions that his state would make a great photo op for Mitt Romney.</p> <p>New Jersey has been hit hard, three people have lost their lives so far to the storm, 2.4m people are out of power and levees have broken in northern New Jersey leaving at least four towns with up to 6ft of water. And Christie has no time for politics.</p> <p>\u201cI have to say, the administration, the president, himself and FEMA Administrator Craig Fugate have been outstanding with us so far,\u201d Christie said on ABC\u2019s Good Morning America. \u201cWe have a great partnership with them.\u201d</p> <p>Obama called on Christie Monday night, the governor said, and offered to help in any way he could. New Jersey has now been declared a major disaster area, opening up government funding for recovery efforts.</p> <p>\u201cI want to thank the president personally for his personal attention to this,\u201d said Christie.</p> <p>On Fox News host Steve Doocy made a pitch for a Christie/Romney photo op in some disaster-stricken New Jersey&#xa0;\u201cOver the last couple of months, you have appeared throughout the country, governor, on behalf of Mitt Romney,\u201d Doocy said. \u201cWe hear that perhaps Mr Romney may do some storm-related events. Is there any possibility that governor Romney may go to New Jersey to tour some of the damage with you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI have no idea, nor am I the least bit concerned or interested,\u201d Christie snapped. \u201cI\u2019ve got a job to do here in New Jersey that\u2019s much bigger than presidential politics and I could care less about any of that stuff.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI have a job to do,\u201d he added. \u201cI\u2019ve got 2.4 million people out of power, I\u2019ve got devastation on the shore, I\u2019ve got floods in the northern part of my state.

The rivers are going down. In general the departments have put down the vigilance, it was red, now it is normal. They are trying to repair the roads and bridges that collapsed.</p> </blockquote> <p>He said the most serious impact of the storm had been on agriculture - the loss of crops and livestock. Christian Aid was going out at the moment to see what the state and other organisations were not able to provide, \u201cand to provide what is missing\u201d. They would be helping repair houses, replace livestock and provide seeds.</p> <p>Asked about the government\u2019s response, he said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>To be honest I think this time they did what they could, because they managed to put more than 20,000 people in temporary shelter, but in total you have 200,000 people that were affected by Sandy. That means there is a huge gap. We think we could provide some support to complement what they are doing.</p> </blockquote> <p>What could the government do differently?</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Christian Aid [is pushing] the government to take the environment situation more seriously, because if the country had the right trees, the right forests in place, I think that could help. It\u2019s really important for them to prioritise this in their future budget, for example. The Ministry of Environment in Haiti has 0.65% of the budget. I don\u2019t think it is normal. As a priority sector they need to receive more in order to help Haiti have better cover in terms of trees, and that could help us with all these hurricane storms that will come in here.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-canonical-url=\"\" >  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;object data=&quot;http://abfiles.s3.amazonaws.com/swf/fullsize_player.swf&quot; id=&quot;boo_embed_1032480&quot; type=&quot;application/x-shockwave-flash&quot; height=&quot;129&quot; width=&quot;400&quot;&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;movie&quot; value=&quot;http://abfiles.s3.amazonaws.com/swf/fullsize_player.swf&quot;&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;scale&quot; value=&quot;noscale&quot;&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;salign&quot; value=&quot;lt&quot;&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;bgColor&quot; value=&quot;#FFFFFF&quot;&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;allowScriptAccess&quot; value=&quot;always&quot;&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;wmode&quot; value=&quot;window&quot;&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;FlashVars&quot; value=&quot;mp3=http%3A%2F%2Faudioboo.fm%2Fboos%2F1032480-hurricane-sandy-in-haiti-prospery-raymond-of-christian-aid-talks-to-the-guardian-s-paul-owen.mp3%3Fkeyed%3Dtrue%26source%3Dembed&amp;amp;mp3Title=Hurricane+Sandy+in+Haiti%3A+Prospery+Raymond+of+Christian+Aid+talks+to+the+Guardian%27s+Paul+Owen&amp;amp;mp3Time=02.11pm+30+Oct+2012&amp;amp;mp3LinkURL=http%3A%2F%2Faudioboo.fm%2Fboos%2F1032480-hurricane-sandy-in-haiti-prospery-raymond-of-christian-aid-talks-to-the-guardian-s-paul-owen&amp;amp;mp3Author=PaulTOwen&amp;amp;rootID=boo_embed_1032480&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe style=&quot;margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: none; display: block; width: 400px; height: 145px;&quot; allowtransparency=&quot;allowtransparency&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; hspace=&quot;0&quot; marginheight=&quot;0&quot; marginwidth=&quot;0&quot; vspace=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;https://audioboo.fm/boos/1032480-hurricane-sandy-in-haiti-prospery-raymond-of-christian-aid-talks-to-the-guardian-s-paul-owen/embed&quot; title=&quot;Audioboo player&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-508fe1d2b5792d0b94e6eaac\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-30T14:18:58.992Z\">2.18pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>A video posted to YouTube captures the collapse last night of the <strong>facade of a building</strong> on 8th Ave in NYC.

We had tremendous amounts of water, tremendous amounts of flooding, severe winds, and we\u2019re seeing those effects across the country, with damaged homes, flooded homes, people displaced, crops and gardens destroyed and lives lost: 52 lives were lost, and it\u2019s extremely heartbreaking.</p> </blockquote> <p>She said she had just got off the phone to a friend whose colleague lost his entire family in a landslide that destroyed their home with his family inside.</p> <p>Van de Wetering explained how Tearfund was helping to respond to the disaster: since the earthquake of 2010 and Hurricane Isaac last year the charity had been helping repair homes and \u201cto address some of the agriculture and livelihood issues\u201d, especially in the rural mountains. \u201cNow Hurricane Sandy has created even more need and to be sure this response will also be addressing the needs of some of those people who now find themselves in a very difficult situation.\u201d</p> <p>I asked her to explain how Sandy had caused problems in terms of food shortages.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We can look at the context prior to both tropical storm Isaac and Hurricane Sandy with increasing food prices and food insecurity throughout the last several months. With tropical storm Isaac and now Sandy a lot of the crops have been destroyed. There are numerous crops that were ready for harvesting that have now been destroyed. Plantain trees and plantations ripped down, gardens flooded, and so in a country that primarily supports itself agriculturally, this is an extreme hit to the country.</p> </blockquote> <p>There would now be an increase in food prices and \u201cfood insecurity\u201d, with families finding it more difficult to harvest or sell their crops, she said. This would make it more difficult for them to send their children to school or repair their homes. Flooding and damaged homes were an immediate problem, \u201cbut in the coming months we\u2019re going to be looking at a real severe food security situation\u201d.</p> <p>She was less optimistic than Lisa Laumann of Save the Children (<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/oct/30/sandy-superstorm-flooding-power-cuts#block-508fce92b5792d0b94e6eaa0%20\">see earlier</a>) that the government was well-prepared to deal with this disaster, coming as it does so soon after the 2010 earthquake and Isaac in 2011.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The government has been active from the very beginning. The national disaster management system has been mobilised early on, and this is a nationwide system. And the government has also been meeting with international organisations to coordinate the response, and has also allocated an additional $800,000 for initial response actions, so they have been very present and very active, but the reality is that they\u2019re stretched in terms of capacity and in terms of ability to respond \u2026</p> <p>The capacity for the government to respond even prior to these storms was starting to diminish. Funding is drying up for cholera response. So, big concern. There\u2019ll need to be a national joint effort with all key stakeholders to respond and to respond swiftly.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-canonical-url=\"\" >  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;object data=&quot;http://abfiles.s3.amazonaws.com/swf/fullsize_player.swf&quot; id=&quot;boo_embed_1032437&quot; type=&quot;application/x-shockwave-flash&quot; height=&quot;129&quot; width=&quot;400&quot;&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;movie&quot; value=&quot;http://abfiles.s3.amazonaws.com/swf/fullsize_player.swf&quot;&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;scale&quot; value=&quot;noscale&quot;&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;salign&quot; value=&quot;lt&quot;&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;bgColor&quot; value=&quot;#FFFFFF&quot;&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;allowScriptAccess&quot; value=&quot;always&quot;&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;wmode&quot; value=&quot;window&quot;&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;FlashVars&quot; value=&quot;mp3=http%3A%2F%2Faudioboo.fm%2Fboos%2F1032437-hurricane-sandy-in-haiti-kristie-van-de-wetering-of-tearfund-talks-to-paul-owen-of-the-guardian.mp3%3Fkeyed%3Dtrue%26source%3Dembed&amp;amp;mp3Title=Hurricane+Sandy+in+Haiti%3A+Kristie+van+de+Wetering+of+Tearfund+talks+to+Paul+Owen+of+the+Guardian&amp;amp;mp3Time=01.35pm+30+Oct+2012&amp;amp;mp3LinkURL=http%3A%2F%2Faudioboo.fm%2Fboos%2F1032437-hurricane-sandy-in-haiti-kristie-van-de-wetering-of-tearfund-talks-to-paul-owen-of-the-guardian&amp;amp;mp3Author=PaulTOwen&amp;amp;rootID=boo_embed_1032437&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe style=&quot;margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: none; display: block; width: 400px; height: 145px;&quot; allowtransparency=&quot;allowtransparency&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; hspace=&quot;0&quot; marginheight=&quot;0&quot; marginwidth=&quot;0&quot; vspace=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;https://audioboo.fm/boos/1032437-hurricane-sandy-in-haiti-kristie-van-de-wetering-of-tearfund-talks-to-paul-owen-of-the-guardian/embed&quot; title=&quot;Audioboo player&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-4be088ea-7c66-4ebc-90d8-310c0259fef9\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/30/1351605351867/5892f225-892b-46fa-822f-1e35d257ffdf-460.jpeg\" alt=\"A resident of Leogane, Haiti makes her way to her home as the water level continues to rise on 26 October 2012.

It went through Cuba, and we were at quite a distance from it. So when it came through it was still quite strong, although it was just a tropical storm. [It was] followed by days of intensive, intensive rain, that Thursday and Friday of last week were just \u2026 I\u2019ve hardly seen so much rain in a long time.</p> <p>It really led to a lot of damage in the country. There\u2019s been a substantial amount of damage to roads, a substantial amount of flooding in agricultural areas raising serious concerns about crops, and then of course with the standing water and the flow of water the increased concern about diaorrhea and disease, particularly cholera.</p> </blockquote> <p>Laumann was reasonably optimistic about the government's ability to deal with these issues.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>What we saw during tropical storm Isaac and I think in tropical storm Sandy as well is a government that is challenged by the recurrent disasters that hit the country but also a government that is increasingly able to deal with this type of disaster. By that I mean that the government has a national system for the management of risks and disaster, and in the last two crises that have hit the country it has taken the lead.</p> </blockquote> <p>Organisations such as her own had \u201cplayed a role in preparation and response\u201d, but increasingly they were working under government leadership. \u201cI don\u2019t want to sound like I think the government has infinite capacity to respond \u2026 but I think it\u2019s important to recognise that the government does have increasing ability to coordinate and manage disaster preparedness and response here.\u201d</p> <p>Why did so many people die, despite the eye of the storm not hitting Haiti directly?</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>People die because they are in the wrong place at the wrong time or because the infrastructure is not such that it protects them from incidents that occur. I think if the road infrastructure was stronger in this country, if there were better flood control, fewer people would die in emergencies like these.</p> </blockquote> <p>Laumann was speaking from a high-up area of Port-au-Prince, where there was no standing water, and children were out and off to school. \u201cThere certainly has been damage to some buildings, but it looks from here like a fairly normal day.\u201d</p> <p>But in the camps for those made homeless by the storm \u201cit\u2019s different\u201d:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>People lost their few assets that they had. They were flooded out \u2026 Life is much more challenging for them. It\u2019s hard when you lose most of your possessions or have them destroyed by a storm.</p> </blockquote> <p>In the south of the country there was a lot of road damage, she said.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The last damage map that I took a look at showed damage in pretty much every department of the southern part of the country, much worse than the north. When you think about the fact that Haiti is already a road-challenged country, that\u2019s going to make problems for people who need to move around and for people who need to respond. Bridges have been broken, sections of road have been washed out, there\u2019s some land sliding over some of the roads.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-b049e51c-f6ba-45c2-bc8b-89eac47f229b\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/30/1351602063625/42cd89c9-da9f-4fd0-a7d3-6298969cdbe3-460.jpeg\" alt=\"The interior of a home is flooded after the passing of Hurricane Sandy in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, on Saturday 27 October 2012.

Sandy has taken on the structure of a wintertime low-pressure area, so is no longer a tropical cyclone.</p> <p>The NHC says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The primary difference between a tropical cyclone and a wintertime cyclone is the energy source. Tropical cyclones extract heat from the ocean and grow by releasing that heat in the atmosphere near the storm center. Wintertime cyclones (also called extratropical or frontal <br>lows), on the other hand, get most of their energy from temperature contrasts in the atmosphere, and this energy usually gets distributed over larger areas.&#xa0;</p> <p>Because of these differences, tropical cyclones tend to have more compact wind fields, tend to be more symmetric, and have a well-defined inner core of strong winds. Wintertime lows have strong temperature contrasts or fronts attached to them, have a broader wind field, and more complex distributions of rain or snow.&#xa0;</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-508f94a795cb55519dae8b43\" class=\"block is-summary\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-30T08:49:43.874Z\">8.49am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Fire in Queens, New York</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>A fire department spokesman has told AP more than 190 firefighters are battling <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/oct/30/sandy-superstorm-flooding-power-cuts?commentpage=all#block-508f8bc5b5792d0b94e6ea81\">the blaze in Breezy Point</a>.

Visually, we interpreted this as a 1920s-style circus. The event involved our services creating circus-themed stalls to showcase their work, a life-size model elephant, and ringmasters entertaining guests. The annual report did not escape the circus theme either: we felt it was important to encourage as many people as possible to read about the trust's journey and showcase the staff's amazing work.</p> <p>A bold stance, perhaps, but it was certainly a head-turner in our drive to ensure that every member of the Merseyside community is encouraged to get involved as we move towards foundation trust (FT) status.</p> </blockquote> <p>As usual you can get in touch with the team throughout the day by tweeting us at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/gdnhealthcare\">@GdnHealthcare</a> or emailing us at healthcare@guardian.co.uk. </p> </div>   </div>",

I said in my last post that OSM data is complimentary to OS data, not a replacement for it and three cases at Surrey Heath are proving this. Our workflow internally now involves digitising new developments into OpenStreetMap, including the roads, building outlines, land parcels and house numbers, as we're doing the street naming work. Using a MapProxy based web service provided by Astun Technology (which caches OSMGB tiles provided by the project at Nottingham) we've been able to plug all this new mapping data back into our intranet mapping system for users consumption along with all our other usual internal vector data.

Those cards might contain local restaurants, the traffic on your commute home, or when your flight is about to take off. They appear automatically as Google tries to guess the information you'll need at any given moment.</p> <p> While it seems like a relatively simple service, it's only really possible because of the massive amount of computational power Google can leverage alongside the massive amount of data Google knows about you thanks to your searches.</p> </blockquote> <p> Which is the tradeoff.

More importantly, in an ecosystem where too many app authors do the bare minimum in terms of security, apps should have that same option.</p> <p> The original iPhone succeeded not because of apps. No, it succeeded because it was a better, more usable phone than almost anything else on the market. It just worked. It had voicemails we could see before listening, contacts we could easily edit on the phone, and a Web browser that was better than any mobile browser we'd ever seen before.</p> <p> But the OS is showing its age. Little nuances like the somewhat functional search screen, Favorites in Contacts, and VIPs in Mail show that iOS is under structural pressure to deal with the volume of data it tries to display in a viable way. Notifications and the Settings app seem fragmented and are starting to become as disorganized as the Windows Control Panel (that's bad!). Photo Stream sharing is a joke. It's unusable.

One point worth noting is on electoral fraud - made out by some to be a big problem. Trouble is the data don't agree: </p> <blockquote> <p>Of course, where there are 86 convictions (14 per year), there may be many more uncaught crimes. For the sake of argument, let's say that for each conviction there are 100 cases of fraud that go undetected. If that were the case, fraud would amount to about 0.003% of the vote, which would not be enough to affect even the close 2000 presidential election. Fox News looked into the problem and concluded \"One doesn't have to look far to find instances of fraudulent ballots cast in actual elections.\" But readers of that article have commented that Fox did have to look pretty far: all the way back to 1984, when a study found \"thousands\" of fraudulent votes between 1968 and 1982 in state races. Again, this comes out to somewhere in the range of 0.001% of votes. While every fraudulent vote is a felony that should be taken seriously, there is no way this level of activity could affect a national race.</p> </blockquote> <h2><a href=\"http://trollemipsum.appspot.com/\">Having trouble finding the right words? &gt;&gt; Trollem Ipsum</a></h2> <p>Haha. </p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.asymco.com/2012/10/22/nokias-price-for-exclusivity/\">Nokia's price for exclusivity &gt;&gt; asymco</a></h2> <p>Remember the $1bn Nokia has received from Microsoft for Windows Phone, after killing Symbian? </p> <blockquote> <p>The foregone revenues from Symbian (assuming they had been able to maintain the decline to the level of 150m units that they had originally forecast) would be about $9bn. This means that had Nokia not knifed Symbian and had sold the shortfall units at an average price of $200 they would have received an additional $9bn in sales. Furthermore, assuming a margin of 33% for those units, Nokia received from Microsoft one third from of what she gave up for exclusivity.</p> <p> In other words, the net cost of the Microsoft exclusive relationship is at least $2bn in operating profit.</p> <p> This turns out to be the difference between being profitable and being distressed.</p> </blockquote> <p> Utterly stunning.

The centre of the storm was moving at up to 30mph, significantly faster than at the start of the day, heading for two cold-weather systems to form a hellish super-storm.</p> <p>Forecasters said the combined \"Frankenstorm\", as it has been nicknamed, could bring a foot of rain in some places, as well as potentially lethal storm surges, especially in lower Manhattan. High winds may produce power outages that last for days, while residents of West Virginia, North Carolina and Kentucky were told to expect up to 2ft of snow.</p> <p>The storm has killed at least 69 people on its path through the Caribbean, including 51 in Haiti. As Sandy began to lurch westwards towards the east coast, Barack Obama and authorities in nine states appealed to people to stay calm and out of harm's way. \"This is a serious and big storm and my first message is: 'You need to take this very seriously,'\" Obama told a briefing at the White House on Monday.</p> <p>He reinforced instructions to residents from local authorities. \"Please listen to what your state and local officials are saying. When they tell you to evacuate, you need to evacuate,\" the president said. \"Do not delay, don't pause, don't question the instructions that are being given, because this is a serious storm and could potentially have fatal consequences if people haven't acted.\"</p> <p>The storm forced Obama and his challenger, Mitt Romney, to suspend their campaigns, at least through Tuesday.</p> <p>Nine states declared a state of emergency, shutting down transport systems and schools and ordering residents of low-lying areas to head for higher ground. More than 12,000 flights were cancelled across the region, and the main rail service suspended.</p> <p>In lower Manhattan, which was expected to get the worst of the storm, New York City's mayor, Michael Bloomberg, warned that authorities were braced for an 11ft surge of seawater that could leave low-lying areas of the city under water. The city advised some 370,000 people in low-lying areas to evacuate at the weekend.</p> <p>By late morning, the authorities were moving to shut down the tunnels that connect Manhattan to Brooklyn and New Jersey. Subways, buses, trains and schools were shut, as was the New York stock exchange, and Bloomberg warned normal services should not be expected before Wednesday.</p> <p>In the meantime, Sandy continued to churn up the coast. In North Carolina, the crew was forced to abandon the tall ship HMS Bounty after it began to take on water. The coast guard plucked 14 crew members from lifeboats. Late last night, the body of one crew member, named as Claudene Christian, 42, was discovered by a helicopter crew. The captain, Robin Walbridge, 63, was missing.</p> <p>The storm also hammered coastal resort towns. \"In some places we have 2.5ft to 3ft of water on the ground and this is low tide,\" the Atlantic City mayor, Lorenzo Langford, told CNN. \"When Mother Nature sends her wrath your way we're at her mercy.\"</p> <p>There were reports of power outages from Virginia to Massachusetts.</p> <p>Away from the water in Manhattan, police cars drove slowly along streets broadcasting warnings: \"You must evacuate this area by 7pm today. Any person who knowingly violates this order may be charged with a class B misdemeanour.\"</p> <p>But Mark Gluck, a professor at Rutgers University, said Sandy was not about keep him from his daily cycle route. \"A bit of drizzle, a bit of wind, it's a perfectly fine day to go cycling,\" Gluck said.</p> <p>He had already stocked up his apartment to ride out the storm. \"I'm well prepared, I've got food and water, I think it'll be fine.\"</p> <p>Most, though, appeared to heed the warnings to hunker down at home or get out of town. But that created its own sense of dread. In Washington DC and other cities, many supermarkets ran out of staples such as bottled water and batteries well before the storm bore down.</p> <p>New York City's mandatory evacuation saw people crowding into evacuation centres across the five boroughs. Around 80 stayed overnight at the John Jay high school in Park Slope, Brooklyn, with many more expected last night.</p> <p>After last year's hurricane Irene, staff and volunteers were ready for them. A handwritten sign inside the door divided newcomers into two categories: people to the right, animals to the left.</p> <p>\"This time last year we had 1,000 people in here,\" said one of three officials as he stood outside on a break. \"We had two rooms full of dogs and cats too. This year we've even got a turtle. And that snake's got his eye on the mouse. It's not gonna happen.\"</p> <p>Inside, people from Coney Island, Red Hook and other low-lying areas of Brooklyn gathered to wait out the storm. They were served a cooked breakfast and there was BBQ chicken for lunch.</p> <p>Staff were surprised there were not more of them and wondered whether last year, when Irene passed New York without major incident, had given people false sense of security. \"They ran out last year thinking it was the end, and it wasn't. But this one's different.\"</p> <p>\"It's horrible,\" said Davon Little, who manages a supermarket in the Brookland neighbourhood of north-east Washington after he ran out of water for a second time. \"The line's been going all the way down the aisles. It's crowded and there are no carts outside. I've had two arguments over beer.\"</p>"

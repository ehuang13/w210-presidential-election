He told folks he was \"the ideal candidate\" for the Tea Party. Now suddenly he's saying, \"what, who, me?\" He's forgetting what his own positions are, and he's betting that you will, too.</p> <p>I mean, he's changing up so much and backtracking and sidestepping, we've got to name this condition that he's going through. I think it's called <strong>Romnesia</strong>. That's what it's called. I think that's what he's going through.</p> <p>Now, I'm not a medical doctor, but I do want to go over some of the symptoms with you because I want to make sure nobody else catches it.</p> <p>If you say you're for equal pay for equal work, but you keep refusing to say whether or not you'd sign a bill that protects equal pay for equal work \u2013 you might have Romnesia.</p> <p>If you say women should have access to contraceptive care, but you support legislation that would let your employer deny you contraceptive care \u2013 you might have a case of Romnesia.</p> <p>If you say you'll protect a woman's right to choose, but you stand up at a primary debate and said that you'd be delighted to sign a law outlawing that right to choose in all cases, man, you've definitely got Romnesia.</p> <p>Now, this extends to other issues. If you say earlier in the year, I'm going to give a tax cut to the top 1% and then in a debate you say, I don't know anything about giving tax cuts to rich folks \u2013 you need to get a thermometer, take your temperature, because you've probably got Romnesia.</p> <p>If you say that you're a champion of the coal industry when, while you were governor you stood in front of a coal plant and said, this plant will kill you, that's some Romnesia.</p> <p>So I think you're beginning to be able to identify these symptoms.</p> <p>And if you come down with a case of Romnesia, and you can't seem to remember the policies that are still on your website, or the promises you've made over the six years you've been running for president, here's the good news: Obamacare covers pre-existing conditions.

The Guardian was always spoken about on the blogosphere back in the States but I've only been a regular reader since moving here. While I'll read the Saturday paper in coffee shops on the weekend, I'm predominantly an online reader \u2013 it's easier to find what you want that way.</p> <p>My favourite writers are Naomi Wolf and Ana Marie Cox. They cover US politics but in a liberal, left-leaning way which is pretty uncommon in the US media. I like the fact that Gary Younge writes about the US as an outsider \u2013 despite being a native, that's now how I feel too. I've also enjoyed the US election coverage \u2013 particularly the liveblogging of the presidential debates. I came over here to work on a PhD in astrophysics, which is now complete, and I'm working on post-doctoral research at Cardiff University. I sometimes wish the media would be more creative in their ways of covering astrophysics. It seems many outlets have quite a generic approach that lacks in-depth analysis. Earlier this week a new, Earth-like planet was discovered orbiting the Alpha Centauri star but the way it was reported was pretty dull!</p>",

Equal numbers of women and men are now saying they support Romney in the <a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/poll/158048/romney-obama-among-likely-voters.aspx\">last</a> Gallup poll. This is a disaster because Democrats can only win with the traditional gender gap, which is usually in the double digits. </p> <p>The Romney team has managed rather brilliantly to obfuscate his position on every issue \u2013 very few women know that if you go to his website, you find out that he does not support a woman's right to abortion <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-18563_162-57501172/romney-my-views-on-abortion-rights-are-clear-/\">except</a> in cases of rape or incest. Ryan is even more drastic in his extremism: supporting ending Planned Parenthood, for instance \u2013 which provides health care to 3 million Americans \u2013 and in <a href=\"http://www.dailykos.com/story/2012/08/14/1119867/-Rachel-Maddow-Welcome-Congressman-Ultrasound-Ryan-to-the-Republican-Ticket\">favor</a> of punitive transvaginal probes for women who dare to choose abortion. Women are not aware, I think, of how invasive the Republican agenda is for their most personal healthcare decisions. The paradox is that the Republican message of 'smaller government' (get the state out of schools, out of healthcare, out of welfare) is reversed in Romney's radical plan for the far right <em>vis a vis </em>women's most intimate reproductive rights decisions. (To see a satirical take on the GOP agenda, one can watch the hilarious yet also tragic <a href=\"http://www.funnyordie.com/videos/87be7156f5/republicans-get-in-my-vagina\">Funny or Die video</a>, \"Republicans, Get in my Vagina\".) </p> <p>As for Romney's first executive order, should he win the presidency, must be to close Guant\u00e1namo. His next policies should involve the repeal of the Patriot Act, the closing of the Department of Homeland Security and the demise of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Defense_Authorization_Act\">National Defense Authorization Act</a>. Any equality women have achieved has come about through human rights activism and democracy protections. Paying attention to any other issue before freedom is restored in America is like legislating on the Titanic. </p> <p><em>Naomi Wolf is a regular columnist on Comment is free and author of Vagina: a New Biography</em></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/jill-filipovic\">Jill Filipovic</a>: 'Romney needs to talk to women like we're people with rational political interests'</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398169537\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2009/1/30/1233350245282/jill_filipovic_140x140.jpg\" alt=\"Jill Filipovic\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>To appeal to women voters, Romney needs to talk to women like we're people with rational political interests, and knock off the condescension. So far, his understanding of women seems to center on his wife \u2013 instead of talking to us himself, he uses Ann as a sort of ambassador to a culture he clearly doesn't understand and doesn't particularly respect.</p> <p>He could speak to us directly about the economy and recognize that the recovery has disproportionately benefited men (even adjusting for the fact that job losses disproportionately impacted men). He could realize that we exist in our bodies, and the physical needs of 50% of the population aren't \"special\" or negligible. He could appreciate that we're a population as diverse as men, and that our interests extend beyond our roles as mothers and care-takers. And he could prove that he has, at any point, considered women to be equal players in society.</p> <p>Even his story (or \"<a href=\"http://blog.thephoenix.com/BLOGS/talkingpolitics/archive/2012/10/16/mind-the-binder.aspx#.UH6ge5hq8ng.facebook\">lie</a>\", as it's also known) at the last debate about soliciting \"binders full of women\" to fill cabinet positions is telling: A man who was a consultant and a businessman for decades didn't know <em>any</em> qualified women? That speaks volumes about his views on half the population, and those views are reflected in his strongly sexist policy positions.</p> <p>Other than the things he definitely <em>shouldn't</em> do that he's already pledged to do on his first day \u2013 overturning Obamacare and reinstituting the deadly <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2012/06/20/why_kenyan_women_fear_romney/\">Global Gag Rule</a> \u2013 I would love to see any president propose a Bill of Women's Rights, ensuring the basic things women require for equal participation in society: universal health care coverage (including contraception, abortion, pre-natal and well-baby care); equal pay; federally-mandated parental leave; subsidized high-quality childcare with well-paid workers and comprehensive assistance to low-income families. But that's about as likely as Romney legalizing the kind of drugs one would need to believe a \"pro-family, pro-life\" Republican president would support legislation that actually helps women, men, children and families live better lives. </p> <p><em>Jill Filipovic is a freelance writer and blogger at Feministe, and a practicing lawyer in New York City</em></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/tamara-winfrey-harris\">Tamara Winfrey Harris</a>: 'Romney has learned little from leafing through binders of women'</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398169538\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Global/content/icons/2012/1/17/1326838687226/tamarawinfreyharris_140x140.jpg\" alt=\"Tamara Winfrey Harris\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>For female voters like me, a candidate's image comes as a result of actions. That is why there is very little Mitt Romney can do before election day to convince me that his presidency would be good for women. His actions tell me just the opposite. For instance, the candidate has pledged to defund Planned Parenthood; voiced support for the <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/birth-control-exemption-bill-the-blunt-amendment-killed-in-senate/2012/03/01/gIQA4tXjkR_story.html\">Blunt Amendment</a>, a bill introduced to restrict access to birth control and said that he supports overturning Roe v Wade. For anyone concerned about reproductive healthcare, Romney's stance should chill the blood.</p> <p>But healthcare isn't the only area where Romney fails to demonstrate the love for the ladies his wife <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2012/08/29/ann_romney_love_mitt_please/\">crowed</a> about during the Republican National Convention. While advisers say that, as president, Romney would not repeal the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, he did <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/10/17/mitt-romney-lilly-ledbetter_n_1973446.html\">oppose</a> the measure when President Obama signed it in 2009, giving women better opportunity to sue over pay inequities. His running mate, Congressman Paul Ryan \u2013 the man Ledbetter herself says \"<a href=\"http://www.rawstory.com/rs/2012/08/16/lilly-ledbetter-paul-ryan-scares-me-to-death/\">scares me to death</a>\" \u2013 opposed the Act.</p> <p>If his positions on women's bodies and our ability to work for fair pay are any indication, Romney has learned little from leafing through \"binders of women\".</p> <p>But perhaps the candidate's rhetoric does not reveal his true intentions. Maybe he's simply rallying his conservative base and a real Romney presidency wouldn't be so radical. The first 100 days of a Romney administration could be very enlightening. A clue as to his authentic objectives may come from what a President Romney doesn't do in its early days. As a candidate, Romney has pledged to repeal the Affordable Care Act \"<a href=\"http://thinkprogress.org/health/2011/11/23/375846/romney-pledges-to-repeal-obamacare-on-day-one/?mobile=nc\">on day one</a>\", cutting off millions of women and families from preventative care and ending no-cost birth control benefits. Ignoring the hyperbole in the pronouncement (rolling back the Act wouldn't be that easy), keeping the Affordable Care Act intact and not working toward its demise would be a first step in convincing me that Mitt gives a whit about women.</p> <p><em>Tamara Winfrey Harris is a blogger on What Tami Said, and editor of New Demographic's Anti-Racist Parent</em></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/deedee-garc-a-blas\">DeeDee Garcia Blase</a>: '[Romney] will have to pick a side and stick with it to the end'</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398169539\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/red/blue_pics/2011/10/26/deedeegarciablase_140x140.jpg\" alt=\"DeeDee Garcia Blase\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>It will be very hard for Mitt Romney to improve his image with women voters because he has reversed his stance on the pro-choice/pro-life issue too many times. His reversals make him appear like a populist politician driven by polls. Remember, Romney gave an oath to protect a woman's right to choose until he decided to run under the Republican presidential ticket. How can a pro-choice woman trust Romney after he went back on his word? On the other hand, how can a pro-life woman trust him when his campaign recently stated that abortion \"<a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/10/16/mitt-romney-abortion-ad_n_1972251.html\">should be an option</a>\" in certain cases?<br> In order for Romney to garner the trust of women voters, he will have to pick a side and stick with it to the end, else mistrust will continue to pile up. Right now, women do not know what his real conviction on the issue, and we become much more considerate of politicians who stick to their convictions. As it stands, we still do not know where his heart is really at. A woman has never served on the Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS); therefore, any president promoting women to the JCS within his first 100 days would give many of us a sigh of relief and encouragement. So many women in the US are related to sons, daughters or relatives currently serving our armed forces, and we are feeling apprehensive and pressure with regard to the multiple wars we have been engaged in. It would be helpful knowing that more women are part of the \"advisory committee\", which helps plan joint operations and resolutions of military problems because, as it stands, there appears to be too much testosterone fueling those key decisions. It would be helpful for us to see balance at a strategic leadership level.</p> <p><em>DeeDee Garcia Blase is founder of Somos Republicans, and the president of the National Tequila Party Movement, which promotes Hispanic Get Out the Vote initiatives</em></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/heidi-moore\">Heidi Moore</a>: 'it may be useful for Governor Romney to get the basics out of the way'</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398169540\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Global/content/icons/2012/5/18/1337374473765/heidimoore_140x140.jpg\" alt=\"Heidi Moore\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>If the current polls are to be believed, Mitt Romney is in line to draw the votes of roughly half the country. The question is: which half? What does Mitt Romney's half look like, and how do they picture the economic future under a Romney presidency? </p> <p>Governor Romney was correct in his \"binders full of women\" speech that America will not be on the road to economic recovery until women are sharing space in hiring decisions alongside equally qualified men. Unfortunately, the conversation around women in the workplace still seems to center around the most pragmatic basics being treated as romantic political dreams. For instance, it's difficult to picture a woman who will rush to the polls, full of passionate vigor, in support of the idea that it' going to be possible for her to one day have a good day at work <em>and</em> get home in time to pitch in for dinner or tuck in her kids. So it may be useful for Governor Romney to get the basics out of the way: we know that corporations respond to tax breaks. Would they also respond to tax incentives for businesses that show they pay their women as equally as they do men? </p> <p>You have to start rebuilding the economy somewhere.

Romney has surged to an average 4-point lead in key swing states due in large part to women supporting him, thus sending the Obama campaign in hyperbole overdrive. The ensuing panic by the left has resulted in the ridiculous, patronizing \"War on Women\" meme, followed by the insulting, \"vote like your lady parts depend on it\" that served only to turn women off Obama and move towards Romney.</p> <p>So excuse me if I find the question posed as a bit biased since it is President Obama who needs to change his tune with women.

He is leading in the popular vote <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/latest_polls/\">52% to 45%</a>, and for the first time in this campaign, now leads in the electoral college.</p> <p>While women in the Obama White House <a href=\"http://mediamatters.org/blog/2012/10/17/fox-accuses-obama-of-pay-discrimination-to-defe/190722\">make less</a> than the men, as governor of Massachusetts, of Mitt Romney's 20 cabinet positions, <a href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2012/10/17/women-including-ex-cabinet-members-rally-around-romney-binder-project/\">ten were held by women</a>. In fact, his record from the 1990's is better than the top current Democratic governors and the upper echelons of Massachusetts government, and more representative of the female population than any state in the natio, according to a 2004 <a href=\"http://www.albany.edu/womeningov/\">State University of New York, Albany study</a>. It is my prediction, too, that Obama letting two high-ranking women in his administration, Hillary Clinton and Susan Rice, take the fall for his incompetency regarding the Benghazi attack that led to the murders of Ambassador Stevens and three other Americans \u2013 and his subsequent cover-up \u2013 will heat up as an issue for women in these weeks before election day.</p> <p>That Obama and his cheerleaders in the media are overplaying their hand on the awkward \"binders\" phrasing as if it is a gaffe, is telling: Romney is trending upwards, and the Obama campaign has even had to abandon large chunks of their firewall strategy as Mitt Romney pulls close, even or ahead in states they thought were reliably Obama's. Once women <em>and</em> men got to see Mitt Romney in the debates without the biased media filter, they saw a man quite different than the one Obama and the left described. And they like him. Binders and binders full of women like and trust him. Obama is finding out the hard way that women vote with their brain and their wallets, and that's very bad news for him.</p> <p>A President Romney should repeat his stellar record of hiring women from his time as governor. And unlike President Obama, he can pay women what he pays the men, leading by example, whereas Barack Obama talks the talk, but won't walk the walk. Romney is also onto something big by pointedly addressing the growing number of women in poverty under Obama. His personal history of helping people combined with his business success and saving the Olympics can be put to good use by tackling this problem, rather than just putting more women on welfare and food stamps as has been the case in the Obama presidency. A President Romney should take the problem seriously. He would be a hero.</p> <p><em>Cher Jacobus is a Republican political strategist, pundit and writer</em></p>",
  "<p>Barack Obama is scheduled to fly to the Camp David presidential retreat near Washington later for three days of seclusion to prepare for the third and final debate with Mitt Romney on Monday as polls suggest the race remains too close to call.</p> <p>Obama and Romney swapped jokes at a charity event in New York on Thursday night but there will be few jokes on Monday at the debate in Boca Raton, Florida, an encounter devoted to foreign affairs.</p> <p>The president had enjoyed high approval ratings in foreign affairs until recently, mainly as a result of the killing on his watch of Osama bin Laden. But the Republicans see the president as vulnerable over the assault on the US consulate in Benghazi that left the US ambassador and three other Americans dead.</p> <p>Obama's 2008 Republican presidential opponent John McCain took the president to task Friday, over his choice of words during an interview on Jon Stewart's Daily Show on Thursday night in which he oddly referred to the deaths as \"not optimal\". </p> <p>\"The optimal line, of course, is very regrettable and makes me a little sad,\" McCain told Fox.</p> <p>Obama used the description in response to a question from Stewart, who was the first to use the word \"optimal\".</p> <p>Stewart said: \"I would say, and even you would admit, it was not the optimal response.\"</p> <p>Obama replied: \"Here is what I will say: when four Americans get killed, it's not optimal.\"</p> <p>Romney fumbled a question about Libya in their second debate on Tuesday in New York, but will get a chance on Monday to redeem himself. The Republicans are questioning why the Obama administration has offered conflicting accounts of what happened at the consulate, by first blaming it on a demonstration by people allegedly upset over a US-made anti-Muslim film and later on al-Qaida affiliates.</p> <p>McCain said it had been obvious to him soon afterwards that it was more than just a demonstration. \"You really don't have to be a CIA analyst or a station chief to know an attack with mortars and rocket-propelled grenades, and which lasted for eight hours, is not a spontaneous demonstration,\" he said, adding that the responses of the administration amounted either to a cover-up or gross incompetence.</p> <p>Another layer of intrigue was added to the story Friday when the Associated Press reported that the CIA station chief in Libya told Washington within 24 hours of the attack that there was evidence it was carried out by militants. However, it was unclear who, if anyone, saw the cable outside the CIA at that point and how high up in the agency the information went.</p> <p>Both Obama and Romney spent Friday campaigning before heading for their respective debate preparation camps, with Romney basing himself in Boca Raton.</p> <p>Obama went to George Mason University in Fairfax, Virginia, the second time in a fortnight he has spoken on campus in the crucial swing state, where students and the youth vote as the key to his winning. He ridiculed Romney for what he claimed were repeated policy switches, saying the Republican candidate had forgotten his previous positions \u2013 a condition he labelled 'Romnesia'.</p> <p>As well as Libya, Obama and Romney are set to argue over Iran, Syria and the Israeli-Palestinian issue. Obama administration officials have hinted that Obama, in his second term, with no election to be fought, would be braver in tackling the Israeli-Palestinian issue, which, like Tony Blair, he views as a source of friction in the Middle East and elsewhere in the Muslim world.</p> <p>On Iran and Syria, Romney and Obama are not particularly far apart in terms of policy, despite Romney sounding more bellicose than Obama on both issues.</p> <p>New polls taken after Tuesday's debate, which both conservatives and Democrats gave to Obama on points, showed Obama ahead in Iowa, which has long been a swing state, and Wisconsin, which had been listed as an Obama hold but had recently been moved to a toss-up.</p> <p>An NBC News/Wall Street Journal/Marist poll put Obama on 51% and Romney on 45% in Wisconsin and 51% to 43% in Iowa.</p> <p>Most polls suggest the two are in a dead heat nationally. Gallup, in contrast with most of the rest, has Romney with a big lead nationally, on 52% to 45%. But Public Policy Polling has Obama on 48% to Romney's 47% and Rasmussen has the two tied at 48%.</p>",
  "<p>To Barack Obama and Mitt Romney, Briana Mihok is gold dust. She ticks the three boxes that qualify her to be exactly the type of voter the presidential candidates are focusing all their attention on as the White House race enters its final three weeks. She is undecided, she lives in an unexpectedly competitive state and \u2013 by far the most important of all \u2013 Mihok is a woman.</p> <p>Presidential elections always come down to a narrow territorial battle for advantage in a handful of swing states. But after almost a year of constant campaigning and millions of dollars of television advertising, it became clear this week that both candidates believe that the defining battle of 2012 is now for female voters. </p> <p>At the second presidential debate on Tuesday night on Long Island, Obama and Romney clashed repeatedly on women's issues, ranging from workplace equality to access to contraception. Romney said women had suffered worse under Obama's economic policies, while the president in turn tied issues like equal pay and healthcare to economic recovery, describing women as important breadwinners in their family. </p> <p>A look at the polls over the last two weeks explains why. Since the first debate, Romney, whose campaign had been faltering, has surged back into contention, <a href=\"www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/08/romney-gains-lead-obama-poll\">overtaking Obama in some national polls</a>. Behind those headline figures is the first sign of a big shift among women, with Obama's massive advantage cut back to a few points. </p> <p>But for some of the women whose votes the campaigns so openly covet, the sudden intensity of these arguments has done little to clarify matters. </p> <p>Mihok, a mother of one and registered Republican, said she was struck by Romney's ignorance of issues that concern women during Tuesday's debate. </p> <p>She cited the answer he gave to a question about workplace equality in which he said he understood the need to be \"flexible\" in order to have women in the workforce. Giving the example of his chief of staff, who had two children of school age, Romney told the audience at Hofstra university: \"She said: 'I can't be here until 7 or 8 o'clock at night: I need to be able to get home at 5 o'clock so I can be there for making dinner for my kids and being with them when they get home from school.' So we said: 'Fine. Let's have a flexible schedule so you can have hours that work for you.'\"</p> <p>Romney's comments were \"weird\", said Mihok, a 32-year-old policy analyst for a non-profit research company at the University of Pittsburgh. She has been leaning towards Obama in recent weeks.</p> <p>\"My husband and I both work, and flexible work hours are just as important to my husband as they are to me,\" she said. \"Unfortunately governor Romney showed a real ignorance when it comes to women's issues.\"</p> <p>Mihok, who did not watch Tuesday's debate but discussed it with friends and read about it afterwards, said Obama put forward a better case for women. \"President Obama, with his background and his upbringing, has the opportunity to see first hand what is important to women and their families. Look at the statement about his grandmother training men for positions for which men got higher pay and better promoted, yet she never had that opportunity. That legacy is still around, and it's important to recognise that.\"</p> <p>But while that's good news for Obama, Mihok said women's issues would not be at the front of her mind when she came to cast her ballot on 6 November.</p> <p>She is not alone. Mihok is one of a number of undecided female voters from Pennsylvania whom the Guardian is talking to over the course of the election <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/11/pennsylvania-women-romney-obama\">to find out what is important to them</a>. None of them cited equal pay or social issues as top of the list of things important to their vote, although three out of five cited affordable healthcare as ranking top alongside the economy. </p> <p>\"Who can say what women need or want?\" said Judy Beck, 52, a grandmother and divorced mother of three from O'Hara township in Allegheny County. \"We are really just people.\"</p> <p>The issues most important to Beck's vote are the economy, foreign policy and the partisan makeup of Congress, but she said she did not hear anything on any of these issues that would make her change her mind, she said.</p> <p>Shireen Parsons, 68, a grandmother and community organiser from Summit Hill, Carbon County, was also unconvinced by the efforts to appeal to women. \"I'm old and cranky and sceptical,\" said Parsons, an independent. \"Women voters are smarter than most politicians think. When Romney talked about women, just how many women did he have in his cabinet? I've no idea but I would like to know.\"</p> <h2>'What decade does Mitt Romney think he's living in?'</h2> <p>Pennsylvania is typically Democratic but the race for its 20 electoral college votes has tightened considerably since the first debate. </p> <p>It has a particularly marked gender divide among voters, as well as a higher pay disparity among men and women. Women earn almost 81\u00a2 to a male worker's dollar, compared to the national average of 82\u00a2.</p> <p>Of the five women, three are Republican, one is a Democrat and one an independent. In the last two weeks, one of the Republicans has decided to vote for Obama, with another two leaning that way. But this week, the Democrat said she is leaning heavily towards Romney.</p> <p>Beck, who is \"principally a Republican\" because of her belief in less government, has made up her mind to vote for Obama over the course of the campaign.</p> <p>She said that the most recent arguments over women from the candidates has \"solidified my leaning towards the Obama campaign\".</p> <p>\"Obama didn't get as specific as Mitt Romney. Romney was too specific and it was apparent he doesn't have a clue. Obama mentioned his mother was a single mother, and he understands there are single mothers who need to make a living and that both men and women need to work.\"</p> <p>Obama answered the equal pay question during Tuesday's debate by referring to his upbringing by a single mother and grandmother who trained men for jobs that paid them more and ranked them higher. He cited the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, which makes it easier for women to sue over pay discrimination, as one of his first official acts in office. And he cited childcare tax credits as a factor in whether women can become the breadwinners.</p> <p>\"These are not just women's issues,\" the president said. \"These are family issues. These are economic issues. And one of the things that makes us grow as an economy is when everybody participates and women are getting the same fair deal as men are.\"</p> <p>These comments chimed with the Pennsylvania women. Romney's answer to the same question was to insist that his record when governor or Massachusetts was one of equality. His description of his efforts to hire women into his cabinet <a href=\"http://blog.thephoenix.com/BLOGS/talkingpolitics/archive/2012/10/16/mind-the-binder.aspx\">were pilloried as wrong-footed and false</a>, and he has been widely ridiculed for his \"binders full of women\" remark about female appointments to his cabinet.</p> <p>Beck said that Romney reminds her of an old boss who refused her a raise because he told her \"the married men need it first\".</p> <p>\"That was back in 1987,\" she said. \"It was wrong then, and it is so much more wrong now. Any suggestion that a woman should be paid any differently is ridiculous. What decade does Mitt Romney think he's living in?</p> <p>\"Romney does not like anyone to disagree with him, You need to be the president but you also need to listen to advice. It seems to me he assumes he has all the answers.\"</p> <p>Like Beck, Parsons said she found herself being more sceptical of Romney than Obama. </p> <p>\"Romney believes that life begins at conception, but he said he wouldn't legislate against a woman's right to abortion. I don't believe that,\" she said.</p> <p>\"Because of Obama's upbringing and who he is and also because of his wife, he tends to do better among women. I'm inclined to trust some things that Obama says than anything Mitt Romney says. I'm not sure why.</p> <p>\"On the other hand I see what Obama has failed to do for women at the bottom layer. He is as much owned by corporate interests as other politicians. They work for corporate interests and leave poor people women and children at the bottom of the heap.\"</p> <p>Joanne Quinn-Smith, 63, a talkshow host, publisher of an online news network and CEO of a marketing company, praised Obama for talking about women as breadwinners. \"If I work as hard as a man I want to get paid like a man,\" she said. </p> <p>She also pointed out the gender pay disparity in Pennsylvania, but said the economy was her number one concern. </p> <p>\"I want someone who can bring us out of this (recession),\" she said. \"Someone who wants to drive business or someone who wants to drive spending that is supported by taxes? I think I just told you where I am leaning. Someone needs to say: 'We've spent enough money, let's re-organise, let's tighten our belts.' Who is better to do that than someone from a business environment?\"</p> <p>Quinn-Smith said that she thought that Romney would be successful in gaining votes among women in higher income brackets.</p> <p>But, despite leaning towards the Republican, she is still not sure. \"In the last Guardian piece someone said, it is about who you hate less.\"</p> <p>She compared the election to a college student \"going home for the weekend and talking to your parents for advice, and you need them to say something wonderful about what's going on and you don't feel any better because you haven't gotten it.\"</p>",

While the urge to protect constituents\u2019 interest is strong and understandable, it should be resisted where there is a clear clinical case for change.

Many patients will be surprised this isn't happening already.</p> <p>We must avoid the trap of thinking that this announcement means the job is done. The implementation of revalidation will be a challenge and requires active commitment. Making sure the process works in practice is what will be key to its success.<br>It would be great to see some of the country's most senior doctors now putting themselves forward to be first in line for revalidation.</p> </blockquote> <p>Mike Farrar, chief executive of the NHS Confederation, of which NHS Employers is a part, added:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Revalidation will be a powerful tool to help NHS boards keep a close eye on the quality of service doctors provide to their local populations.<br>&#xa0;<br>These new checks will be an opportunity to address the bigger picture of clinical governance. The challenge now for boards is to become engaged with revalidation to ensure it helps deliver a continual improvement in services, medical practice and patient care.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-50811865c0e343ef1abc7c9e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-19T09:07:50.016Z\">10.07am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><em>Jessica Fuhl writes</em></p> <p>Elsewhere today Monitor has urged <a href=\"http://www.monitor-nhsft.gov.uk/home/news-events-and-publications/latest-press-releases/monitor-urges-the-nhs-foundation-trust-secto?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+monitor%2Fpress-releases+%28Press+Releases%29\">the NHS foundation trust sector to deliver hospital cost savings earlier</a>.

  "<p>At some point this year, somewhere in the US, a teenage girl will decide she wants to have sex. She might not know when, or who with, but she has made that choice. Unfortunately for her, this is a turbulent and uncertain year to be making sexual and reproductive health choices in the US.</p> <p>If a student, she might have been relieved when Barack Obama's <a href=\"http://www.healthcare.gov/law/index.html\" title=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\">Affordable Care Act</a> passed in June, knowing she can access student health plans that provide free contraception. She may already be benefiting from the <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/teenpregnancy/PreventTeenPreg.htm\" title=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\">Teenage Pregnancy Prevention Initiative</a> launched by Obama in 2010, which funds school sex education programmes that show evidence of success, those predominantly promoting contraception over abstinence.</p> <p>But this is an election year and early in 2012 voters got an idea of what to expect from the Republicans' presidential candidate, Mitt Romney, when he challenged contraceptive coverage included in the health reforms. Along with many Republicans, Romney supported an amendment that would exempt employers with moral objections from including contraception in employees' health plans. Though the amendment failed, Romney promised to not only \"undo\" the contraceptive mandate but to repeal the entire act on his first day in office.</p> <p>\"They could starve it financially, cripple it even if they can't repeal entirely,\" explains Adam Sonfield, of the <a href=\"http://www.guttmacher.org/\" title=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\">Guttmacher Institute</a>, which specialises in sexual and reproductive health and rights. \"There are lots of opportunities to do damage.\"</p> <p>Whatever the route, his point is clear: as president, Romney will do all he can to ensure federal money isn't spent providing contraceptives.</p> <p>Voters could be forgiven for thinking Romney is less clear on abortion. When running for Senate in 1994 he said he believed \"abortions should be safe and legal in this country\". Now he wants <a href=\"http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/historics/USSC_CR_0410_0113_ZS.html\" title=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\">Roe v Wade</a>, the court decision that legalised abortion nationally, overturned and would make further substantial cuts to reproductive health services, despite a federal ban on funding abortion.</p> <p>\"Republican and independent-leaning women may believe Romney is the man he said he was in 1994, but he's not,\" says Emilie Ailts, director of campaign group <a href=\"http://www.prochoicecolorado.org/\" title=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\">NARAL Pro-Choice Colorado</a>. \"If he gets to the White House he will defund Planned Parenthood.\"</p> <p>Whereas pro-choice Obama refused to bow down to Republican <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/government-shutdown-sticking-point-planned-parenthood/story?id=13328560\" title=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\">threats in 2011 to shut down government</a> unless funding was cut to <a href=\"http://www.plannedparenthood.org/\" title=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\">Planned Parenthood</a>, Romney promises the opposite. Underscoring this is Romney's VP running mate, Paul Ryan. A fiscal conservative driven by pro-life ideology, Ryan co-sponsored a <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/08/11/paul-ryan-personhood_n_1767760.html\" title=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\">federal measure to ban abortion in all cases</a> and is consistent with his position.</p> <p>\"Ryan practices what Romney preaches: Romney has pledged to 'get rid of Planned Parenthood'; Ryan voted repeatedly to defund Planned Parenthood. Romney said he would end the Title X program that funds birth control and cancer screenings; Ryan voted to eliminate Title X,\" says Ailts.</p> <p>The Guttmacher Institute estimates the <a href=\"http://www.hhs.gov/opa/title-x-family-planning/\" title=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\">Title X family planning programme</a> is used by 25% of poor women wanting to obtain contraceptives and is vital to reduce unintended pregnancies. Obama wants more funding for this programme but Romney wants it axed and would also cut the widely used Medicaid programme through which low income women receive reproductive healthcare.</p> <p>Programmes promoting safe sex among young people could also be at risk under Romney, who supports sex education based on abstinence until marriage and funded such programmes when governor of Massachusetts. According to Douglas Kirby, senior research scientist at health and education research non-profit <a href=\"http://www.etr.org/home\" title=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\">ETR Associates</a>, Obama's pregnancy initiative is likely to reduce unprotected sex. The opposite could happen if the focus returns to abstinence.</p> <p>\"Because abstinence programs are generally less effective at reducing sexual risk, if they are promoted instead of comprehensive programs, more young people will probably engage in unprotected sex and teen pregnancy and STI rates will be a little higher than they otherwise would be,\" says Kirby.</p> <p>On some youth reproductive health policies, the candidates stand closer together. Last year, going against scientific advice, Obama restricted giving emergency contraception over-the-counter to under 17-year-olds unless they had a doctor's prescription. As a father of two daughters the decision to him was \"common sense\". Romney vetoed emergency contraceptive legislation in Massachusetts because it \"disregarded the importance of parental involvement\". Neither helps young girls wanting to discreetly access the morning-after pill.</p> <p>Overwhelmingly though, Romney would cause bigger problems for reproductive rights in the US and internationally. He promises to reinstate the \"<a href=\"http://www.genderhealth.org/the_issues/us_foreign_policy/global_gag_rule/\" title=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\">Global Gag rule</a>\", a policy that prohibits international organisations receiving US funds from providing any abortion-related care. The rule, rescinded by Obama on his second day, has been an early act of every new party president since introduced in 1984 and has big repercussions.</p> <p>Improving access to reproductive services is key to <a href=\"http://www.un.org/millenniumgoals/maternal.shtml\" title=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\">millennium development goal 5</a> \u2013 the target to improve maternal health. With this target lagging, there is a pressing urgency to ensure it is at the top of the agenda as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2012/aug/01/panel-lead-global-development-agenda-named\" title=\"\">discussions begin on future development goals</a>.</p> <p>As a member of the UN, the US will contribute to negotiations about the post-2015 development agenda, which will steer a course for future sustainable development. But in contrast to Obama, a Romney administration is unlikely to recognise that a lack of access to sexual and reproductive health services only worsens cycles of poverty \u2013 at home and abroad.</p>"

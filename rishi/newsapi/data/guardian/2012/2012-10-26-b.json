First off the blocks is The Orphan Of Zhao, the first Chinese play to be translated in the west and which is presented here in a version by James Fenton. With origins dating back to the fourth century, the piece (sometimes known as The Chinese Hamlet) tells of a young man who, in the wake of a violent coup, discovers the truth of his background and sets out to take his revenge.</p> <p><strong><em>The Swan, Royal Shakespeare Theatre, Tue to 26 Mar</em></strong></p> <p><em>LG</em></p> <h2>Nosferatu, London</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398407884\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/25/1351169259918/Noeferatu-008.jpg\" alt=\"Noeferatu\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Photograph: Marta Orlik-Gaillard</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Marta Orlik-Gaillard</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Halloween shivers are guaranteed at the Barbican, with one of the highlights of its 2012 programme the third visit of Poland's TR Warszawa company, this time with a production of Nosferatu, inspired by Bram Stoker's Dracula.

Golding had a close connection with Salisbury. He lived in the city and taught at Bishop Wordsworth's grammar school in the Cathedral Close. It also provided him with the inspiration for The Spire which tells the story of Dean Jocelin and the men who envisaged building a 400-foot spire on Salisbury Cathedral, in spite of the fact that no one had ever built that high, the cathedral had no foundations, and there was no money. Gareth Machin directs a local story on an epic scale, adapted here by Roger Spottiswoode.</p> <p><strong><em>Salisbury Playhouse, Thu to 24 Nov</em></strong></p> <p><em>LG</em></p> <h2>Orpheus Descending, Manchester</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398407886\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/25/1351169563744/Orpheus-Descending-008.jpg\" alt=\"Orpheus Descending\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Imogen Stubbs.

But with the current US president being a black man espousing liberal values, it would seem that a great deal has changed since Williams's depiction of small-town life in America's deep south in the 1940s. Or has it? Frankcom's production aims to hold up a mirror to the contemporary world and maybe even to the hate crimes of modern America. She tells the story of a young drifter who arrives in a small town with nothing but a guitar and who manages to form a relationship with Lady Torrance, an unhappy woman trapped in a loveless marriage.

  "<p>Barack Obama received a pre-election boost on Friday when the latest economic figures showed a higher-than-expected rise in growth as both the Democratic and Republican teams stepped up efforts to break the deadlock before November 6.</p> <p>The growth was fuelled by rising consumer confidence, the fledgling recovery in the housing market and an uptick in government spending.</p> <p>The worry for Democrats is that the favourable figures may be arriving too late to have a big impact on the election.</p> <p>Obama and Republican presidential challenger Mitt Romney are stuck on 47% each in the polls, according to the average of polls on Real Clear Politics, and looking for an issue that will tip the balance in their favour in the final days of the campaign.</p> <p>There are big variations between individual polls, with the latest Gallup daily tracking poll putting Romney back up five points, on 51% to Obama's 46%.</p> <p>A CNN poll in Ohio, which has emerged as the pivotal state of the election, attracting more visits by the candidates than any other, shows Obama is on 50% to Romney's 46%. Republican senator Rob Portman, who is co-chair of Romney's campaign, admitted on NBC that it would be hard for Romney to win the White House without Ohio.</p> <p>Romney delivered a speech in Ames, Iowa, another swing state, what his aides had billed as a major address on the economic but in fact contained nothing new in terms of policy. He had one fresh rhetorical line, rehearsed by the Romney campaign in an ad earlier in the week, in which he accused Obama of focusing on trivial issues because he had no record worth fighting the election on.</p> <p>\"This is an election of consequence. Our campaign is about big things, because we happen to believe that America faces big challenges. We recognise this is a year with a big choice, and the American people want to see big changes. And together we can bring real change to this country,\" Romney said.</p> <p>\"Four years ago, candidate Obama spoke to the scale of the times. Today, he shrinks from it, trying instead to distract our attention from the biggest issues to the smallest, from characters on Sesame Street and silly word games to misdirected personal attacks he knows are false.\"</p> <p>He then returned to what is basically his stump speech.</p> <p>Although the election has been largely dominated by the economy, it has broadened to encompass social issues, mainly abortion and rape, and, more recently, racial tensions.</p> <p>On abortion and rape, the Obama campaign put out a new web page with a clock marking how long Romney has maintained his endorsement of Indiana senate candidate Richard Mourdock who on Tuesday said that that pregnancies from rape are \"something that God intended\". It follows a claim by another Republican senate candidate, Todd Akin, in Missouri, who used the phrase \"legitimate rape\".</p> <p>On race, the former governor of New Hampshire, John Sununu \u2013&#xa0;a leading Romney surrogates \u2013 was forced to go into reverse after suggesting that Colin Powell, a secretary of state in the George W Bush administration, had endorsed Obama simply because he is black.</p> <p>Democrats claimed this was not an off-the-cuff remark but part of a deliberate strategy on the part of the Romney campaign to make race an issue. A Washington Post poll this week showed fewer whites supporting Obama in this election than in 2008.</p> <p>Obama's 2008 opponent John McCain beat him among white voters by 12 points. According to the Washington Post poll, Obama is trailing Romney among whites by 23 points.</p> <p>On Friday, Sununu backtracked over his remark about Powell's endorsement. \"Colin Powell is a friend and I respect the endorsement decision he made and I do not doubt that it was based on anything but his support of the president's policies,\" Sununu, a former White House chief of staff, said.</p> <p>On Thursday night, speaking on CNN, Sununu had said: \"Frankly, when you take a look at Colin Powell, you have to wonder if that's an endorsement based on issues, or whether he's got a slightly different reason for preferring president Obama?\" Asked what reason that might be, Sununu said: \"Well, I think when you have somebody of your own race that you're proud of being president of the United States, I applaud Colin for standing with him.\"</p> <p>Tad Devine, a senior adviser to the Gore campaign in 2000 and Kerry in 2004, saw this as part of a Republican strategy aimed at making race part of the campaign. \"I believe there is a systematic effort on the part of the Republican party to introduce a racial component into this election \u2026 I don't think this is accidently shooting off at the mouth.\"</p> <p>Obama, speaking to Democratic campaign workers in his hometown Chicago on Thursday night before flying back to Washington, acknowledged that the race is close and that he might lose, while adding he still expected to win.</p> <p>\"This is going to be a close election, so we just got to work really hard over these next 12 days. If we let up and our voters don't turn out, we could lose this election,\" Obama said:.\"Now the good news is, if our voters do turn out, we will definitely win the election.\"</p> <p>The president spent Friday in the White House doing 10 interviews, mainly with media from the swing states that will decide the outcome on November 6, while Romney continued his campaign tour in Iowa and Ohio.</p> <p>The White House welcomed the news from the department of commerce on economic growth. Although the economy remains sluggish, this was the 13th straight month of growth.</p> <p>Alan Krueger, chairman of the White House council of economic advisers, said that over those 13 months the economy had expanded by 7.2% overall.</p> <p>\"While we have more work to do, together with other economic indicators, this report provides further evidence that the economy is moving in the right direction.,\" he said.</p> <p>The figures on growth, the last from the commerce department before the election, come after unemployment statistics released earlier this month showed a drop below the symbolically important 8%. The next unemployment figures are due just before polling day.</p> <p>Romney described the growth figures as discouraging. \"Slow economic growth means slow job growth and declining take-home pay. This is what four years of president Obama's policies have produced. Americans are ready for change \u2014 for growth, for jobs, for higher take-home pay,\" he said in a statement.</p> <p>In spite of the increase in consumer confidence, businesses are reining themselves in, worried about the so-called 'fiscal cliff\" at the end of the year when Bush-era tax cuts are due to expire and massive spending cuts scheduled to kick in unless there is a political compromise.</p> <p>With 10 days left to the election, the Obama campaign claims to have a slight edge in the swing states and to have stopped the momentum that Romney built up after his debate victory in Denver on December 3. The Romney campaign insisted that the momentum is still with them, bringing into play more states, such as Wisconsin.</p>",
  "<p>Heaven knows the British are poorly placed to moan about others' rigged electoral rules. But for all the follies of our first-past-the-post, by imagining a general election as 650 entirely separate constituency ballots you at least see how it might once have made sense. Not so with US electoral college, which somehow makes it possible for the laggard to emerge as the winner in a single, two-horse \u2013 as the world learned to its cost when George W Bush snatched the White House from Al Gore, despite having amassed <a href=\"http://www.fec.gov/pubrec/fe2000/prespop.htm\" title=\"\">half a million fewer votes</a>. You might just about argue (though <a href=\"http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2012/oct/11/should-we-have-new-constitutional-convention/?pagination=false\" title=\"\">polls find most Americans don't</a>) that carrying states as opposed to mere voters is important in a federal system; the difficulty is that the individual electors who make up the college are perfectly free under the constitution to disregard opinion in their state. This is not a theoretical problem \u2013 in half of <a href=\"http://archive.fairvote.org/e_college/faithless.htm\" title=\"\">postwar presidential polls</a> some \"<a href=\"http://www.law.northwestern.edu/lawreview/v100/n1/121/LR100n1Bennett.pdf\" title=\"\">faithless elector</a>\" has strayed from their democratic mandate. They exploit a liberty conferred by the founding fathers, who fondly imagined it would stave off the emergence of partisan politics. The last ditch defence is that what counts is what works. Even before the younger Bush, however, there were blots on the historical record, with the foiling of <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/about/presidents/andrewjackson\" title=\"\">Andrew Jackson</a>'s <a href=\"http://www.270towin.com/1824_Election/\" title=\"\">first run</a>, and the near-scuppering of <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/about/presidents/thomasjefferson\" title=\"\">Thomas Jefferson</a>'s <a href=\"http://www.270towin.com/1800_Election/\" title=\"\">second</a>. For all this, if the state-by-state stitch-up saves the world from President Romney, the world's liberals will no doubt find it in their hearts to forgive the college its quirks.</p>",
  "<p>Of the two big political transitions ahead of us next month, it is clear which will receive most attention and be the easiest to read. The US presidential election, in spite of some uncertainties about Mr Romney's real position on many issues, is a straightforward and dramatic electoral contest. It will be comprehensively covered everywhere, and its outcome exhaustively analysed. The replacement of China's leadership at the 18th party congress, a couple of days after the American vote, is, by contrast, already foreordained. It looks like Chinese business as usual, and will be an almost entirely opaque process, as unclear in its implications after it is over as it is before it has begun. Yet it is arguably the more important of the two.</p> <p>This is not because China is a bigger power than America, which it is not, and which it may never become. It is because China's accumulated problems are so numerous and its need for reform and renewal so evident that the course its leaders set in the next five years could be more critical for the world than the choices a single American president will make in the four years at his disposal. Ever since it became possible to talk about Chinese politics in something like western terms, outsiders have hoped for reforms that will take the country in the direction of the rule of law and democracy, and reduce its dependence on a combination of nationalism and consumerism as a source of legitimacy. So have many, although it is unclear how many, Chinese. These expectations have usually been disappointed, because both the party and the people in China are frightened of too much change \u2013 the party because it worries that it will lose its grip, and ordinary people because of the memory of the chaos and cruelty of earlier times. However angry they are about official corruption and mismanagement, they fear any lurch into the unknown.</p> <p>Corruption is a key to many aspects of the Chinese situation. As the distinguished British sinologist Roderick MacFarquhar recently argued, high-level Chinese corruption is not just theft. Together with the export of assets abroad, and the despatch of sons and daughters to foreign schools and universities, it suggests that the party brass lacks <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/21/opinion/in-china-fear-at-the-top.html\" title=\"\">confidence in the future</a>. Mao and the other earlier leaders had won the war against the nationalists, created a pervasive and effective party apparatus, and spread an ideology which was widely accepted. All of this is now in the distant past, to the point that, as MacFarquhar writes: \"Globalising one's assets\u2026 makes sense as a hedge against risk.\" The <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/26/business/global/family-of-wen-jiabao-holds-a-hidden-fortune-in-china.html?pagewanted=all\" title=\"\">revelations</a> in the New York Times this week about the wealth amassed by the family of Wen Jiabao, the Chinese premier, will undoubtedly find their way past the state's information filters, and their impact will be the more severe because he has been a relatively popular leader. The<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/26/bo-xilai-expelled-chinese-parliament\" title=\"\"> expulsion </a>of the disgraced Bo Xilai from the party and, yesterday, from parliament, for, among other offences, corruption, is hardly likely to convince a sceptical populace that China's leaders are ready to clean up their act.</p> <p>But that is what a new leadership must do, if it is to transform a society \"unstable at the grass roots, dejected in the middle strata, and out of control at the top\", which is how some Chinese scholars apparently described their country at a recent <a href=\"http://www.economist.com/news/briefing/21565132-china%E2%80%99s-communist-party-preparing-its-ten-yearly-change-leadership-new-team\" title=\"\">conference</a> near Shanghai. Similarly, Deng Yuwen, a senior editor at one of the party's journals, has argued that the achievements of the last decade of growth may be outweighed by its failures, especially the <a href=\"http://www.globalpost.com/dispatches/globalpost-blogs/america-the-gutted/china-middle-class-economic-growth-wealth-disparity\" title=\"\">\"failure to nurture and grow a middle class\".</a> The most serious failure of all, as the Chinese writer <a href=\"http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,2100133,00.html\" title=\"\">Yu Hua</a> has said, is the erosion of political belief and meaning to the point where, as he suggests, the phrase \"the people\" has become \"nothing more than a shell company, utilised by different eras to position different products in the marketplace\". Put that way, there is indeed a long way to go in China.</p>",

Romney and Republican National Committee operatives won\u2019t say it publicly but concede privately that Nevada is out of reach \u2014 largely because of Hispanic voters and Obama\u2019s superior ground operations.

  "<p>Mitt Romney came to the battleground state of Ohio on Thursday and brazenly stole Barack Obama's clothes. He presented himself as the agent of \"big change\" and repeatedly accused the president of being the candidate of the status quo.</p> <p>In the final stop of a single day's three-point dash from the south-west to the north-west of the state, Romney echoed the message that Obama had brought to this electoral ground zero just four years ago. \"Paul Ryan and I represent a big change for America,\" he told a high school football stadium filled in the north-west town of Defiance, his voice growing hoarse.</p> <p>\"We're finally going to tackle the problems politicians have spoken about for years but haven't been willing to deal with,\" he said. With further parallels to the Obama message of 2008, he added that to get the job done in Washington he would \"reach across the aisle\".</p> <p>There was no sign of any waning in the momentum that the Republican nominee has enjoyed since the Denver TV presidential debate. The stadium was packed to overflowing, supporters having queued for two hours in a line that snaked right around the high school \u2013 another striking '08 echo.</p> <p>The official tally for the event was 12,000 people, which was impressive given that the population of Defiance is 16,000. \"This is a big event for a small town,\" said Jason Tackett, 26, attending the rally. \"I've never seen anything like it in all my life here.\"</p> <p>The town takes its name from the way General Anthony Wayne described a fort built here in the war against the Native Americans: \"I defy the English, Indians and all the devils of hell to take it.\"</p> <p>Romney came here with more than a little of that spirit. It took defiance to come to Defiance because not two miles out of the town is a massive General Motors plant, an iron and aluminium foundary that makes engine blocks.</p> <p>The Obama re-election campaign has been <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mgiuq2uR6LA\">pounding the area with TV and radio adverts</a> reminding voters that in the 2008 crash Romney argued that the auto industry should be allowed to go bankrupt. The $87bn in federal loans that the Obama administration extended to GM and Chrysler, located just up the road in Toledo, have provided one of the great fault lines of the election this year, with Obama presenting himself as the savior of the auto industry and Romney on the defensive.</p> <p>Unemployment in Defiance is 6.7%, well below the national average of 7.8%.</p> <p>A small demonstration of Obama supporters at the entrance to Defiance high school included several workers from the GM plant. \"If GM had gone bankrupt this town would have been destroyed. Hospital, schools, lawyers, restaurants, you name it, everything would have gone down,\" said Veronica Estrada, 43.</p> <p>But there were also several GM workers, and other employees of subsidiaries dependant on the GM plant, inside the stadium supporting Romney. John Vogel, 29, who works for a sub-contractor of GM, dismissed Obama's claim to having saved the industry.</p> <p>\"It's the people that do the work that saved GM, not the politicians,\" he said.</p> <p>A contractor who works for all of the large car companies called Jim, 52, (he declined to give his last name) disputed that Romney would have let GM go bankrupt in any case. \"He had a plan to reorganise it, he wanted to see GM go through a managed rebuilding.\"</p> <p>In Jim's opinion, unionised companies like GM were starting to wish they'd done more to restructure themselves. \"A lot of them are beginning to realise they are hanging on but not getting stronger.\"</p> <p>Rob Portman, the Republican senator for Ohio who was a contender for vice-presidential nominee before Romney chose Ryan to be his running mate, addressed the auto bailout head on in his speech to the Defiance crowd. He began by admitting that he had supported the auto bailout, but then went on to accuse Obama of lying about Romney's position.</p> <p>\"There is no question in my mind that Mitt Romney's policies for the future are going to be better for our auto companies, for the workers, for communities like Defiance. Folks, if you are an auto worker here tonight I can tell you this \u2013 we need to elect Mitt Romney as next president of the United States.\"</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2012/president/oh/ohio_romney_vs_obama-1860.html\">latest polls on Ohio</a> vary slightly with two \u2013 CBS News / Quinnipiac and Time showing Obama with a still robust five point lead but all the others recording an effective tie between the presidential rivals. The crucial importance of the state comes down to the fact that unless Romney wins its crop of 18 electoral votes out of the 270 needed to win, he will find it virtually impossible to win the presidency.</p> <p>Victory for Romney without Ohio would require him to sweep other swing states and take either Nevada or Wisconsin.</p> <p>Part of the attraction of Romney for the Defiance crowd was on religious grounds. The town is heavily Catholic, with a strong socially conservative bent.</p> <p>Debra Scheub, 55, said that watching the presidential debates had given new energy to the Republican campaign. \"Everybody got to see the man for themselves. They saw he was a viable candidate, and we learned a lot about his character and how he carries himself as a disciplined man.\"</p>",
  "<p>Last month, Vanity Fair featured <a href=\"http://www.vanityfair.com/politics/2012/10/michael-lewis-profile-barack-obama\">a major profile of President Obama</a> by Michael Lewis, who was given what <a href=\"http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/09/11/a-journalist-with-rare-access-to-obama-had-to-play-by-quote-rule/\">the New York Times called</a> \"rare\" and \"extraordinary access\". Lewis \"conducted multiple interviews with the president\"; \"rode in the official presidential limousine\"; \"was given a special lapel pin that identified him to the Secret Service as someone who was allowed to be in close proximity to the president\"; and \"flew with the president on several foreign and domestic trips\" -- \"not with the rest of the press corps in the back of Air Force One, but near the front.\" And, noted the Times, \"the president even allowed Mr. Lewis to play on his basketball team.\"</p> <p>But in exchange for such access, Lewis, unbeknownst to readers of his profile, had agreed to a journalistically corrupt practice - now <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/us-news-blog/2012/sep/20/new-york-times-bans-quote-approval\">banned by many large media outlets</a> - whereby the only quotes he was permitted to use were ones the White House approved in advance. Unsurprisingly, the profile was pure hagiography that left Obama's most devoted media fans <a href=\"http://andrewsullivan.thedailybeast.com/2012/09/how-to-be-president.html\">gushing with ecstacy</a>.</p> <p>Though I would have thought it impossible, Rolling Stone somehow just managed to top that profile when it comes to sycophantic, power-worshiping \"journalism\". This week, it features <a href=\"http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/obama-and-the-road-ahead-the-rolling-stone-interview-20121025\">a cover story on Obama</a> by its contributing editor, the historian Douglas Brinkley, largely based on a 45-minute interview in the Oval Office. The questions Brinkley posed are so vapid and reverent that it is hard to believe it's not satire.</p> <p>Most of his questions are some iteration of asking Obama: <em>Seriously, how heinous is Mitt Romney? How gross is he? And really, how great are you?</em> Just behold some of the questions which this historian and journalist - given the opportunity for a one-on-one interview with the president of the United States - chose to ask, beginning with the first four of the interview:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"Let's start with how the campaign has been going. Ever since the first debate, Romney has abruptly shifted his position on a whole host of issues, from his tax plan to financial regulation [that's the entirety of his first \"question\"]. </p> <p>\"Many observers have commented on how Romney has misrepresented or even changed his positions in this last leg of the campaign \u2013 that he's been like a chameleon on plaid. Do you feel that he has lied to the American people? </p> <p>\"Where were you when you first saw Romney's speech in Boca Raton about the 47 percent? What was your first reaction? </p> <p>\"What has surprised you the most about the Republican campaign this year? </p> <p>\"You said, 'a.k.a. Obamacare.' Do you mind if historians call the achievement Obamacare?</p> <p>\"You sometimes use the term 'fair shake'. FDR had the New Deal, Lyndon Johnson had the Great Society. Is the Fair Shake something you'd be comfortable with to describe your legacy? </p> <p>\"The auto bailout helped rescue states like Ohio from economic disaster. What, in turn, have you learned from the people of Ohio during your many visits to the state? </p> <p>\"Bill Clinton \u2013 how important is he as a surrogate for you? What's your friendship with him like these days? </p> <p>\"Halloween's coming up. If you could have Mitt Romney dress in a costume, what should he be for Halloween?\" </p> </blockquote> <p>If nothing else, shouldn't a concern for his own dignity lead Brinkley to have at least a pretense of adversarial substance? An interview of Obama by White House Press Secretary Jay Carney would have been more challenging. Had Brinkley had more time, next on his list of questions undoubtedly included: \"Do you believe Romney is more like Hitler or Satan?\", and \"Sir, do you mind that historians will likely see you as a mix of Gandhi and Jesus?\"</p> <p>Ample ink is spilled over debating whether the US media is biased in favor of Republicans or Democrats. It is neither. The overwhelming, driving bias of the US media is subservience to power, whoever happens to be wielding it.</p> <p>That is what explains why the US media has been so obsequious first with George Bush and now with his Democratic successor (for those who doubt that \"the liberal media\" venerated Bush as much as Lewis and Brinkely do Obama, I'll remind you of <a href=\"http://mediamatters.org/research/2006/04/27/mission-accomplished-a-look-back-at-the-medias/135513\">this still-remarkable, borderline pornographic display of giddy fawning</a> on Mission Accomplished Day, or the fact that Bush's own Press Secretary <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2008/05/28/mcclellan_6/\">wrote a book</a> mocking the US media for how \"deferential\" it was to the Bush White House). It's why journalists <a href=\"http://wonkette.com/402599/david-gregory-famous-for-one-thing-dancing\">joyously dance with top officials</a>, <a href=\"http://talkingpointsmemo.com/news/2008/10/tire_swinging_the_alternative.php\">swing on their tires</a>, are <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2010/06/07/washington_3/\">creepily grateful when they're sprayed in the face by their squirt guns</a>, and <a href=\"http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/10/21/a-football-draw-for-romneys-staff-and-the-press/\">play fun beach games with the very campaign officials they're ostensibly covering</a>.</p> <p>The central function, the religion, of the US establishment media is adulation of those who wield power, <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2012/05/03/nbc_news_top_hagiographer/\">especially military power</a> as personified by the <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2008/11/02/biden_12/\">inaptly referred to</a> \"commander-in-chief\". Brinkley conducted the interview in the Oval Office from his knees because - with some significant exceptions - that's the posture which US media culture assumes in the presence of the royal court.</p> <p>What makes this most ironic, and most destructive, is that this function is the exact antithesis of what media figures claim they perform and what pioneers of press freedom protections envisioned. The political media is designed to be adversarial because it is supposed to serve as a scrutinizing check on the claims of those in power, not serve as worshipful, propagandistic amplifiers of those claims. </p> <p>If, as is obviously the case, Brinkley desperately craves Obama's re-election, that's fine. But as a journalist and historian, there are all sorts of dubious assertions and controversial actions on the part of the president that merit questioning and challenge. One would think that minimal intellectual curiosity, or at least base professional self-esteem, would prevent someone like Brinkley from completely squandering this opportunity by taking the time he was given to flatter and serve the president.</p> <p>But one would be wrong. He was given this time and access precisely because the White House knew how and toward what end he would use it. In other words, they knew he was a typical member of the US press corps and his behavior would therefore be reverent in the extreme. One cannot blame the White House for exploiting those eager to spit up hagiography masquerading as journalism. The fault lies with those who deceive the public by holding themselves out as journalists.</p>",
  "<p>The UK government has reiterated that it does not believe military action against Iran would be appropriate at the moment, following the disclosure that Britain has rebuffed US requests to use UK military bases to support the buildup of forces in the Gulf.</p> <p>Downing Street said: \"We are working closely with the US with regard to UK bases\" but \"the government does not think military action is the right course at this point of time\".</p> <p>David Cameron made a lengthy speech last week urging Israel to show restraint, and pointing to the way in which sanctions are having an impact on the Iranian economy.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/25/uk-reject-us-request-bases-iran\" title=\"\">The Guardian has been told</a> that US diplomats have also lobbied for the use of British bases in Cyprus, and for permission to fly from US bases on Ascension Island in the Atlantic and Diego Garcia in the Indian Ocean, both of which are British territories.</p> <p>The US approaches are part of contingency planning over the nuclear standoff with Tehran, but British ministers have so far reacted coolly. On Friday, Downing Street said such contingency planning was something that was done as a matter of routine.</p> <p>They have pointed US officials to legal advice drafted by the attorney general's office and which has been circulated to Downing Street, the Foreign Office and the Ministry of Defence.</p> <p>It states that providing assistance to forces that could be involved in a pre-emptive strike would be a clear breach of international law on the basis that Iran, which has consistently denied it has plans to develop a nuclear weapon, does not currently represent \"a clear and present threat\".</p> <p>\"The UK would be in breach of international law if it facilitated what amounted to a pre-emptive strike on Iran,\" said a senior Whitehall source. \"It is explicit. The government has been using this to push back against the Americans.\"</p> <p>Sources said the US had yet to make a formal request, and that they did not believe an acceleration towards conflict was imminent or more likely. The discussions so far had been to scope out the British position, they said.</p> <p>\"But I think the US has been surprised that ministers have been reluctant to provide assurances about this kind of upfront assistance,\" said one source. \"They'd expect resistance from senior Liberal Democrats, but it's Tories as well. That has come as a bit of a surprise.\"</p> <p>The situation reflects the lack of appetite within Whitehall for the UK to be drawn into any conflict, though the Royal Navy has a large presence in the Gulf in case the ongoing diplomatic efforts fail.</p> <p>The Guardian has been told that a British military delegation with a strong navy contingent flew to US Central Command headquarters in Tampa, Florida, this summer to run through a range of contingency plans with US planners.</p> <p>The UK, however, has assumed that it would only become involved once a conflict had already begun, and has been reluctant to commit overt support to Washington in the buildup to any military action.</p> <p>\"It is quite likely that if the Israelis decided to attack Iran, or the Americans felt they had to do it for the Israelis or in support of them, the UK would not be told beforehand,\" said the source. \"In some respects, the UK government would prefer it that way.\"</p> <p>British and US diplomats insisted that the two countries regarded a diplomatic solution as the priority, but this depends on the White House being able to restrain Israel, which is nervous that Iran's underground uranium enrichment plant will soon make its nuclear programme immune to any outside attempts to stop it.</p> <p>Israel has a less developed strike capability and its window for action against Iran will close much more quickly than that of the US, explained another official. \"The key to holding back Israel is Israeli confidence that the US will deal with Iran when the moment is right.\"</p> <p>With diplomatic efforts stalled by the US presidential election campaign, a new push to resolve the crisis will begin in late November or December.</p> <p>Six global powers will spearhead a drive that is likely to involve an offer to lift some of the sanctions that have crippled Iran's economy in return for Tehran limiting its stockpile of enriched uranium.</p> <p>The countries involved are the US, the UK, France, Germany, Russia and China.

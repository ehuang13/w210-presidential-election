  "<p>'There are two ways you can interest [the average American] in a campaign, and only two that we have ever found successful,\" wrote <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2012/09/24/120924fa_fact_lepore?currentPage=1\" title=\"\">Clem Whitaker</a>, the co-founder of America's first political consulting firm. \"He likes a good hot battle, with no punches pulled ...\", or \"he likes the movies; he likes mysteries; he likes fireworks and parades ... So if you can't fight, PUT ON A SHOW! And if you put on a good show, Mr and Mrs America will turn out to see it\".</p> <p>With just a fortnight to go before polling day, the \"show\" has been terrible. Democrats are running the same acts that they did last time, and hoping that nobody will notice. Concluding the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UANbTju765A\" title=\"\">first TV debate</a>, President Barack Obama's closing argument was: \"Four years ago I said that I'm not a perfect man and I wouldn't be a perfect president ... But I also promised that I'd fight every single day on behalf of the American people and the middle class, and all those who are striving to get in the middle class. I've kept that promise and if you'll vote for me, then I promise I'll fight just as hard in a second term.\" I tried my best. I want another go. It's hardly a pitch bursting with vision.</p> <p>His opponent, Mitt Romney, is worse. He has <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/19/opinion/krugman-snow-job-on-jobs.html?_r=1&amp;adxnnl=1&amp;adxnnlx=1350831834-8/bD5WjKMmB/fFbe5KDbmg\" title=\"\">visions a-plenty</a>. In his crystal ball he sees a land of free-market unicorns galloping under tax-slashing, deficit-reducing rainbows where, if only government would get out of the way, prosperity would fall from the sky. Those are the visions that he will admit to, and insists that he has costed. The ones he won't take ownership of look like a black and white version of Mike Leigh's 2004 film about illegal abortion in 1950s London, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2004/sep/07/venicefilmfestival2004.londonfilmfestival2004\" title=\"\">Vera Drake</a>, in a land full of ungrateful moochers.</p> <p>It's not a difficult or inspiring choice, particularly for progressives. And it's not much of a show, either. The most sympathetic character has terrible lines;&#xa0;his foil has no character; and there has not been much of a plot to lose. There are serious issues to be dealt&#xa0;with and there are debates about policy, morality and ideology to be had and, contrary to Whitaker's claim, many&#xa0;\"average Americans\" are interested in them. But elections, apparently, aren't the place to have them or to resolve the issues in question.</p> <p>But while the show may be dull, the fight has just got very interesting. What was beginning to look like a foregone conclusion, in which the contest was always close but an Obama victory increasingly likely, is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/17/barack-obama-election-gary-younge\" title=\"\">now wide open</a>. Few now doubt that Romney could win. Indeed it's indicative of just how poor the show has been that Obama's eight-month lead could be eroded with a single poor 90-minute performance. Before then, he was leading by default. Once Romney's Etch a Sketch finally settled upon a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/oct/17/hofstra-presidential-debate-instapolls-obama-romney\" title=\"\">plausible version of himself</a>, the uncommitted and unconvinced were prepared to take a second look.</p> <p>The final two weeks will be volatile. On Saturday alone, three different national <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/latest_polls/\" title=\"\">polls ranged from showing Romney ahead by 6% to him trailing Obama by 3%</a>. Obama maintains a wafer-thin lead in enough swing states to remain the favourite. But that lead is decreasing, and in several places \u2013 <a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/10/20/oct-19-after-romney-gains-should-obama-concede-florida/\" title=\"\">Florida</a>, <a href=\"http://www2.timesdispatch.com/news/2012/oct/21/tdmain01-battle-for-virginia-intensifies-ar-2299505/\" title=\"\">Virginia</a>, Colorado and <a href=\"http://www.miamiherald.com/2012/10/19/3057214/romney-campaign-begins-pulling.html\" title=\"\">North Carolina</a> \u2013 it has disappeared completely. Barring something unforeseen during the last debate, the outcome will be shaped by three related factors: enthusiasm, organisation and cash.</p> <p>Polls suggest that there is no significant enthusiasm gap between the&#xa0;two parties. Democrats still genuinely love their candidate, Republicans have learned to tolerate theirs. Romney's inauthenticity as a conservative was the price they were willing to pay for his electability as a candidate. When he looked like a loser, the base felt they had the worst of both worlds. Now that he's viable, they are engaged. The momentum is definitely with the Republicans. They are cresting late and strong. Conversely, in three short weeks, Democrats have gone from complacency to panic to relief, and are only now regaining confidence.</p> <p>They'll need it. Enthusiasm is important for two main reasons. The first is voters: people need to be energised enough to get to the polls. The second is volunteers: someone has to get them there. This is a much bigger issue for Democrats, whose base of young, black and Latino voters traditionally manage a lower turnout and have fared particularly badly under Obama.</p> <p>That's where organisation comes in and <a href=\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2012/10/19/ground-game-obama-campaign-opens-up-a-big-lead-in-field-offices.html\" title=\"\">the Democrats are more impressive</a>. They have three times as many field offices as the Republicans in Ohio, and more than twice as many in Florida and Nevada. The Republicans insist that this is of little significance. They may be right. Offices don't necessarily mean action. On Saturday morning the Obama office in Ybor City, near Tampa in Florida, was empty, and the county headquarters was closed.</p> <p>Nonetheless, Democrats are clearly doing something right. Considerably more voters in the swing states say they have been contacted by them during the last month than by Republicans. Meanwhile, 3m votes have been cast nationwide. In <a href=\"http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2012/10/18/polls-obama-has-advantage-in-wisconsin-iowa/\" title=\"\">Iowa</a>, a third of likely voters said they have already voted, and Obama leads among them by&#xa0;some 67% to 32%. In <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/michael-p-mcdonald/early-voting-spinning_b_1989094.html\" title=\"\">Ohio, Florida and North Carolina,</a> the picture is more&#xa0;mixed and inconclusive \u2013 but, broadly speaking, at&#xa0;this early stage Democrats are doing better at the actual polls than in the opinion polls.</p> <p>That's just as well. For gains earned in sweat on one side can be clawed back with cheques by the other \u2013 a fact born out in Wisconsin in June, during the recall vote where grassroots mobilisations could not compete with massive advertising buys. Romney knows this. During the primaries, he and his surrogates would eke out narrow victories from statistical draws with millions of dollars in TV advertising. He doesn't have the <a href=\"http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/10/19/democratic-money-pours-into-super-pacs/\" title=\"\">cash advantage</a> over Obama that he did against his primary challengers. But with unlimited donations now legal, a major cash infusion at this late stage on either side could make all the difference \u2013 and it's more liable to come Romney's way than Obama's.</p> <p>Like many, I would rather talk about what will change than who will win. But the show is lame, and the fight is on. The question of who will win and how has become urgent, unpredictable and dramatic in a manner few could have imagined. Almost every outcome lies within the margin of error. Those margins are getting narrower. And the error could be great.</p> <p><em>Twitter: </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/garyyounge\" title=\"\"><em>@garyyounge</em></a></p>",
  "<p>A new poll of voter intention has president Barack Obama and Republican challenger Mitt Romney neck-and-neck with just over two weeks to go until election day.</p> <p>Announced on NBC's Meet the Press, the NBC/Wall Street Journal survey has the two candidates in a dead heat at 47% each.</p> <p>A breakdown of the figures shows that Obama still has a lead amongst a women, but even that advantage is now down to 51% to 43% \u2013 the smallest gap in a year of polling, NBC correspondent Chuck Todd said.</p> <p>And in a further worrying development for the White House incumbent, Romney had opened up a \"little bit of a lead\" over his opponent in key battleground states, it was announced on the programme.</p> <p>The poll, conducted after last week's presidential debate, is in line with other recent polls that suggest that the Republicans have narrowed the gap in recent weeks and that the outcome of the election is still very much in the balance.</p> <p>Such a tight race is likely to put emphasis on the importance of two set-piece events due to take place in advance of the national ballot on 6 November: Monday's final presidential debate, and monthly jobs figures slated for release just days before America goes to the polls.</p>",
  "<p>Remember four years ago, when no Halloween party was complete without at least four ladies in updos, glasses and red pantsuits, claiming they were Sarah Palin? Or what about three years ago when everyone recycled those Palin wigs and we had more Snookis than a million episodes of Jersey Shore? Yes, such rampant uninspired dressing up is just dreadful.</p> <p>Guys do it too. In the past every gentleman of a certain cultural persuasion with a fake mustache dressed up as Borat. Then there was the year the city was under siege by a sea of Jokers from The Dark Knight (who were made even creepier by the fact that Heath Ledger had just passed). </p> <p>Yes, every year there are certain outfits that you just can't escape and every time you see one you just want to groan. Halloween is one of our more creative holidays, where people can express their individuality by dreaming that they are someone else. That individuality (and creativity) goes by the wayside when you're standing cheek to jowl at the punch bowl with seven people in the same regalia as you. </p> <p>I'm here to help. Here are a handful of costumes based on pop cultural phenomena, internet memes and topical comedy that have the potential to be the hit of the season. If you really want to stand out and wow the crowd, you're going to have to think of something else. (And no, it doesn't matter how well executed your costume is, if it's on the list, the volume of imitators will only detract from your hard work.)</p> <h2>The Ecce Homo Mural </h2> <p>Everyone had a good chuckle this summer where the pictures of a botched restoration of an Ecce Homo mural in Borja, Spain, <a href=\"www.guardian.co.uk/artanddesign/video/2012/aug/23/art-restorer-ecco-homo-mural-video\">surfaced on the internet</a>. That doesn't mean that we should all put on red robes and monkey masks and try to impersonate Cecilia Gimenez's handiwork. And if you think this is such a great idea, well, <a href=\"http://imgur.com/a/KxwHB#1x8wk\">someone already had it</a>, and he did a much better recreation than you can probably pull off. </p> <h2>An Olympian</h2> <p>There is nothing easier than putting on some sports kit, making a few medals out of ribbon and tin foil and calling yourself an Olympian. Since the fever of the London games has not entirely worn off, we're going to see plenty of people sporting Ryan Lochte's grill and McKayla Maroney's scowl on 31 October. Sure, there are plenty of demi-celebrities who ascended the medal stand for you to pick from, but you'll have a hard time sticking out no matter what you choose. However, if you have the body and youth to pull off Tom Daley in his Speedo, then no one will complain if you give it a whirl. </p> <h2>Honey Boo Boo</h2> <p>Here Comes Honey Boo Boo, the latest reality show that everyone thinks is sure to predict the downfall of our great civilization, is ripe for easy Halloween costumes. All it takes is a repurposing of that every-so-popular last minute dress-up idea of going as a \"white trash\" person or redneck and adding a topical spin. You'd be better off finding all the trash you have in your apartment, gluing it to some clothes and going as someone from Hoarders. Even if no one wants to stand next to you, at least you'll get points for originality. </p> <h2>Anything election-related</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398171819\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Politics/Pix/pictures/2012/10/19/1350662464458/Palin-Look-Alikes-Prepare-010.jpg\" alt=\"Palin \"Look-Alikes\" Prepare For Halloween\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Four Sarah Palins, Halloween 2008, San Francisco.

I'm not talking about the cast of Saturday Night Live (though they can be equally uninspired), but about political-themed get-ups. A politician is just a guy in a suit. How hard is that to pull off? You might as well just wear a fedora, write \"PRESS\" on an index card and call yourself an olde-tyme reporter. What a snooze. I will give allowances for someone who dresses like a dog, straps himself to a car and goes as Mitt Romney's pooch, but finding a red tie and a free weight and going as Paul Ryan doing P90X takes no work at all. </p> <h2>Tan Mom </h2> <p>The charges against Patricia Krentcil for taking her young daughter into a tanning booth have <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/feedarticle/10227797\">long been dropped</a>, so maybe we should forget about this crazy internet personage for good. Some people might need to be reminded of her overly tanned hide even now, so just imagine how it's going to feel walking around a spooky party telling everyone, \"I'm Tan Mom, I'm Tan Mom!\" and trying to make it look like you're not trying to perpetrate some sort of latter-day blackface. You might even get yourself beat up by those who don't know what a Tan Mom is.</p> <h2>A Mormon</h2> <p>Maybe it's thanks to Mitt Romney's place in the election or the general rise of Mormonism in popular culture, but all men out there too lazy to think up a real costume need to know they can't keep dressing as a Mormon. I know it's easy to pull the short-sleeved white shirt out of our closet, put on a black tie, and formulate a little name tag. This is no longer cute. If you want to spend some time and get together a whole Joseph Smith look that's a different story but as Annie Lennox sang, don't mess with a missionary man. </p> <h2>Anything slutty</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398171820\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Politics/Pix/pictures/2012/10/19/1350664212670/A-sexy-nurse.-Not-good.-010.jpg\" alt=\"A sexy nurse.

Ladies, you can dress as proactively as you want, but don't be so stupid as to go as a \"<a href=\"http://www.costumes.net/pink-sexy-crayon-dress.html\">sexy crayon</a>,\" a \"<a href=\"http://www.yumdrop.com/Sexy+Ketchup+Bottle+Costume-Y817422/\">sexy ketchup bottle</a>, or, god forbid, a <a href=\"http://www.yandy.com/Sci-Fi-Furry-Costume.php\">sexy Chewbacca</a>. There are a million sexy outfits in the world (French maid, genie, slave Princess Leia) in which you don't have to debase yourself in some infantilized version of a male sex fantasy. If you're going to show off the goods, at least keep it classy.</p>",
  "<p>The Obama administration has moved quickly to water down a report that the US and Iran have agreed in principle to meet one-on-one for negotiations on Iran's nuclear programme.</p> <p>The New York Times said secret talks between officials that began early in Barack Obama's term as president had <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/21/world/iran-said-ready-to-talk-to-us-about-nuclear-program.html\">delivered the provisional agreement</a>.

  "<p>After an eventful year, China has cleared the decks for a wholesale change of leadership amid a particularly challenging set of circumstances. Turbo-powered growth has left the last major state ruled by a communist party facing a string of political, economic and social questions. The five-yearly party congress <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-19755035\" title=\"\">on 8 November</a>, which will appoint the new leaders to steer the country through the rest of this decade, is, therefore, as important in its way as the US presidential poll two days earlier.</p> <p>Whatever the faults of the US system, the contrast between the competitive election across the Pacific, held after months of open policy discussion, and the closed-door transition of power in China is striking. For all the praise from foreign commentators about the way China works, that contrast points to a significant weakness in the system that tries to guide the world's second largest economy on a path of \"scientific&#xa0;socialism\".</p> <p>It has now been 63 years since Mao Zedong proclaimed the People's Republic, and the market-led economic reforms launched at the end of the 1970s&#xa0;by his successor, Deng Xiaoping, have changed the country and the world&#xa0;beyond all measure. But the basic power equation has not budged, confronting those in charge with the task of containing a society that has been brought to prefer materialism to Marxism or Confucianism.</p> <p>In many ways this is healthy. The traditional ruling method, stretching back to the <a href=\"http://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/article_index/c/china_eastern_zhou_dynasty.aspx\" title=\"\">first emperor in 221 BC</a>, was patriarchal and despotic, and was picked up enthusiastically by the communists. But&#xa0;it sits on top of a country in which individuals enjoy a far greater degree of&#xa0;liberty, behaviour patterns are shifting fast, respect for authority is&#xa0;not what&#xa0;it was and technology \u2013 especially in the form of social media \u2013 has wrought a revolution.</p> <p>But the leadership, outgoing and incoming, acts as if nothing has changed. In the Leninist pecking order, the party ranks above the government and the real decisions are made in its politburo, which operates in the strictest secrecy. There is no open policy discussion. Control is everything. The institutions of civil society are absorbed into the official apparatus. Dissent is equated to subversion. Judges swear an oath of loyalty, not to China or to the legal system, but to the communist movement. The party's disciplinary commission can pick anybody up at will, without charge, and hold them for interrogation in a secret location.</p> <p>Occasionally, a corner of the curtain is lifted, as in the party's expulsion last week of the one-time rising star Bo Xilai, boss of the mega-municipality of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/mar/15/china.china\" title=\"\">Chongqing</a> (32 million inhabitants) till last spring. He was accused of \"grave violations of party discipline\", \"massive bribery\", \"improper sexual relations with multiple women\" and \"errors and culpability\" in the cases of former Chongqing police chief <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/24/china-police-chief-wang-lijun-jailed?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">Wang Lijun</a>, and Bo's wife, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/sep/27/neil-heywood-unsafe-warns-scientist\" title=\"\">Gu Kailai</a>, who was convicted last month of the murder of British businessman Neil Heywood.</p> <p>Those charges may or may not be justified, but the fundamental reason for&#xa0;Bo's fall was the fear his ambition and ruthlessness aroused among his peers in the leadership, as he sought to join the supreme decision-making body, the politburo standing committee. For the last 10 years, under Hu Jintao, China&#xa0;has been run on consensus, a dictatorship without a dictator. That is certainly better than the days when Mao got out of bed in the afternoon and launched some adventurous scheme that brought death to millions. But it does not allow for the likes of Bo, who step out of the opaque central circle and plough their own furrow.</p> <p>The political defenestration of this champion of Mao-era values and of state control, who backed the use of the law against opponents, is no bad thing. But the way Bo's case was decided secretly by the politburo, after he disappeared, following his dismissal from his Chongqing post in the spring, is the antithesis of the rule of law. It was a power play in which the charges were personal, raising the question of how many others act similarly but evade censure by bowing to the rule of the centre.</p> <p>There was no debate about the policies Bo pursued \u2013 an awkward matter: Hu Jintao and his anointed successor, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/xi-jinping?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">Xi Jinping</a>, went to the city to sing the praises of the \"Chongqing model\", but since then, photographs of&#xa0;their visits have disappeared from Chinese websites.</p> <p>Such issues go to the heart of the challenge the People's Republic faces. Its essentially conservative leadership is&#xa0;stuck in a system of opaque, top-down rule. Like the emperors before them, the&#xa0;leaders fear that change may&#xa0;bring down the whole edifice. But if&#xa0;the party has no alternative, its model&#xa0;is reaching its limits.</p> <p>Deng made the economy the driver of&#xa0;national revival and the party's's recovery from the implosion of the Cultural Revolution, but expansion is slowing down, shot through with inefficiency and excess capacity, and paying the price for the failure to address crucial issues such as land ownership, labour movement, capital markets and water and energy supply. Though the party claims to stand for the people, there are an estimated 150,000 popular protests a year. The lack of trust people feel covers everything from food safety standards to official pronouncements \u2013 \"Only believe something when the government denies it,\" a saying goes. Corruption and yawning disparities of wealth fuel resentment. The environment is a mess and the demographics are heading the wrong&#xa0;way.</p> <p>Still, for most of its people, this is the best time to live in China during the&#xa0;modern era. The material and social strides made in the past few decades are indisputable. But they have brought the need for a new approach from the top, and time is running out. If the new leadership cannot forge that, China's future will be far more uncertain than its&#xa0;recent past.</p>",
  "<p>In a glass mountain-top palace that looms over Tbilisi like something from a Bond movie, Bidzina Ivanishvili talks fondly of his penguins. It's not true, he says, that he keeps them in a special refrigerator. \"I have a breed capable of standing normal temperatures,\" he explains. He also owns several lemurs, a herd of deer and a pet zebra \u2013 not to mention a stunning collection of modern art, all financed with a fortune made in Russia.</p> <p>The billionaire is leading the country's once-divided opposition into the most important election since the rose revolution swept the old order from power almost a decade ago. For the first time, Mikheil Saakashvili \u2013 the hero of that hour \u2013 faces a real challenge to his authority in parliamentary elections on Monday that could change the course of this corner of the Caucasus. </p> <p>The poll is bitterly contested. This small mountain nation (population: 4.5&#xa0;million) on the doorstep of Russia is more polarised than at any time since 1991 and independence from the Soviet Union. At stake is whether Georgia moves towards genuine democracy, or whether the rose revolution that swept Saakashvili to power in 2003 fizzles out.</p> <p>The country is also at the heart of a strategic battle between Moscow and the west. Russia insists Georgia is part of its backyard. To prove a point, it invaded in 2008 after Saakashvili unwisely tried to grab back rebel South Ossetia. Washington and the EU say Georgia is a sovereign nation that can decide its own destiny. Two geopolitical visions, Atlanticist and neo-Soviet, collide in a landscape of ancient villages, medieval towers and breathtaking mountains.</p> <p>Until recently, Saakashvili and his ruling United National Movement party had been expected to cruise to victory. All this changed after the release by two opposition TV stations 12 days ago of a horrific video showing prison officers abusing inmates and sodomising them with broom handles. \"When I watched it&#xa0;I thought it was a nightmare. The images were just awful,\" said Khatuna Kipiani, an opposition supporter.</p> <p>The video revealed something rotten at the heart of Georgia's state. It has appalled Georgian voters, embarrassed the authorities, and led to a surge of support for Georgia's opposition and for Ivanishvili, whose $6.4bn (\u00a34bn) fortune is put at half of Georgia's GDP. He burst on to the political scene a year ago, following years of quiet philanthropy in which he had paid for police uniforms, restored crumbling churches and funded salaries for actors and struggling artists \u2013 a sort of Georgian fairy godfather.</p> <p>His Georgian Dream coalition, named after a song by his rapper son, lags behind Saakashvili's ruling party in the ratings. But it is catching up, according to the latest polls. On Saturday evening, 100,000 Georgian Dream supporters packed into Tbilisi's central Rustaveli Avenue. \"It is as clear as day \u2013 we will win and achieve another victory in the history of our nation,\" Ivanishvili told them. \"We will not let anyone separate us from civilisation, modern times and democracy.\"</p> <p>His rise has spooked the government. It has variously dismissed him as a Kremlin stooge, a political dilettante, a \"weirdo\", and an old-style paternalist. Government aides mock his zoo, kept at his village home in western Georgia. They also say his sprawling coalition includes unsavoury elements, such as xenophobes and fans of Stalin, who was born in the Georgian town of Gori. But, undoubtedly, Ivanishvili has plugged into a mood of popular discontent and fatigue with Saakashvili, who critics say has become increasingly dictatorial.</p> <p>Ivanishvili dismisses the government's many charges against him and says that it is Saakashvili who is the monster: \"I'm very happy that I'm physically here and alive. You don't know Saakashvili's true face. He's capable of doing some atrocious things.\"</p> <p>Thousands of observers have flooded into Georgia for the election. Lobbyists hired by Ivanishvili have bombarded members of the US Congress and other opinion-makers with emails promoting Georgian Dream and accusing Saakashvili of treachery. The Georgian government has hit back: all international visitors to Georgia, a land of ancient viniculture, receive a free bottle of Saperavi wine from passport control. The government also says that Ivanishvili is using his money, made in the 1990s, to buy the election.</p> <p>In a report on Saturday, Transparency International, which describes itself as an anti-corruption organisation, blamed both sides for presenting \"simplistic programmes\" for increased social spending. For many voters, it is poverty and unemployment that have driven them to support Georgia's opposition.</p> <p>Sitting in a Tbilisi park on a warm evening, next to a statue of Giorgi Leonidze, a Georgian poet, Manana Nizharadze said she was surviving on a state pension of just 100 lari (\u00a337) a month. \"We live very badly. Wages are low. Communal charges are high. We can't afford medicines,\" she said. \"Saakashvili is a bad person.\"</p> <p>Edward Saakashvili, a distant relative of the president, demurred. \"He's done good things. People don't like discipline,\" he said, tossing back a glass of schnapps.</p> <p>Many voters complain of the president's disastrous 2008 war with Russia. Both South Ossetia and Abkhazia \u2013 which broke away in the 1990s \u2013 are now home to a massive Russian military presence. Russia's president, Vladimir Putin, who famously described how he wanted to \"hang Saakashvili by the balls\", conducted military exercises there last week, a crude reminder to Tbilisi that Moscow could reinvade any time.</p> <p>\"Shevadnadze lost the whole of Abkahzia. Misha [Saakashvili] lost Ossetia. It was a big mistake,\" said Nizharadze.</p> <p>Saakashvili's own future is unclear. He is 44 and due to step down as president in January 2013. His government has enacted constitutional changes that will transform Georgia next year from a presidential to a parliamentary republic. This has fuelled speculation that Saakashvili is planning to \"do a Putin\", and perform a job swap that would see him hang on to executive power by becoming prime minister.</p> <p>His government colleagues, however, are sceptical of such a manoeuvre. \"Politically it's impossible,\" said Giga Bokeria, secretary of Georgia's national security council.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 3 October 2012 to correct the population of Georgia from 4.7 million to 4.5 million.</p>",
  "<p>Barack Obama and Mitt Romney were gearing up on Sunday for three days of intense preparations for the first of the US presidential debates, which is almost certain to be the Republican candidate's last chance to turn around his struggling campaign.</p> <p>The 90-minute debate in Denver on Wednesday will be the first opportunity Americans will have to see the two candidates side by side and compare not only their policies but how they look and behave. The outcome could be decided by a hesitation in explaining a policy, a smart riposte or a display of arrogance.</p> <p>Each side took part in the usual ritual of talking up their opponent at the weekend in an attempt to dampen expectations. Paul Ryan, the Republican vice-presidential candidate, speaking on Fox News on Sunday, described Obama as \"a very gifted speaker\". Supporters of Obama claimed Romney had won nearly all of the debates during his gruelling nomination process.</p> <p>Estimates for the number of viewers in America range from 50 million to 60 million, almost double the number who watched the party conventions. There will be two additional debates, in Long Island and Florida, but it is the first that usually has the most impact.</p> <p>Obama, with significant poll leads in the swing states, can play defence, just getting through the evening without making a mistake. The onus is on Romney to make an impression.</p> <p>Chris Christie, the Republican governor of New Jersey, acknowledged on NBC's Meet the Press on Sunday that Romney would need to do well in the first debate. \"You're going to have tens of millions of people for the first time really tuning in and paying attention to this race ... On Thursday morning the entire narrative of this race is going to change.\"</p> <p>Both candidates were readying themselves for three days of intensive preparation. Obama, after a campaign event in Las Vegas on Sunday night, heads to Henderson half-an-hour's drive away for three days of preparation. Romney will also do three days of preparation, arriving in Denver Monday.</p> <h2>Do debates make a difference?</h2> <p>Some political analysts argue that the debates do not matter, usually ending inconclusively and quickly forgotten. Others point to debate moments over the last 52 years, since the first televised debate between Kennedy and Nixon, that have turned out to decisive.</p> <p>John McCain, failed Republican presidential candidate in 2008, who has debated with both Obama and Romney, did not anticipate any \"breakthrough\" moments, saying they they have become rarer in recent decades.</p> <p>\"I can't remember the last time there was one of these comments that grabbed everybody's attention because, frankly, the candidates are too well prepared,\" McCain told CNN on Sunday.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396937031\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2008/09/27/0926_stage_460x276.jpg\" alt=\"Barack Obama and John McCain\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Then Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama and  John McCain in their first presidential debate in 2008. Photograph: Win McNamee/Getty</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Win McNamee/Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But debates can dramatically change a campaign. Hillary Clinton was a seemingly insurmountable 30 points ahead of Obama in the race for the Democratic presidential nomination until she hesitated when asked a question in a 2007 debate about illegal immigration. </p> <p>Tad Devine, a Democratic strategist involved in presidential campaigns from Mondale in 1984 through to Kerry in 2004, believes debates are important. He recalled Mondale jumped 23 points in a poll after having a good first debate with Reagan and that Gore lost a three to four point lead in 2000 after his debate with George W Bush.</p> <p>He argues it is possible for Romney to use the debate to mount a comeback.</p> <p>\"Romney has got to get himself back into the race. He needs voters to have one more look at him and this is it,\" said Devine.</p> <p>\"If the Romney team are smart, they will not try to do it all in the first debate. They need to make up some ground and get people to like this guy a little. It is all about how he comports himself. If they are smart and he starts repairing his image, you can change a lot in 90 minutes.\"</p> <h2>Preparations</h2> <p>Romney's campaign team has long argued that the debates are pivotal and, because of that, the candidate has been rehearsing since at least August, locking himself away for mock-up debates with senator Rob Portman from Ohio standing in for Obama.</p> <p>According to the Obama team, the president has had less time to prepare because of his White House duties, though he has occasionally taken time out for visits to the Democratic national committee's headquarters in Washington for debate sessions, with senator John Kerry standing in for Romney.</p> <p>The preparations at the rival camps will be intensive, with soundbites rehearsed over and over again. They will prepare on replicas of the Denver stage, the rehearsals filmed and analysed. </p> <p>Obama, with a tendency for long answers, is being encouraged by staff to be snappier. One of his advisers, Jen Psaki, said last week: \"The president is familiar with his own loquaciousness and his tendency to give long, substantive answers.\" </p> <p>The relentless preparations include appearance as well as policy, with ties and suits chosen to avoid blending in with the stage backdrop.</p> <p>Devine remembers that, in spite of all the detailed preparations for one Gore-Bush debate, one of the problems was a failure to check how Gore's make-up would look on camera. Viewers complained he looked \"too orangey\".</p> <h2>Expectations</h2> <p>It has become commonplace that, ahead of the debates, the two camps talk up the opposing candidate in an effort to lower expectations. Romney supporters talk up Obama's oratorical skills, while the president's campaign has been claiming that Romney has had a great deal of practice at debates during his nomination process.</p> <p>In reality, neither candidate is a great debater. Often forgotten is that Obama, while one of the best orators in the US, performed poorly at debates during the during Democratic primaries and caucuses before the 2008 election, though he improved towards the end. The White House spokesman, Jay Carney, at the time a reporter, admitted last week that Obama had become the nominee in 2008 \"in spite of his debate performances\".</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396937032\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2012/1/20/1327024713757/Mitt-Romney-and-Newt-Ging-007.jpg\" alt=\"Mitt Romney and Newt Gingrich in the CNN debate\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mitt Romney and Newt Gingrich in a CNN debate earlier this year. Photograph: Emmanuel Dunand/AFP/Getty Images</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Emmanuel Dunand/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Romney tends to be a poor debater too but has produced occasional good performances when he has had to, particularly against Republican rival Newt Gingrich in Florida earlier this year.</p> <p>It will be completely different after the debate, with both teams fielding supporters in the spin-room to talk up their candidates. </p> <h2>Issues</h2> <p>One of the big issues on Wednesday night will be the secret video of Romney's speech at a May fundraiser in Florida in which he dismissed 47% of Americans as freeloaders. Obama will seek to exploit this to the fullest while Romney has to try to explain it away.</p> <p>Romney's success against Gingrich in debate was attributed at the time to his debate coach, Brett O'Donnell, who subsequently left his staff. O'Donnell, in an interview with the Associated Press last week, said Romney has to try to confront the 47% remark. \"He has to turn the 47% and make sure people understand the reasoning behind that argument, how that's the result of the president's policies.\"</p> <p>The dominant issue will be the slow economic recovery, from an unemployment rate over 8% to the burgeoning deficit and taxation. Other issues will be healthcare reform, immigration and women's rights. Foreign policy is not on the agenda until the final debate.</p> <h2>Debates that made a difference</h2> <p>The first televised debate between Kennedy and Nixon in 1960 cost the Republican the election. Kennedy looked better on television while Nixon appeared unshaven and ill at ease.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396937033\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2008/10/14/kennedy460.jpg\" alt=\"John F Kennedy, Richard Nixon, 1960 presidential debate \" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">John F Kennedy and Richard Nixon wait for the start of their televised presidential debate on 26 September 1960.  Photograph: CBS archives</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: CBS Photo Archive/CBS</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There was a long gap in debates until they resumed in 1976. In 1980, Reagan won a debate and the election with the question \"Ask yourself, 'Are you better off now than you were four years ago?'\"</p> <p>Gore came off second best in a debate with Bush in 2000. Devine recalled that the Gore team thought it had won but the Bush campaign successfully spun to the press that Gore had looked arrogant, sighing repeatedly throughout the debate and rolling is eyes. The spin worked.</p>",
  "<p>The challenger to Hugo Ch\u00e1vez in the Venezuelan presidential election has vowed a dramatic change in foreign policy if he is elected next Sunday, shifting his country away from China and Russia and reviewing crucial oil deals.</p> <p>Henrique Capriles, who has gained ground in recent polls, said he would halt arms purchases from Russia, rethink relations with Iran and revise deals to exploit one of the world's biggest recoverable oil resources in the Orinoco belt.</p> <p>In an interview during a campaign stop, Capriles said he would end the Ch\u00e1vez policy of promoting worldwide revolution and focus on Venezuela's needs.</p> <p>\"The foreign policy of this government is driven by politics \u2013 to extend a revolution worldwide. My objective with regards to foreign relations is to benefit all Venezuelans,\" he said.</p> <p>This would mark a dramatic change. Under Ch\u00e1vez, Venezuela has consistently thumbed its nose at the US and moved closer to Russia, China, Nicaragua, Cuba and Iran. An example of the close friendship with Moscow came this week when Vladimir Putin presented Ch\u00e1vez with a Russian terrier puppy.</p> <p>Capriles did not mention Russian dogs, but said Russian guns would no longer be required. \"We have spent more than $14bn (\u00a38.66bn) on arms purchases from Russia,\" Capriles said. \"I am not going to buy more weapons. I think the policy has been mistaken.\"</p> <p>The big question is what would happen to the oil industry in Venezuela, which vies with Saudi Arabia in claiming the biggest proven oil reserves in the world. Until now Russian and Chinese companies have struck the biggest deals for future exploitation. \"We have to revise every deal. I think they are agreements that are not functioning,\" Capriles said.</p> <p>Capriles has said he will continue to work with Beijing \u2013 because \"everyone deals with China\" \u2013 but he appeared ready to distance Venezuela from Iran. \"How have relations with Iran and Belarus benefited Venezuela? We are interested in countries that have democracies, that respect human rights, that we have an affinity with. What affinity do we have with Iran?\"</p> <p>Capriles is the grandson of Jewish <em>\u00e9migr\u00e9s </em>who escaped the Holocaust. He studied law at the Catholic University in Caracas, and says that if he wins the first thing he will do is pay homage to the Virgin Mary in El Valle on the island of Margarita.</p> <p>The 40-year-old offers a sharp contrast with Ch\u00e1vez, who has been in power for 14&#xa0;years and has had treatment for cancer throughout much of his third term.</p> <p>Capriles, who spent eight months in prison after allegedly trying to break into the Cuban embassy in the days after a 2002 coup attempt against Ch\u00e1vez, describes himself as a political centrist \"who looks to the left\". Critics fear he will roll back social programmes and income redistribution initiated by Chavez.</p> <p>Polls suggest the race may be tight. Some say Capriles may be leading by two points. And as the race draws to a close tensions have risen. On Saturday, two Capriles party leaders were killed by gunmen who, the opposition said, were driving a vehicle with state logos.</p> <p>If the results are close many fear a period of instability. Capriles has said he will win by a wide margin and a transition will be peaceful. \"I believe there will be no violence,\" he said. \"Venezuelans have a deep democratic conviction. If the government hotheads ventured out to stir violence they would encounter the armed forces. I don't believe the armed forces respond to a political party.\"</p>",

  "<p>It took just over four months for the tide of public opinion to turn against Fran\u00e7ois Hollande: at the start of September a poll revealed that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/02/french-pessimistic-francois-hollande\" title=\"\">68% of French people were pessimistic about their country's future under their new president</a>. And that was the common line before <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-19763665\" title=\"\">Friday's announcement of the 2013 budget</a>, which will find him even fewer friends in the country.</p> <p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Moscovici\" title=\"\">Pierre Moscovici</a>, the finance minister, has boasted that no previous government has attempted to reduce the budget deficit by 1.5% in a single year \u2013 from 4.5% to 3% \u2013 and all that with almost nonexistent growth. But it is precisely this kind of ministerial pride that French people are worried about \u2013 whether they belong to the group who will be heavily taxed or are one of those 3 million unemployed who can't see how the austerity budget will help them find a job.</p> <p>Admittedly, a drop in popularity will have always been part of Hollande's calculations. With no elections for another two years, his government will feel it is wiser to take tough measures now rather than later, hoping that positive results will show when voters go back to the polls. Two years: that's the period president Hollande has said would be needed to turn the clock back on unemployment.</p> <p>Still, the proposed budget is far more of a shock than anyone could have predicted only a few weeks ago. It promises to achieve the eurozone-wide 3% budget deficit ceiling as early as 2013, a target Hollande has maintained despite the deterioration of the economy, with a mild recession under way.</p> <p>To do so will require a major effort, whose chance of success has divided opinions. The government needs to find an additional \u20ac30bn next year, and has chosen to divide this amount in three: one-third in spending cuts, and two-thirds in new taxes \u2013 half for businesses and half for individual taxpayers.</p> <p>Liberal economists criticise this division: they argue that state spending should have been cut much further, with fewer new taxes in a country that is already one of the bigger taxers in Europe. They fear job creation will suffer as both businesses and consumers are forced to tighten their belts. Technology entrepreneurs have been particularly vocal since Friday, complaining about a 60% tax on profits when selling a company \u2013 a sharp increase which, they say, will discourage the innovation sector.</p> <p>On the other side, leftwing critics of the socialists such as the former presidential candidate <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/jean-luc-melenchon\" title=\"\">Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon</a> denounce an austerity package designed to satisfy financial markets and Europe's liberal vision, which is not what Hollande promised the French in his campaign against Nicolas Sarkozy.</p> <p>The \"left of the left\" is showing its muscle today, with a major demonstration planned in Paris against Hollande's choice to ratify the new European budgetary treaty in parliament, and not by referendum. The austerity measures in the new budget will have given leftwing voters an additional reason to join the march.</p> <p>Government spokesmen defend their approach as both orthodox and fair. Moscovici made a passionate plea for the reduction of the budget deficit \u2013 and therefore the French debt burden \u2013 in an <a href=\"http://fr.reuters.com/article/topNews/idFRPAE88S02620120929\" title=\"\">interview with Le Monde this weekend</a>. He defended a \"just\" approach in which the tax burden will fall on big corporations and not small and medium-sized companies, and called upon the 10% richest French people to save the nation's social system. \"Rigorous but leftwing\", cheered the left-leaning Lib\u00e9ration, in a rather Pravda-like fashion.</p> <p>Unlike the worst-affected states of southern Europe, France has apparently not given up on saving its generous social system \u2013 while simultaneously following an orthodox path of deficit reduction. The budget has allowed the country to gain time, and France is currently borrowing on financial markets at record low, sometimes even negative, rates.</p> <p>All this is a far cry from former president Sarkozy's gloomy warning during last spring's election campaign: \"Vote for Hollande and you'll have a Greek-style situation in less than two weeks.\"</p> <p>Hollande's gamble is to put the country's finances in order without having to go through the deep and painful cuts that Spain is imposing on its people, or the hard and equally painful social reforms that Germany underwent years ago.</p> <p>Mission impossible? The answer will emerge in the next few months, in the toughest economic environment possible.</p>",
  "<p>On Friday morning, Politico ran <a href=\"http://dyn.politico.com/printstory.cfm?uuid=0665D7E1-13A2-45EC-876F-271DC28CA86A\">an article</a> that chiefly attributed President Obama's lead to Mitt Romney and his failures. Salon's Steve Kornacki came to the <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2012/09/28/sorry_its_not_romneys_fault/\">opposite conclusion</a> and concludes that the fundamentals of this cycle made Romney's task of deposing Obama quite difficult. So, which is it?</p> <p>There are really two ways to measure the fundamentals: approval ratings and economic statistics. Both metrics try to assess how the contest stands without taking into account the opposing candidate's characteristics. Approvals incorporate other factors, such as an incumbent's strengths on other issues unrelated to the economy.</p> <p>Before the campaign really got under way, in April and May, Obama's <a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/poll/124922/Presidential-Approval-Center.aspx?ref=interactive\">average Gallup approval rating</a> was 47%. That figure of 47% isn't great \u2013 but it's not bad, either. During the past <a href=\"http://webapps.ropercenter.uconn.edu/CFIDE/roper/presidential/webroot/presidential_rating.cfm\">11 elections</a> where an incumbent ran for re-election and there was a Gallup poll (all since 1940, save 1944), there has been a statistical trend for the president's approval rating to rise during the campaign.&#xa0;</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396912188\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/30/1348959722868/ApprovalGallup-1.jpg\" alt=\"Approvals, Gallup\" width=\"460\" height=\"335\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Obama's Gallup approval rating has risen to about 49.7% since the conventions. If that holds through the election, it's right about where we would expect Obama's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/cifamerica/2012/may/16/2012-race-obama-approvals-romneys-favorables\">final approval</a> to be, given his April/May approval, based on the out-of-sample prediction from the previous 11 elections. In other words, by this measure, any effect Romney's ineptness might have had is minimal.</p> <p>We can also predict Obama's margin of victory from his April/May approval rating. A 47% approval in April/May forecasts Obama to win the election by 3.4 percentage points. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396912189\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/30/1348959758064/ResultApproval-1.jpg\" alt=\"Result v approvals\" width=\"460\" height=\"335\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Obama's average lead over the past three weeks of Gallup polling is 4 percentage points. Obama's right where he should be, then, based on his approval when the campaign began. In fact, despite being out-of-sample, Obama's fits the line the best out of any of the data points. </p> <p>Some might say that Obama's approval is based in part on his high favorability. Thus, a stronger opponent could have knocked Obama a peg or two, particularly with a strong economic case.</p> <p>Measuring the economy is difficult to do because there are many different metrics and they often diverge. Also, many economy-based models include other factors not related to the economy.</p> <p>Bob Erikson and Chris Wlezien get around this messiness <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/dp/0226922154\">by turning</a> to a leading economic indicator growth variable that incorporates ten economic statistics. A model based off only this economic index for every election since 1952 predicts that President Obama should win the election by 5 points. In other words, even the economy paints Obama as a favorite. This figure not incidentally matches the margin that a model based on <a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/01/28/approval-ratings-and-re-election-odds/\">November Gallup approval</a> would estimate, given Obama's 50% approval rating.&#xa0;</p> <p>Much of the reasoning that the state of the economy made Obama the underdog derives from a misunderstanding of how the economy relates to presidential elections. Many people look only at the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/cifamerica/2012/jan/10/obamas-reelection-prospects-hard-numbers\">absolute statistics</a> \u2013 but it is growth, specifically late growth, that is most important. Other models are solid, but aren't purely based on economic measures. Looking at an ensemble of these forecasts collected created by Jacob Montgomery, Florian Hollenbach and Michael Ward, Obama is <a href=\"http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayJournal?jid=PSC\">still favored</a> to win 60% of the time.</p> <p>So what about the idea that Mitt Romney is supposedly a dismally poor candidate? We can measure Romney's crumminess by examining his favorable ratings. I dug through the <a href=\"http://www.ropercenter.uconn.edu/\">Roper archives</a> and found three pollsters with favorable ratings taken during the final week of the campaign dating back to at least 1992. Gallup has favorables since 1988. CBS goes back to 1980. From each of these pollsters, I took the tightest screen (that is, likely voters when available or possibly estimated).</p> <p>The result is that <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/other/romney_favorableunfavorable-1134.html\">Romney's favorables</a> are bad, but probably not the worst of any recent presidential candidate. Romney's latest net favorable (favorable minus unfavorable) in the <a href=\"http://desmond.imageshack.us/Himg542/scaled.php?server=542&amp;filename=picture139h.jpg&amp;res=landing\">CBS poll</a> is -1 percentage point. If that holds through the election, there have been eight major party candidates with an equal or worse favorable rating since 1980, including Jimmy Carter, Walter Mondale, Michael Dukakis, Bill Clinton, Bob Dole, John Kerry, and John McCain.</p> <p>Romney's net favorables rank worse historically in <a href=\"http://desmond.imageshack.us/Himg542/scaled.php?server=542&amp;filename=picture139h.jpg&amp;res=landing\">Gallup and NBC/Wall Street Journal's polls</a>. Even then, his Gallup +2 net favorable is better than either Michael Dukakis's in 1988 and George HW Bush's in 1992 at the end of the campaign. NBC/Wall Street Journal -5 net favorable rating is equal to President George HW Bush's in 1992. Romney's net favorables would, no doubt, be better than Democratic presidential candidates were in the 1980s if these pollsters surveyed voters in the 1980 and 1984. As I said, Romney is not viewed favorably, but his deficit is not historically exceptional.</p> <p>Part of the reason that many think Romney's poor standing is historic is because Pew Research's data <a href=\"http://www.people-press.org/2012/09/19/obama-ahead-with-stronger-support-better-image-and-lead-on-most-issues/\">has said it is</a>. The problem, in my opinion, is that Pew is mixing its data from this year with Gallup's from the past. Pew has been <a href=\"http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2012-09-28-delta.png\">consistently one of the more favorable pollsters</a> for President Obama in 2012.</p> <p>What is often not discussed is that despite a reputation as likable figure, Obama's <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/other/obama_favorableunfavorable-643.html\">net favorables</a> are actually quite low compared to past candidates. According to CBS, eight presidential candidates since 1980 had an equal or better net favorable at the end of the campaign than Obama does right now. Nine since 1988 had an equal or better favorable rating than Gallup found in their last poll. Six since 1992 had a better favorable per NBC data.</p> <p>Why are both Obama and Romney's favorable ratings so low? It could be that the electorate is <a href=\"http://www.people-press.org/2012/06/04/partisan-polarization-surges-in-bush-obama-years/\">more polarized</a> than at any point in the last 25 years.</p> <p>The way we can really compare 2012 to prior years is to look at the difference between the candidates' favorability. The difference in the net favorables of the candidates in CBS's data among likely voters is smaller than in every other election since 1980. The gap in 2012 tied for the second smallest next to 2004 according to Gallup. For NBC, it is in the middle of the pack. In other words, 2012 should be a close to moderate victory for Obama based off <a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/04/18/do-romneys-favorability-ratings-matter/\">past data</a>.</p> <p>Another key point is that Romney's favorability \"problem\" may itself be determined by the fundamentals. Favorable ratings don't happen in a shell: people's view about a challenger relates at least partially to whether they like the job the incumbent is doing.&#xa0;</p> <p>Not surprisingly, then,&#xa0;when incumbents run for re-election,&#xa0;the favorability gap in the <a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/04/18/do-romneys-favorability-ratings-matter/\">late stages</a> of the campaign is tied to an incumbent's approval rating in April and May. I went back in the Roper archive and plotted the incumbent's approval rating against the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/cifamerica/2012/may/16/2012-race-obama-approvals-romneys-favorables\">favorability gap in the final months</a> since 1980.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396912190\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/30/1348959917209/Approvalvsfavorable-1.jpg\" alt=\"Approval v favorables\" width=\"460\" height=\"335\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>There are only five observations from past years, so caution must be taken, but the trend is pretty clear. In fact, 94% of the favorability gap in the final months of the campaign is explained by the president's approval back in April and May. Because Obama's approval in CBS's lone April/May poll was 48%, Obama is estimated to have a net favorability edge of 13 points over Romney. Obama's lead in net favorables among registered voters was 11 points in CBS's last poll, is about 9 points in the Real Clear Politics average, and was only 1 point in the last CBS poll among likely voters.&#xa0;</p> <p>In short, Romney's favorability problem seems either well predicted by Obama's approval strength before the campaign started or actually not anywhere near as bad as might have been expected.&#xa0;</p> <p>There is no proof here that Romney is losing because he's a weak candidate. Romney's problem with the electorate probably has little to do with Romney himself. The reason Romney has struggled is that Obama was in a relatively strong position, thanks in part to economic growth, before many voters could even form an opinion about him.</p>"

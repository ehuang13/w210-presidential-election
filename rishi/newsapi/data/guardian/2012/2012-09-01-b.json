  "<p>\"How do I get into the swimming pool?\" I asked one of those famously helpful \"Games makers\" at the Olympic Park. She pointed me down a path, across a bridge, but then she warned: \"You know, you can't get into the swimming pool.\"</p> <p>Why hello, Miss Jobsworth, I thought, bristling and preparing to jab my \"all venues\" accreditation in her smug face. She looked alarmed and took a step backwards. \"Only the athletes can get <em>into</em> the swimming pool,\" she simpered.</p> <p>Oh no, she'd been making a joke! It was day one of the Paralympic Games, and I'd clearly not got the memo that we were back to being nice to each other. Smiling, being polite and stuff that Londoners regard as a sign of weakness.</p> <p>So after a fortnight's regression into misanthropy since the Olympics, once again we are aspiring to be better, happier, more patriotic people. But if it was business as usual for the Games makers \u2013 the majority of whom seem to have been freshly indoctrinated for the Para-lympics \u2013 how are the rest of us feeling? A major international sports competition is a significant emotional and time investment; were we ready to wholeheartedly commit to another one so soon after the euphoria of the Olympics?</p> <p>The initial signs were that, yes, we were. With a peak of 11.2 million viewers, the opening ceremony gave Channel 4 its highest ratings in more than a decade. This was followed by an impressive 3.3 million who watched the British team play Germany at wheelchair basketball. Ticket sales have also been unprecedented. More than 2.42 million have already been allocated, leaving around 10,000 to be drip-released each day. After a surge in demand during the Olympics and steady enthusiasm ever since, there has been speculation that this will be the first sold-out Paralympics.</p> <p>At the ExCel, home to the powerlifting, table tennis and sitting volleyball among other events, there was little evidence of an Olympic hangover on Friday. Visitors had taken advantage of \u00a310 tickets (\u00a35 for children) that allowed them to roam from event to event starting at 9am with 7/7 survivor Martine Wright's debut in the sitting volleyball with constant action until past 10pm. In the gaps you could watch separated-at-birth pair London mayor Boris Johnson and Babs Windsor trying to play sitting volleyball, which was arguably worth the price of admission on its own.</p> <p>One frazzled Games maker admitted that the organising team had been a little overwhelmed by the enthusiasm. \"Spectators are just finishing up in one event and then literally sprinting to the next one,\" he said, just after he had to turn away a long line from a jam-packed powerlifting session. \"We expected them to mill around, maybe get something to eat, go to the toilet.\"</p> <p>Despite some waits at the open-access events in the ExCel, the atmosphere was jubilant. Twice I saw people spontaneously break into dance. \"This is much more relaxed than the Olympics,\" said Simon, who came with his wife and two kids from Ealing, west London.</p> <p>The aim that the Paralympics should be related but distinct from its big brother is also becoming evident. London 2012 chairman Seb Coe has pointed out that Paralympics GB's success in the swimming pool has led to louder cheers there than we ever heard during the Olympics. No one I met this week could confidently explain to me the labyrinthine classification in Paralympic sport, but it didn't seem to adversely affect anyone's enjoyment either. Likewise, the idea that we should judge the athletes on their ability, not their disability, was starting to hit home too.</p> <p>\"I didn't really understand the classification for women's powerlifting, but it was so awesome,\" said London-based Australian Amber, dressed fetchingly in a Superwoman costume. \"But the woman from Nigeria who won was under 44kg and she was benching more than double her weight, 109kg, and that's just amazing.\" \"I wouldn't be able to do half that shit,\" added her friend Gemma, who today was Wonder Woman.</p> <p>Anecdotally, it has been felt that these Games have been less partisan than the Olympics. At the velodrome on Thursday, Sarah Storey's extraordinary gold medal, the first won by a British athlete, was greeted by a racket that rattled the Siberian pine floorboards. But the screaming that accompanied a particularly topsy-turvy bronze-medal decider in the men's individual B pursuit between an Irish rider and a Spaniard was \u2013 to my ears \u2013 just as loud and even more sustained.</p> <p>While you would hesitate to describe all of the performances as elite sport \u2013 there were just six competitors in the women's F40 discus, each with a 50/50 shot at a medal \u2013 that has done little to dampen enthusiasm. Many people are just happy to see venues such as the Olympic Park \u2013 \"I just wanted to be part of it,\" said Anoushka from Oxford \u2013 before they are reassigned.</p> <p>Even traditional rivalries and jingoism have been put to one side in many instances. If you had ever thought that two arms would be beneficial, even essential, for swimming backstroke, then China's Lu Dong disproves that. A double arm amputee, she produced one of the performances of the Games so far to win the women's 100m S6 category, ahead of home favourite Nyree Kindred, and also one of the most memorable images as she stood on the podium with her medal and her bouquet cradled in the crook of her neck.</p> <p>If there's one thing that has been a bit off, it's the absence of foreign visitors. Locog insists they have sold half a million tickets abroad, but non-UK spectators were little in evidence in the opening days of the Games. Eventually, at a Rwanda-Brazil sitting volleyball clash, I found a stars-and-stripes flag, next to paraphernalia from Sweden, Germany, Holland and Ireland. Sadly, they all belonged to one (well-travelled) family \u2013 American mother Alice and her five children \u2013 and today they had come all the way from Berkshire.</p> <p>Alice has been disappointed by tales of NBC's lacklustre coverage, but ascribed it more to the current surfeit of sport in the US \u2013 the start of the American football season, the end of baseball's, and the US Open tennis \u2013 and the forthcoming presidential election than any lack of interest from her compatriots.</p> <p>\"We went to a few Olympics events, but I find the Paralympics even more inspiring,\" she said. \"Just seeing the Rwandan athletes in front of us and after the match how they put their shoes on, their legs on, that sort of stuff for them is so ordinary. I have found the whole thing incredible.\"</p> <p>Alice's kids look on rapt, and you can't ignore the fact \u2013 at a time when legacy is all \u2013 that children, in particular, are clearly loving the Games. \"We had a long drive from Oxford but it was worth it,\" Anoushka's eight-year-old son Joseph confided to me earlier. Inspired by the judo, he has just unleashed a devastating ippon on his younger brother in the main concourse of the ExCel. \"It's been the happiest day of my life.\"</p>",
  "<p>OK, here's the statutory health warning: for a long, long time, people have been saying that the next US presidential election will be \"the internet election\". And thus far, all those predictions have turned out to be wrong, at least if one interprets them as claims that the outcome of the election is effectively determined by online activity.</p> <p>The inspiration for all this speculation about the political impact of the net is an older communications technology \u2013 television. In the 1950s, people speculated endlessly about that medium's impact on politics, but it was only in 1960, with the famous <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6Xn4ipHiwE\" title=\"\">televised debates</a> between John F Kennedy and Richard Nixon, that speculation hardened into certainty: TV was the key factor in presidential politics.</p> <p>And that was the conventional wisdom for the next three decades, until the web turned the internet into something that \"ordinary\" people began to use.</p> <p>For at least a decade since, people have been seeking an analogous tipping point for online media. Some argued that Barack Obama's mastery of social networking in 2008 was critical in ensuring his election. Sceptics countered with the view that the impact of online media paled into insignificance compared with the damage the Republicans inflicted on themselves by nominating Sarah Palin as John McCain's running mate and aspiring vice-president.</p> <p>So will the 2012 election provide the tipping point, the moment when the internet plays a decisive role in influencing how people vote? Given the penetration of the network into daily life, it's obviously implausible to maintain that it isn't having <em>some</em> impact on politics. The yawning gap that existed in the 1990s between cyberspace (where people do \"social networking\") and \"meatspace\" (where they go to polling stations and vote) has clearly shrunk. But by how much?</p> <p>Judging by current online activity, if the internet decided the outcome Obama would win by a mile. His <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/barackobama\" title=\"\">Facebook page</a>, for example, has more than 28m \"likes\" and had more than 1.7m people \"talking\" about it when I last checked. <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/mittromney\" title=\"\">Romney's page</a> has a mere 5.5m \"likes\" (but more than 2m people were \"talking\" about it). On Twitter, Obama is way ahead by all the <a href=\"http://2012twit.com/\" title=\"\">significant metrics</a>: followers (19m to Romney's 954,000); number of followers added in past 24 hours (46,000 v 13,000); mentions (59,000 v 29,000); retweets (25,000 v 6,600); retweeters (22,000 v 5,000). I could go on, but you get the picture.</p> <p>Last week also saw a revealing contrast between the two camps. Romney's crowd put everything into an intensively scripted, 1980s-style rebranding of their candidate, using all the tired old tricks of <em>Mad Men</em> and old media. Obama, in contrast, just turned up on Reddit.com and did an AMA (Ask Me Anything) <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/us-news-blog/2012/aug/29/barack-obama-ask-me-anything-reddit\" title=\"\">session</a>, which brought the site to its knees. If you don't know about Reddit then I suggest you take a look; then ask yourself how many contemporary British politicians you can think of who would dare to do an AMA session on it. (My answer: one \u2013 John Prescott.)</p> <p>The big question is whether Obama's online dominance will make much difference. My hunch is that it won't. This is not because the net isn't important, but because of the peculiar nature of this election. According to a <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/post/the-incredible-shrinking%E2%80%94and-increasingly-valuable%E2%80%94undecided-voter/2012/07/23/gJQAcRMH4W_blog.html\" title=\"\">recent poll</a>, most voters have already made up their minds and only about 6% remain undecided as to how they will vote in November. One analyst, <a href=\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/newsweek/2012/07/15/paul-begala-on-the-swing-voters-who-will-pick-the-president.html\" title=\"\">Paul Begala</a>, a former adviser to Bill Clinton, thinks that the election will be decided by just 4% of the voters, in six states \u2013 Virginia, Florida, Ohio, Iowa, New Mexico and Colorado. That's 916,643 people, or \"fewer than half the number of people who paid to get into a Houston Astros home game last year\".</p> <p>Most of these \"undecideds\" are not interested in politics. But they are almost certainly among the <a href=\"http://www.socialbakers.com/facebook-statistics/united-states\" title=\"\">164m Americans currently on Facebook</a>, which is why one commentator, <a href=\"http://www.technologyreview.com/news/428530/facebook-the-real-presidential-swing-state/\" title=\"\">David Talbot</a>, has dubbed it \"the real presidential swing state\". The thing about Facebook is that many users reveal fine-grained information about themselves \u2013 home town, age, education, preferences, friends. People who are uninterested in politics are unlikely to be swayed by overtly \"political\" messages, but they might be amenable to messages from their Facebook contacts. So, voters in swing states such as Ohio or Florida who have \"liked\" a Facebook page describing Romney as a \"vulture capitalist\" might suddenly find themselves getting messages from \"friends\" reminding them that they buy stationery from Staples, a successful company that Romney invested in.</p> <p>Even in a networked world, all politics will ultimately turn out to be local politics.</p>",

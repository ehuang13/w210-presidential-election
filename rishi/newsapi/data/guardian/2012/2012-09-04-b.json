  "<p>The Obama campaign's use of sophisticated digital tools designed to oil its ground operation and increase engagement with voters on the doorstep could give the president a one or two point advantage over Mitt Romney in the key battleground states upon which the outcome of the election depends, his campaign manager has predicted.</p> <p>Jim Messina, who heads an army of several hundred staffers that has been working for 18 months to secure Obama's re-election, said that the digital campaign that has been assembled this year to interact with voters is \"light years ahead of where we were in 2008. We're going to make 2008 on the ground look like Jurassic Park\".</p> <p>He also claimed that Democrat's investment in innovations <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/may/14/obama-digital-campaigning-dashboard\">such as the canvassing tool set Dashboard</a> and a massive database of voters' details <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/feb/17/obama-digital-data-machine-facebook-election \">that interfaces with Facebook</a> had left the Republicans standing.</p> <p>\"The Romney campaign are doing more than the McCain campaign did [in 2008], I want to give them credit for that. But they are nowhere near where we are on the ground,\" Messina told an event at the Democratic National Convention sponsored by ABC News and Yahoo News.</p> <p>He gave examples from two important swing states \u2013 North Carolina where the convention is being held and where the Obama campaign has 50 field offices up and running while the Romney campaign has yet to open its 20th; and Ohio where the disparity on the ground is even greater at 100 Obama offices to Romney's 30.</p> <p>Messina said that a two-point bounce in key swing states such as Florida, Ohio, Iowa and Colorado could be decisive in determining the outcome of the 6 November election. \"This election is going to be very close. We have been building a ground operation that will give us the one or two points that we need to win these states and we are on track to do that.\"</p> <p>Messina's comments on the 2012 election's ground war were unusually direct for the Obama campaign. The Chicago headquarters that is spearheading the effort to re-elect the president normally avoids discussion of its technical operations for fear of giving away trade secrets to the opposition.</p> <p>The Chicago team prides itself with having developed over the past five years, since Obama launched his first bid for the White House in 2007, the most sophisticated digital campaign in global political history. It is centred around a gargantuan unified database of millions of voter files which, through Dashboard, volunteers can access anywhere at any time. That, combined with Facebook and online micro-targetting of specific groups of undecided voters, has allowed the campaign to amplify and extend the traditional door-to-door efforts of volunteers digitally.</p> <p>While Obama has put a large portion of his war chest behind the largest and best oiled ground operation ever seen, Romney and his Super PAC supporters have taken a more conventional approach of blitzing battleground states with largely negative television advertising. The outcome of the presidential race could in part hinge on this fundamental difference \u2013 a modern digital campaign versus a conventional TV one.</p> <p>Ben LaBolt, the Obama campaign's chief spokesman, said that the president had an important advantage over his Republican challenger. Obama took the unprecedented decision at the end of the 2008 race to leave his digital campaign largely intact, redirecting it to help fight battles faced by his administration such as the passage of healthcare reform.</p> <p>That means that he was able to start campaigning for re-election historically early. \"We have been organising in this campaign for 500 days; while the Republicans were out there pummelling each other during the primaries, our supporters were talking to their friends and neighbours about the president's record and vision,\" LaBolt said.</p> <p>While the 2012 digital campaign launched by the Obama team undoubtedly looks slick, many of the claims made for it have so far been unsubstantiated by any solid data. Messina claimed that the campaign has registered 150% more voters and knocked on 147% more doors this year than at this stage in 2008, though whether or not that translates into actual votes cast remains one of the big questions of this presidential election cycle.</p>",
  "<p>The odds against an Israeli military strike on Iran in the next few months appear to be lengthening, and perhaps the strongest evidence comes from none other than Binyamin Netanyahu, the man who has beaten the war drums loudest over the past few months. </p> <p>By calling for<a href=\"http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4276757,00.html\"> clear international (read US) 'red lines'</a> containing Iran's nuclear programme, the Israeli prime minister has put the focus back on diplomacy, and given himself a ladder to climb down from his earlier rhetoric.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Ehud Barak, the defence minister who had claimed that Iran was approaching a <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/29/magazine/will-israel-attack-iran.html?pagewanted=all\">'zone of immunity'</a> beyond which it could not be stopped, is now reported to be <a href=\"http://www.haaretz.com/opinion/the-barak-livni-axis.premium-1.462096#.UEYkt0aRCqQ.twitter\">against an Israeli attack (\u00a3)</a> before the coming US presidential elections.</p> <p>Consequently, Mike Rogers, the head of the US House intelligence committee returned from a visit to Israel with the conviction that Israel <a href=\"http://thehill.com/conventions-2012/gop-convention-tampa/246087-intel-chairman-israel-waiting-until-after-us-election-for-iran-strike\">will not launch an attack</a> before the US vote in November. According to The Hill online, the Republican congressman said the Israeli threat had lifted for now, \"because I think they believe that maybe after the election they could talk the United States into cooperating\".</p> <p>Such cooperation would be more likely in the event of a Mitt Romney victory in November, and with the poor state of the US economy, that seems increasingly possible. Netanyahu would look particularly foolish if he led Israel into a conflict on its own, just weeks before a close US ally came to power in Washington. The former CIA chief and current Romney adviser, Michael Hayden, was in Israel yesterday echoing the Obama administration message that <a href=\"http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/former-cia-chief-tells-haaretz-decision-on-iran-strike-can-wait.premium-1.462519\">military action can wait. </a></p> <p>Writing in Haaretz, the columnist Amos Harel, <a href=\"http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/in-the-iranian-poker-game-netanyahu-and-barak-have-overplayed-their-hand.premium-1.462525\">notes that Israel Hayom (\u00a3) </a>, owned by the American casino magnate and one of Romney's biggest backers, Sheldon Adelson, and which is widely viewed as a Netanyahu mouthpiece, has considerably toned down its coverage of Iran's nuclear programme in recent days. Harel's reading is that Netanyahu and Barak have overplayed their hand in poker terms, and have realised they have damaged Israel's relationship with the US for little or no strategic gain.</p> <p>David Remnick <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2012/09/03/120903fa_fact_remnick\">reports in the current edition (\u00a3) </a> of the New Yorker on the substantial lobby in the Israeli security and intelligence agencies who are opposed to unilateral Israeli action this year. The patron saint of the dissidents, the former Mossad chief, Meir Dagan, tells Remnick in a particularly striking passage: </p> <blockquote> <p>After 33 years in the military and intelligence...[y]ou discover it is possible to get dragged into something and then it is hard to explain why it all happened. It's easy to go from being a victim to being an oppressor. You always have to pay attention to your internal moral compass and ask the right questions. </p> </blockquote> <p>The background to all this is <a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/world/interactive/2012/sep/04/iaea-report-full-document\">the latest report</a> from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) on the Iranian programme which failed to provide an unambiguous springboard for urgent action. It showed relentless progress, with a rough doubling of the number of centrifuges installed at Fordow, a heavily-protected site dug into the side of a mountain, and the main focus of Israeli and western concern. But the new centrifuges have not been turned on. The number of machines actually producing 20%-enriched uranium (critical because it can relatively easily be turned into weapons grade material) at Fordow has remained constant.</p> <p>And although IAEA reported that Iran has so far produced near 190 kg of 20%-enriched uranium, (theoretically enough for a warhead if it was further enriched) it has used 71 kg of that total for the production of reactor fuel plates, which are harder to turn into weapons-grade fuel.</p> <p>As Shashank Joshi <a href=\"http://www.rusi.org/go.php?structureID=commentary&amp;ref=C5044947B3D809#.UEYFn79y9E4\">argues in an analysis </a>for the Royal United Service Institute, it is questionable whether Barak's 'zone of immunity' idea made much sense in the first place. Fordow is under IAEA safeguards monitoring, so any attempt to \"break out\" and enrich to weapons grade would be flagged in advance. As there is no sign that Fordow is being fortified any further, the immunity of the programme does not seem to change. The 'zone of immunity' concept, Joshi says, should be 'understood primarily as a rhetorical device', and that rhetoric - this week at least - is sounding increasingly hollow.</p>",
  "<p>What if members of the United States Congress, now returning from their summer recess, were to receive a \"back to school\" letter from concerned citizens? Here is what a first draft might look like.</p> <h2>Dear Member of Congress:</h2> <p>Welcome back to the Capitol. We hope that you had a good summer break, and that you return to Washington not just rested, but also energised to take on our country's mounting economic challenges.</p> <p>The news has been mixed during your absence. We have seen some improvement in economic data, but not enough to suggest that we are any closer to overcoming decisively this painful period of low growth and high unemployment. And, with a self-inflicted fiscal cliff looming \u2013 one that could send our country back into recession, pulling the rest of the world with us \u2013 businesses are reluctant to hire and invest in new capital goods. Fortunately, the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/aug/31/markets-fed-chairman-ben-bernanke?intcmp=239\" title=\"\">Federal Reserve has signalled its intention to remain active</a>, but its policy tools are poorly suited to the challenges that we face.</p> <p>Meanwhile, global difficulties remain substantial. We continue to face strong headwinds originating from the deepening European debt crisis, as well as geopolitical tensions in the Middle East. China, once the world's unstoppable growth engine, is slowing. And, despite all the happy talk, multilateral policy co-ordination is essentially non-existent.</p> <p>All of this calls for courageous and visionary economic leadership; otherwise, our problems will fester and grow, and the solutions will become even more complex. Already, too many of our economy's difficulties, including worrisome trends in youth joblessness and long-term unemployment, risk becoming structurally embedded.</p> <p>No doubt you have also noticed that, with less than 10 weeks to go until the November presidential election, our country is in the grip of an increasingly ugly political campaign. So, with this combination of bad economics and bad politics, we look to you for direction and leadership. It is that simple, and that important.</p> <p>We need you to overcome a prolonged period of congressional paralysis and polarisation in order to address the country's malaise. We need you to pivot in your responses from the tactical to the strategic, from the cyclical to the secular, from the partial to the comprehensive, and from sequential to simultaneous reforms.</p> <p>If this call to national duty is not enough, we would remind you of your own self-interest. According to the latest NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll, your support among us, the electorate, stands at just 12%.</p> <p>We concede that there is no magic wand to overcome our country's problems. After all, for too many years leading up to the global financial crisis, America \"bought\" and \"borrowed\" its growth by leveraging balance sheets, rather than \"earning\" it through increased competitiveness. The result was massive misallocation of human resources, insufficient infrastructure investment, over-reliance on credit entitlements, and, of course, unsustainable debt. To make matters worse, this occurred at a time when systemically important emerging economies hit their \"developmental breakout phase,\" powered by trade and other aspects of globalisation.</p> <p>We do not expect you to solve America's problems overnight. Instead, we look to you to embark on an appropriate and sustainable policy path. So, as you unpack your bags and renew old friendships and rivalries, please keep the following in mind.</p> <p>Changing course requires that you, together with the president, have a much more open and consistent economic dialogue with us, the general public, about the challenges that we face. It also requires that you and the president converge on a multi-prong, multi-year policy initiative that, at a minimum, makes simultaneous advances in six critical areas:</p> <p>\u2022 Fiscal reform: We desperately need you to eliminate the looming fiscal cliff in the context of medium-term reforms of both the tax system and entitlements. This would also allow for greater fiscal stimulus at a time when other components of aggregate demand are slowing.</p> <p>\u2022 Labour-market reform: Persistently high unemployment and large-scale withdrawal from the labour force are a constant reminder of a malfunctioning labour market that needs support through better training and retooling. Reform must also address the related challenges of a lagging education system and an insufficient social safety net.</p> <p>\u2022 Housing and housing finance: At the root of the global financial crisis, the troubled US housing market continues to act as a millstone around the economy's neck. The longer the problems persist, the greater the pressure on consumer and business sentiment, and the harder it is for the unemployed to find and relocate to new job opportunities.</p> <p>\u2022 Clogged credit pipes: With banks' balance sheets contracting, too many small and medium-size companies are unable to mobilise credit for investment and growth. Recognising that it will take years until banks are properly stabilised, America needs to build new conduits for credit.</p> <p>\u2022 Infrastructure: Those of you who have travelled abroad know that our infrastructure is desperately lagging that of a growing number of countries. This makes it even harder for our companies to compete and prosper.</p> <p>\u2022 Global policy co-ordination: America's traditional leadership role has evaporated in recent years as our problems have made us more insular and inward-looking. This would not be a major problem if the resulting vacuum had been filled. But that has not happened. On the contrary, the G7 has lost relevance, the International Monetary Fund is hampered by its representation and legitimacy deficits, and the G20 is still finding its feet.</p> <p>Engineering such an agenda is not an overwhelming challenge. But that will provide little comfort if you, our elected representatives, do not collaborate effectively.</p> <p>The choice Congress faces this term is simple: either address head on America's challenges, or risk being remembered as the body whose dithering condemned future generations to being worse off than their parents.</p> <p>Yours sincerely,</p> <p>Concerned citizens</p> <p>__________________________________________________________</p> <p>Copyright: <a href=\"http://www.project-syndicate.org/\" title=\"\">Project Syndicate</a>, 2012</p>"

  "<p>While Julian Assange was not a household name in Ecuador before this week, figures from across the political spectrum have rallied round the government of Rafael Correa over the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/video/2012/aug/16/ecuador-julian-assange-threats-britain-video?intcmp=239\" title=\"\">perceived threat from the Foreign Office against the country's embassy</a> in London.</p> <p>For many, granting asylum to the WikiLeaks founder has became a matter of principle in order to defend the country's sovereignty. Correa dedicated a large part of his regular Saturday television and radio broadcast to the subject, saying that if Ecuador had threatened to enter a foreign embassy, other countries would have accused him of being a dictator.</p> <p>\"They haven't found out that the Americas are free and sovereign and that we don't accept meddling and colonialism of any kind,\" he said. \"They don't know who they are dealing with.\" Sweden had not given enough guarantees that it would not be extraditing Assange to a third country, he said, and the Ecuadorean government wanted to give him protection.</p> <p>With his country suddenly playing a key role in a high-profile diplomatic standoff, many analysts believe Correa is likely to use the case to build capital at home ahead of next year's presidential election, when he is expected to run again.</p> <p>But writing in the opposition newspaper El Comercio, columnist Marco Arauz suggested that in the long term the row may count against Correa. \"By drawing the world's attention with this superhuman effort in Assange's favour, the government will revive the debate over its own intolerance against the independent press,\" he wrote. El Comercio, openly hostile to Correa, is one of several privately owned media organisations that have born the brunt of the president's hostility.</p> <p>C\u00e9sar Ricaurte, the executive director of the Quito-based media watchdog <a href=\"http://www.fundamedios.org/\" title=\"\">Fundamedios,</a> said that his organisation has registered 533 attacks on journalists in Ecuador since 2008, 100 of them this year. Twenty radio and television stations have been shut. Ricaurte said the panorama for journalists in Ecuador is \"increasingly asphyxiating\".</p> <p>\"We've suffered five years of constant harassment and persecution which begins with the president's own hostile discourse,\" said Ricaurte. Human rights groups say only Cuba has a worse record in the Americas on press freedom.</p> <p>One of the latest incidents reported to Fundamedios involved the editor of the local newspaper La Hora, who had written critical editorials about the granting of asylum to Assange. Orlando Gomez, also a correspondent for the Colombian magazine Semana, said a man stepped off the back of a motorcycle at a road junction, asked if he was Mr Gomez then smashed his car window with an iron bar.</p>",
  "<p>As <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/francois-hollande\" title=\"\">Fran\u00e7ois Hollande</a> hits the 100-day mark, what is the verdict on the man at the top of French politics? In terms of style, his trademarks emerged quickly enough. Hollande has renewed the Gaullist interpretation of the presidency: in accordance with the letter of the constitution, he sees his role as an above-the-party arbiter who lets the prime minister, Jean-Marc Ayrault, govern. Unlike Nicolas Sarkozy, Hollande neither polarises public opinion, nor does he arouse strong feelings. He is generally described as \"decent\" and \"modest\"; adjectives that were never associated with Sarkozy.</p> <p>Three months on, however, the novelty of this change is beginning to wear off. Over the course of the last week, commentators in the media have called on Hollande to start being more specific about his policies and priorities. Some journalists have even begun to mock his quiet tone: the expression <em>pr\u00e9sidence p\u00e9p\u00e8re </em>(\"cushy presidency\") has been used in several broadsheets.</p> <p>So where is France really headed? In line with Hollande's Agenda for Change, released on 4 April, the new Socialist majority in parliament passed a rash of bills before the recess on 2 August. Most were intended to generate an extra \u20ac7.2bn to meet the 2012 deficit targets. The highest-profile reversal of previous government policy was the decision to resume taxing overtime pay and putting an end to state subsidies to fund that exemption. \"Work more to earn more\" was the flagship measure of Sarkozy's 2007 campaign. It aimed to boost the economy by deregulating the labour market. In fact, this reform did nothing to stimulate employee income but cost the state more than \u20ac25bn in tax relief.</p> <p>Another law reinstated salary-based charges that employers pay \u2013 the previous government had shifted those costs to the general public in the form of a tax increase. The infamous Tepa law, passed in August 2007 \u2013 which lowered taxes on assets of wealthier people \u2013 was also revised. J\u00e9r\u00f4me Cahuzac, the Socialist minister for the budget, declared that this \"exceptional contribution is a big effort being demanded of those who can afford to make it\". It sounded like a uneasy plea to the rich, rather than a confident decision. This half-hearted approach augurs badly for the intentions of the government when it comes to addressing the widening gap between the rich and the rest of the population.</p> <p>Furthermore, a 75% tax rate on those earning more than \u20ac1m, and a new 45% rate on those earning over \u20ac150,000 has been delayed until the autumn. At the same time, the minimum wage was increased by a token 2%. This felt like a slap in the face for the trade unions and low-income voters.</p> <p>But what about the much-heralded \"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/tobin-tax\" title=\"\">Tobin tax</a>\", introduced on 1 August? It's worth clarifying that this is a tax on only 0.2% of the value of financial transactions. Another tax aimed at high-frequency trading was also implemented. The so-called frequency tax is 0.01% on the amount of stock orders modified or cancelled that exceeds 80% of all orders transmitted in a month. In short, it's more of a \"non-transaction\" tax.</p> <p>These \"achievements\" promised to shed a new light on Hollande's much trumpeted intentions of \"further regulating the markets\". The government has used taxation to dissuade bankers from deliberately placing false orders in an attempt to manipulate the market. Take note: Hollande did not try to ban certain practices or introduce new rules. He is simply trying to benefit modestly from the system as it stands.</p> <p>In the runup to the election, Hollande had promised to renegotiate the EU fiscal compact. This endeavour was supported by a large majority of voters. On 29 June, after one of those dramatically choreographed EU summits, a glowing Hollande appeared before cameras and declared: \"Europe has changed in the right direction.\"</p> <p>Yet the French president spectacularly failed to keep his word. Angela Merkel's and Sarkozy's treaty has prevailed unchanged. Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon, the Left Front presidential candidate, denounced it as a \"knockabout farce\". All Hollande could claim was a derisory \"growth pact\" worth 1% of the EU's GDP (\u20ac130bn). More embarrassing was the revelation that the growth package entailed deploying up to \u20ac55bn in unspent EU structural funds.</p> <p>The Socialist president has not opposed the EU-inspired austerity programmes that are strangling the economies of Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal and Spain. Worse, he has implicitly endorsed them by sending an unprecedented, thinly veiled warning to Greek voters days before the dramatic rerun of the general elections. He hinted that if Greeks insisted on casting their votes in favour of Syriza, a leftwing \"anti-austerity\" coalition, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/greek-election-blog-2012/2012/jun/14/greece-bailout-hollande-ultimatum-eurozone\" title=\"\">it could cost them Greece's participation in the eurozone</a>.</p> <p>On 9 August, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutional_Council_of_France\" title=\"\">France's constitutional council</a> ruled that the adoption of the EU fiscal compact did not require a change to the constitution. This would have necessitated the support of three-fifths of MPs; an unachievable majority. Instead, the treaty will enter into force if the government passes an \"organic law\" by a simple majority. Hollande said there would be no referendum on the new treaty \u2013 he is afraid of losing it.</p> <p>This denial of democracy has infuriated the left. Many argue that the pact allows Brussels to dictate national policy by allowing it to impose sanctions on countries that fail to respect a structural deficit ceiling of 0.5% of GDP. The diktat will restrict all governments' room for manoeuvre in the foreseeable future. What is more, it dramatically undermines parliament's powers to pass laws as it sees fit for the country. When the French return from their summer holidays, they can only hope for further spending cuts (\u20ac33bn in 2012-14) and tax rises to meet Hollande's 3% deficit targets by the end of 2013.</p> <p>Hollande has chosen to stay the course of the punitive austerity policies that are ruining European countries. Mr Normal has quietly taken to the neoliberal sea \u2013 and he makes no waves.</p>",
  "<p>Under cover of darkness the men creep out to their prime targets in the capital of Somalia. Their aim is to grab attention with a spectacular political statement. By dawn they will have disappeared without trace, but the city will not be the same.</p> <p>Meet Muhiyidin Sharif Ibrahim, Adan Farah Affey, Mohamed Ali Tohow and Ahmed Ado, a collective of painters slowly but surely changing the face of Mogadishu through guerrilla art.</p> <p>Their message \u2013 for peace, against corruption \u2013 is riding a wave of optimism unprecedented for more than two decades in this all but doomed city.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/newsweek/2012/01/29/is-al-shabab-on-the-way-out-in-somalia.html\" title=\"\">Militant Islamists have been chased out</a>, thousands of expatriate Somalis are packing flights back, a new constitution has been passed and, on Monday, a new president will form the first functioning government since 1991. It is make or break time for Somalia, long seen as the world's most failed state.</p> <p>At present, Mogadishu is dystopia. Countless buildings lie pulverised as if by an angry giant, evocative of the ruins of Europe at the end of the second world war. A lone staircase floats where a building used to be; a formerly grand hotel is now a skeleton stripped bare; a cathedral stands with no roof and broken masonry in the nave; a series of beachside bars and restaurants resemble ancient ruins. Few walls are free of bulletholes or cracked and crumbling plaster. Roads are rutted and potholed, quickly flooding with rainwater, and stinking rubbish goes uncollected. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2012/jun/18/somali-mogadishu-vulnerable-progress\" title=\"\">Displaced people squat in domed tents amid the rubble</a>.Guns are everywhere.</p> <p>It is into this apocalyptic vision that the artists project. At a garage-cum-studio last week, their giant works were leaning against the walls. One diptych showed rodents with moneybags queuing up at \"the office of who you know\", then the happier scene of people with qualifications lining up at \"the office of what do you know\". A triptych portays a fallen young Somali rising from the ground and finally standing tall with the national flag.</p> <p>In the middle of the night, these works will be silently moved to prime locations in the city to make a public plea for justice, security and a national vision. The veteran artists are resurrecting a culture that was devastated 21 years ago when Somalia's government collapsed and warlords filled the vacuum.</p> <p>Ibrahim, 62, relaxing on a car seat on the floor (the car is long gone), learned to paint under an Italian mentor and was the official presidential portraitist. \"You had to try as much as possible to make him look more handsome and elegant,\" he recalled. \"You could not show his age.\"</p> <p>Hundreds of the portraits, and much of his other work, were lost in the chaos. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jan/31/shabaab-somalia-islamic-militia-refugees?INTCMP=ILCNETTXT3487\" title=\"\">Then came al-Shabaab</a>, bringing a semblance of order and youth appeal (it runs <a href=\"https://twitter.com/HSMPress\" title=\"\">a Twitter account</a>) but also a Taliban-like ban on TV, music, bras and depictions of humans and animals. These artists continued to draw in secret behind closed doors, however, and when <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/aug/07/somali-troops-mogadishu-rebels-out\" title=\"\">al-Shabaab was pushed out of Mogadishu by US-backed African Union forces</a> last year, the artists could return to the open. \"It was freedom for artists,\" Ibrahim said. \"We decided to work again.\"</p> <p>The old friends had been apart for years and were initially frightened of meeting again. They were helped by a parcel containing brushes, paints and other essential materials sent by a British benefactor. \"We were like children on Christmas day,\" said Adan Farah Affey, 50.</p> <p>The collective is now mentoring and teaching young people in a scheme run by Somalia's <a href=\"http://www.crdsomalia.org\" title=\"\">Centre for Research and Dialogue</a>. Affey hopes to develop Somalia's first ever art academy. Yet he used to be afraid of young people.</p> <p>\"Al-Shabaab used youth for recruitment,\" he added. \"A young guy can come and assassinate you. But I believe this project will stop them joining al-Shabaab because artists need to concentrate. It teaches them a way of life. If you are an artist, you need to be gentle and wise. You cannot kill yourself.\"</p> <p>Among the students is Suleyman Mohamed Yusuf, 20, who previously spent two years in a militia, collecting money at checkpoints and witnessing the killings of car passengers including children. \"At the checkpoint people were afraid of me,\" he recalled. \"You have a gun and you have the power. At that time I behaved as if I was the most powerful man in the city \u2013 I could capture the city.</p> <p>\"But I don't miss it because it was the wrong way because either you kill or be killed. Neither has any benefit for you. I've seen many troubles and I do not want to see them again.\"</p> <p>Describing the artists, Yusuf added: \"These are the only guys I admire. I've never seen people like this.\"</p> <p>The Centre, a thinktank working for reconciliation, is headed by Jabril Ibrahim Abdulle, 42, who lost his entire family in the civil war. It is running other youth projects including a My Mogadishu photography group \u2013 \"instead of shooting an AK47, they shoot a camera\" \u2013 a system for awarding grants and even a Somali Idols talent contest.</p> <p>Jabril Abdulle argues that young people, who make up the majority of the population, will decide Somalia's fate. \"The new constitution doesn't mention youth. There's no one consulting them. That's why al-Shabaab happened: they even took the name 'youth' [shabaab]. They did what the government is supposed to do in terms of reaching young people. They recruited people from the diaspora via Facebook to come and blow themselves up. It was a silent killer and no one was paying attention.\"</p> <p>Jabril Abdulle reckons there have been \"four or five\" assassination attempts against him. He was at the national theatre <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/apr/04/somalia-theatre-suicide-bombing-shabaab\" title=\"\">when a suicide bomber struck earlier this year</a>; giving up his seat to elders, until he was at the end of the row, saved his life. He speaks to the Guardian a day after the director of the international airport was gunned down on his way to breakfast.</p> <p>Yet the defeat of al-Shabaab in Mogadishu, and the peace \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/02/somali-comic-marshale-death-threat\" title=\"\">a relative term</a> \u2013 that has followed, offer a sliver of hope. Boys can be seen <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/nov/06/somalians-revel-mogadishu-safe-beaches\" title=\"\">kicking footballs on the beach again</a>,</p> <p>the fish market is thriving and new shop fronts include Mogadishu's first dry cleaner for two decades. The city hums with crammed minibus taxis, land cruisers with darkened windows and saloon cars that have seen better days \u2013 a bustle unthinkable amid the bullets and mortars just a year ago.</p> <p>\"For the first time in Somalia, something is happening,\" Jabril Abdulle said. \"People are saying we shall not rely on the government; what you see in Mogadishu is nothing to do with the government. People are saying enough is enough. About 150 buildings here are being renovated. Al-Shabaab will be defeated by the will and aspirations of the Somali people. They are really ready to move on.\"</p> <p>He estimates that 4,000-5,000 <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-19254249\" title=\"\">members of the Somalia diaspora</a> have been coming and going in the past three months, some bringing their children for the first time. But scarred by false dawns of the past, Jabril Abdulle warned: \"Something good is happening and I am scared. I don't want to lose it. We are on the edge. I can't say we're at a tipping point; we're at a pre-tipping point.\"</p> <p>The biggest hope, but also the biggest risk, comes on Monday when the weak transitional federal government is replaced by a president, prime minister, speaker and MPs elected by clan elders (Somalia is far from ready for a truly democratic election). The UN has already warned that the process is steeped in corruption; a parliamentary seat can reportedly be bought for $50,000 (\u00a331,832). Jabril Abdulle is wary of the fallout.</p> <p>\"You will have a lot of bad losers,\" he warned. \"They might not walk away. They might say, 'If I lose, everyone has to lose.' Somalia does not have a democratic tradition. There is a window of opportunity to engage the youth, but the possibility of returning to war is there. The value of an AK47 hasn't really gone down.\"</p> <p>The result could be a melee of warlords competing for power redolent of Afghanistan. Already, some say, there is an increase of checkpoints in Mogadishu in the absence of African Union forces, who are pursuing the battle with al-Shabaab elsewhere. Two militia groups are said to be competing for the spoils if and when al-Shabaab is driven out of its stronghold, the port city of Kismayu. Some analysts believe the writing is on the wall.</p> <p>One said: \"My feeling about the transition is that it's quite a lot of hot air and there are really significant challenges in the next six months. Poor Ugandans in the African Union forces are getting killed to create space for something but nobody's sure what it is.</p> <p>\"There's a danger it's going to give power to the people who were in control before 2006 and made Somalia a really shitty place. The rhetoric is that something new and beautiful is being built, but I'm not sure I believe it.\"</p>"

My first priority is and will always be the student-athletes and doing what is best for the program and the university.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Gundy has come under criticism since a Tuesday conference call with reporters where he said he hoped to have the team return to the on-campus football facilities on 1 May, in defiance of federal social-distancing guidelines. He said the the media has been overly negative in its coverage of what he called the \u201cChinese virus and added that if one of his players or coaches were to test positive after then, they would be \u201cquarantined just like we do people that get the flu\u201d.</p> \n  <p>\u201cWe get people that get the flu during the season, we quarantine them, we treat them, we make sure they\u2019re healthy, we bring \u2018em back,\u201d Gundy said. \u201cIt would be the same thing here, but at some point, we\u2019ve got to go back to work. We\u2019ve got to get these guys back in here. ... From what I read, the healthy people can fight this, the antibodies make it better. They\u2019re doing some blood transplants now with the people that have already gotten the disease, that have gotten over it that have the antibodies that can fight it. There\u2019s a lot of people who can figure this out. May 1\u2019s our goal. Don\u2019t know if it will happen. Players will come in after that.\u201d</p> \n  <p>The remarks prompted a swift statement from the university, which said: \u201cWe will adhere to the advice of public health experts who are making informed decisions in the best interest of the citizens of our nation and state based on sound scientific data.\u201d</p> \n  <p>It\u2019s not the first time Gundy, whose annual salary is $5.13m, has whipped up controversy over his right-wing views. But USA Today\u2019s Dan Wolken made a salient point <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/columnist/dan-wolken/2020/04/07/oklahoma-state-coach-mike-gundy-coronavirus-comments/2966225001/\">in a Wednesday op-ed</a> that Gundy\u2019s political ideology is immaterial:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Hey, according to \u201cDr. Gundy,\u201d what\u2019s the harm in 18-, 19-, 20-, 21-year-olds possibly getting exposed to coronavirus? If they\u2019re healthy, it\u2019s all good, right? At any rate, we\u2019ve got to get moving, Gundy suggested, because paying salaries and \u201ccontinuing the economy in this state\u201d relies on the bodies of unpaid amateurs and people will \u201cfeel better\u201d watching football on TV.</p> \n   <p>Herd immunity, right? That\u2019s actually what Dr. Gundy was getting at. In fact, he referred to players as \u201cthe herd of healthy people\u201d who can fight the virus, even though that is, uh, not exactly the way any of this works. </p> \n   <p>None of this should be a surprise. Gundy has been edging toward the cliff of absurdity for a while now. In November 2018, he blamed \u201cliberalism\u201d for players transferring, saying \u201cI\u2019m a firm believer in the snowflake.\u201d He acknowledged Tuesday he\u2019s getting a lot of his information these days from the ultra-conservative One America News Network, an outlet he described as objective and non-political despite its history of pushing debunked right-wing conspiracy theories related to the murder of Seth Rich, and Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting survivor David Hogg.</p> \n   <p>But this isn\u2019t really about Gundy\u2019s political ideology or his sources of information. It\u2019s about him saying the quiet part out loud regarding how many college coaches view their players.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-11T22:17:48.787Z\">at 11.17pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e92312a8f08db3109f20e00\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-11T21:10:54.485Z\">10.10pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Arkansas senator Tom Cotton, who <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/17/business/media/coronavirus-tom-cotton-china.html\">floated a conspiracy theory</a> which said the Chinese government created Covid-19 in a weapons lab <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/11/republican-tom-cotton-coronavirus-china\">claimed on Saturday</a> that \u201ccommon sense has been my guide\u201d since he first learned of the outbreak in mid-January.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>\u201cNot Chinese communist lies.

  "<p>A democratic socialist, Senator Bernie Sanders\u2019 campaign amplified and projected ideas that radical grassroots organizers have been demanding for centuries in this country. His surrogates gave fiery, mesmerizing speeches at rallies that featured crowds larger than 25,000. Now, he has suspended his presidential campaign. This was his second run for the Oval Office.</p> <p>Sanders\u2019 political outsider savviness was his strength and weakness. He was sometimes criticized for not having specific plans for black people. I agree with a more nuanced version of this claim: Sanders did not demonstrate how he would prevent racism from impeding the universal programs that would help black people. While disappointing and warranted, his shortcoming mostly provided an easy cover for liberals to undermine his political ascension. Former vice-president Joe Biden authored a devastating crime bill that increased policing and mass incarceration, but that was smoothed away with his \u201cWe Know Joe\u201d slogan aimed at black communities. The California senator Kamala Harris laughed about threatening to prosecute poor black mothers for school absenteeism, but also made punchy race soundbites during debates that went viral. Even the Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren\u2019s defense of capitalism and neoliberal ideas was obscured by her larger pronouncements to protect black women in hospitals and the workplace \u2013 bastions of capitalist exploitation. But Sanders\u2019 wise refusal to pander to black voters manifested in a perhaps unwise polar extreme: an unarticulated specific response to black plight.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/08/bernie-sanders-revolution-not-over\">Bernie Sanders\u2019 political revolution is not over | Bhaskar Sunkara</a> </p> </aside>  <p>When he flew to Michigan instead of where he was scheduled to speak in Jackson, Mississippi, headlines emerged that Sanders <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/05/us/politics/bernie-sanders-democratic-primary.html\">ceded the south </a>\u2013 meaning black voters \u2013 to Biden. He did not give a race speech in Detroit, but instead passed the microphone to black organizers to talk about their own issues. The day before his campaign suspension he talked about black voters, the coronavirus and the need for a targeted response in a virtual town hall.</p> <p>Nonetheless, Sanders had the most progressive presidential campaign in recent memory. By far, he had the enthusiasm and support of black people under 50, and was polling higher than Biden among black people as recently as <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/14/opinion/bernie-sanders-black-voters.html\">late February</a>. Free college and complete student debt cancellation could have decreased the wealth gap for all people, but for black students in particular because they disproportionately carry high debt loads. Medicare for All could have decreased future generations\u2019 prospects of facing pre-existing conditions and increased their health outcomes. Ending wars would have reduced the United States\u2019 militarism and slowed down the armed services from recruiting this country\u2019s poorest people. Vulnerable, dispossessed and oppressed communities in the United States and abroad would have experienced a significant improvement in their quality of life. Unhoused people would have entered homes and billionaires entered political homelessness. And when Biden went <a href=\"https://jacobinmag.com/2020/03/joe-biden-coronavirus-pandemic-presidential-campaign\">virtually absent</a> during the Covi-19 panic, Sanders shifted his campaign to a multimillion-dollar relief effort.</p> <p>Sanders\u2019 supporters now face a nearly impossible situation. For years, politicians and pundits asserted that Sanders is not a \u201creal Democrat\u201d. Those same critics now expect Sanders supporters to \u201cvote blue no matter who\u201d, regardless of being independent voters. If Biden loses to Donald Trump, then Sanders\u2019 supporters will be blamed for failing to fall in line. If Biden wins, the Democratic party will resist any transformational concessions to the party\u2019s left voters. We must not let them.</p> <p>If Sanders is right about losing the electability argument but winning the ideological one, then that\u2019s where his supporters must continue organizing if Biden wants their vote. Rather than \u201cvote blue no matter who\u201d, we must vote green for our planet, and brown and black for our people \u2013 and make demands on Biden that will fundamentally change this country. I do not expect Biden to become a socialist overnight, nor can he expect Sanders supporters to wake up neoliberal capitalists. Thus, Biden supporters should be putting pressure on <em>him</em> to change instead of threatening millions of other voters with a Trump card.</p> <p>As an alternative to using social media to express #NeverBiden, individual progressive voters might join or support coalitions that are using a collective and organized process to put pressure on the vice-president to agree to universal healthcare, a moratorium on deportations, and to overhaul his climate change plan. And instead of shaming protest voters who refuse to participate in this fragile election, Democrats should examine why their party fails to inspire millions of people they claim to represent.</p> <p>We must not vote like our lives depend on it. Biden must change because our planet depends on it.</p> <ul> <li><p>Derecka Purnell is a Guardian US columnist</p></li> </ul>",
  "<p>I\u2019m heading to the White House in the middle of a global pandemic \u2013 not a phrase I ever imagined writing when I was a schoolboy in Britain thinking about a career in journalism. Downtown Washington resembles a deserted film set these days, most of its famed monuments and museums closed. At the White House gates a white tent has been set up; a medical worker zaps me with a device that takes my temperature and gives me the all clear.</p> <p>After passing through security, I arrive at the West Wing briefing room, usually bustling like a railway station, but now sparsely populated by journalists, some wearing face masks.</p> <p>My temperature is taken again and I sit down, several seats apart from the other reporters. When Donald Trump and his team emerge stage right, they seem less worried than us about physical distancing (yet the US president has twice been tested, with negative results, for coronavirus).</p> <p>America has the greatest number of coronavirus cases in the world. It is a public health crisis, an economic crisis and \u2013 this is where we in Washington come in \u2013 a crisis of leadership. Trump, a property developer and reality TV star, was the first US president elected with no prior military or political experience. It was all a bit of a lark. Well, we\u2019re not laughing now. He is the man in charge of America in its biggest emergency since the second world war. And it seems that history\u2019s verdict will be unforgiving: he is not up to the job.</p> <p>I watch most of his daily coronavirus taskforce briefings, which sometimes run for more than two hours, from home (grateful for TV and steady broadband, though not always easy with two boisterous children) but get to go along about once a week <a href=\"https://twitter.com/cspan/status/1242234983516966912?s=20\">and ask questions.</a> Up close, the president\u2019s stature (he is 6ft 3in), blond mat of hair and peachy face afford a certain perverse charisma.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>This is the closest any of us will get to the court of George III, with its mix of awesome power and terrifying capriciousness</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I was there one evening when, defying medical advice, Trump talked baldly about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/24/trumps-push-to-shorten-the-coronavirus-shutdown-proves-the-captain-is-flying-blind\">reopening the economy by Easter.</a> It was just a little scary, this realisation that the most powerful person in the world is unhinged \u2013 the closest any of us will get to the court of King George III with its mix of awesome power and terrifying capriciousness. Fortunately, on that occasion, Trump eventually bowed to the experts and kept the physical distancing guidelines in place until the end of April.</p> <p>It\u2019s also a presidential election year. Trump can no longer hold campaign rallies with big crowds. He has turned <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/24/donald-trump-coronavirus-briefings-2020-campaign-rallies\">the daily briefings into a substitute,</a> still airing grievances, spinning untruths, bullying reporters and narcissistically promoting his favourite brand: himself. \u201cI have, you know, hundreds of millions of people,\u201d he mused on April Fools\u2019 Day. \u201cNumber one on Facebook. Did you know I was number one on Facebook? I mean, I just found out I\u2019m number one on Facebook. I thought that was very nice, for whatever it means.\u201d</p> <p>The wartime president Harry Truman kept a sign on his desk that said: <a href=\"https://www.trumanlibrary.gov/education/trivia/buck-stops-here-sign\">\u201cThe buck stops here.\u201d</a> Trump adheres to the opposite view. Having downplayed the virus for so long \u2013 \u201cWhen you have 15 people, and the 15 within a couple of days is going to be down to close to zero, that\u2019s a pretty good job we\u2019ve done,\u201d he said on 26 February \u2013 and failed to prepare resources, he is now, extraordinarily, trying to sell a potential death toll of 100,000 Americans as a success. Even for this master of razzle-dazzle, it would be quite a magic trick.</p> <p>Typically, in times of national crisis, there is a default expectation that leaders will speak the truth, or mostly (let\u2019s not forget George W Bush\u2019s weapons of mass destruction). But with Trump that assumption no longer holds. His briefings would come with a government health warning were it not for the fact he is the government.</p> <p>Amid this confusing torrent of bluster, there are also medical experts dispensing genuine information, showing predictive models, urging people to maintain physical distancing, advising on the wearing of face masks. It therefore becomes an intensive exercise in trying to sift fact from fiction.</p> <p>American TV networks are having a lively debate about this. Should they show the broadcasts with a 30-second delay to allow fact-checking interventions? Should they show them at all? Increasingly, some are issuing disclaimers at the start and cutting away before the end.</p> <p>At the Guardian our rolling coverage of the briefings includes real-time fact-checking from a team of reporters. It is important not to allow Trump\u2019s baseless claims, for example his pushing of an unproven drug, to hang in the air unchallenged. Our reporting is determined to hold the powerful to account. What did the president know and when did he know it? And why didn\u2019t he act?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"155dbfdd144dcccf97364d2037d043681c5299c1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/155dbfdd144dcccf97364d2037d043681c5299c1/0_0_6720_4032/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A deserted street in Washington DC during the lockdown.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A deserted street in Washington DC during the lockdown.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Anadolu Agency/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For example, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/28/trump-coronavirus-politics-us-health-disaster\">one article explored</a> how it could be that the first confirmed cases of Covid-19 were reported in South Korea and the US on the same day \u2013 20 January \u2013 yet one country took swift action to curb the outbreak while the other is still lurching towards catastrophe. Jeremy Konyndyk, who used to lead the government\u2019s response to international disasters at USAid, told the Guardian: \u201cWe are witnessing in the United States one of the greatest failures of basic governance and basic leadership in modern times.\u201d</p> <p>For a journalist, this most peculiar presidency already felt like the story of a lifetime. Now it has collided head-on with another story of a lifetime. But day by day, I am also witnessing the unfolding of an American tragedy. For three years, Trump thought he could define events.

Globally women represent more than 70 per cent of all health care workers and in the home, women are predominantly the carers of the elderly, people with disabilities and children.

From the letter:</p> \n  <blockquote> \n   <p>\u201cLaunch a nationwide public service campaign to educate consumers about common scams targeting the economically vulnerable. Over the next several weeks, most consumers will receive checks of $1,200 or more because of the recently enacted Cares Act. Scammers are already defrauding consumers by claiming they can expedite the receipt of these funds. The FTC and IRS should dramatically increase their efforts to educate consumers about these scams, and the Department of Justice should prioritize investigation and prosecution of the criminals behind them.\u201d</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-10T20:45:33.561Z\">at 9.45pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e90d2758f081a236f1916c5\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/mario-koran\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-10T20:09:50.220Z\">9.09pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>About 74 miles of city streets <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/10/oakland-california-slow-streets-coronavirus-us\">will be blocked off</a> for joggers and bikers to enjoy for Easter weekend after Libby Schaaf, the mayor of Oakland, California, announced a \u201cslow streets initiative\u201d.</p> \n  <p>The move will give residents a way to get outdoors at a time when the record number of visitors who flocked to beaches and parks prompted officials to close popular recreational spots. </p> \n  <p>\u201cBecause of the reduction in car traffic, we will be closing off a number of streets so that bicyclists and pedestrians can spread out and take in fresh air safely on Oakland streets, free of cars,\u201d Schaaf said Thursday.

The weekend long curfew, the first of its kind within the United States geographical borders, will be enforced by tribal police, who have been authorized to sanction violators with a fine of up to $1000 and/or 30 days in jail. Essential workers such as medical staff are exempt, but must carry a letter from their employer. </p> \n  <p>On Thursday, Navajo president <strong>Jonathan Nez</strong> and vice-president <strong>Myron Lizer</strong>, announced that they were going into self-quarantine after recently coming into contact with a first responder who later tested positive for the virus. \u201cThis is real and no-one is immune from contracting the virus. We will continue to fight for our people as we self-quarantine - this is a precautionary measure,\u201d said Nez during an online town hall meeting. </p> \n  <p>The Navajo government was quick to implement prevention and mitigation measures after reporting its first case on 17 March, in an effort to minimize spread through its vast territory which stretches over parts of Arizona, New Mexico and Utah. This included issuing a stay at home order just two days after California, followed by an 8pm to 5am curfew. But, the virus is spreading rapidly with 558 confirmed cases including 20 deaths as of Thursday 9 April. </p> \n  <p>Last month, the US federal government approved $8bn for native communities and tribal services in its third coronavirus rescue package, but tribal leaders fear that they won\u2019t see the money until summer due to red tape and paperwork.

  "<p>It was a moment made for live cable TV. Andrew Cuomo, the governor of New York state, warned on CNN on Wednesday night that coronavirus was \u201chere, it\u2019s much more prevalent than we know, you\u2019re going to see the numbers go sky high \u2013 and if the American people aren\u2019t ready for it, we are going to have a problem\u201d.</p> \n<p>Suddenly, CNN\u2019s primetime anchor, Cuomo\u2019s younger brother Chris, butted in. You could see the frown of disapproval flit across big brother\u2019s face: what was the youngster doing interrupting him like that?</p> \n<p>\u201cHold on,\u201d said Chris Cuomo, who was being fed information via his earpiece. \u201cThis is happening in real-time. The NBA has just suspended its season.\u201d</p> \n<p>There it was.</p> \n<p>The magnitude of the coronavirus threat to America, this invisible danger that nobody appears able to quantify or fully comprehend, came into blazing view. It was written across the brows of the Cuomo brothers, their split-screen expressions unified in utter disbelief that the basketball season, that national sporting institution, was off.</p> \n<p>The US has finally woken to the uncomfortable truth \u2013 this is happening. And it\u2019s happening in a country of 327 million people who are in varying degrees overwhelmingly, totally, largely or partially not ready for it.</p> \n<p>To adopt Governor Cuomo\u2019s words: America, we have a problem.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"2cbb7e6cd16edbbdac5c941e211da948d67fd24d\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2cbb7e6cd16edbbdac5c941e211da948d67fd24d/0_0_3408_2272/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Workers clean a subway station in Brooklyn as New York City confronts the coronavirus outbreak on March 11, 2020 in New York City.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Workers clean a subway station in Brooklyn as New York City confronts the coronavirus outbreak.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Spencer Platt/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>There have memorably been two occasions in the past century when the United States has declared itself to be under attack on domestic territory: Pearl Harbor and 9/11. Now a third onslaught is under way on American soil and no amount of xenophobic rebranding by Donald Trump, who in his Oval Office address this week cast the disease as the \u201cforeign virus\u201d, will alter that fact.</p> \n<p>Even before the virus has taken hold in communities and cities across the country, it has been preceded by two other contagions \u2013 confusion and fear.</p> \n<p>You can see those twin pestilences sprouting furiously on both US coasts. In Bend, Oregon, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/rebecca_mehra/status/1237891575897718791\">Rebecca Mehra</a>, a professional runner, related on Twitter how on her way to shop for groceries she heard a woman call to her from a car parked outside the store.</p> \n<p>The woman and her husband, both in their 80s, had been sitting in the vehicle for almost an hour, afraid to go inside for fear of exposing themselves to the virus yet unable to go home as they were running out of supplies. Mehra said the woman was \u201cnearly in tears\u201d.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"5b86d89c-98d6-4d80-ba4b-9c7affda275f\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/NezEbDx4B9A?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Over on the east coast there was another small glimpse into huge social changes.

For everyone\u2019s safety, all dinners [sic], vendors, and courier personnel\u2019s body temperature will be verified upon entry.\u201d</p> \n<p>Was this some distasteful practical joke? \u201cOh no, we are totally doing it,\u201d one of the managers assured the Guardian. \u201cWe use a laser thermometer to take people\u2019s temperatures so we don\u2019t have to touch them.\u201d</p> \n<p>When the Guardian asked whether at some point Sushi Katsuei might have to close its doors to the public, the manager replied: \u201cThat\u2019s a silly question, this isn\u2019t Chinatown.\u201d</p> \n<p>Chinatown. Therein lies another part of the coronavirus story unfolding across this vast nation. Some of the best-known restaurants in Manhattan\u2019s Chinatown, which barely three weeks ago had lines of diners stretching around the block, are now virtually empty.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"e981b4f540904fd70cf8fb3552ce8461b4f69c74\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e981b4f540904fd70cf8fb3552ce8461b4f69c74/0_0_3500_2333/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A woman wearing a face mask walks through the Chinatown section of San Francisco, California, U.S., February 26, 2020.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A woman wearing a face mask walks through the Chinatown section of San Francisco, California, on 26 February.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Shannon Stapleton/Reuters</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>In <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/coronavirus-chinatown-flushing-queens-new-york-city-2020-3\">Flushing, Queens</a>, home to one of the largest ethnic Chinese populations outside Asia, food courts and restaurants are also deserted.</p> \n<p>What began as anecdotal and random examples of mounting distress have exploded this week into a nationwide phenomenon, visible for all to see.</p> \n<p>In Oklahoma, a staunch <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/elections/2016/results/oklahoma\">Trump-supporting</a> state, surreal events unfolded in Oklahoma City around the same time as Trump was making his televised address.

By the end of Thursday, the rush to batten down the hatches was so intense it seemed that all of America, the country founded upon visions of openness and freedom, was closing down.</p> \n<p>After the NBA came the MLS (soccer), NHL (ice hockey) and MLB (baseball) postponing their seasons.

  "<p>How is US Soccer going to get itself out of this mess?</p> <p>While the new coronavirus is upending much of the sports world, US Soccer has been unraveled by its own sexism and arrogance, culminating Thursday <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/mar/13/carlos-cordeiro-quits-us-soccer-federation-after-row-over-female-players\">in the sudden resignation of the federation\u2019s president</a>, Carlos Cordeiro.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/mar/13/carlos-cordeiro-quits-us-soccer-federation-after-row-over-female-players\">Carlos Cordeiro quits US Soccer Federation after row over female players</a> </p> </aside>  <p>US Soccer\u2019s latest misstep? An appalling admission in legal filings that the federation views its female athletes as inherently inferior to their male counterparts.</p> <p>In response to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/mar/08/usa-womens-team-sues-us-soccer-pay-equality\">the wage discrimination lawsuit</a> filed by the US women\u2019s national team, the federation argued Monday that women have less \u201cability\u201d than men because ability is based on \u201cthe level of certain physical attributes, such as speed and strength\u201d. The federation\u2019s male attorney went on to write that playing for the men\u2019s team \u201crequires a higher level of skill\u201d and it wasn\u2019t \u201ca sexist stereotype\u201d but \u201cindisputable science\u201d.</p> <p>In other words, US Soccer tried to justify paying women less based on the same misogyny spewed by Twitter trolls to demean female athletes every day. Of all the ways US Soccer could\u2019ve defended itself, it chose to say the women don\u2019t deserve equal pay because they aren\u2019t equal.</p> <p>The criticism was swift. First it was former players, such as Heather O\u2019Reilly, who wrote that \u201cto read that US Soccer thinks this of the USWNT and female athletes in general is disgusting and disturbing to me\u201d. Then came the sponsors, with Coca-Cola, Visa, Deloitte and Budweiser calling it \u201cunacceptable\u201d and \u201coffensive\u201d. The players on the USWNT engaged in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/mar/12/uswnt-protest-equal-pay-shebelieves-cup\">a silent protest before a game Wednesday night</a>.</p> <p>There\u2019s never a good time to weaponize misogyny and demean women everywhere, but the timing perfectly illustrated the way US Soccer has historically wanted to have it both ways, patting itself on the back for its support of women while quietly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/feb/21/jill-ellis-uswnt-salary-womens-world-cup-soccer\">applying double standards in other ways</a>. The sexist legal filing came amid the SheBelieves Cup and the SheBelieves Summit, the federation\u2019s attempt to promote female empowerment.</p> <p>That\u2019s why Cordeiro\u2019s resignation, as necessary as it may have been, does little to fix anything.</p> <p>US Soccer\u2019s unconscionable legal strategy was not Cordeiro\u2019s doing, and it wasn\u2019t something that emerged for the first time this week. It was a strategy presumably executed at the direction of several high-ranking officials at US Soccer. Megan Rapinoe said the team long felt an \u201cundercurrent\u201d of disrespect from their boss but the legal filing just proved it.</p> <p>Federation lawyers last year grilled Carli Lloyd and Alex Morgan in depositions about whether they could beat boys at soccer. At one point, an attorney asked: \u201cDo you think you could be competitive against the senior men\u2019s national team?\u201d to which Lloyd replied: \u201cShall we fight it out to see who wins and then we get paid more?\u201d</p> <p>Other employees and board members who remain at US Soccer knew exactly the federation\u2019s legal counsel was doing and apparently thought it was a fine strategy. The months-long process of building a legal defense doesn\u2019t occur in a vacuum.</p> <p>To be clear, US Soccer <em>does</em> support its women\u2019s team better than perhaps any other federation in the world does. In some ways, the USWNT\u2019s continued success is a product of that support and investment.</p> <p>But the federation\u2019s attitude that the women ought to be thankful for whatever they get is nothing new \u2013 that\u2019s what the federation said back in the 1990s, when <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/National-Team-Updated-Expanded-Changed/dp/1419743015/\">the women were paid $10 per day</a> and had to work side jobs to support their love of their sport.</p> <p>US Soccer is an organization that is, in some ways, entrenched in what it was when the USWNT first started in 1985 and the players <a href=\"https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/the-national-team-caitlin-murray/1130471569?ean=9781419743016#/\">wore hand-me-down men\u2019s jerseys</a>. It\u2019s grown massively over the years into an entity that employs hundreds of full-time and part-time staff and will spend around $143m this year on operations. But that growth has just been added onto what US Soccer always been and how it\u2019s always done things, with its most influential figures also some of its longest-tenured.</p> <p>There was hope that with Cordeiro at the helm that could start to change. In the past year, longtime CEO Dan Flynn stepped down, followed by string-puller CMO Jay Berhalter. Kate Markgraf, who hadn\u2019t been afraid to criticize the federation <a href=\"https://www.foyles.co.uk/witem/sport-hobbies/the-national-team-the-inside-story-of-t,caitlin-murray-9781419734496\">in the past</a>, was hired as the GM for women\u2019s programming.</p> <p>But since Cordeiro took over in 2018 from former president Sunil Gulati, who didn\u2019t run for re-election after the US men <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/oct/10/usa-trinidad-and-tobago-world-cup-2018-qualifier-soccer\">failed to qualify for the World Cup</a>, reforms have been slow and tepid. Cordeiro, as well-intentioned as he may have been, appeared too eager to defer to the expertise of the people around him \u2013 many of the same people who had been at the federation far too long and were resistant to change.</p> <p>The federation has made efforts to <a href=\"https://sports.yahoo.com/reforms-planned-after-internal-criticism-leads-to-wake-up-call-for-us-soccer-183357300.html\">boost morale at US Soccer House</a>, but the mess of the past week surely tanked it again. After all, every woman there must have heard what US Soccer thinks of them \u2013 and what kind of man wants to work at an organization labeled as sexist?</p> <p>Now, the VP candidate that sources say Cordeiro favored, Cindy Parlow Cone, has abruptly been thrown into the president role. Parlow Cone, a former USWNT midfielder, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/caitlinmurr/status/1238156875893366785\">spoke out publicly</a> against US Soccer\u2019s sexist legal strategy hours before Cordeiro resigned, calling it \u201ctroubling\u201d. Now, she\u2019ll be at the helm until February 2021, when someone else can be elected to take over Cordeiro\u2019s term, and she\u2019ll serve as US Soccer\u2019s first female president.</p> <p>There\u2019s not a question of Parlow Cone\u2019s capabilities but of how much she\u2019ll embrace the job at a time when the federation lacks direction and leadership. The presidential position is unpaid but heavily involved \u2013 another sign that US Soccer has failed to evolve past its quaint beginnings \u2013 and the volunteer VP role she signed up for was very much part-time.</p> <p>What US Soccer needs is a much larger overhaul. Heather O\u2019Reilly, who was on the Athlete Council that voted for Cordeiro, said US Soccer should go through \u201ca lengthy process of reorganization\u201d. She\u2019s right, but the federation has resisted it for this long \u2013 why should anything change now?</p> <p>Maybe, just maybe, the situation is dire enough that now is the time for true reform and a shift in culture. After all, it\u2019s hard to imagine it can get any worse.</p>",
  "<p>Ekene Okonkwo studies political science, advocates for gun control and reproductive rights, and is voting in a presidential election for the first time this year. But only if she can vote for Bernie Sanders.</p> \n<p>The 19-year-old, who studies political science and lives in the Bronx, said the Vermont senator is the only candidate she trusts to deal with the issues she cares most about \u2013 on climate change, for instance, she called former vice-president Joe Biden\u2019s plan \u201cunfeasible\u201d.

She is part of a loosely connected but vocal group, sometimes uniting under hashtags like #BernieorBust or #NeverBiden who say they will not vote for Biden if he wins the nomination. While it\u2019s nearly impossible to know how large the group is, hundreds of people have shared this sentiment, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/anthonyvclark20\">including</a> progressive political candidates.</p> \n<p>It may be impossible to quantify their number, but not their influence. Those Democrats who will not yield to a moderate and vote for Biden if he wins the nomination are the same group who are sometimes blamed for Donald Trump\u2019s victory in 2016 when disappointed Sanders fans sat out the general election.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6c92bd2584465722667c6f0071aa9b18002720e0\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6c92bd2584465722667c6f0071aa9b18002720e0/0_0_5760_3840/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bernie Sanders supporters at a campaign rally in Richmond, Virginia, on 27 February.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bernie Sanders supporters at a campaign rally in Richmond, Virginia, on 27 February.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Zach Gibson/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>And the past few weeks have been hard to swallow for Sanders fans. After a strong early showing in Iowa, Nevada and New Hampshire his star faded on Super Tuesday. Supporters were left disappointed again this week when he lost to Biden in Michigan, where he edged out Hillary Clinton in 2016. This poor performance is partly due to an unexpectedly weak youth vote \u2013 despite Sanders\u2019 vaunted ability to mobilise younger Americans.</p> \n<p>As the Sanders campaign reckons with the fallout, and former Democratic candidates <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/biden-builds-moderate-coalition-collecting-endorsements-2020-candidates/story?id=69442331\">rush to endorse Biden</a><strong>,</strong> the #BernieorBust fans are grappling with a repeat of 2016. It\u2019s hard to tell how their decision could affect the election, but in 2016, a similar group of people who boycotted Hillary Clinton on election day contributed to her loss in swing states like Florida, where <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/elections/2016/results/florida\">more than</a> 200,000 people voted for candidates from outside the two major parties, such as Gary Johnson or Jill Stein.</p> \n<p>\u201cIf you distrust something, you are more likely to opt out of it,\u201d said Rashawn Ray, a governance fellow at the Brookings Institution. And Sanders supporters don\u2019t trust the Democratic party. \u201cThey think its political sabotage, and not allowing Bernie to have a fair shot. So what do people do? They opt out.\u201d</p> \n<p>Martha Baez, a 54-year-old who works in finance, is one of those voters. She is registered as an independent and voted for Jill Stein in 2016. \u201cThere was failure in getting me out to the polls with the \u2018lesser of two evils\u2019 theory\u201d, she said of the argument that whatever Clinton\u2019s perceived flaws, she was better than Trump.</p> \n<p>This year, Baez is planning to vote for Sanders in the New York primary, and will not vote for Biden if he is the nominee in November.<strong> </strong>But she said her real issue was not with the specific candidate, but losing trust in the Democratic party. \u201cI don\u2019t think that I should put aside my values and vote out of fear,\u201d she said. \u201cThe DNC needs an overhaul, it lacks values, real leaders that represent the people not its donors.\u201d</p> \n<p>The impact on the supreme court or other policies, she said, was not her responsibility.</p> \n<p>\u201cWhy is that my problem?\u201d she said. \u201cShouldn\u2019t it have been considered before selecting the \u2018chosen one\u2019? Will they try and flip the script and make it my issue or fault?\u201d</p> \n<p>Jessica Wright, an avid Sanders supporter in east Texas, tweeted that she was #BernieorBust after his Super Tuesday defeat in her state. She said she was angry that other Democratic candidates had dropped out just before the big primary day to endorse Joe Biden, and wanted the \u201cso-called Democratic establishment\u201d to know they were letting down people like her.</p> \n<p>Wright, 37, works at a hospital and said she and her husband live paycheck to paycheck. She said Sanders\u2019 policies would be the best for her family, including family members married to immigrants struggling to gain citizenship status in the US. But given that a Trump election could be worse, and herald new conservative court appointees and other harmful policies, she is still considering voting for Biden, or at the very least, voting down ballot in other, non-presidential races on election day.</p> \n<p>\u201cFor me not voting would be to send a message: what you\u2019ve done is not OK,\u201d Wright said. \u201cI wish there was a way to vote for [Biden] and still send that message.\u201d</p> \n<p>Stephen Ansolabehere, a Harvard government professor who studies political campaigns, said there is a similar \u201csour grapes\u201d group during every election, even if it\u2019s not a big enough group to swing the result. But he said what determines whether or not Sanders supporters will show up for Biden depends on how the latter treats them in the coming months.</p> \n<p>\u201cWhen you lose [your candidate] it\u2019s like a death in the family,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s the bitterness of the emotions. Biden knows that bitterness so he could be empathetic and bring those people back to the fold.\u201d He gave the example of the 1988 Democratic primary, when frontrunner Michael Dukakis <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1988/06/26/us/democrats-agree-on-rules-to-select-nominee-in-1992.html\">reached a compromise</a> with his opponent Jesse Jackson by changing party rules to tie the delegate vote more closely to the popular vote, giving Jackson a partial victory.</p> \n<p>Ansolabehere also pointed out that Sanders\u2019 progressive movement relies heavily on young people going to the polls. But even if they are politically engaged, this subset of voters consistently deals with more hurdles to register to vote because of restrictive voting policies around address changes and identification. In New Hampshire, for example, a Republican-backed law <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/dec/05/new-hampshire-2020-election-student-vote\">requires</a> that many young voters have a driver\u2019s license to vote.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s hard to organize a campaign around younger generations,\u201d Ansolabehere said. \u201cYou only have 50% chance of being registered when you\u2019re 18 years old.\u201d And that could have played a role during Super Tuesday, when youth turnout (ages 18 to 29) was only an <a href=\"http://circle.tufts.edu/latest-research/super-tuesday-2020\">estimate</a>d 14% in Virginia, and 5% in Tennessee, according to a Tufts University exit poll.</p> \n<p>Ray also said \u201cvoter suppression is alive and well\u201d and probably affected turnout for Sanders. But he said that the group that is more likely to determine the election is the 11% of white voters, mostly suburban and often women, who <a href=\"http://centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/articles/just-how-many-obama-2012-trump-2016-voters-were-there/\">switched</a> from Barack Obama in 2012 to Trump in the last election.</p> \n<p>For Sanders\u2019 supporters, these obstacles only drive home the frustration around an election system that they say works against their candidate.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"a381fa53-24c1-46a8-a648-7710acb74a3a\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/K30TgRppDzg?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Habiba Choudhary, a Sanders supporter who was canvassing in Michigan, saw the long polling station lines firsthand on Tuesday in Sanders-friendly communities like Dearborn and perceived this as a way to rig the election in favor of Biden. The New York-based 28-year-old, who identifies with the #BernieorBust movement, said the senator\u2019s message resonated with her family<strong>,</strong> Bangladeshi immigrants who share a one-bedroom apartment in Queens.</p> \n<p>Sanders seemed to be the only candidate whose policies could ease the plight of her father, a taxi driver dealing with healthcare issues, and her sister, who is straining to pay back student loans. \u201cEnough is enough \u2013 we tried the neoliberalism and we\u2019re sick and tired of it,\u201d she said. \u201c[Sanders] gave me and other people that voice.\u201d</p> \n<p>Nevertheless, Choudhary said, she would follow Sanders\u2019 lead when it came to voting in November. In 2016, the senator accepted defeat after the primary, and went on to endorse Hillary Clinton in the presidential election.</p> \n<p>\u201cI know Bernie is super consistent,\u201d she said. \u201cHis supporters are gonna come out for Biden.\u201d</p> \n<p>\u2022 This article was amended on 17 March 2020. An earlier version said that Gary Johnson and Jill Stein were independent candidates in the 2016 election. In fact they represented the Libertarian Party and the Green Party, respectively.</p>",

On 26 February <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2020/feb/27/trump-says-coronavirus-spread-not-inevitable-video\">Donald Trump said that the US had 15 cases of the coronavirus</a>, and that \u201cthe 15 within a couple of days is going to be down to close to zero, that\u2019s a pretty good job we\u2019ve done.\u201d</p> \n  <p>It is now 15 days later, <a href=\"https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6\">the US has 1,312 cases</a>, and has seen 38 deaths. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/mar/11/nba-suspend-season-coronavirus\">The NBA season has been suspended</a>. Today\u2019s news is likely to be dominated by the administration\u2019s continued efforts to get on top of the crisis, and the fall-out from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/11/coronavirus-outbreak-us-trump-latest\">the sweeping travel ban for visitors from Europe</a> that Trump announced last night.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n   <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"bce7d1f1-9db5-47e1-b3ca-04ae6e48b596\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n    <div>\n     <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/xVLdDA6WWrA?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n    </div>\n   </gu-atom> \n  </figure> \n  <p>European markets, airline stocks and the pirce of oil have all tumbled after the announcement. It could be turbulent again when Wall Street opens this morning.</p> \n  <p>Somewhat ironically - the president will be busy greeting a guest from Europe this morning - Irish prime minister Leo Varadkar. Ireland is not covered by the ban. What Trump said in his address, and what has actually been written down in <a href=\"https://publicpool.kinja.com/subject-proclamation-suspension-of-entry-as-immigrants-1842280740\">Proclamation 9984</a> are slightly at odds. Here\u2019s an explainer of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/11/trump-coronavirus-europe-travel-suspended\">what it means</a> in practice.</p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/11/trump-coronavirus-europe-travel-suspended\">Trump's EU travel suspension explained: who is affected and will it help?</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n  <p>House Speaker Nancy Pelosi will be having her weekly press conference, then is hosting the annual Friends of Ireland luncheon, with Varadkar as a guest at 11.30am. </p> \n  <p>Democratic front runner Joe Biden will be in Wilmington, Delaware, at lunchtime, where he is expected to talk about the coronavirus pandemic.</p> \n  <p>We might also get some further administration reaction to the news that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/11/iraq-rocket-attack-americans-uk-soldier-dead\">two American service members were killed last night by a rocket attack</a> on a military base in Iraq.</p> \n </div> \n</div>"

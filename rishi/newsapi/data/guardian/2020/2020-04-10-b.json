  "<h2>Could the November election be delayed due to coronavirus?</h2> <p>The presidential vote is due to take place on 3 November. The date is set by federal law and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\">Donald Trump</a> has no power to delay it alone. That would require legislation enacted by Congress and signed by the president. Such an outcome still remains unthinkable to most. But many unthinkable events have unfolded recently.</p> <h2>Is Joe Biden the Democratic presidential nominee?</h2> <p>This week, the Vermont senator and democratic socialist Bernie Sanders <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/08/bernie-sanders-ends-2020-presidential-race\">suspended his campaign for president</a>, saying he couldn\u2019t see a path to the nomination. Sanders, who reshaped American politics with his youth-led movement for sweeping social change, was Biden\u2019s last rival in the field, which leaves the former vice-president, under Barack Obama, as the de facto Democratic candidate to challenge Trump.</p> <h2>Will Democratic primary elections still take place?</h2> <p>Despite the pandemic and the fact that the Democrats already have a de facto nominee, many states have not had their chance to cast their ballots. This week, despite widespread criticism and some late efforts by the governor to stop it, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/07/wisconsin-votes-controversial-election-coronavirus-us-election-2020\">Wisconsin still held in-person voting</a> in its primary, but most other states yet to vote have delayed theirs until June.</p> <h2>Why is Sanders staying on the Democratic primary ballot?</h2> <p>When Sanders suspended his campaign this week, he made it clear that <a href=\"https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2020/03/9540304/joe-biden-wins-bernie-sanders-women-voters\">he viewed Biden</a> as the party\u2019s de facto nominee. But that doesn\u2019t mean that Biden is automatically the official Democratic candidate \u2013 he still <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/22/us/politics/democratic-primary-dnc-superdelegates.html\">has to receive the party\u2019s nomination</a>, which happens at the Democratic national convention (now delayed from July to August). If Biden secures 1,991 pledged delegates at the DNC, which now seems likely, he will be the official nominee. Sanders has said he will stay on the ballot in states that are yet to hold their primaries, to continue to exert the influence of his leftist movement on the 2020 Democratic policy platform.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/10/trump-poll-numbers-dip-handling-coronavirus\">Trump's poll numbers dip over handling of coronavirus pandemic</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>How will the conventions work?</h2> <p>The Democratic national convention, where Biden, 77, is expected to be officially nominated as the party\u2019s presidential candidate, was due to be held in July in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, which, like most other US cities, is grappling with coronavirus. It has been delayed to August, a week before the Republican national convention, when Trump, then 74 years old, will be officially named his party\u2019s nominee after facing no serious challengers.</p> <h2>Will campaigning continue?</h2> <p>Media coverage that would normally be all about the race for the White House is dominated instead by an extraordinary public health and economic crisis, with the US <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2020/04/01/coronavirus-latest-news/\">death toll from the virus expected to</a> be in the tens of thousands. Trump and Biden continue to work on the assumption that, come November, the worst of the pandemic will be over. The US held <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/21/us/politics/1918-flu-pandemic-elections.html\">midterm elections in 1918</a> even in the grip of the Spanish flu that killed 675,000 people nationwide. Meanwhile, the president controversially uses the daily White House coronavirus taskforce briefings to push his own political agenda, and Biden has been campaigning from home in Delaware, hoping to use a new digital strategy that includes a podcast to reach voters.</p> <h2>Could the election be carried out by vote-by-mail?</h2> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re in completely uncharted waters here and I don\u2019t think anybody knows what\u2019s going to happen,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.fordham.edu/info/24277/ma_in_elections_and_campaign_management_faculty/6866/monika_l_mcdermott\">Monika McDermott</a>, a political science professor at Fordham University in New York, recently told the Guardian. \u201cBy November the picture might be completely unrecognisable. We don\u2019t even know if the election is going to happen as scheduled. There\u2019s talk out there about postponing it or changing it to a mail-in-only election.\u201d</p> <p>If the election does go ahead as expected on 3 November, states that already allow early and absentee voting will be well placed. Washington state, for example, has carried out elections by mail for years and its primary last month went ahead as planned. <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/paloma/the-trailer/2020/04/02/the-trailer-the-fear-and-politics-around-expanding-voting-by-mail/5e84980e602ff10d49ada414/\">But 17 states require some kind of excuse</a> for requesting an absentee ballot. Many would need to change their rules at huge cost to run a mail-only election.</p> <h2>What happens if a candidate becomes incapacitated?</h2> <p>If the president\u2019s cabinet and Congress agree the president is incapacitated, the 25th amendment to the US constitution states that the vice-president becomes acting president.</p> <p>No presidential candidate has ever died or become incapacitated between their nomination and the election. The procedures to replace a candidate are guided by federal and state laws and party regulations, but the situation would be unprecedented.</p>",
  "<p>Less than 72 hours before polls opened in Wisconsin on 7 April, the state legislature convened to weigh an <a href=\"https://evers.wi.gov/Documents/COVID19/EO073-SpecialSessionElections%20searchable.pdf\">emergency request</a> from the governor, Tony Evers. With Covid-19 cases in the thousands, Evers implored the lawmakers to delay in-person voting for the state\u2019s presidential primary and mail a ballot to every voter in the state.</p> <p>It was a meeting only in name. Republicans, who control 63 of 99 seats in the state assembly, sent just one member. He brought the session to order and then immediately ended it without taking up the governor\u2019s request. It took just <a href=\"https://twitter.com/patrickdmarley/status/1246549489671905280?s=20\">17 seconds</a>. In the Republican-controlled state senate, <a href=\"https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/2020/04/04/wisconsin-legislature-adjourns-special-session-monday-voting-track-tuesday-election/2948444001/\">the same thing happened</a>, according to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. It took even less time.</p> <p>The legislature\u2019s defiance was a naked display of unabashed power \u2013 an elected body refusing its governor\u2019s request and turning its back on its constituents in a time of crisis.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I don\u2019t think many people who are aware of what\u2019s going on would say that it\u2019s anything even resembling a democracy</p> <footer> <cite>Jay Heck of Common Cause</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The Republican lawmakers who didn\u2019t even bother to show up for the emergency session on Saturday knew that their re-election was guaranteed because of a successful party effort over the last 10 years to entrench themselves in power. Even in a state at the center of some of the most hard-nosed fights over voting, it was a stunning series of events.</p> <p>That assault on democracy began in 2011, when Republicans drew new lines for political districts in Wisconsin. It was part of a national Republican effort, called Project Redmap, to capture state legislatures and, with those victories, to gain control over redrawing the lines of each district. The goal of<a href=\"http://www.redistrictingmajorityproject.com/\"> R</a><a href=\"http://www.redistrictingmajorityproject.com/\">edmap</a> was to conjure districts that would advantage Republicans and disadvantage Democrats \u2013 a process called gerrymandering. The writer and author <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/15/millennial-politicians-unrigged-excerpt-david-daley\">David Daley</a> called Project Redmap \u201cthe most audacious political heist of modern times\u201d.</p> <p>Karl Rove, former senior adviser to George W Bush announced the redistricting effort in the Wall Street Journal, claiming, rightly, that whoever controls redistricting also controls Congress. Later, according to the <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/06/27/ratfcked-the-influence-of-redistricting\">New Yorker</a>, when Rove addressed potential funders of Redmap in Dallas, he said \u201cPeople call us a vast rightwing conspiracy. But we\u2019re really a half-assed rightwing conspiracy. Now it\u2019s time to get serious.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/10/wisconsin-primary-coronavirus-republican-voting-by-mail\">Wisconsin proves it: Republicans will sacrifice voters' health to keep power</a> </p> </aside>  <p>For $1.1m \u2013 a small sum in campaign dollars \u2013 Republicans won the state legislature and went on to curb Democratic power by passing a strict voter ID law, making it harder for minorities and students to vote, and later<a href=\"https://www.mprnews.org/story/2019/06/21/wisconsin-supreme-court-upholds-gop-lame-duck-laws\"> stripped statewide</a> elected officials of some of<strong> </strong>their authority.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think many people who are aware of what\u2019s going on, and are tuned into politics and government in this state, would say that it\u2019s anything even resembling a democracy,\u201d said Jay Heck, the executive director of the Wisconsin chapter of Common Cause, a government watchdog group.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"9210f4e85a45487fb8c3eb01b373c4f24d75d5bf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9210f4e85a45487fb8c3eb01b373c4f24d75d5bf/0_576_3135_3917/800.jpg\" alt=\"person wears sign saying thank you for risking life to vote\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Wisconsin held its primary on Tuesday despite the coronavirus pandemic.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pat A Robinson/Zuma Wire/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>On Tuesday, voters <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/07/wisconsin-votes-controversial-election-coronavirus-us-election-2020\">risked their lives</a> to go to the polls, waiting hours in line in Milwaukee. So far, turnout looks like it will be a fraction of what it was in 2016, and that is believed to benefit Republicans, who were seeking to maintain control of a seat on the conservative-leaning state supreme court. It was the state supreme court who voted along partisan lines to overrule Evers\u2019 last-minute effort and to allow the election to move forward.</p> <p>\u2022\u2022\u2022</p> <p>Wisconsin had long held a reputation as a bipartisan state, and there had been fights over redistricting before. But in 2011, Republicans took it to a new level. They deployed mapmakers to the offices of a law firm across from the state capitol, where they drew different options for maps that tested how much of an advantage could be gained in districts. They closely regulated who had access to the room where maps were drawn, even requiring Republican lawmakers to <a href=\"http://archive.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/lawmakers-were-made-to-pledge-secrecy-over-redistricting-9643ep0-138826854.html/\">sign agreements</a> to keep discussions about the maps secret.</p> <p>Republicans understood that they were drawing maps to maintain power far beyond that year. \u201cThe maps we pass will determine who\u2019s here 10 years from now,\u201d one memo at the time read.<strong> </strong>One assembly district belonging to Andy Jorgensen, a Democrat in the state general assembly, was cracked into four different Republican-friendly districts, Daley wrote in Ratf**ked: Why Your Vote Doesn\u2019t Count.</p> <p>The plan worked almost exactly as the mapmakers predicted. In 2012, the first election with the new map in place, Republicans won less than half the votes, but conquered 60 of the state\u2019s 99 assembly seats. The Republicans grew their majority in 2014 and 2016, despite earning just over 50% of the statewide vote.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Republicans could act brazenly without fear because gerrymandered maps make it impossible for them to lose their majority</p> <footer> <cite>Michael Li, a voting rights expert at the Brennan Center at NYU</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cIt seems impervious to what happens with voters,\u201d said Barry Burden, director of the Elections Research Center at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. \u201cIt really looks like an unresponsive institution.\u201d</p> <p>Michael Li, a voting rights expert at the non-partisan Brennan Center at NYU, wrote this week: \u201cWisconsin\u2019s maps are so gerrymandered that Republicans can win close to a supermajority of house seats with a <em>minority</em> of the vote.</p> <p>\u201cRepublicans could act brazenly without fear of electoral blowback because gerrymandered maps make it virtually impossible for them to ever lose their legislative majority,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/analysis-opinion/gerrymandering-meets-coronavirus-wisconsin\">he wrote</a>. Wisconsin\u2019s maps were crafted with such micro-precision that even if Democrats managed to win a historically high 54% of the two-party vote \u2013 a level they\u2019ve reached only once in the last 20 years \u2013 Republicans would still end up with a <a href=\"https://www.brennancenter.org/sites/default/files/legal-work/Whitford-Opinion112116.pdf\">solid nine-seat majority</a> in the state assembly.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022\u2022\u2022</p> <p>As the gerrymandering project wore on in 2011, Republicans also drafted one of the strictest voter ID laws in the country. <a href=\"https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/2011/related/acts/23\">It required</a> Wisconsin voters to present a form of photo ID such as a driver\u2019s license or passport to vote.

So they continue to restrict the electorate to advantage themselves.\u201d</p> <p>A few weeks after the 2016 election, Greenwood and a team of lawyers helped convince a three-judge panel to <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/21/us/wisconsin-redistricting-found-to-unfairly-favor-republicans.html\">strike down</a> the gerrymandered assembly map, saying it was so severely manipulated that it violated the US constitution. But in 2018, the US supreme court, in a 5-4 vote, overruled the lower court on technical grounds and sent the case back for further review. One year later, it would rule that federal courts could do nothing to stop partisan gerrymandering.</p> <p>\u2022\u2022\u2022</p> <p>The maps Republicans secretly drew in 2011 laid the foundation for the power they used to force an unprecedented election on Tuesday.

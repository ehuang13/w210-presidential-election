  "<p>Standing in the Brady briefing room at the White House last week, Donald Trump said that despite new restrictions on the number of journalists allowed in the room, there were still too many reporters around.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re actually sitting too close,\u201d the president told the journalists. \u201cWe should probably get rid of about another 75, 80% of you. I have just two or three that I like in this room.\u201d</p> <p>If it was a joke, the timing was terrible.</p> <p>As the coronavirus crisis has grown, so too has the power of the president\u2019s whim to shape American life, whether that means choosing which states get emergency medical equipment first, deciding where to deploy troops to build temporary hospitals \u2013 or controlling what the public knows about what the government is doing.</p> <p>In recent weeks, Trump has invoked emergency powers enabling him to waive certain healthcare regulations and direct enormous streams of cash to areas of need. He has also announced that the federal government would use its authority to direct private companies to boost the production of surgical masks, gloves and other equipment, although the status of those efforts was unclear.</p> <p>For now the risk \u2013 the seeming surety \u2013 of a national disaster has fostered a willingness in even Trump\u2019s harshest critics for him to aggressively seize the reins of his office and marshal the power of the federal government toward a muscular and decisive response that could save thousands of lives.</p> <p>But with this widespread desire for action has come related concerns about where, exactly, that power will stop growing, when the emergency crests, and how that power will shrink when the crisis subsides.</p> <p>Civil society advocates warn the fog of crisis could give Trump cover to grab adjacent powers, not related to the current emergency, that might be difficult to claw back \u2013 especially if Congress and the courts failed to check Trump after the fact.</p> <p>\u201cOrdinarily, that\u2019s not something you\u2019d be worried about, because it would seem kind of unthinkable for a president to exploit a pandemic to arrogate a bunch of power that he doesn\u2019t need,\u201d said Elizabeth Goitein, co-director of the liberty and national security program at the Brennan Center for Justice.</p> <p>\u201cBut we have seen that this president is willing to abuse emergency powers, and to use them for political gains. And so we have to worry.\u201d</p> <p>By <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/proclamation-declaring-national-emergency-concerning-novel-coronavirus-disease-covid-19-outbreak/\">invoking</a> the National Emergencies Act on 13 March, Trump gained access to emergency powers in more than 100 other statutes, Goitein said, \u201cand if you look at those authorities, very few of them relate to health crises\u201d. With incremental action, Trump could expand government control of the internet, freeze private assets or change the size and composition of the armed forces.</p> <p>Other steps Trump has taken in the coronavirus response, such as restricting international borders and imposing mandatory quarantines for certain travelers, do not rely on emergency authorities but could create a legacy of expanded executive power that advocates fear could outlast the virus.</p> <p>One step Trump did not take after his administration <a href=\"https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2020/01/31/secretary-azar-declares-public-health-emergency-us-2019-novel-coronavirus.html\">declared</a> a public health emergency on 31 January was to reallocate funds to speed approval for drugs and ramp up the production of coronavirus tests kits. Trump\u2019s failure to deploy that power, the University of Texas law professor Steve Vladeck said, may have ironically created a scenario in which he ends up using much broader powers.</p> <p>\u201cThe president\u2019s dilatory use of the powers he has, I think, is going to end up requiring him to use a lot more of that power, in ways that are a lot more controversial and a lot more coercive and a lot more inconsistent,\u201d Vladeck told Benjamin Wittes of the Brookings Institution in a <a href=\"https://www.lawfareblog.com/lawfare-podcast-bonus-edition-steve-vladeck-emergency-powers-and-coronavirus\">Lawfare podcast</a> about emergency powers and coronavirus.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"38f39f4948cbc823d5c64fdcf4a908efd2ec8951\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/38f39f4948cbc823d5c64fdcf4a908efd2ec8951/0_169_5098_3060/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Members of the Maryland national guard control entry to a section of parking lot on the south side of FedEx Field on Monday that officials said will become a clinic for coronavirus health screenings.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Members of the Maryland national guard control entry to a section of parking lot on the south side of FedEx Field on Monday that officials said will become a clinic for coronavirus health screenings.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Concerns that the administration would look for ways to use the crisis to move the lines of the law were sharpened by <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/21/doj-coronavirus-emergency-powers-140023\">reports</a> last week that the justice department had asked Congress to pass legislation allowing federal judges to detain people indefinitely without trial during emergencies.</p> <p>But analysts differ in their imaginations of how a dangerous expansion of power by Trump might unfold, with the economy in a tailspin and a presidential election on the horizon.</p> <p>Under extraordinary powers accessible to Trump after his national emergency declaration, he could declare the coronavirus to be a \u201cforeign threat\u201d and impose financial sanctions on anyone he said was contributing to the threat, such as a media company or a political opponent.</p> <p>He could announce an interstate travel ban, enforceable by the military, citing a need to stop the spread of the virus. Along similar lines, he could take steps that could make it harder for some people to vote in the presidential election in November \u2013 or make it more difficult for legal challenges to such steps to be heard in court.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not hard to imagine the federal courts in general, and this supreme court in particular, being remarkably deferential to the federal government in a public health crisis like this one,\u201d Vladeck told Wittes.</p> <p>Or, in what analysts describe as a worst-case scenario, the justice department could move for a federal judge to declare a breakdown of local law enforcement \u2013 at which point Trump could theoretically deploy the military in the streets, in a manner breaking with <a href=\"https://www.army.mil/article/45029/the_army_response_to_hurricane_katrina\">past deployments</a> of active-duty troops for disaster response.</p> <p>As an ominous reference point, civil liberties advocates point to anti-democratic moves taken by the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, to close most courts, adjourn parliament and exploit secret cellphone data.</p> <p>\u201cWe have to be on the lookout for any use of these powers that goes beyond what public health experts are recommending as necessary, and that intrude on civil liberties,\u201d Goitein said.</p> <p>In offhand comments, Trump has occasionally expressed a reticence about the power of his office, which he elsewhere has described as unlimited.</p> <p>\u201cA lot of executive power, if we don\u2019t have to use it that would be a good thing, not a bad thing,\u201d he said at the White House last week. As late as Wednesday, Trump was resisting calls to invoke the Defense Production Act to get private businesses involved in mask and ventilator production, saying, \u201cWe hope we\u2019re not going to need it.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"3044778bfa1fcc6a503b5817444bff2200d26707\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3044778bfa1fcc6a503b5817444bff2200d26707/0_134_4015_2409/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Donald Trump\u2019s track record offers no reason to believe that he will eagerly accede to the contraction of powers that expanded in a time of emergency response, experts warn.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Donald Trump\u2019s track record offers no reason to believe that he will eagerly accede to the contraction of powers that expanded in a time of emergency response, experts warn.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Eric Baradat/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Berkeley law professor John Yoo, who crafted legal cover for torture programs in the George W Bush years, took a sanguine view of Trump\u2019s power and its containment.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s not a whole lot more I think that the president can do, unless we saw something much more serious occur such as the breakdown of law and order,\u201d said Yoo in a call-in forum hosted on Friday by the Federalist Society. \u201cEven then the president would need to rely on the request of state governors for assistance before he could intervene.\u201d</p> <p>But Trump\u2019s track record offers no reason to believe that he will eagerly accede to the contraction of powers that expanded in a time of emergency response, said Goitein, of the Brennan Center.</p> <p>\u201cIf you divorce his emergency orders from the context of every other thing he\u2019s ever said or done, you might be able to believe that,\u201d she said. \u201cBut if you put it in the context of a president who has said that article II gives him the power to do anything he wants, and a president who has ordered officials not to comply with congressional subpoenas, and a president who has said that Congress does not have the authority to impeach him \u2013 then I think you absolutely have to be worried.\u201d</p>",

You have death, probably, I mean definitely would be in greater numbers than the numbers that we\u2019re talking about with regard to the virus.\u201d</p> \n  <p>What does the data show? </p> \n  <p>It is reasonable to suggest that a pandemic-linked recession <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2020/03/23/coronavirus-pandemic-isolation-fear-job-loss-triggers-suicide/2871949001/\">can increase the risk of a rise in suicides</a>. According to research published in the <a href=\"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/the-british-journal-of-psychiatry\">British Journal of Psychiatry</a>, North America and Europe experienced 10,000 more suicides during the 2008 recession. The outbreak of Sars in Hong Kong in 2002 and 2003 also led to a \u201csignificant increase\u201d in suicides in those aged over 65, <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20418214\">according to 2010 research</a>. </p> \n  <p>But experts also caution that there is no single cause of suicide. </p> \n  <p>While the figures for the mortality rate of coronavirus continues to evolve, recent research from Wuhan, China, the city where the outbreak began, indicates the mortality rate there <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/19/health/wuhan-coronavirus-deaths.html\">was around 1.4%</a>.

  "<p>The US has said it will cut its aid to Afghanistan by $1bn (\u00a3840m), blaming the failure of President Ashraf Ghani and his main political rival, Abdullah Abdullah, to agree on a unity government for talks with the Taliban.</p> <p>A further $1bn could be cut<strong> </strong>from the annual aid package of $4.5bn in 2021, the US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, warned after a surprise visit to Kabul on Monday failed to persuade the two men to strike a deal. Pompeo suggested the aid could be restored if they changed their minds.</p> <p>The aid cut would represent about 5% of Afghanistan\u2019s GDP, but Ghani claimed in a televised address on Tuesday that \u201cthe US reduction in aid will have no direct impact on our key sectors\u201d. He expressed hope that the Afghan government could try to satisfy the US \u201cthrough talks and negotiations\u201d.</p> <p>The Afghan president also blamed Abdullah, who he said had been offered an important role in the cabinet, but had instead demanded changes to the constitution. Abdullah also released a statement saying that while Pompeo\u2019s trip had created an opportunity to resolve the crisis, \u201cunfortunately it was not utilised properly\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/23/pompeo-arrives-in-kabul-despite-us-advice-against-international-travel-coronavirus\">Pompeo to meet Taliban in Doha in effort to revive peace talks</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Abdullah, who formerly held the title of Afghanistan\u2019s chief executive officer, refused to accept defeat in last September\u2019s presidential election, amid widespread allegations of fraud. He is seeking to set up a parallel administration in a palace next door to Ghani\u2019s presidential compound.</p> <p>\u201cThe United States is disappointed in them and what their conduct means for Afghanistan and our shared interests,\u201d Pompeo said in a sharply written statement. \u201cTheir failure has harmed US-Afghan relations and, sadly, dishonours those Afghan, Americans, and coalition partners who have sacrificed their lives and treasure in the struggle to build a new future for this country.</p> <p>\u201cBecause this leadership failure poses a direct threat to US national interests, effective immediately the US government will initiate a review of the scope of our cooperation with Afghanistan,\u201d Pompeo added. \u201cAmong other steps, we are today announcing a responsible adjustment to our spending in Afghanistan and immediately reducing assistance by $1bn this year. We are prepared to reduce by another $1bn in 2021.\u201d</p> <p>The secretary of state warned that other US projects, as well as US pledges at donor conferences, would come under review. He blamed the Afghan leaders for failing to abide by a joint declaration with the US made on 29 February to send a unified team to talks with the Taliban, and to free Taliban prisoners.</p> <p>In a separate agreement on 29 February with the Taliban, the US said 5,000 Taliban prisoners would be released in exchange for 1,000 government soldiers held by the insurgents. But the Afghan government insisted it had not agreed to free that many prisoners at once before broader peace negotiations had got under way.</p> <p>Pompeo told reporters that the first cut in assistance could still be averted if Ghani and Abdullah changed course, formed an \u201cinclusive team\u201d and went ahead with the prisoner exchange. \u201cWe\u2019re hopeful, frankly, they\u2019ll get their act together and we won\u2019t have to do it, but we are prepared to do that if they can\u2019t,\u201d he said.</p> <p>After spending more than eight hours in Kabul in unsuccessful talks with Ghani and Abdullah, Pompeo flew to Doha, where he held hour-long talks late on Monday night with the top Taliban negotiator, Mullah Baradar, at a Qatari air base.</p> <p>Pompeo said that in contrast to the Afghan government, the Taliban were keeping their end of the 29 February deal. \u201cThey committed to reducing violence; they have largely done that, and then they are working towards delivering their team to the ultimate negotiations,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The rift in Kabul and the breakdown of a planned prisoner exchange with the Taliban have stalled progress towards peace talks following the agreement of the temporary ceasefire, under which the Taliban said it would not attack US troops as they withdrew from the country.</p> <p>US and allied troops have begun their withdrawal but Taliban attacks on Afghan targets have <a href=\"https://www.afghanistan-analysts.org/en/reports/war-and-peace/voices-from-the-districts-the-violence-mapped-what-has-happened-since-the-reduction-in-violence-ended/\">almost returned to their pre-ceasefire level</a> and there is no immediate prospect of political negotiations between the insurgents and government officials that were supposed to start on 10 March.</p> <p>The two sides held talks via Skype on Sunday but there was no sign of a breakthrough on the core disagreement. The Afghan government wants a staggered release of prisoners but the Taliban are demanding that Kabul free all 5,000 of its fighters at once.</p> <p>The official number of coronavirus cases in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/afghanistan\">Afghanistan</a> stands at 34 but testing there is limited and the disease is expected to be much more widespread, posing dangers of an epidemic among prisoners in particular.</p> <p>\u201cEveryone clearly understands the coronavirus threat makes prisoner releases that much more urgent,\u201d wrote the US special envoy for Afghan peace talks, Zalmay Khalilzad.</p> <p>Pompeo staked his diplomatic reputation on <a href=\"https://www.state.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Agreement-For-Bringing-Peace-to-Afghanistan-02.29.20.pdf\">the deal with the Taliban</a>, flying to Qatar to oversee its signing by Khalilzad.

  "<p>Diving into the campaign app for Donald Trump\u2019s re-election campaign results in a radically different experience than the app for Joe Biden\u2019s campaign.</p> <p>It is a difference that illustrates a key aspect of how the Trump campaign is going about organizing online during the coronavirus pandemic versus Biden\u2019s effort: the former is mobilizing its own base, and the latter is seeking to broaden it.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/19/trump-hydroxychloroquine-covid-19-white-house\">Trump is taking hydroxychloroquine, White House confirms</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Trump campaign\u2019s app and digital footprint increasingly reflects an emphasis on activating its passionate communities of supporters. Meanwhile, the Biden campaign has thus far taken a far more traditional approach, with an app and organizing events that point more to the list-building approach common among federal and statewide campaigns. It allows for voters that aren\u2019t necessarily hardcore Democrats or Biden supporters.</p> <p>In a campaign where door-to-door knocking is limited because of the coronavirus, strategists are having to explore new online ways of rallying voters and collecting information on potential supporters.</p> <p>\u201cPeople don\u2019t want you to knock on their door any more. Digital does that now. They haven\u2019t wanted to go to events. Only old people want to go to events. Well, you\u2019ve seen digital solve all that with Zoom. You\u2019ve seen digital solve that with an app,\u201d said Republican strategist Jim McIntosh. \u201cCoronavirus has sped up the natural cycle of things. We were already going this way but digital impact will have the biggest impact this year.\u201d</p> <p>Strategists have taken note of the differences in the two presidential campaigns\u2019 approach.</p> <p>\u201cWhat Trump is doing with the app that I think is so interesting \u2026 is he\u2019s really building up this idea of \u2018us versus them. You\u2019re on our team. You\u2019re with us,\u2019\u201d said Democratic digital strategist Stefan Smith, former online engagement director for Pete Buttigieg\u2019s presidential campaign.</p> <p>\u201cSo you become this sort of under-siege political minority \u2026 because that\u2019s the language they\u2019re using, even though they\u2019re winning. That mentality keeps them feeling like, \u2018OK, we have to stay together\u2019, and then you\u2019re getting constant uploads.\u201d</p> <p>The difference between the two apps is apparent from the minute the downloads have completed.</p> <p>The Trump campaign app sends out multiple email alerts over a few days \u2013 the Biden campaign app over the same period barely sent out any. Both campaign apps offer updated lists of events, but the Trump campaign app also offers other ways to help it. You can help registering voters, become \u201ca bundler\u201d for fundraising, \u201cHost a Maga meet-up\u201d, join the campaign\u2019s election day team, or \u201cBecome a Trump team leader\u201d. There\u2019s also a point system on the app for rewards.</p> <p>\u201cThis is about energizing the base and getting more out of the same people,\u201d said Republican strategist and ad maker Will Ritter.</p> <p>For the Biden campaign app, there are standard links to make calls, send texts, volunteer and donate, and a list of campaign events. But there is no point system. And the variety of ways to engage with the campaign is smaller.</p> <p>It\u2019s a similar situation with supporter events online. Both campaigns send out fundraising and supporter emails. Both campaigns have migrated mostly to holding events online with surrogates. For Biden, it\u2019s often himself and other elected officials or leaders of various wings of the Democratic party; for Trump, it\u2019s minor icons within the larger Trump movement.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ce6a4c25238e0c0be1726a452933d2d498c8a6fb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ce6a4c25238e0c0be1726a452933d2d498c8a6fb/0_113_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Biden in San Diego last year.

The campaign regularly distributes a weekly broadcast schedule of online events with groups like \u201cBlack Voices for Trump\u201d and \u201cMaga Mamas\u201d and an event featuring Lara Trump, the president\u2019s daughter-in-law. Trump himself doesn\u2019t participate in those events but he doesn\u2019t have to as he has the bully pulpit of his office. Oftentimes during the pandemic official White House events involving Trump have been featured live on major cable networks.</p> <p>Smith said that another major difference between the campaign\u2019s online approach has been the types of voters the campaigns are trying to reach.</p> <p>\u201c[The Trump] ecosystem is really about sharing, putting things on your own social media profile. Like if you look at the instructions on the app,\u201d Smith said, pointing to the step-by-step instructions on the Trump campaign app to invite friends and use specific hashtags.</p> <p>Those directions are for a specific audience of older Trump supporters who may not be as savvy as younger voters. \u201cIt has instructions in the app \u2013 \u2018How do you sign up for a Facebook page?\u2019 Not: how do you post on one? But they\u2019re helping their older supporters get on Facebook just to spread news about the president to earn points so that they can maybe see him and get merch or whatever.\u201d</p> <p>Smith added: \u201cThis is a base strategy. This is the assumption that if we can get everybody in the same direction and we don\u2019t lose anybody then we can keep them.\u201d</p> <p>Even before the Democratic presidential primary shrank to only Biden, strategists fretted about the data lead Republicans and the Trump campaign had been building over their Democratic rivals. </p> <p>\u201cAs a digital professional, the Trump campaign scares me a little,\u201d Smith warned. \u201cThey have so much runway, they have so much data.\u201d</p> <p>The Biden campaign has been working to catch up.

unspecified reforms or lose out on US funding.</p> \n  <p>A resolution that backed the WHO\u2019s leadership and said there needed to be an investigation into the global response to the coronavirus pandemic won endorsement at the WHO\u2019s annual ministerial meeting on Tuesday.</p> \n  <p>The US president launched his attack late on Monday, sending a lengthy letter outlining America\u2019s belief that the WHO had not been sufficiently independent of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/china\">China</a>, and had been too willing to accept its explanations for the origins of the coronavirus outbreak.</p> \n  <p>As the pandemic worsens in the US, and other countries begin a tentative recovery, Trump has sought to blame China and the WHO. The letter accused the WHO of making repeated mistakes, meaning thousands of lives had been lost, and America\u2019s interests not served.</p> \n  <p>\u201cIf the WHO does not commit to major substantive improvements within the next 30 days, I will make my temporary freeze of United States funding to the WHO permanent and reconsider our membership,\u201d Trump told its chief, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.</p> \n  <p>His attack was timed to coincide with the start of the two-day World <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/health\">Health</a> Assembly, which on Tuesday finally backed a draft resolution that supported a WHO-established independent and impartial inquiry into the WHO\u2019s conduct over the coronavirus.</p> \n  <p>The resolution, supported by China\u2019s president, Xi Jinping, on Monday and largely drafted by the European Union, stops short of the kind of international inquiry focused on China\u2019s conduct that was first canvassed by Australia and the US.

It has been licensed for use in the US since the mid 1950s and is listed by the World Health Organization as an \u201cessential\u201d medicine.</p> \n  <h2><strong>What\u2019s the state of the current evidence?</strong><br></h2> \n  <p>In May, the British Medical Journal reported on a randomised (although still problematic) clinical trial in China that found little evidence hydroxychloroquine worked, with serious adverse events noted in two patients.</p> \n  <p>A second study reported in the BMJ last week on a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/27/vital-drug-people-lupus-coronavirus-covid-19-link-hydroxychloroquine\">French trial</a> also concluded that hydroxychloroquine does not significantly reduce admission to intensive care or improve survival rates in patients hospitalised with pneumonia owing to Covid-19. Overall, 89% of those who received hydroxychloroquine survived after 21 days, compared with 91% in the control group.</p> \n  <p>The US Food and Drug Administration in a safety alert issued on 24 April warned that it had received reports that hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine could have serious side-effects and that the drugs should be taken only under the close supervision of a doctor in a hospital setting or a clinical trial.</p> \n  <h2>What are the risks in taking hydroxychloroquine?</h2> \n  <p>There are a number of side-effects. The most serious is that it can interfere with the rhythm of the heart. Other side-effects include headache, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, stomach pain, skin rash or itching or hair loss. Research published by the Mayo Clinic has suggested that \u201coff-label\u201d repurposing of drugs such as hydroxychloroquine could lead to \u201cdrug-induced sudden cardiac death\u201d.</p> \n  <p>Although Trump\u2019s official physician has said he was in \u201cvery good health\u201d at his last official checkup, the president is 73 and his recorded weight would put him in a BMI category of \u201cclinically obese\u201d.</p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/19/hydroxychloroquine-trump-and-covid-19-what-you-need-to-know\">Hydroxychloroquine, Trump and Covid-19: what you need to know</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-19T21:23:14.470Z\">at 10.23pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ec447a38f0864e579f1405f\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-19T21:05:40.952Z\">10.05pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Today so far</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>That\u2019s it from me today.

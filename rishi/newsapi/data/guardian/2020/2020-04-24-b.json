The fire has been nipping at Bolsonaro\u2019s heels for a couple of months now \u2026 and congress has always hated Bolsonaro. So if that 30% starts to budge, things could move really quickly.\u201d</p> <p>Within seconds of Moro\u2019s announcement there were already signs support for Bolsonaro was slipping with deafening pot-banging protests erupting in major Brazilian cities, including in strongly pro-Bolsonaro areas of Rio de Janeiro.</p> <p><em>\u201cFora Bolsonaro! Fora Bolsonaro!\u201d</em> (\u201cBolsonaro out!\u201d), dissenters cried from their windows and balconies as they pounded their saucepans.</p> <p>A commentary in the conservative O Antagonista website <a href=\"https://www.oantagonista.com/brasil/bolsonaro-deveria-renunciar/?desk\">said</a>: \u201cIf he has any honour, Bolsonaro should resign. If he doesn\u2019t resign, impeachment proceedings should begin. In any case, the government is finished.\u201d</p> <p>The immediate trigger for Moro\u2019s resignation was reportedly Bolsonaro\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-brazil-politics/bolsonaro-fires-head-of-brazils-federal-police-amid-political-spat-idUSKCN2261KW?il=0\">decision to remove</a> one of the minister\u2019s closest associates, Maur\u00edcio<em> </em>Valeixo, from his job as head of the federal police.</p> <p>Since reports of Valeixo\u2019s impending firing emerged on Thursday, Brazilian newspapers have filled with speculation about why Bolsonaro would be so keen to remove him.</p> <p><a href=\"http://blogs.correiobraziliense.com.br/vicente/pf-esta-proxima-de-pegar-carlos-bolsonaro-por-fake-news/\">A report</a> in one major newspaper, the Correio Braziliense, claimed Bolsonaro\u2019s discomfort stemmed from the fact that a federal police investigation into the dissemination of fake news and promotion of anti-democracy protests was closing in on a highly sensitive target: the president\u2019s own son, Carlos Bolsonaro.</p> <p>Carlos Bolsonaro denied those claims <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CarlosBolsonaro/status/1253430667284606977?s=20\">in a pair of offensive tweets</a> aimed at the broadsheet.</p> <p>\u201cYou scum never stop lying,\u201d one said. Another read: \u201cYourarse [sic].\u201d</p> <p>In his explosive 40-minute resignation speech, Moro claimed he was leaving government because of what he called Bolsonaro\u2019s unacceptable and inappropriate political interference in Brazil\u2019s federal police.</p> <p>Moro claimed Bolsonaro had told him he wanted a federal police director he knew and could call up in order to have access to police intelligence reports.</p> <p>But Winter, who knows Moro and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/nov/01/bolsonaro-sergio-moro-brazil-justice-ministry-anti-corruption\">had questioned his decision</a> to enter politics, claimed other factors had also played a role \u2013 including Bolsonaro\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/27/jair-bolsonaro-coronavirus-brazil-governors-appalled\">anti-scientific handling</a> of the coronavirus pandemic.</p> <p>\u201cHe has been deeply frustrated by a number of things including the government\u2019s response to Covid-19,\u201d Winter said, claiming Moro had been part of a group of ministers \u201cconstantly lobbying Bolsonaro to take the pandemic more seriously and adopt a science-based response\u201d.</p> <p>Winter said Moro, who last year <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jun/11/sergio-moro-jair-bolsonaro-justice-minister-resign\">resisted calls to resign</a> after leaked documents prompted claims he had improperly plotted to jail Lula, also sensed political pressure on Bolsonaro was growing and that the coming months would represent \u201can existential threat for the presidency itself\u201d.</p> <p>Moro, who rejected the allegations against him as \u201csensationalist\u201d smears, is the second top minister to leave Bolsonaro\u2019s administration in just over a week.</p> <p>Last Thursday, Bolsonaro fired his popular health minister, Luiz Henrique Mandetta, after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/13/brazil-bolsonaro-coronavirus-covid-19-social-distancing\">he publicly challenged</a> the president\u2019s coronavirus response.</p> <p>Bolsonaro continues to play down the crisis and undermine social distancing measures despite Covid-19 now having claimed more than 3,300 lives. On Thursday a record 407 deaths were reported.</p> <p>Speaking before Moro\u2019s resignation, the author and commentator Pedro Doria said he feared there would be a high human price to pay for the political chaos consuming Brazil.</p> <p>\u201cEvery single person in government should be totally focused on Covid-19,\u201d Doria said.</p> <p>\u201cThe only real result of all this is that a lot of people will die.\u201d</p>",

The president has repeatedly demonstrated a lack of understanding about the limits on executive power, particularly when it comes to <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2018/06/the-strangest-thing-about-trumps-approach-to-presidential-power/562271/\">his own self-preservation.</a></p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">Covid-19 outbreak</a> has also increased <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/23/coronavirus-fight-to-vote-us-voters\">concerns</a> about how to conduct in-person voting safely. In response, many are pushing for an expansion of voting by mail.</p> <p>Trump has used <a href=\"https://twitter.com/WHO/status/1227248333871173632?s=20\">Covid-19</a> press briefings to make false claims about voting by mail, calling it \u201ccorrupt\u201d and \u201cdangerous\u201d. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/08/trump-mail-in-voting-2020-election\">Earlier this month</a>, Trump also urged Republicans to fight efforts to expand voting by mail.</p> <p>\u201cRepublicans should fight very hard when it comes to state wide mail-in voting,\u201d Trump tweeted. \u201cDemocrats are clamoring for it. Tremendous potential for voter fraud, and for whatever reason, doesn\u2019t work out well for Republicans.\u201d</p> <p>At the fundraiser, Biden also referenced <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/04/11/post-office-bailout-trump/\">reporting by the Washington Post</a> which revealed Trump\u2019s reluctance to fund the US postal service and efforts to <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/04/23/10-billion-treasury-loan-usps/\">force changes to its financial structure</a>, which could harm voting by mail.</p> <p>\u201cImagine threatening not to fund the post office. Now, what in God\u2019s name is that about? Other than trying to let the word out that he\u2019s going to do all he can to make it very hard for people to vote,\u201d Biden said. \u201cThat\u2019s the only way he thinks he can possibly win.\u201d</p> <p>The Covid-19 outbreak has already reshaped the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-elections-2020\">2020 campaign</a>. The candidates are campaigning from home and at a stage in the cycle when the election tends to dominate news coverage, reporters are instead focused on Covid-19.</p> <p>Biden also shared a broader concern about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2019/apr/18/mueller-report-trump-russia-key-takeaways\">interference</a> in the presidential election by Russia and two unnamed \u201cmajor actors\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cI promise you the Russians did interfere in our [2016] <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-elections-2016\">election</a> and I guarantee you they are doing it again with two other major actors,\u201d Biden said. \u201cYou can be assured between [Trump] and the Russians there is going to be an attempt to interfere.\u201d</p> <p>In response to Biden\u2019s comments, the Trump campaign said in a statement: \u201cThose are the incoherent, conspiracy theory ramblings of a lost candidate who is out of touch with reality. Perhaps he also missed the news that the infamous Steele Dossier, central to the Russian Collusion Hoax, was likely compiled with Russian disinformation. That\u2019s the real Russian collusion.\u201d</p>",

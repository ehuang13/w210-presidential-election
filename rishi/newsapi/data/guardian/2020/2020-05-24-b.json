Few surrender power for the asking.</p> <p>After the debacle of 2000, Frum\u2019s boss extended an olive branch to blue America. Bush sought to broaden his mandate. Trump still spits in half the country\u2019s eye. Conciliation is not part of his DNA, or even his playbook.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"33951935cc61ded727629b7eddba39baf2d9e1a1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/33951935cc61ded727629b7eddba39baf2d9e1a1/0_0_2928_2756/1000.jpg\" alt=\"David Frum speaks at Politicon in Nashville, Tennessee last October.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"941\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">David Frum speaks at Politicon in Nashville last October.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Brian Cahn/Zuma Wire/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Frum questions the legitimacy of the process if Trump wins re-election but finishes second again in the popular vote. He also homes in on the contradiction at the heart of Trumpian populism.</p> <p>On the one hand, it is rooted in the belief that the silent majority should come first, not the elites. On the other, its operative dictum is \u201cwe should not choose our leaders just by counting who got the most votes\u201d. Shades of Animal Farm: some folks are more equal than others.</p> <p>Said differently, the people\u2019s preferences should not be equated with \u201cwill of <em>the </em>people\u201d. In the end, Frum says, Trumpism is about defending a \u201cdistinct way of life\u201d, one challenged by modernity.</p> <p>Frum makes clear that this outlook is shared by the cosseted segments of Trump\u2019s base. Trumpocalypse quotes <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/fema-tells-states-to-hand-public-health-data-over-to-palantir\">Peter Thiel, a pillar of Silicon Valley</a> and an early Trump supporter, who sees democracy at odds with his libertarian ideals. Thiel has written that he \u201cno longer believes that freedom and democracy are compatible\u201d.</p> <p>A PayPal co-founder and Kushner family partner, Thiel blames this decoupling on the \u201cextension of the franchise to women\u201d. He also contends that the welfare state has \u201crendered the notion of \u2018capitalist democracy\u2019 into an oxymoron\u201d. Recent reports, however, describe even Thiel <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/billionaire-maga-fan-peter-thiel-has-had-it-with-trumps-covid-19-response\">as displeased with Trump</a> over his handling of the pandemic.</p> <p>Trumpocalypse voices irreconcilable grievance. Still, Frum\u2019s dismay is not directed at the president\u2019s supporters, at least he tries not to. Frum understands that even if the incumbent loses re-election, the great American divide is not disappearing anytime soon.</p> <p>On that note, Trumpocalypse rejects progressivism\u2019s embrace of the \u201cGreat Awokening\u201d, the volatile brew of identity politics and intersectionality. The left\u2019s orthodoxies find few takers in swing districts. Frum opposes liberal immigration policies as devaluing the rights and status of actual citizens. He also criticizes Biden for advocating healthcare expansion to cover undocumented migrants.</p> <p>More Americans <a href=\"https://www.scribd.com/document/440012308/Fox-December-8-11-2019-National-Topline-December-15-Release#fullscreen&amp;from_embed\">favor a wall along the southern border</a> than <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/democratic-candidates-healthcare-benefits-undocumented-immigrants-2019-7\">support granting government healthcare</a> to the undocumented. Frum warns that \u201cthe election can be thrown away by people who will not meet voters where they are\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/17/pelosi-review-speaker-donald-trump-brain\">Pelosi review: the speaker, her rise and how she came to rent space in Donald Trump's brain</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Trumpocalypse proposes a series of reforms to rebalance the disconnect between the populace and electoral outcomes. Among other things, Frum urges abolishing the filibuster if the Democrats retake the Senate: \u201cDon\u2019t study or debate it. Just do it.\u201d Right now, the odds of the GOP <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/18/us-senate-democrats-elections-2020?CMP=share_btn_tw\">keeping the upper chamber</a> are <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/republicans-grow-nervous-about-losing-the-senate-amid-worries-over-trumps-handling-of-the-pandemic/2020/05/09/65691184-915f-11ea-a9c0-73b93422d691_story.html\">no better than 50-50</a>.</p> <p>As for climate change, the author opposes the Green New Deal but backs a carbon tax and carbon sequestration. In 2010, the GOP regained the House in part due to congressional Democrats passing a \u201ccap and trade\u201d tax.</p> <p>Whenever Trump leaves office, his legacy will haunt. He was more than just a candidate, he embodied a movement. His children show no hint of leaving the stage.</p> <p>Frum observes that in theology, the apocalypse was not \u201cthe end\u201d but the harbinger of a \u201cnew and better order\u201d. We\u2019ll see. But Trumpocalypse is an apt title for these blighted times.</p>",

Unsurprisingly, many of these revolved around allegations that the PM\u2019s advisor Dominic Cummings broke the lockdown rules back in March. Here\u2019s a summary of the key points:</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The government has announced it will put \u00a3283m into moving public transport back to a full timetable</strong>. However, those who can should still work from home, and those who can should still avoid all forms of public transport. Even a fully restored service will only be capable of carrying, at best, one fifth of normal capacity, to allow for social distancing. </li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>There have been a further 282 recorded deaths, bringing the UK\u2019s total death toll to 36,675</strong>. Important to note - the government publishes the death toll based on those who definitely had Covid-19; broader figures based on suspected coronavirus deaths is larger. On average, the number of deaths is starting to come down, Harries said. </li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li>The \u201csteady, slow\u201d <strong>downward trend in hospital admissions in England is continuing</strong>. Across all four nations, the percentage of mechanical ventilator beds occupied by patients with Covid-19 is also falling.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Testing for under 5s will be \u201cprogressed\u201d going forward</strong>, said Harries, after a question on whether they\u2019ll be able to get tested once early years facilities are reopened. Harries said it is known that children rarely become ill with Covid-19 and there are signals that the transmission from children is reduced.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <h2><strong>Shapps was grilled on Cummings</strong></h2> \n  <ul> \n   <li>Shapps dodged a question on whether or not the PM knew of Dominic Cummings\u2019 400km journey, simply saying: \u201cthe important thing is that everyone remains in the same place whilst they are in lockdown\u201d. He also said the welfare of Cummings\u2019 4 year old child was \u201cthe important thing\u201d - this is a reference to the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/iainjwatson/status/1264124644191277057\">explanation</a> given by Downing Street for Cummings\u2019 journey.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li>The PM gives Cummings his full support.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li>Asked if, like Cummings, those who become ill with the virus can go closer to relatives, Shapps says if you\u2019re symptomatic, you have to get yourself locked down in the most practical way, and that this will be different depending on different family circumstances.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li>If you want more detail, you can read some of the exchanges <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/may/23/uk-coronavirus-live-boris-johnson-under-pressure-to-sack-dominic-cummings-latest-updates?page=with:block-5ec942418f0886ce4f5d91c7#block-5ec942418f0886ce4f5d91c7\">here </a>and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/may/23/uk-coronavirus-live-boris-johnson-under-pressure-to-sack-dominic-cummings-latest-updates?page=with:block-5ec940278f0864e579f167ae#block-5ec940278f0864e579f167ae\">here</a>.</li> \n  </ul> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-23T19:51:23.657Z\">at 8.51pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ec9498f8f0886ce4f5d91fc\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-23T16:06:59.567Z\">5.06pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The death toll in <strong>Italy </strong>has risen by 119 to 32,735, the third highest in the world after the US and the UK.</p> \n  <p>There have been another 669 confirmed cases, taking the total to 229,372, the sixth highest global tally behind those of the US, Russia, Spain, Britain and Brazil.

Early analysis by WHO suggests that Africa\u2019s lower mortality rate may be the result of demography and other possible factors. Africa is the youngest continent demographically, with more than 60% of the population under the age of 25. Older adults have a significantly increased risk of developing a severe illness. In Europe nearly 95% of deaths occurred in those older than 60 years.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>WHO also noted that African governments swiftly imposed restrictive measures on their populations in an attempt to contain the spread of the disease.

To recap the latest developments around the world:</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li>About 1.8bn Muslims worldwide will celebrate one of their biggest holidays, the three-day Eid al-Fitr, largely confined to their home. The celebration marks the end of the fasting month of Ramadan, and usually involves travelling, visiting family and gathering for lavish meals, all of which will be largely prohibited as authorities try to prevent virus outbreaks. </li> \n   <li>Meanwhile, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/may/22/hydroxychloroquine-trumps-covid-19-cure-increases-deaths-global-study-finds\">another study has shown that the anti-malarial drug the US president,<strong> Donald Trump,</strong> is taking</a> to prevent Covid-19 has increased deaths in patients treated with it in hospitals around the world. It follows a<a href=\"https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.16.20065920v2\"> study published in April that showed hospital patients given hydroxychloroquine</a> in the US found no benefit from the drug, either alone or given in combination with an antibiotic. In fact the patients treated with hydroxychloroquine alone had a higher mortality rate.</li> \n   <li>Still in the US, in yet another attack on media Trump called the editor of the New York Times \u201cone of the dumbest men\u201d in journalism, and as CNN\u2019s fact-checker has noted, this is the third time in the last month he has called a prominent black journalist \u201cdumb\u201d. He also spent his Friday evening attacking his former attorney general, <strong>Jeff Sessions, </strong>on Twitter. Trump declared churches, mosques and synagogues \u201cessential services\u201d and threatened to override governors who refuse to reopen them this weekend \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/22/donald-trump-churches-mosques-synagogues-reopen\">a power he does not possess</a>.</li> \n   <li>In Russia, the Chechen leader,<strong> Ramzan Kadyrov</strong>,<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/22/ramzan-kadyrov-vanishes-amid-reports-he-has-coronavirus\"> is being treated for Covid-19 in Moscow</a>.

The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/may/22/jobkeeper-to-cost-60bn-less-than-originally-forecast-due-to-reporting-error\">error between the number of employees businesses estimated would be covered by the scheme and the actual number receiving the payment means the scheme will cover 3.5m workers, down from 6.5m</a>. It will also cost about $70bn, not $130bn.

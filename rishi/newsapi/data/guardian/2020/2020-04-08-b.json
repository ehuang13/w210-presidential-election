Stories of confusion have accompanied the sharp rise in deaths, from cases of mistaken identity to days-long searches for the bodies of loved ones who have passed away. </p> \n  <p>For Mercedes Maroto, the saga began when her mother, Teodora, was admitted to a hospital in central Spain last month. Days later, after a full day had passed without any news, Maroto and her siblings began calling the hospital.</p> \n  <p>It took four attempts before they got a doctor on the line. He informed them that their mother had passed away, Maroto told Spanish newspaper El Mundo.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3a8dff8c6b79a0ae2d2781e97305b61a7e1d932f\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3a8dff8c6b79a0ae2d2781e97305b61a7e1d932f/0_0_5568_3712/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A woman rests in front a shop in Pamplona, northern Spain\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A woman rests in front a shop in Pamplona, northern Spain.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: \u00c1lvaro Barrientos/AP</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n  <p>The news left the family reeling, particularly Maroto\u2019s father. \u201cHe kept repeating, between sobs: \u2018Now what do I do without you?\u2019\u201d</p> \n  <p>After a sleepless night punctuated with questions \u2013 How did she die?

She rushed over to the hospital where a doctor helped her speak to her mother on the phone.</p> \n  <p>While she described it as the \u201cworst experience of her life\u201d, Maroto shied away from casting blame, pointing to the chaos that has taken hold at Spanish hospitals as they scramble to treat the sudden influx of thousands of thousands of Covid-19 patients.</p> \n  <p>Her mother is now home and slowly regaining her strength.

What has been widely reported as the end of Wuhan\u2019s lockdown is somewhat different from his lived experience, he writes: </p> \n  <blockquote> \n   <p>What you\u2019ve seen happen today is the \u2018exit door\u2019 open to allow thousands of people who have been trapped in Wuhan for 76 days to finally go home.<br></p> \n   <p>Life for residents of Wuhan is still more restricted than UK\u2019s so-called lockdown. Each district is controlled by its own local authority so it\u2019s not entirely uniform but the basics are the same.</p> \n   <p>To leave the community residence you need a green health code via an app on your phone. This is tied to your Chinese ID card and logs who you are and where you are. Your temperature is also taken.</p> \n   <p>To use the limited public transport you also need to log in and out using the app. Foreigners don\u2019t have an ID card so they can\u2019t use it.</p> \n   <p>Anyone returning to work also needs a special certificate verifying that the business has been given permission to restart. Otherwise you\u2019re expected to return to your home within two hours.</p> \n   <p>Restaurants, cafes, stores, anywhere that people might gather are still closed.

Drafted into the US army, but fortunate enough to escape a tour of duty in Vietnam, he spent the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2017/may/21/golden-daze-50-years-on-from-summer-of-love-san-francisco-festivals\">Summer of Love</a> stationed in Germany. Prine arrived back in the US at the end of 1967, just as rock music began to leave psychedelic experiments behind and head earthbound again, which suited him just fine.</p> \n  <p>He was born in 1946 and learned to write songs during the early 60s folk revival by imitating the Carter Family. Eighteen months after he returned to civilian life in Chicago, he saw Bob Dylan and Johnny Cash performing together on the latter\u2019s TV show. \u201cI thought the music I was playing and writing, it\u2019d fit straight in-between the two of \u2019em,\u201d he recalled in 2019. \u201cI thought, \u2018That\u2019s exactly where I want to be.\u2019\u201d</p> \n  <p>Almost uniquely among the glut of early 70s singer-songwriters, Prine \u2013 who has died aged 73 \u2013 seemed untouched by the countercultural events of the preceding years: he seemed to tap into an earlier musical tradition, \u201can authentic, rather catchy extension of Nashville and Appalachia\u201d, as critic Robert Christgau noted of Prine\u2019s eponymous 1971 debut album. </p> \n  <p>He was not given to writing starry-eyed paeans to the denizens of the Woodstock festival. His albums never sounded as if they had emerged from the stoned, eucalyptus-scented idyll of Laurel Canyon. There was something tough and austere about them, perhaps because of Prine\u2019s voice \u2013 a rough, artless, nasal rasp that Dylan suggested sounded as if Prine had swallowed a jew\u2019s harp. It got more gravelly as the years progressed and he recovered first from neck, then from lung cancer.</p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/apr/08/john-prine-songwriter-bob-dylan-johnny-cash-bruce-springsteen\">John Prine: this extraordinarily gifted songwriter was the envy of all</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e8d31338f08ec70cecec8b1\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-08T02:12:40.183Z\">3.12am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Rosanne Cash, Johnny Cash\u2019s daughter has tweeted about John Prine\u2019s death: </p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/rosannecash/status/1247706520596463616\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Just give me one thing I can hold on to.

We all denounce racism, that would include the president.\u201d</p> <p>In March 2017, she tried to defend Trump\u2019s frequent golfing by turning the tables on Obama over the killing of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/daniel-pearl\">Daniel Pearl</a>, a Wall Street Journal reporter in Pakistan.</p> <p>\u201cYou had President Obama, who after the \u2013 I believe it was the beheading of Daniel Pearl \u2013 spoke to how upset he was about that, then rushed off to a golf game,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2017/03/28/pro-trump-pundit-accuses-obama-of-golfing-after-daniel-pearls-slaying-in-2002/\">she claimed on CNN.</a> \u201cI think when we\u2019re in a state of war, when we\u2019re in a state of mourning, you should take time off from the golf course.\u201d</p> <p>But when Pearl died in 2002, Obama was still a state senator. McEnany subsequently apologised, explaining she meant to say <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/james-foley\">James Foley</a>, a photojournalist kidnapped in Syria and beheaded by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/isis\">Islamic State</a> in 2014.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/01/20/president-trump-made-16241-false-or-misleading-claims-his-first-three-years/\">According to a Washington Post count,</a> Trump made 16,241 false or misleading claims in his first three years in office. But on 28 August 2019, McEnany told CNN\u2019s Chris Cuomo: \u201cNo. I don\u2019t believe the president has lied.\u201d</p> <p>And taking her cue from the president, McEnany played down the threat of the coronavirus. On Trish Regan\u2019s Fox Business Network show in late February, she praised Trump\u2019s partial Chinese travel ban <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AaronBlake/status/1247543589833527297?s=20\">and asserted:</a> \u201cWe will not see diseases like the coronavirus come here. And isn\u2019t it refreshing when contrasting it with the awful presidency of President Obama?\u201d</p> <p>Regan later parted ways with the network after calling the coronavirus an \u201cimpeachment scam\u201d. McEnany has been rewarded with a senior job at the White House.</p> <p>On 28 February, McEnany appeared on Fox News. \u201cWhat is bad for America is good for Democrats. It\u2019s incredible that they think this way. They root against the stock market. They root for this [coronavirus] to take hold. They have a demented dream of taking down President Trump. It doesn\u2019t matter how many Americans they destroy in order to get there.\u201d</p> <p>On 11 March, with the Democratic <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-elections-2020\">presidential</a> candidate <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/joebiden\">Joe Biden</a> and then candidate <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/bernie-sanders\">Bernie Sanders</a> having cancelled campaign rallies, she was asked on the Fox Business Network whether Trump would follow suit. She wasn\u2019t worried, she insisted. \u201cLook, we have the commander-in-chief, we have the best health experts, we are taking it day by day, we are currently proceeding as normal,\u201d McEnany said.</p> <p>\u201cAnd look, Joe Biden, he\u2019s suspending his rallies. He\u2019s been dying to get off the campaign trail. The man can only speak for seven minutes \u2026 The media\u2019s best hope is for Donald Trump to suspend his rallies \u2026 they know it\u2019s his avenue to speak directly to the American people.\u201d</p> <p>Later that day, the Trump campaign did cancel rallies.</p> <p>Meanwhile, when it comes to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change\">climate crisis</a>, McEnany has a history of denying the scientific consensus that humans are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/mar/10/climate-emergency-global-action-way-off-track-says-un-head-coronavirus\">heating the planet</a>, primarily by burning fossil fuels.</p> <p>In 2014, when climate protesters marched during a cold winter in Washington DC, McEnany told Fox News: \u201cThe science is not settled, so let\u2019s stop the liberal hysteria, take a break from the protesting, go get some hot cocoa, sit inside.\u201d</p> <p>The Fox host Neil Cavuto and McEnany laughed as an Occidental College professor explained that the vast majority of qualified climatologists agreed on the climate threat.</p> <p>McEnany countered that \u201cin the 1970s it was global cooling\u201d and \u201cthey always change the verbiage. It\u2019s the verbiage to justify the liberal mechanisms that they would like to put in place.\u201d</p> <p>McEnany also claimed corruption of the scientific process, saying: \u201cLet\u2019s be real. Who\u2019s getting the grants? Who are the liberal universities giving the grants to? Of course it\u2019s going to be people who buy into the fact that global warming does exist.\u201d</p> <p>More recently, McEnany has shifted to focusing on the costs of addressing the climate crisis.</p> <p>In February, McEnany <a href=\"https://twitter.com/kayleighmcenany/status/1225979282574454784?s=20\">tweeted</a> that the Democratic plan for climate change was \u201cto eliminate more than 1 million jobs in America by eliminating the fossil fuel industry.

But his long-sought political revolution never quite arrived. Though Sanders made gains with Latino voters, he struggled to expand his appeal to black voters and young voters did not turn out in the numbers he hoped.</p> \n<p>\u201cYour fight for progressive ideas moved the conversation and charted a path for candidates and activists that will change the course of our country and party,\u201d Warren said on Twitter.</p> \n<p>Moderate Buttigieg, who sparred mightily with Sanders, called the senator a \u201ctremendous force\u201d in US politics.</p>",
  "<h2>Eire salutes the republic</h2> <p><strong>Day of modified rejoicing: two sorts of disapproval and a mass of indifference</strong><br>From our special correspondent<br>18 April 1949</p> <p><em>Dublin, Monday, 1 am<br></em>The first ceremonies to mark the promulgation of the Republic of Ireland Act to-day took place in Dublin at midnight, when a salute of 21 guns and a feu de joie were fired from O\u2019Connell Bridge. The main civil, military, and religious ceremonies are at noon to-day at the Pro-Cathedral and at the General Post Office in Dublin.</p> <p>Dublin is crowded, though not all the visitors are \u201cup for the Republic,\u201d and not more than one in ten is wearing any of the Republican emblems which are being hawked in the streets. Although the crowds were calm throughout the day they became a little more excited towards midnight and collected in thousands round O\u2019Connell Bridge. At 11 45 p.m. it seemed impossible that the guns, riflemen, and band would ever get into position, for the crowd had overflowed rather than forced its way past the police cordon and had occupied all the open space which should have held the ceremonial troops.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/dec/20/republic-fight-irish-independence-townshend-review\">The Republic: the Fight for Irish Independence 1918-1923 by Charles Townshend \u2013 review</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>A republic is born</strong><br>In spite of this there was a delay of only two minutes in the start of the ceremony. The guns flashed and boomed, firing across O\u2019Connell Bridge in the direction of Liberty Hall, which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/from-the-archive-blog/2016/mar/30/1916-easter-rising-guardian-reports-archive\">in 1916 was shelled by British guns</a> which were not loaded with blank rounds. After the salute riflemen performed their feu de joie, the band played the national anthem, and the crowd began to disperse, waving flags, cheering, and singing. For once a republic had been born without bloodshed \u2013 at least in this case the blood had been shed 33 years ago.</p> <p>At Dun Laoghaire the ceremony was rather more naval than military. A flag was raised at the end of one of the piers and was illuminated by searchlights from craft in the harbour. A naval guard of honour presented arms and the National Anthem was played.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"d36c03f57bc77372cfb0a9d51880552a9ffe039a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d36c03f57bc77372cfb0a9d51880552a9ffe039a/0_0_2656_3924/677..jpg\" alt=\"Sean T Kelly, president of Ireland, takes the salute at the parade celebrating Ireland\u2019s status as an independent republic, 1949.\" width=\"677\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sean T Kelly, president of Ireland, takes the salute at the parade celebrating Ireland\u2019s status as an independent republic, 1949.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bettmann Archive</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Irish military genius, which has so often been expended in the service of other nations (especially of England), will have a chance to express itself in the march past the President outside the General Post Office. The parade will be partly mechanised and will include a unit of the small naval service, two battalions of the local defence force, infantry, anti-aircraft gunners, sappers, signallers, field artillery, and a field ambulance. The centrepiece of the ceremony will be the hoisting of the tricolour on the Post Office, where it flew for those few days in 1916 which made the Republic of to-day possible.</p> <p>Although to-day marks an important step in Eire\u2019s national evolution the celebrations are being taken calmly by most people and coldly by some. The public buildings \u2013 except for the Post Office \u2013 are not decorated; the Dublin Corporation thought it inappropriate to spend even the product of a farthing rate on marking an occasion of which so many members disapproved. No flags have appeared on Trinity College, but the tricolour is flying almost everywhere else with the Papal Flag and the banners of the four provinces \u2013 so even Ulster is playing a part.</p> <p>There have been rumours that some young extremists might put up a counter-demonstration to mark disapproval of partition but even this anti-partitionist feeling is not being very loudly proclaimed, and the only anti-British slogans to be seen are chalked up in Irish on the walls. They call for an end to the use of the English language. The celebrations have also incurred the disapproval of those who are less than Unionists but who are still aware of what Eire gained from the slender Commonwealth connection. This feeling is strong but not organised. Between these two wings there are the people, probably the majority, who do not care one way or the other.</p> <p>The atmosphere is, then, not exactly jubilant here, and if it were not for the marching soldiers, the artillery salutes, and the fireworks to-day would pass like any other Bank Holiday and certainly not like a national festival</p> <p><strong>Fianna Fail stands aloof</strong><br>It might have been a different matter if the Fianna Fail party were not withholding its support, and if Mr De Valera were at the saluting base (he is taking no part in the celebrations). But the Coalition Government has not found it easy to work up enthusiasm for a constitutional change which was not part of its mandate from the voters in the last general election, and which, it has been suggested, would hardly have got a majority in the country if it had been put to the test of a referendum; even the 1937 Constitution, which was Republican in everything but name, was not passed by an overwhelming majority, and things have changed in Western Europe since then.</p> <p>But to-day the political differences may sink below the surface for an hour, and the achievement of the 1916 leaders may be remembered in its historic rather than in its party context. They and not the present Government will be in the minds of to-day\u2019s crowds \u2013 at least among the people who have any sense of Ireland\u2019s past and what it was that Pearse, Connolly, MacDonagh, and the others died for.</p> <h2>Truncheons out in Tyrone</h2> <p>18 Apri 1949</p> <p>In the village of Carrickmore, County Tyrone (Northern Ireland), 500 young men who had assembled yesterday for a Gaelic football match were warned by the police that they could not march in procession.

Several men were injured.</p> <h2>Editorial: The Republic</h2> <p>18 April 1949</p> <p>The new chapter in Irish history begins to-day without interrupting the flow of life more than a birthday or a silver wedding. <a href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo6/12-13-14/41\">The Republic of Ireland Act</a> and the consequent withdrawal of Eire from the Commonwealth are generally regretted here, but more regretted than resented; one does not have to be very deeply versed in Irish affairs to know something of the inner compulsions which move her statesmen. Though the struggle which made the Republic possible ended nearly thirty years ago and its echoes have died away, to-day\u2019s leaders took their share in it as young men; it was for most of them the great, the formative, experience of their lives; they found themselves moved by irresistible currents of courage and generous idealism.</p> <blockquote> <p>All changed, changed utterly; <br>A terrible beauty is born.</p> </blockquote> <p>Such a struggle generates deeper passions than served to start it, and these have run too deep to be satisfied with an outcome which might have been welcome enough if it had been more easily reached. They have run their course at last. The companions and disciples of Pearse and Connolly may turn now with a clear conscience to the not less pressing social problems of their country, and to its proper place among the free nations of the world. It will be well if they can apply to these the same spirit of selfless service which moved their old leaders at Easter, 1916.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/sep/16/united-ireland-brexit-irish-unification-back-on-agenda\">Talk of a united Ireland is rife.

The only part of the ceremony which seemed to make any emotional impression on the spectators was the hoisting of the tricolour on the General Post Office in O\u2019Connell Street, where thirty-three years ago the Easter rising began. When the flag went up it was greeted with cheers and waving hats and small banners. There was for the moment a touch of the fervency which broke out when the guns were fired at midnight on O\u2019Connell Bridge.</p> <p>But the parade which followed the flag-raising, put on with the utmost military efficiency, seemed to leave the spectators unmoved, though they roused themselves to a few ragged cheers and handclaps when the naval detachment marched past with a decided swagger. This does not mean that Dublin was not enjoying the parade; it seems to be a characteristic of an Irish crowd that although it enjoys the pomp and circumstance of soldiering and watches with an expert eye it will not rise to the occasion by throwing metaphorical caps over imaginary windmills.</p> <p><strong>A brave display</strong><br>Even a regimental sergeant major of the Brigade of Guards could not have found much fault with the turnout and drill of the troops, and he might well have searched for a superlative to describe the smartness of the presidential guard of honour of officer cadets.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"eac692c12bef0066f64015a3e6f36b122cc331b3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/eac692c12bef0066f64015a3e6f36b122cc331b3/0_0_1672_2048/816..jpg\" alt=\"Ireland\u2019s president Sean O\u2019Kelly reviewing the guard of honour on Easter Sunday, Ireland\u2019s independence day.\" width=\"816\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ireland\u2019s president Sean O\u2019Kelly reviewing the guard of honour on Easter Sunday, Ireland\u2019s independence day.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Larry Burrows/The LIFE Picture Collection via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/biography/Sean-T-OKelly\">President O\u2019Kelly </a>sat on his stand in front of the Post Office surrounded by the Diplomatic Corps and other distinguished guests. who had arrived in a procession of unusually democratic appearance. The top hat, the cocked hat, the trilby and the cloth cap marched together; the shining dress uniform of the soldier (and even of the senior policeman) walked with the academic robe, the municipal gown, and the well-worn lounge suit \u2013 and there were, of course, priests of various orders in black clerical suits or the brown habits and sandals of the friars.</p> <p>There was no single figure to catch the imagination of the crowd, though there was a ripple of applause for <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W._T._Cosgrave\">Mr Cosgrave</a> and an affectionate cheer for Alderman \u201cAlfie\u201d Byrne, Dublin\u2019s most famous ex-Lord Mayor.

It was not so much Hamlet without the Prince as a large and loyal family without any father \u2013 but perhaps it is a virtue of the republican idea that there is no individual on whom the crowd can fix its eyes and swoon.</p> <p>After the ceremonies the Taoiseach held a press conference in the main hail of the post office \u2013 the hall which was the nerve-centre of the Easter rising \u2013 in which he said nothing which has not been said often before on the subject of partition and of the longing (south of the border) for a united Ireland. It was not an occasion for profound statements of policy, but later in the day in a broadcast Mr Costello said what must have been in the minds of many Irishmen to-day:</p> <blockquote> <p>We have put ourselves apart but not cut ourselves adrift from our former association with the great nations of the Commonwealth. We have severed the formal links but have not sundered the intangible bonds that exist between us. We hope for a closer and more harmonious association, based on community of interests and common ideals, than could have ever existed from formal ties.</p> </blockquote> <p><em>This is an edited extract.</em></p> <h2>Atlantic Pact and partition</h2> <p>Chicago, April 18</p> <p>Mr Sean MacBride, Foreign Minister of Eire, said here to-night that if Ireland joined the Atlantic Pact while partitioned she would almost certainly face the threat of a civil war in the event of a crisis.</p> <p>Ireland was in complete agreement with the objects of the Atlantic Pact, but had not joined it because it included a military alliance. This was an insuperable obstacle because some of the Irish counties were occupied by British forces. There were also strategic objections, for only a single central authority, supported by the decisive majority of the population could undertake Ireland\u2019s defence.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Click to read.\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://theguardian.newspapers.com/clip/48179562/&quot; style=&quot;text-decoration: none;display:block;&quot; target=&quot;_parent&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://img.newspapers.com/img/img?id=259412722&amp;width=700&amp;height=340&amp;crop=879_280_3489_2015&amp;rotation=0&amp;brightness=0&amp;contrast=0&amp;invert=0&amp;ts=1586264980&amp;h=cce304c0fee6f91609a368527065a09e&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;max-width:100%;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;display:block;font: 13px helvetica, sans-serif; color: #747474;padding: 4px 0;max-width: 700px;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;  The Guardian, 19 April 1949.&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> <figcaption>Click to read.</figcaption> </figure>",

This new one is deadly too. Last night a 61-year old man died in a Wuhan hospital, the first known victim.</p> \n<p>At this stage the official caseload is falling.

More than 800 infections have been detected there and 25 people are dead.</p> \n<p>The city is the first to experience the full glare of the outbreak: rapid increases in caseloads, hospitals under severe strain and an entire population quarantined.</p> \n<p>The virus arrives in Europe, detected in two recent arrivals from China and a relative. The trio have had dozens of contacts and French authorities say they are racing to track down possible cases. \u201cYou have to treat an epidemic as you treat a fire,\u201d says the French health minister, Agn\u00e8s Buzyn.</p> \n<p>Trump received his first media question about the virus while in Davos two days ago.

  "<p>Donald Trump hunted for a new scapegoat on Tuesday in an increasingly frantic attempt to shift blame for thousands of American deaths from the coronavirus, accusing the World Health Organization (WHO) of having \u201ccalled it wrong\u201d and being \u201cChina-centric\u201d.</p> \n<p>The US president contradicted himself within minutes, first vowing to put \u201ca very powerful hold\u201d on his government\u2019s funding of the WHO, then insisting such a freeze was only under consideration.</p> \n<p>Trump\u2019s early inaction has come under renewed scrutiny in the past day after<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/06/us/politics/navarro-warning-trump-coronavirus.html\"> a New York Times report</a> that Peter Navarro, Trump\u2019s trade adviser, warned in a memo in late January that the virus could put millions of Americans at risk and cost trillions of dollars. Susan Rice, a former national security adviser, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/04/06/susan-rice-trumps-coronavirus-response-he-has-cost-tens-thousands-american-lives/\">told the Washington Post</a> that Trump\u2019s missteps \u201ccost tens of thousands of American lives\u201d.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/07/donald-trump-coronavirus-memos-warning-peter-navarro\">Trump was warned in January of Covid-19's devastating impact, memos reveal</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The president has repeatedly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/07/donald-trump-coronavirus-memos-warning-peter-navarro\">denied responsibility</a> and sought to blame China, the Obama administration and the media. On Tuesday, with the US death toll exceeding 12,000, he unleashed a tirade at the WHO, even though it raised the alarm in January, after which he made statements downplaying it and comparing it to the common flu.</p> \n<p>\u201cThey\u2019ve been wrong about a lot of things,\u201d Trump said at the daily White House coronavirus task force briefing. \u201cAnd they had a lot of information early and they didn\u2019t want to \u2013 they seemed to be very China centric\u201d \u2013 implying that the WHO had toed the line of Beijing\u2019s early efforts to minimise the scale of the outbreak.</p> \n<p>Shaking his head peevishly, he added: \u201cThey called it wrong, they called it wrong. They missed the call. They could have called it months earlier. They would have known and they should have known and they probably did know. So we\u2019ll be looking into that very carefully and we\u2019re going to put a hold on money spent<strong> </strong>[sic] to the WHO.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to put a very powerful hold on it and we\u2019re going to see. It\u2019s a great thing if it works but when they call every shot wrong, it\u2019s not good.\u201d</p> \n<p>But soon after, Trump was asked if the middle of a pandemic was the time to suspend money for the WHO. \u201cNo, maybe not,\u201d he replied, backtracking from his earlier remark. \u201cI\u2019m not saying I\u2019m going to do it but we\u2019re going to look at.\u201d</p> \n<p>A reporter interjected: \u201cYou did say that \u2013\u201d</p> \n<p>Trump retorted: \u201cNo, I didn\u2019t, I said we\u2019re going to look at it. We\u2019re going to investigate it, we\u2019re going to look at it. But we will look at ending funding, yeah, because you know what, they called it wrong, and if you look back over the years even, everything seems to be very biased toward China. That\u2019s not right.\u201d</p> \n<p>The WHO declared Covid-19 a public health emergency on 30 January, nearly a month before Trump tweeted: \u201cThe Coronavirus is very much under control in the USA\u201d, and proclaimed: \u201cOne day \u2013 it\u2019s like a miracle - it will disappear.\u201d He eventually declared a national emergency on 13 March.</p> \n<p>Trump has long been sceptical about multinational organisations. In its most recent budget proposal, in February, his administration requested a reduction of the American contribution to the WHO from an estimated $122.6m to $57.9m.</p> \n<p>On Tuesday, the president also played down January and February memos from Navarro, saying he had not seen them at the time but did \u201cmore or less\u201d what his trade adviser suggested by imposing travel restrictions on China. (<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/04/us/coronavirus-china-travel-restrictions.html\">It was reported this week</a> that nearly 40,000 people have flown from China to the US since the partial ban came into effect on 2 February.)</p> \n<p>He would not have wanted to act prematurely, Trump added, when it was not clear how bad the situation would become. \u201cI don\u2019t want to create havoc and shock and everything else. I\u2019m not going to go out and start screaming: \u2018This could happen, this could happen.\u2019 I\u2019m a cheerleader for this country.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"8ecfde462d6e6c35f4993232c39f42e3b2d0735c\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8ecfde462d6e6c35f4993232c39f42e3b2d0735c/0_0_4461_3138/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Voters wait in line to cast their ballots in the Wisconsin presidential primary election.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"703\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Voters wait in line to cast their ballots in the Wisconsin presidential primary election.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tannen Maury/EPA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Meanwhile Wisconsin <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/07/wisconsin-votes-controversial-election-coronavirus-us-election-2020\">went ahead with an in-person primary election</a> on Tuesday after Republicans and the US and state supreme courts blocked efforts to postpone it. Trump declined to criticise the move and claimed, without evidence, that mail-in voting is rife with fraud.</p> \n<p>\u201cMail ballots are a very dangerous thing for this country because they\u2019re cheaters,\u201d he said. \u201cThey go and collect them, they\u2019re fraudulent in many cases, you gotta vote \u2026 The mail ballots are corrupt in my opinion.\u201d</p> \n<p>When it was pointed out that Trump himself used a mail ballot to vote in last month\u2019s Florida primary, he retorted: \u201cBecause I\u2019m allowed to. That\u2019s called out of state. You know why I voted? Because I happen to be in the White House and I won\u2019t be able to go to Florida and vote.\u201d</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://slack-redir.net/link?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.brennancenter.org%2Fanalysis%2Fdebunking-voter-fraud-myth\">Research</a> has found that voter fraud is virtually nonexistent. In the five states that have moved to an entirely vote-by-mail systems, there has been no evidence of widespread fraud. Sean Eldridge, the founder of the grassroots community organisation Stand Up America, said: \u201cTrump\u2019s baseless attacks on vote-by-mail are a pathetic attempt to suppress the vote in the middle of a national crisis. He is demanding that voters choose between protecting their health and participating in our democracy.\u201d</p> \n<p>He added: \u201cTrump himself voted absentee in the last two elections. His comments tonight show he is a liar and a hypocrite. Congress must intervene now to provide states with the resources they need to implement mail-in voting, online registration and expanded early voting.\u201d</p> \n<p>Evidence is also emerging that people of colour have been <a href=\"https://crooked.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=8855a23519ab892dfe2cd34f6&amp;id=b97560aa46&amp;e=cf0c47e66f\">hit disproportionately hard by</a><strong> </strong>the virus for socioeconomic reasons and vulnerability due to underlying conditions.

Last week the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) provided the drug with an \u201cemergency use authorization\u201d to use on coronavirus patients in some circumstances. State officials in New York have said that about 4,000 seriously ill patients are now being treated with the drug. But experts say it\u2019s too early to call it a cure. </p> <p><strong>What is hydroxychloroquine?</strong><br></p> <p>Hydroxychloroquine, also known by its brand name, Plaquenil, is a drug used to treat malaria. It is a less toxic version of chloroquine, another malaria drug, which itself is related to quinine, an ingredient in tonic water.</p> <p>It is also readily available to Americans \u2013 already approved as a malaria and anti-inflammation treatment by the FDA \u2013 where it is an off-the-shelf drug with various low-cost generic versions. Despite the emergency use order, the FDA has not conducted clinical trials to fully ascertain whether the drug is an effective treatment for Covid-19.</p> <p><strong>Why is Trump touting it?</strong></p> <p>Trump was influenced by a widely publicized study in France where 40 coronavirus patients were given hydroxychloroquine, with more than half experiencing the clearing of their airways within three to six days. This apparent improvement is important as it would curtail the timeframe in which infected people could spread Covid-19 to others.</p> <p>However, experts have warned that the study is small and lacks sufficient rigor to be classed as evidence of a potential treatment. The French health ministry has warned against the use of hydroxychloroquine for Covid-19, with Olivier V\u00e9ran, France\u2019s health minister, saying that it shouldn\u2019t be used by anyone with the exception of \u201cserious forms of hospitalization and on the collegial decision of doctors and under strict medical supervision\u201d.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-07T22:45:23.093Z\">at 11.45pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5e8cff588f08008f0919edd3\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-07T22:37:08.967Z\">11.37pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Trump is again touting hydroxychloroquine, an anti-malarial drug, which has not yet been proven effective against the coronavirus. </p> <p>The repeated a story about a Democratic state lawmaker who credits hydroxychloroquine and Trump for her recovery from Covid-19. \u201cI really think it\u2019s a great thing to try, just based on what I know,\u201d he said. \u201cAgain, I\u2019m not a doctor.

For three weeks, I had been quarantined in my apartment in DC-- away from everyone, including my family, who has been home in Miami. It has not been an easy journey. There were moments when I thought I was recovering, but then the fever would return. Thankfully, I never experienced shortness of breath, difficulty breathing, or issues with my heart. I treated my symptoms with Tylenol and a lot of rest. I want to share my experience to emphasize the seriousness of this virus and reiterate that you should continue to follow CDC and local health guidelines, including social distancing. I have no idea how, when, or where I was exposed to the virus, despite being extremely careful and constantly washing and sanitizing my hands. On Sunday, after being deemed Coronavirus-free by my doctor, I was able to reunite with my family in Miami. While still a little weak, I feel well. I applied to donate my plasma to help those suffering from #COVID19 infections. If you have also recovered from the virus, I encourage you to sign up to donate\u2014it could save a life. I reiterate my profound gratitude to the nurses, scientists, doctors, first responders, our military, and all the men and women on the frontlines of this pandemic. We will always be thankful for their heroism, sacrifice, courage, and dedication.</a></p> <p style=\" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;\">A post shared by <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/repmariodb/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" style=\" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px;\" target=\"_blank\"> Congressman Mario Diaz-Balart</a> (@repmariodb) on <time style=\" font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;\" datetime=\"2020-04-07T18:20:58+00:00\">Apr 7, 2020 at 11:20am PDT</time></p></div></blockquote> <script async src=\"//www.instagram.com/embed.js\"></script> </figure>  <p>Congressman <strong>Mario Diaz-Balart </strong>said he has reunited with his family in Miami after spending three weeks in Washington as he recovered from the virus.</p> <p>\u201cIt has not been an easy journey,\u201d the congressman wrote in an Instagram post. \u201cThere were moments when I thought I was recovering, but then the fever would return.

They show that even within the Trump administration alarm bells were ringing loudly by late January, at a time when the president was consistently <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/04/trump-coronavirus-science-analysis\">downplaying</a> the threat of Covid-19.</p> <p>The memos, <strong>first reported by the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/06/us/politics/navarro-warning-trump-coronavirus.html?action=click&amp;module=Spotlight&amp;pgtype=Homepage\">New York Times</a> and <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/exclusive-navarro-deaths-coronavirus-memos-january-da3f08fb-dce1-4f69-89b5-ea048f8382a9.html\">Axios</a></strong>, were written by Navarro on 29 January and 23 February. The first memo, composed on the day Trump set up a White House coronavirus task force, gave a worst-case scenario of the virus killing more than half a million Americans.</p> <p>According to the Times, it said: \u201cThe lack of immune protection or an existing cure or vaccine would leave Americans defenseless in the case of a full-blown coronavirus outbreak on US soil. This lack of protection elevates the risk of the coronavirus evolving into a full-blown pandemic, imperiling the lives of millions of Americans.\u201d</p> <p>The second memo went even further, predicting that a Covid-19 pandemic, left unchecked, could kill 1.2m Americans and infect as many as 100m.</p> <p>This was not the first time Trump and his White House team were warned that the virus had the potential to devastate the US and needed to be dealt with quickly and firmly. Senior scientists, epidemiologists, and health emergency experts in the US and around the world delivered that message clearly early on in the crisis, only for Trump to continue belittling the scale of the threat which he compared falsely to the dangers of <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/03/24/trump-again-downplays-coronavirus-by-comparing-it-seasonal-flu-its-not-fair-comparison/\">seasonal flu</a>.</p> <p>But the emergence of the memos from such a senior aide within the White House will make it much more difficult for Trump to claim \u2013 as he has done on <a href=\"https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2020/03/30/trump_on_coronavirus_nobody_could_have_predicted_something_like_this.html\">multiple occasions</a> \u2013 that nobody was able to predict the severity of the disease.

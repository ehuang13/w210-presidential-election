However, with 84% of today\u2019s 1,032 new cases and 67% of the national total located in the capital, the health minister <strong>Jaime Ma\u00f1alich</strong> has taken to referring ominously to the situation as the \u201cbattle for Santiago\u201d.</p> \n  <p>According to official statistics released by the health ministry, Chile had largely kept its epidemic under control. However, the country now has 23,048 confirmed cases and 281 people have died having tested positive.</p> \n  <p>Chile has maintained the highest level of testing in Latin America with more than 230,000 tests carried out. And the government has suggested an increase in testing could have contributed to the recent uptick in cases.</p> \n  <p>But the pandemic has also pushed out of the wealthier western suburbs of Santiago into more deprived, poorer-equipped areas of the capital. And the government has announced that 12 more districts will go into quarantine from Friday as part of its \u201cdynamic\u201d approach to enforcing and lifting lockdowns.</p> \n  <p>Checkpoints will also be set up around the nearby coastal cities of Vi\u00f1a del Mar and Valpara\u00edso \u2013 the country\u2019s second-largest population centre \u2013 where cases are currently far lower than in the capital.</p> \n  <p>Amid the rise in cases, the government has also softened its rhetoric with regard to a passport-style scheme that it had said would certify \u201cimmunity\u201d. A WHO directive has since urged caution regarding such policies.</p> \n  <p>Nonetheless, the government has said the first cards will be issued on Friday, although they will simply confirm that a person has tested positive for the virus, not that they are immune.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-06T18:49:32.198Z\">at 7.49pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5eb3011f8f08597eeb1b7403\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-06T18:42:03.149Z\">7.42pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Iceland has all but eliminated the virus as 97% of infected patients have recovered and only two new cases have been confirmed in the last week, the country\u2019s chief epidemiologist <strong>Thorolfur Gudnason</strong> has said.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We have been pleasantly surprised to see a very fast deceleration of the pandemic in Iceland.

That suggests that the virus was already being transmitted extensively around the globe from early on in the epidemic. </p> \n  <p>Balloux said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>All viruses naturally mutate. Mutations in themselves are not a bad thing and there is nothing to suggest SARS-CoV-2 is mutating faster or slower than expected.</p> \n   <p>So far we cannot say whether SARS-CoV-2 is becoming more or less lethal and contagious.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Balloux said the 198 small genetic changes, or mutations, that the study identified appeared to have independently occurred more than once. </p> \n  <p>These may hold clues to how the virus is adapting and help in efforts to develop drugs and vaccines. Ballouz explained:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>A major challenge to defeating viruses is that a vaccine or drug might no longer be effective if the virus has mutated. </p> \n   <p>If we focus our efforts on parts of the virus that are less likely to mutate, we have a better chance of developing drugs that will be effective in the long run.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>The UCL team\u2019s findings, published on Wednesday in the journal Infection, Genetics and Evolution, confirm that the virus emerged in late 2019, Balloux said, before quickly spreading across the globe. </p> \n  <p>The study was not able to confirm the exact starting point or location. </p> \n  <p>A study by <strong>French scientists</strong> published earlier this week found <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/04/french-hospital-discovers-covid-19-case-december-retested\">a man there was infected with Covid-19 as early as 27 December</a>, nearly a month before France confirmed its first cases. <br></p> \n  <p> The <strong>World Health Organization</strong> said the French case was \u201cnot surprising\u201d and urged countries to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/05/who-seeks-early-coronavirus-cases-as-merkel-warns-over-german-lockdown\">investigate any other early suspicious cases</a>. </p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5eb2913a8f084fb5ab57d176\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-06T10:33:23.726Z\">11.33am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Twitter</strong> said it would tackle the spread of damaging conspiracy theories linking mobile phone technology and coronavirus with a prompt to direct people searching for 5G to British government-verified information. </p> \n  <p>The theory, which has spread on social media, has resulted in attacks on mobile telecoms masts and abuse directed at engineers in <strong>Britain</strong>. </p> \n  <p>Scientists, phone companies and the government have said it is completely untrue. </p> \n  <p>Twitter said the search prompt would inform users that the government had seen no link between 5G and Covid-19, and include a link to a government website with credible, factual and verified information in relation to 5G. </p> \n  <p>Katy Minshall, Twitter UK\u2019s head of government, public policy and philanthropy, said the move was the latest step in its focus on connecting people with authoritative information regarding Covid-19. </p> \n  <p>\u201cOur partnerships throughout this pandemic have allowed us to take proactive steps in bringing people the information most relevant and useful for them,\u201d she said. </p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e555962df387d1ecb97d8a5465f2d04a1df7d65c\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e555962df387d1ecb97d8a5465f2d04a1df7d65c/0_0_5568_3340/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A burned down mobile phone mast in London.

One of them saved the Union and created the model for the muscular federal government we know today; the other got impeached for corrupting that government for his personal profit.</p> <p>One gave his life to unite the country and free it from slavery. The other wants tens of thousands of Americans to give up their lives to free the country from lockdown.</p> <p>One was known as Honest Abe. The other <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-cohen/fbi-documents-point-to-trump-role-in-hush-money-for-porn-star-daniels-idUSKCN1UD18D\">lied</a> about paying off porn stars with hush money. You can see how they confused the two.</p> <p>To be fair, presidents in times of crisis often reach for the same analogy.

Barack Obama all but wore a stovepipe hat as he quoted <a href=\"https://time.com/4178331/state-union-barack-obama-abraham-lincoln/\">liberally</a> from the Great Emancipator in a career of speeches ranging from his campaign announcement to his presidential inauguration to his final State of the Union.</p> <p>To be less fair, Donald Trump somehow missed the entire point of Lincoln while sitting inside a secular temple to one of the greatest presidents of them all.</p> <p>When asked by a fan if he couldn\u2019t tone down his bullying \u2013 if only to help the world understand what a great leader he is \u2013 Trump sailed on by like a <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/28/world/asteroid-earth-flyby-1998-or2-scn-trnd/index.html\">giant</a> asteroid spinning on its thoughtless journey through the galaxy.</p> <p>\u201cI am greeted with a hostile press the likes of which no president has ever seen,\u201d said the gas-filled lump of rock. \u201cThe closest would be that gentleman right up there. They always said Lincoln \u2013 nobody got treated worse than Lincoln. I believe I am treated worse.\u201d Frankly Lincoln had it easy. Apart from that night at the theater, and that blood-drenched civil war. Not like the Trump presidency, where every hour brings another nasty word or two from a talking head on cable news.</p> <p>Sitting at the feet of Honest Abe, Trump naturally lied about why he was even there. \u201cYou know, I didn\u2019t know that it was creating criticism,\u201d he innocently explained to his softball interviewers at Fox News. \u201cBut I thought it was your choice, not ours.\u201d</p> <p>This must have been news to Fox News, whose executives <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/04/us/politics/trump-lincoln-memorial.html\">confirmed</a> that it was the Trump White House that wanted him to be seated inside the Lincoln Memorial. In fact, they wanted it so badly they changed the federal rules to allow Trump to speak inside the inner sanctum.</p> <p>Their official reason? It\u2019s the pandemic, stupid: \u201cGiven the extraordinary crisis that the American people have endured, and the need for the president to exercise a core governmental function to address the nation about an ongoing public health crisis,\u201d explained Trump\u2019s interior secretary, David Bernhardt.</p> <p>As it happens, the American people have endured only the start of this extraordinary crisis. If this president could exercise any core governmental function \u2013 or any core brain function \u2013 America\u2019s ongoing public health crisis would look far less deadly.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The total American death toll is likely to be around 134,000 by early August \u2013 but could also reach double that figure</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Instead, Trump\u2019s own experts \u2013 if that\u2019s not a political paradox \u2013 are predicting 3,000 deaths a day by early June. According to a CDC document <a href=\"https://int.nyt.com/data/documenthelper/6926-mayhhsbriefing/af7319f4a55fd0ce5dc9/optimized/full.pdf#page=1\">leaked</a> to the New York Times, instead of flattening the curve, America is building a Trump Tower of new infections over the next month.</p> <p>Those stunning numbers are in fact the middle range of the new projections, which could be as high as 10,000 deaths a day. Independent modeling by the University of Washington\u2019s Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation <a href=\"https://covid19.healthdata.org/united-states-of-america\">suggest</a> the total American death toll is likely to be around 134,000 by early August \u2013 but could also reach double that figure.</p> <p>Since we\u2019re indulging in historical comparisons, that\u2019s more than the number of Union <a href=\"https://ehistory.osu.edu/exhibitions/cwsurgeon/cwsurgeon/statistics\">soldiers</a> Lincoln lost in combat. It\u2019s more than America lost in the first world war. It\u2019s the equivalent of a 9/11 massacre every day, just one month from now.</p> <p>Why are the numbers rising so sharply? Not, as Trump likes to claim, because of China. Not because the experts are too pessimistic with their public health models. But because so many governors are following Trump\u2019s toxic mix of arrogance and ignorance to relax their own lockdowns. This is a deadly pattern of dunce-like leadership. Instead of suppressing coronavirus spread in January and February, Trump obsessed about his own job survival. Instead of surging medical supplies in March, Trump <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/17/how-trump-shifted-his-tone-on-coronavirus-134246\">claimed</a> he was doing a great job on this whole pandemic thing. Instead of figuring out contact tracing in April, he <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/05/01/politics/donald-trump-michigan-gretchen-whitmer-protests/index.html\">encouraged</a> armed protesters to pressure for an end to lockdown. Trump has brought a whole new meaning to the concept of killing time.</p> <p>Soon the rock-solid Trump voters in previously Republican states will understand the true cost of Trump\u2019s leadership. Trump\u2019s partisan blame game will fall apart before Memorial Day. The most recent <a href=\"https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/texas/\">polling</a> in Texas suggests Trump is now tied with Joe Biden in a state he won by nine points in 2016.</p> <p>These are the kind of numbers \u2013 not the death toll \u2013 that keep Trump up at night. It was past one in the morning on Tuesday, when Dishonest Don rage-tweeted against a group of former Republican operatives who call themselves the Lincoln Project.</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019re all LOSERS, but Abe Lincoln, Republican is all smiles,\u201d our Lincoln expert <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1257532114666508291\">tweeted</a>, in a rhetorical flourish that evoked Gettysburg.</p> <p>What peeved the great insomniac in the executive mansion where Lincoln once slept? <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/feb/28/lincoln-project-donald-trump-cooper-union-rick-wilson\">The Lincoln Project</a> crossed a bright red line by remaking the epic 1984 re-election ad about how Reagan had made America great again.</p> <p>Like most Trumpian tales, it is a parody of the presidency.

New York voters, she said, weren\u2019t just voting for a presidential candidate, but also for delegates who could influence the direction of the Democratic National Convention in August. (Sanders and Biden announced an agreement <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/biden-camp-agrees-let-sanders-keep-lost-convention-delegates-n1196631\">last month</a> to let Sanders keep hundreds of delegates, and make sure the senator is represented at the Democratic national convention.)</p> <p>\u201cThe removal of presidential contenders from the primary ballot not only deprived those candidates of the chance to garner votes for the Democratic party\u2019s nomination \u2026 it deprived Democratic voters of the opportunity to elect delegates who could push their point of view in that forum.\u201d</p> <p>Election officials had argued that holding a largely symbolic presidential primary would be costly and put people\u2019s health at risk during the coronavirus pandemic.

But he has also alienated the state\u2019s independent and moderate voters, while a growing Hispanic electorate and newcomers from states like California and Washington have also accelerated the state\u2019s political diversity.</p> \n<p>In 2016, he won the state by 3.5 percentage points, a much smaller margin than past Republican presidential candidates. Two years later, the Democrat Kyrsten Sinema beat Martha McSally in a Senate race to succeed the retiring Arizona senator Jeff Flake. McSally was then appointed to fill the seat of the late Arizona senator John McCain, and she is now locked in a <a href=\"https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2020/senate/az/arizona_senate_mcsally_vs_kelly-6801.html\">fierce contest</a> with the Democrat Mark Kelly to retain it.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/05/white-house-coronavirus-taskforce-winding-down-why\">Why is the White House winding down the coronavirus taskforce?</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The seat has been held by a Republican since Barry Goldwater was first elected to the Senate in 1968. But the race is now considered a \u201c<a href=\"https://cookpolitical.com/ratings/senate-race-ratings\">toss-up</a>\u201d by the non-partisan Cook Political report and <a href=\"https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2020/senate/az/arizona_senate_mcsally_vs_kelly-6801.html\">recent polling </a>shows McSally trailing Kelly.</p> \n<p>\u201cThis year really could be a tipping point for Arizona politics,\u201d said Chip Scutari, a political consultant in Phoenix. \u201cAnd I\u2019m sure President Trump and his team want to solidify Arizona in the win column but it\u2019s really up for grabs.\u201d</p> \n<p>Scutari called Trump\u2019s visit a \u201cpseudo-campaign rally\u201d; indeed, when the president finished speaking at the Honeywell facility the Rolling Stones\u2019s You Can\u2019t Always Get What You Want \u2013 a Trump rally staple \u2013 began to play.</p> \n<p>Democrats are increasingly bullish on their prospects, buoyed by polls that show Biden leading in the state.</p> \n<p>Felecia Rotellini, the chair of the Arizona Democratic party, called Trump\u2019s visit to the state a \u201csign of desperation\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe Covid-19 crisis and the complete lack of empathy and competence that the president has shown in his handling of this has created even a greater sinking ship that is now called his re-election campaign,\u201d Rotellini said.</p> \n<p>The brief trip to Phoenix marks the beginning of what Trump hopes will be more frequent outings after being locked down in Washington for weeks, and as polling numbers show his support eroding in battleground states. The president has said he plans to travel soon toNew York and North Dakota for a Fourth of July fireworks display at Mount Rushmore. Though eager to get back on the campaign trail, Trump acknowledged in a town hall with Fox News on Sunday that his signature rallies were unlikely to return for several more months, at least.</p>"

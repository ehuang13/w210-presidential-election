  "<p>Joe Biden has long been expected to pick a woman or a minority figure \u2013 or someone who is both \u2013 as his pick for vice-president, should he win the Democratic nomination to face Donald Trump in November.</p> <p>During his debate with Bernie Sanders in Washington on Sunday, the former vice-president made it official. He would name a woman as his running mate, he said \u2013 and also put an African American woman on the supreme court.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll pick a woman to be vice-president,\u201d Biden said. \u201cThere are a number of women who are qualified to be president tomorrow.\u201d</p> <p>The California senator Kamala Harris and former Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams are two names most commonly mentioned in Democratic circles.</p> <p>Harris ran against Biden in the primary and landed memorable blows on him in an early debate, but endorsed him after dropping out. Neither she nor Abrams has said they would turn down an offer to join a Biden ticket.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/16/five-key-takeaways-bernie-sanders-joe-biden-democratic-debate-2020-election\">Five key takeaways from Sanders and Biden's first one-to-one debate</a> </p> </aside>  <p>However, Biden\u2019s comments during the debate, and those of senior campaign officials in a post-debate call with reporters, made it clear that the likes of the Minnesota senator Amy Klobuchar and Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren, also former rivals for the nomination, could also be selected. The hard criterion is that the pick will be a woman who both works well with Biden and balances the ticket.</p> <p>\u201cHe has to balance out who he is,\u201d said Steve Phillips, a top party donor and the founder of Democracy in Color. \u201cHe\u2019s an old white man so logically he should have a young woman of color to balance the ticket out.</p> <p>\u201cHe will have some strength with some of the white suburban voters but he\u2019s going to need turnout with young people, that was the cornerstone of the Obama-Biden ticket. So if there\u2019s one thing people are not about Joe Biden, it\u2019s enthusiastic. But if he has someone like a Stacey Abrams on his ticket, the level of enthusiasm there would just be dramatically different.\u201d</p> <p>Phillips said his organization and a number of others had been discussing sending a letter to Biden and Sanders, urging them to commit to a person of color.</p> <p>Biden advisers, as any advisers would with the nomination still to be won, are loth to go into more detail about their candidate\u2019s thinking. But in the post-debate call, Symone Sanders, a senior adviser, said: \u201cHe has said that the qualification for vice-president for him would be someone that is simpatico with him, as he would like to say.\u201d</p> <p>She added, unequivocally: \u201cIt will be a woman.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d6a1acabee78983509400b629b564dedf125623c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d6a1acabee78983509400b629b564dedf125623c/0_101_2400_1440/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Stacey Abrams, pictured with Joe Biden, in Selma, Alabama, on 1 March, indicated she would be honoured to join the ticket.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Stacey Abrams, pictured with Joe Biden, in Selma, Alabama, on 1 March, indicated she would be honoured to join the ticket.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Curtis Compton/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Abrams has arguably been the most open about her willingness to join Biden on the ticket. She met with the former vice-president in the early days of the campaign, as his advisers floated the idea of naming a running mate early.</p> <p>\u201cLeader Abrams would be honored to be asked to join the ticket,\u201d Seth Bringman, a spokesman for Fair Fight, Abrams\u2019 voting rights group, said in a statement after Sunday\u2019s debate, referring to her former position in the Georgia state house.</p> <p>\u201cFor now, she is focused on leading national efforts to stop voter suppression and ensure an accurate census.\u201d</p> <p>Biden\u2019s comments ignited a new level of speculation. On Monday, the Michigan governor, Gretchen Whitmer, who is seen as a rising star in the Democratic party, said she did not expect to join Biden in the general election.</p> <p>Biden endorsed Whitmer during her 2018 campaign and on Monday she said she would \u201chelp him vet and make sure he\u2019s got a great running mate\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIt is not going to be me but I\u2019m going to have a hand in helping him make sure that he has got a roundabout ticket that can win,\u201d Whitmer said.</p> <p>Picking a woman cuts out contenders including Cory Booker, a senator from New Jersey, and the former South Bend mayor Pete Buttigieg, both of whom mounted their own presidential campaigns.</p> <p>During Sunday\u2019s debate, Sanders was also asked about his thinking. The Vermont senator\u2019s path to the nomination is increasingly narrow but it has not closed entirely. After digressing, he said he was moving in the direction of picking a woman.</p> <p>\u201cIn all likelihood, I will,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cFor me, it\u2019s not just nominating a woman, it is making sure that we have a progressive woman and there are progressive women out there. So my very strong tendency is to move in that direction.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>Tonia Martinez doesn\u2019t remember the last time she voted \u2013 she guesses it was about two decades ago. The Florida native\u2019s first brush with the prison system was in 1992 but she said her real struggle started in 2010 when she was convicted of a felony and sentenced to 19 months in a Broward county facility.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/15/florida-primary-tuesday-coronavirus-fears\">Florida: coronavirus fears could hurt voter turnout in crucial primary</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>When she was released she did everything she was supposed to do: she paid her court fees and got a job at an Ihop closer to her hometown in Palmetto, Florida. Getting her voting rights back was hard. Returning citizens, as people in her situation are known, had to fill out paperwork and be individually granted clemency from the governor.</p> \n<p>Martinez, who is now 51, spent months trying to get her voting rights back.</p> \n<p>\u201cThis is something my ancestors fought for,\u201d she said. But every time she sent in a form, or wrote an email, she was told there was another step or another problem.</p> \n<p>\u201cI read somewhere about even if you\u2019ve did your time, paid your fines, and you want to become an active part of the community, the chances of the governor granting you clemency was little to none,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s when I gave up.\u201d</p> \n<p>That changed at the end of 2018, when Florida <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/nov/09/florida-amendment-4-felons-voting-rights-response-activists\">passed</a> a constitutional amendment granting people with prior felony convictions the right to vote after they complete their sentence, including parole and probation. Amendment 4, as it often called, gives an estimated 1.4 million people the right to vote.</p> \n<p>This Tuesday, as millions of Floridians <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/15/florida-primary-tuesday-coronavirus-fears\">head to the polls for the presidential primary</a>, the impact of amendment 4 will be visible for the first time on such a scale. In a state where elections are often won by razor-thin margins, that could mean changing the political makeup of Florida, as well as offering another pathway for people leaving the prison system to re-entering their community.</p> \n<p>\u201cI expect there to be an increase in the 2020 primary turnout,\u201d said US representative Darren Soto, who represents a swath of central Florida that includes Orlando. \u201cThe returning citizens should be voting in high numbers.\u201d</p> \n<p>But there are still barriers for people with prior felony convictions. For one, the Republican legislature\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jan/16/florida-amendment-4-ruling-voting-rights\">attempts</a> to place restrictions on the law \u2013 such as requiring former felons to pay off all court fines and fees associated with their sentence \u2013 have created confusion.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ll never know the size of that group that was made eligible but was deterred,\u201d said Marc Mauer, executive director of The Sentencing Project, a criminal justice advocacy group in Washington DC.</p> \n<p>The confusion affects election officials too. Earlier this year the Guardian <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jan/09/florida-voting-rights-felons-amendement-4\">reported</a> that Florida\u2019s supervisors of elections were still unclear as to which crimes were exempt from the law. States with similar laws often decide that some crimes \u2013 such as murder or rape \u2013 mean losing voting rights permanently.</p> \n<p>Some returning citizens are also grappling with the registration process, which can prove confusing for any Florida residents who change address or party affiliation.</p> \n<p>Tracey Washington was an avid voter until 2017, when she was convicted of a fraud-related felony at her workplace in Manatee county and sentenced to six months in prison. She said it was a particularly difficult time: her father was incarcerated when she was young and she had experienced the trauma her family suffered.</p> \n<p>\u201cThat six months was very \u2013 I don\u2019t know what word to use for it \u2013 it was an experience,\u201d she said. \u201cI was away from my kids, from my grandchildren. It just really drained me mentally.\u201d</p> \n<p>When Washington was released earlier this year, she was embarrassed but relieved and started rebuilding her life. She paid her court fees of $646 and started working part-time at a dry cleaners. She lives with her extended family, is saving money to rent her own apartment again and has started a not-for-profit for children with incarcerated parents.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"a84a02ba-1ab5-4612-bbc3-30ad94a4935a\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/8QfsnG00j7s?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>She has also tried to register to vote, but she hasn\u2019t received her voter registration card or any confirmation. Since she doesn\u2019t see any barriers after amendment 4 that would stop her, she plans to go to the polling center in Manatee county in order to cast her ballot. She\u2019s hoping things go smoothly.</p> \n<p>Mauer said it was difficult to tell how many people like Washington and Martinez, who are eligible to vote, will actually be able to vote in this election. While amendment 4 has garnered lots of attention, he said, turnout may not immediately reflect the change.</p> \n<p>\u201cEven at best, it\u2019s going to be a small fraction of the more than 1 million who potentially could be eligible,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>For Martinez, her new right to vote is something she is protecting. She chose her Democratic affiliation by weighing the issues and political platforms and watching the news at home. And she\u2019s going to the polling station on Tuesday to vote for who she thinks will make the country a more humane place to live.</p> \n<p>\u201cFor me it\u2019s about the treatment of people \u2013 millions of people,\u201d she said.</p>",

It\u2019s what people think because it\u2019s the easy way to explain it. So it\u2019s an easy way to make up a myth,\u201d said<a href=\"https://www.ulmer.com/attorneys/david-w-leopold/\"> David Leopold</a>, an immigration attorney and former president of the American Immigration Lawyers Association.</p> <p>It\u2019s true that children born on US soil <a href=\"https://talkingpointsmemo.com/cafe/immigration-lawyer-birthright-citizenship\">have been granted citizenship</a> through the 14th amendment to the US constitution, and that a landmark supreme court decision<a href=\"https://www.scpr.org/blogs/multiamerican/2011/01/19/7987/who-was-wong-kim-ark/\"> set the precedent</a> for that right to be extended to almost all children of foreigners. But Americans can\u2019t just immediately safeguard their family members from deportation. In fact, a US citizen<a href=\"https://my.uscis.gov/exploremyoptions/us_petition_for_immediate_relative\"> must be 21 years old</a> before they can sponsor their parents for a green card. <a href=\"https://www.uscis.gov/i-864\">They also</a> must be able to financially support their parents.</p> <p>Now the Trump administration\u2019s new public charge rule targeting low-income immigrants is adding yet another burden.</p> <p>Parents who were not inspected and admitted into the US face even more obstacles to changing their immigration status: <a href=\"https://www.uscis.gov/sites/default/files/files/pressrelease/Section245ProvisionLIFEAct_032301.pdf\">with limited exceptions</a>, they have to go abroad as part of the legalization process and then often <a href=\"https://www.uscis.gov/legal-resources/unlawful-presence-and-bars-admissibility\">aren\u2019t allowed back into the US for </a><a href=\"https://www.uscis.gov/legal-resources/unlawful-presence-and-bars-admissibility\">10 years</a>.</p> <p>Even if parents do get a green card, they have a five-year holding period before they can finally apply for naturalization.</p> <p>In the end, the so-called \u201canchor baby\u201d pathway to citizenship is at least a 26-year endeavor, even for those who entered the US legally.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s ludicrous to think that that\u2019s some sort of a tactic that people use to come here, get citizenship, \u2019cause it just isn\u2019t true,\u201d said Leopold. \u201cIt\u2019s a myth, and it\u2019s a specious talking point.\u201d</p> <p>A talking point that\u2019s popular among anti-immigrant groups, pundits and the Republican party.</p> <p>The Republican senator Lindsey Graham has called birthright citizenship \u201c<a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2010/07/graham-eyes-birthright-citizenship-040395#ixzz0v5pFRNr4\">a mistake</a>\u201d and argued that immigrants come to the US to \u201cdrop a child\u201d. Graham\u2019s former colleague the California<a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2010-may-26-la-oe-rutten-20100526-story.html\"> congressman Duncan Hunter</a> even advocated for deporting the US-citizen children of undocumented immigrants. Congressman <a href=\"https://steveking.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/king-s-effort-to-end-birthright-citizenship-for-illegals-advanced-by\">Steve King</a> has continually introduced legislation challenging these kids\u2019 right to citizenship.</p> <p>When Donald Trump launched his campaign for the 2016 presidential election, his signature policy agenda around immigration often leaned into the \u201canchor baby\u201d fallacy. Part of his platform included<a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/itsallpolitics/2015/08/17/432605103/whats-in-donald-trumps-immigration-plan\"> ending birthright citizenship</a> for the children of undocumented immigrants, and Trump called for deporting such families.</p> <p>Since becoming commander-in-chief, Trump<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/22/us/birthright-citizenship-14th-amendment-trump.html\"> has continued to hint</a> at an impending <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/oct/30/trump-birthright-citizenship-executive-order-14th-amendment\">crackdown on birthright citizenship</a>, and in January,<a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2020/1/22/21077547/state-department-pregnant-women-birth-tourism-policy\"> the administration made it more difficult</a> for pregnant people to get short-term visas. Meanwhile, officials at the border aren\u2019t allowing pregnant asylum seekers to attend their court hearings, and an attorney said it was so they wouldn\u2019t give birth to a US citizen, <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2020/02/23/808536155/pregnant-asylum-seekers-barred-from-u-s-entry-for-court-hearings\">KPBS</a> reported.</p> <p>As the 2020 presidential election heats up, Trump will probably use birthright citizenship to rile his supporters, Leopold suggested.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s red meat for the Trump base,\u201d he said.</p> <p>During the last election, Trump repeated the words \u201canchor baby\u201d gratuitously on the campaign trail, giving the phrase even more air. When a reporter pointed out that the term was hurtful and offensive, <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/video/trump-ill-word-anchor-baby-33201519\">Trump rebuffed</a> him: \u201cYou mean it\u2019s not politically correct? And yet everybody uses it.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/feb/25/trump-family-separations-children-torture-psychology\">Trump's separation of families constitutes torture, doctors find</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But just two decades ago, no one used it \u2013 at least not publicly. In the book <a href=\"https://www.sup.org/books/title/?id=28631\">Anchor Babies and the Challenge of Birthright Citizenship</a>, the anthropologist Leo Chavez tracked the term\u2019s appearance in both coasts\u2019 papers of record, the New York Times and the Los Angeles Times. \u201cAnchor babies\u201d never cropped up until the early 2000s.</p> <p>\u201cThat practice of targeting people who really are members of your society historically and legally and marking them as different allows you to do incredibly awful things to them,\u201d Chavez said. They suffered psychological terror caused by the same fears that their families experienced, he said.</p> <p>For 17 years, Daira hasn\u2019t been able to keep Silvia and Jorge safe just by being a US citizen. Nor did they ever expect that she would.</p> <p>\u201cIt was never the idea to come to the US to have a child,\u201d Silvia said. After she, Jorge, and their one-year-old son arrived in Long Island, she tried to get birth control, but the complicated US medical system delayed that process. In the meantime, life happened.</p> <p>\u201cWhen I became pregnant with her,\u201d Silvia said, \u201cat first the world fell apart for me, because we were in another country where the situation wasn\u2019t the best.\u201d</p> <p>The family can laugh about it now, maybe because they\u2019ve hustled and come out on the other side. It wasn\u2019t easy. In a corner of the country known for abnormally high rents, they\u2019ve spent practically all their lives in other people\u2019s basements. Silvia worked night shifts at odd jobs. When Jorge finally found work that wasn\u2019t just temporary, he tended to hold on to the role for years.</p> <p>These days, Daira takes art classes and wants to study illustration. Silvia is \u201cretired to march\u201d, she jokes; <a href=\"https://time.com/5670018/daca-rescinded-dreamers/\">after Trump rescinded</a> Daca and the courts took up the issue, she became an activist fighting to protect young people like her son. Jorge just got his driver\u2019s license after successfully advocating on the frontlines for all New Yorkers\u2019 rights to drive legally regardless of their immigration status. Daira\u2019s happy about that; it\u2019s \u201cmore secure\u201d, she says.</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019re doing all the positive things that we think are strong American values that we would really like to have here, but we don\u2019t give them the opportunity to put that into practice,\u201d said Chavez. \u201cWhat we do is take their kids and call them names.\u201d</p>",

Here are some of the night\u2019s key takeaways:</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Coronavirus dominated the debate, with Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders offering different visions for how to combat the crisis. </strong>After the pair bumped elbows to greet each other, Biden described the coronavirus crisis as an \u201call hands on deck\u201d situation that required immediate steps to protect vulnerable communities, while Sanders said the pandemic underscored the need for an overhaul of the US healthcare system to protect all Americans. The contrast reflected one of the key questions in the primary race: should the country focus on immediate, short-term results or broad, structural change?</li> \n   <li><strong>Biden pledged to choose a woman as his running mate. </strong>Sanders would not explicitly commit to selecting a woman running mate but said, \u201cIn all likelihood, I will.\u201d Biden\u2019s pledge could help to reassure Democrats who are disappointed that the party\u2019s historically diverse field has narrowed down to two white men in their late 70\u2019s.</li> \n   <li><strong>Biden avoided a complete debacle, which Sanders needed to change the direction of the race. </strong>Biden did stumble at times, but considering his significant delegate lead, Sanders needed his opponent to have a terrible night if he wanted any chance at turning the tide of the race. Biden managed to avoid that catastrophe.</li> \n   <li><strong>The debate was surprisingly combative considering the current crisis. </strong>Many commentators had predicted the night would be relatively tame as the candidates focused on the health crisis gripping the country. However, Sanders went after Biden for his refusal to disavow super PACs and his past comments on Social Security, and Biden returned the favor by criticizing Sanders for his record on gun control and his recent praise of <strong>Fidel Castro.</strong></li> \n   <li><strong>Tonight made the case for holding debates without live audiences. </strong>The debate was conducted without a live audience or a media spinroom because of coronavirus, and a number of commentators said it was a welcome change from past debates. It\u2019s possible the practice could be replicated with general election debates.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <p>Thanks for following our live debate coverage tonight, and our US politics live blog will return tomorrow morning.</p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/15/bernie-sanders-joe-biden-debate-coronavirus-policies-latest\">Biden and Sanders confront coronavirus crisis in first one-on-one debate</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e6eeee88f088d7575593f95\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-16T03:16:07.689Z\">3.16am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Anita Dunn, </strong>a senior adviser to <strong>Joe Biden, </strong>compared <strong>Bernie Sanders </strong>to the average protester who shows up at Biden\u2019s events in a post-debate call with reporters.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/KThomasDC/status/1239386937741508610\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Biden sr. adv.

There could also be a shift to household isolation rather than individual self-isolation.</p> \n  <p>Meanwhile, a new-born baby in England who has tested positive for coronavirus is likely to be one of the world\u2019s youngest patients with the disease. The infant and its mother both tested positive at a north London hospital and staff who had contact with them have been advised to self-isolate.</p> \n  <p>The developments come as the UK\u2019s approach to developing \u201cherd immunity\u201d against Covid-19 has been called into question.</p> \n  <p>But Hancock denied that achieving herd immunity was part of the government\u2019s policy.

  "<p>A Texas appeals court on Thursday <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YocI1u-2MXFNrO227gfLpFMQroqbGlrO/view?usp=sharing\">upheld </a>a five-year prison sentence for a woman who was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/apr/01/texas-woman-jailed-five-years-voting-probation\">convicted of illegally voting</a> even though <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/crystal-mason-prison-sentence_n_5d3b04e8e4b0c31569e9fb94\">she didn\u2019t know she was ineligible</a> when she went to the polls in 2016. The punishment for the Fort Worth woman, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/aug/27/crime-of-voting-texas-woman-crystal-mason-five-years-prison\">Crystal Mason</a>, stirred national outrage because of its severity, prompting accusations that prosecutors were trying to intimidate Texans from voting.</p> <p>Four years ago, Mason was on supervised release, similar to probation, for a federal felony conviction related to tax fraud. She didn\u2019t know that Texas prohibits felons from voting until they finish their sentence entirely. Mason voted in the last presidential election at the urging of her mother and cast a provisional ballot when poll workers couldn\u2019t find her name on the voter registration rolls. The ballot was never counted because Mason was not an eligible voter.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/17/coronavirus-vote-by-mail-restrictions-us\">Coronavirus exposes absurdity of vote by mail restrictions in US</a> </p> </aside>  <p>During her <a href=\"https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/6219544/Crystal-Mason-Trial-Transcript.pdf\">2018 trial</a> probation officials testified that they never told Mason she could not vote, but the appeals court said that didn\u2019t matter. Mason was guilty, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/sep/28/crystal-mason-begins-prison-sentence-in-texas-for-of-voting\">the court said</a>, because she knew she was on supervised release. \u201cContrary to Mason\u2019s assertion, the fact that she did not know she was legally ineligible to vote was irrelevant to her prosecution,\u201d Justice Wade Birdwell wrote for a three-judge panel on Texas\u2019 second court of appeals.</p> <p>\u201cThese are difficult times for me, but I have faith that with the help of my family and God, right will prevail,\u201d Mason said in a statement on Friday. \u201cA punishment of five years in jail for doing what I thought was my civic duty, and just as I was getting my family\u2019s life together, is not simply unfair, it\u2019s a tragedy.\u201d</p> <p>The case has already taken a <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/crystal-mason-prison-sentence_n_5d3b04e8e4b0c31569e9fb94\">significant toll</a> on Mason, who turns 45 on Saturday. After she was arrested in 2017, the life she had been working to rebuild since getting out of federal prison in 2015 crumbled. She lost her job, which provided the main source of income for her family, which includes three children, four of her brother\u2019s children who she raised, and her grandchildren.</p> <p>Because she was convicted of illegal voting while on supervised release, a federal judge had also sent her back to federal prison in late 2018, where she served several months. Her teenage daughter Taylor put off going to college to come home and run the household. The family depended in part on donations from a <a href=\"https://www.gofundme.com/f/justice4crystal\">GoFundMe account</a>. Since her conviction, Mason has become more politically active \u2013 she hosted a voter registration drive ahead of Texas\u2019s primary.</p> <p>Thomas Buser-Clancy, an attorney with the Texas chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union who helped represent Mason, said Mason\u2019s legal team will appeal. \u201cCrystal submitted a provisional ballot that was not counted, she did not vote illegally,\u201d he said. Mason will remain out of prison on bond while the appeal is pending.</p> <p>Texas is one of 48 states that strip people with felony convictions of the right to vote, but the rules on when people regain the right to vote vary widely from state to state and are often extremely confusing, <a href=\"https://www.sentencingproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/A-Crazy-Quilt-of-Tiny-Pieces-State-and-Local-Administration-of-American-Criminal-Disenfranchisement-Laws.pdf\">even to elections officials</a>. The appeals court\u2019s ruling was alarming because it confirmed that any voter in Texas who was unsure about their voter eligibility could be criminally prosecuted if they voted while ineligible, said Sasha Samberg-Champion, a former Department of Justice attorney who was not involved in the case.</p> <p>\u201cIt should be obvious that this is a profoundly dangerous vision of the law,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is not the legal standard that is applied by any state or country that takes the right to vote seriously.\u201d</p> <p>The decision to prosecute Mason was unusual. Since 2014, <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/crystal-mason-provisional-ballot_n_5d5c5f88e4b0d1e113695972\">at least 12,668 people</a> have voted using a provisional ballot in Tarrant county and 88% of them have been rejected because the voter was not eligible. Mason is the only voter who used a provisional ballot who was prosecuted for illegal voting.</p> <p>The court\u2019s opinion on Thursday goes further than what prosecutors argued during Mason\u2019s trial. There, they argued that Mason read <a href=\"https://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/athena/files/2019/07/26/5d3b706ce4b0c31569eada09.pdf\">tiny print on an affidavit</a> she signed before casting a provisional ballot and therefore knew she was ineligible. Mason said she never read the language and that the head election judge, who was also her neighbor, never alerted her to it. This week, the court said none of that mattered.</p> <p>\u201cAlthough Mason may not have known with certainty that being on supervised release as part of her federal conviction made her ineligible to vote under Texas law or that so voting is a crime \u2026 she voted anyway, signing a form affirming her eligibility in the process despite the fact that she was not certain,\u201d Birdwell wrote.</p> <p>Mason\u2019s lawyers will ask the full appeals court to rehear the case, and then could appeal to the Texas court of criminal appeals, the highest criminal court in Texas. If Mason loses at that high court, her lawyers could ask the US supreme court to take the case.</p> <p>\u201cThis ruling is a severe misinterpretation of the law,\u201d said Alison Grinter, an attorney representing Mason. \u201cIt undercuts efforts to encourage voter turnout through the Help America Vote Act and punishes ordinary voters for attempting to fulfil their civic duty in a way that is at complete odds with our democratic principles.\u201d<br></p>",

It is cheap, considered relatively safe in humans and has been used for over 70 years. </em></p> \n   <p><em>However, for over 10 years there have been studies reporting the anti-viral effects of chloroquine, or its common derivative hydroxy-chloroquine, against flu and Sars, raising hope of activity against the current pandemic virus.</em></p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Preston said studies showing chloroquine\u2019s anti-viral effects during the previous Sars virus outbreak received \u201crelatively little attention\u201d as it died away and highlighted recent research in <strong>France</strong> where a trial of chloroquine treatment on 20 Covid-19 patients in hospital saw 70% considered to be cured after six days, PA Media reported. </p> \n  <p>However, he emphasised more scrutiny was needed of the results as well as larger controlled trials on chloroquine\u2019s effectiveness. </p> \n  <p><strong>Robin May</strong>, professor of Infectious Disease at the University of Birmingham, said of chloroquine: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p><em>It is a drug that has a long history of use against malaria, essentially because it diffuses into red blood cells, making the environment within the cell less suitable for the parasite to live in. </em></p> \n   <p><em>Since it has a long history of clinical use, the safety profile of chloroquine is well-established and it is cheap and relatively easy to manufacture, so it would - theoretically - be fairly easy to accelerate into clinical trials and, if successful, eventually into treatment.</em></p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Meanwhile, Reuters has reported that there is a shortage of generic malaria drug hydroxychloroquine amid surging demand, according to independent pharmacies and the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists (ASHP). </p> \n  <p>The treatment that has been trialled with some success against the coronavirus.<br></p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-03-19T19:22:42.007Z\">at 7.22pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e73bfc18f085e564ad87740\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-19T18:55:28.347Z\">6.55pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>This is Mattha Busby taking over the blog from my colleague Damien Gayle.

Her family is under observation.</p> \n  <p>Coronavirus numbers have more than doubled in Russia over the last week, but the country has still shown surprisingly few infections, with 147 confirmed cases as of Wednesday evening, the most recent official numbers. Moscow is rushing to build a new hospital similar to the ones that were built in China at the height of the coronavirus outbreak there. The new hospital will have beds for 500 patients and will be ready in the next month, officials have said. </p> \n  <p>While the government has claimed that its success has stemmed from early border closures with China and quick isolation of suspected cases, there are also concerns that Russia may be underestimating the official numbers of those infected with coronavirus in order to avert public panic. </p> \n  <p>Last week, the Russian business daily RBC reported that registered pneumonia cases in Moscow had grown 37% between January 2019 and January 2020, speculating that a wave of new coronavirus infections could have been registered as cases of pneumonia or other pulmonary diseases. </p> \n  <p>The Kremlin has said that it is protecting Vladimir Putin, 67, from contracting the disease by testing members of his entourage. During a trip to Crimea, the peninsula annexed from Ukraine in March 2014, Putin said: \u201cThank God, we generally have everything under control so far. Hopefully, it will continue in the future.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Russia has closed its borders to most foreigners and has cancelled many flights to Europe and the US. The economy has taken a significant hit due to the simultaneous effects of the coronavirus outbreak and an oil price war with Saudi Arabia.

When the last one started in 2008 it took the Bank of England six months to spot it. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/18/britain-faces-economic-emergency-warns-new-bank-of-england-governor-andrew-bailey-covid-19\">This time it is different</a>. Then it was a financial virus, this time it is the real thing. Commentators often say the economy is hitting the wall or is falling off a cliff on the weakest of evidence.

That is not a recession, it is a collapse surpassing anything in modern times, including the Great Depression.</p> \n  <p>When the banks were bailed out in 2008, it was because policymakers feared precisely what is now happening: a complete shutdown of the global economy. The rescue package worked, but only just. The early indications from China are that the impact of Covid-19 is markedly greater than that of the financial crisis, itself the most severe downturn of the postwar era.</p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/commentisfree/2020/mar/19/peacetime-constraints-ditched-in-the-war-for-economic-survival\">Peacetime constraints ditched in the war for economic survival | Larry Elliott</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e73138a8f085e564ad86e93\" class=\"block is-summary\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-19T06:47:50.961Z\">6.47am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Summary</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Dozens of London underground stations are to be closed indefinitely</strong>.

And now, more than ever, we need each other. We need each other for truth, for support, and to feel less alone during a time that can honestly feel quite scary. There are so many around the world who need support right now, who are working tirelessly to respond to this crisis behind the scenes, on the frontline, or at home. Our willingness, as a people, to step up in the face of what we are all experiencing with COVID-19 is awe-inspiring. This moment is as true a testament there is to the human spirit. We often speak of compassion. All of our lives are in some way affected by this, uniting each of us globally. How we approach each other and our communities with empathy and kindness is indisputably important right now. Over the coming weeks, this will be our guiding principle. We will be sharing information and resources to help all of us navigate the uncertainty: from posting accurate information and facts from trusted experts, to learning about measures we can take to keep ourselves and our families healthy, to working with organisations that can support our mental and emotional well-being. In addition, we will focus on the inspiring stories of how so many of you around the world are connecting in ways big and small to lift all of us up. We are all in this together, and as a global community we can support each other through this process \u2013 and build a digital neighbourhood that feels safe for every one of us. We look forward to sharing more over the days and weeks to come...</a></p> <p style=&quot; color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;&quot;>A post shared by <a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/sussexroyal/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;amp;utm_campaign=loading&quot; style=&quot; color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px;&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;> The Duke and Duchess of Sussex</a> (@sussexroyal) on <time style=&quot; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;&quot; datetime=&quot;2020-03-18T15:17:29+00:00&quot;>Mar 18, 2020 at 8:17am PDT</time></p></div></blockquote> <script async src=&quot;//www.instagram.com/embed.js&quot;></script></body></html>\"></iframe> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e72d7d48f085c6327bc2b31\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-19T02:27:16.468Z\">2.27am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Between <strong>400 and 500 foreigners are stranded in Panama</strong> after a \u201ctribal\u201d festival and music event ended with many of them being quarantined at the concert site near the Caribbean beach of Playa Chiquita, an organiser said Wednesday. </p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b04b92e57ab0a75daa415330a19efa381f78d292\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b04b92e57ab0a75daa415330a19efa381f78d292/0_0_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Panama\u2019s health workers check attendees of the Tribal Gathering festival rock in Cuango, Colon province, Panama, on March 18, 2020.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Panama\u2019s health workers check attendees of the Tribal Gathering festival rock in Cuango, Colon province, Panama, on March 18, 2020.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Luis Acosta/AFP via Getty Images</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n  <p>At the same time, Panama\u2019s government announced that the <strong>number of coronavirus cases in the country had risen to 109</strong> and that a nighttime curfew would be imposed beginning Wednesday night. <br><br>James Baker of Manchester, England, said those attending the Tribal Gathering included people from Spain, Canada, the United States, Denmark, France, Britain and Hungary as well as Costa Rica, Colombia, Chile and Mexico. <br><br>Baker said authorities in Panama had instituted a requirement that <strong>all those seeking to leave had to prove they had been in Panama for at least 14 days</strong>.

The US has less than 950,000 hospital beds which is the equivalent of 2.8 per 1,000 people - a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/12/upshot/coronavirus-biggest-worry-hospital-capacity.html\">lower rate than China, South Korea and Italy.</a> </p> \n  <p>Almost 20% of the US population - or 49million people - are aged over 65. But as this varies hugely by county, it\u2019s important to know where they are, and where the beds are.</p> \n  <p>New research by <a href=\"https://headwaterseconomics.org/equity/hospital-access-seniors/\">Headwaters Economics </a>and <a href=\"https://www.hcn.org/articles/north-covid19-crowded-cities-and-lonely-country-see-your-countys-hospital-bed-capacity?utm_source=wcn1&amp;utm_medium=email\">High Country News </a>has found that 1.8 million people 65 years and older - or 4% of all US seniors - live in a county without a hospital. In addition, 86% of counties with no hospital beds have a higher than national average senior population; most of those counties are rural.</p> \n  <p>This snapshot, which uses data from the Department of Homeland Security and Commerce Department, is important as 10 to 20% of those who get infected with Covid-19 could require hospitalization, according to what we\u2019ve seen in Asia and Europe.

  "<p>OBAMAGATE! OBAMAGATE! Donald Trump seems to think that if he yells \u201cObamagate\u201d often enough and loud enough, it will magic a scandal into existence and send his arch-nemeses, Barack Obama and Joe Biden, to jail.</p> <p>On Monday, the US attorney general, William Barr, burst his boss\u2019s bubble and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/18/obamagate-investigations-barr-dashes-trump-hopes-obama-biden\">dismissed the possibility</a> of a criminal investigation into Obama or Biden. Because, you know, they didn\u2019t do anything wrong. Trump responded to Barr\u2019s statement in his usual fashion: sulking like a petulant child and saying: \u201c<a href=\"https://twitter.com/thehill/status/1262475642836258818?s=20\">Well, if it was me they would [investigate]</a>\u201d before continuing to babble incoherently.</p> <p>It may be wishful thinking, but I have a feeling that one reason Trump is so keen to accuse Obama and Biden of criminality is because he is starting to get nervous about going to jail himself. Last week, Biden pledged that, if elected president, he wouldn\u2019t use his executive powers to <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2020/05/15/joe-biden-pledges-not-to-pardon-trump-2\">pardon Trump of potential crimes</a>. This wasn\u2019t the first time the presumptive Democratic nominee has said he wouldn\u2019t go easy on Trump. In October, Biden told an <a href=\"https://www.radioiowa.com/2019/10/13/biden-says-if-hes-elected-in-2020-he-will-not-pardon-trump/\">Iowa radio station</a> that it had been a mistake for Gerald Ford to pardon his predecessor, Richard Nixon, after Watergate in 1974. Pardoning Trump, Biden said, \u201cwouldn\u2019t unite [the US]\u201d and would send the message that some people are above the law.</p> <p>Of course, as it stands, the US president is above the law. In 1973, amid the Watergate scandal, the Department of Justice adopted the position that a sitting president is \u201c<a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-russia-indictment-explainer/can-a-sitting-us-president-face-criminal-charges-idUSKCN1QF1D3\">constitutionally immune</a>\u201d from criminal prosecution, a position it reaffirmed in 2000. As long as he is president, Trump is safe.</p> <p>When he leaves office, however, it is another matter: there are a host of charges he might face. These include <a href=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/trump-prison-after-office-mueller-863027/\">obstruction of justice</a> charges in relation to the Russia investigation; illegally withholding military aid to Ukraine in order to pressure them to investigate his political rivals; and soliciting campaign donations from foreign nationals \u2013 all of which Trump denies. According to the investigative site the Intercept, the laws Trump has potentially broken in his interaction with Ukraine and China as president could land him <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2019/10/10/trump-crimes-law/\">10 years in prison</a>.</p> <p>And it is not just Trump\u2019s conduct as president that has opened him to potential legal trouble. There is also the matter of his financial and tax dealings, which are the subject of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/12/supreme-court-donald-trump-tax-returns\">numerous lawsuits</a>.</p> <p>Importantly, how long Trump stays in power has a bearing on any potential legal liability. The statute of limitations on obstruction of justice charges, for example, is only <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-and-obstruction-of-justice-what-is-the-statute-of-limitations-against-donald-trump-2019-07-25/\">five years</a>. So if Trump gets another term, he will run down the clock on that. Honestly, if you want to do the crime without doing the time, it really pays to be president.</p> <p>If Trump ever goes to jail, it will be one of the happiest days of my life. Not everyone is so enthusiastic about \u201clocking him up\u201d, however. Earlier this year, the then Democratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang said that, if he were president, he <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2020/02/02/pardon-trump-andrew-yang-2020-110331\">wouldn\u2019t investigate Trump</a>: \u201cIf you look at history around the world, it\u2019s a very, very nasty pattern that developing countries have fallen into, where a new president ends up throwing the president before them in jail.\u201d</p> <p>Look, I understand that the US, where people die because they <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/diabetes-josh-wilkerson-death-age-counter-insulin-cost-lost-private-health-insurance-american-doctor-a9039656.html\">can\u2019t afford diabetes medication</a>, doesn\u2019t want to be like a \u201cdeveloping country\u201d. Nevertheless, there is a very nasty pattern into which authoritarian regimes have fallen, where the leader does whatever they like with no repercussions. I am not sure the US wants to be like that, either.</p> <p>I have no idea what the chances of Trump ending up in prison are, but I am pretty sure he is not happy that there is even a small possibility he might swap the White House for the \u201c<a href=\"https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/big_house\">big house</a>\u201d. But his <a href=\"https://thehill.com/hilltv/what-americas-thinking/498367-poll-trump-approval-on-economy-jobs-drops-amid-economic-fallout\">approval ratings are dropping</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/05/17/politics/state-polls-2020-analysis/index.html\">chances of a President Biden are rising</a>. That means Trump is going to do everything he can to win re-election in November; he is not just fighting for another term, he is also fighting for his freedom. He is fighting to avoid the possibility of a Trumpgate.</p> <p>\u2022 Arwa Mahdawi is a Guardian columnist</p>",
  "<p>Love is the great accident. We can fall for the wrong person, or we can have the great good fortune to attach ourselves to the right person, and the strange thing is, we may never know which is which.</p> <p>In Curtis Sittenfeld\u2019s 2008 novel <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/oct/12/fiction\">American Wife</a></em>, a woman\u2019s tough love pulls her husband back from alcoholism and then he becomes president of the United States. That woman is a fictional version of Laura Bush and she sometimes wonders at the amazing, almost casual particularity of her role in history. People seem to blame her: \u201cHis election is my fault, his presidency is my fault, his war is my fault. Why couldn\u2019t I just have let him be an alcoholic? Plenty of wives put up with it every day!\u201d</p> <p>The intersection of the ordinary and the historic made <em>American Wife</em> feel almost Shakespearean; the relationship was destined and domestic and surprisingly sexy. Sittenfeld\u2019s new book, <em>Rodham,</em> undoes destiny, and it tilts toward the political rather than the intimate. This is, in part, because its heroine, Hillary Clinton, is a greater political force than Laura Bush ever was. But also, in <em>Rodham,</em> there is no central marriage. That is the whole point.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The problem is that this fictional Hillary is not as interesting as the proud and private human being we wonder about</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In the old days, people used to think Hillary was hitching a ride on Bill\u2019s career \u2013 now it is possible to think that he held a good woman back. <em>Rodham</em> is an account of what might have happened if she had taken one hard look at Bill\u2019s promiscuous nature and run the hell out of the relationship. It is a very exciting conceit; the only pity is that Hillary\u2019s life feels more dull as a result.</p> <p>The first third of the novel is one we know from the history books. The couple meet at Yale, move to San Francisco and then to Fayetteville, where Bill plans to run for office, in Arkansas. In this version, however, Hillary quickly discovers the nature of the man who is the love of her life, and she decides to leave him. \u201cIt was unfathomable that we were hugging a final time, that I was climbing into the car, starting the engine,\u201d she says: and then she does just that.</p> <p>We find the new fictional Hillary in 1991, working as a law professor in Chicago, single and happy enough. Bill has become governor of Arkansas, as he planned to do. At his side is a sweet, soft-spoken, younger wife who wears <em>Little House on the Prairie</em> dresses and cries when challenged on television about his infidelity. This is a version of the famous <em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-UqKNgrwK8E\">60 Minutes</a></em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-UqKNgrwK8E\"> interview</a>, in which the real Hillary saved Bill\u2019s presidential campaign. When alternate Hillary watches it from her life in Chicago, she thinks her ex-boyfriend\u2019s wife is weak. \u201cBill needed an equal who acted like, even if he\u2019d had affairs, so what?\u201d</p> <p>The game of the speculative part of the book is to consider what might have happened differently and what would have happened anyway, and this is a lot of fun. What is the result of happenstance and what of choice? Some incidents look familiar: the suicide of a colleague, the rise of Obama, the fact of Trump. Sittenfeld teases apart the strands of fate and weaves them together in a slightly altered pattern, but she does not change the personality of the actors, nor can she change society itself. Misogyny is a constant in this fictional Hillary\u2019s life, too, though the men who incite it are crucially different. All through her journey, the book holds a certain dream intact \u2013 that, without Bill, our heroine might have become her proper self.</p> <p>The problem is that this \u201cmore true\u201d Hillary, as voiced in the book, is not as interesting as the challenged, proud and private human being we wonder about when we see her on our television screens. In the novel, we find fictional Hillary single at 40 and relieved that the question of children is now moot. She has latent political ambitions but they remain hidden, even from herself. She thinks like a law professor, and this feels appropriate, though it dampens everything down, somehow. The law is a discourse where passion gets turned into procedure, where things are regularised and made known. This tendency is there from the very beginning. When she and Bill go on their first date, as students at Yale, their reported conversation sounds like a job interview for future greatness.</p> <p>The real Hillary is, of course, a controlled kind of person. She is shown, in the early sections, happily nesting in her student bedsit, alone and in her pyjamas, surrounded by her calendar, to-do list and legal briefs. When the young Bill disturbs this moral, conscientious life, they have a great amount of sex, as students in love are prone to do, but there is none of the joyous specificity that made <em>American Wife</em> such a surprising book. Clinton attracted women with great ease and frequency, but though the word \u201ccharisma\u201d is much used, it is hard to tell what exactly his secret was. And although, in later life, his response to getting found out is one of self-pity and resentment, the discovery of his infidelity as a young man produces an odd, confessional penitence. He wakes Hillary in the middle of the night to say she should leave him. \u201cThe thing that is wrong with me is incurable,\u201d he says. This early, more religious self feels a little unlikely \u2013 a young man who says he needs sex all the time is more usually boasting than crying for help. And this is the problem with real life, because in real life people don\u2019t know what they are doing until it is too late.</p> <p>In real life, it is possible to look at that <em>60 Minutes</em> interview and see a man who is not just interested in sex but in punishing his smart-as-paint wife. Yes, there were telephone calls with Gennifer Flowers. \u201cI think once that I called her when we were together,\u201d he says and his wife manages to hold her expression, before glancing quickly down. Bill would later ring senators from the Oval Office while an intern was servicing him under the desk. Perhaps he was addicted, not to orgasm, but to the pleasures of deceit \u2013 and these pleasures sometimes require being found out. So it is possible to see why Clinton needed a woman like Hillary to cheat on, over and again, and less easy to see what she got out of being punished in this way, apart perhaps from the moral high ground and, with it, a sense of her own superiority. The battle for power was in their marriage long before it was in the world. The real Hillary stayed because that is exactly what she would have done. This fictional Hillary leaves when his philandering spills over into something worse.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/feb/04/rodham-curtis-sittenfeld-hillary-without-bill-clinton-novelist\">Hillary without Bill: Curtis Sittenfeld rewrites Clinton's personal history</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Everyone can have a theory about what happened within the marriage, including people who think it was just a political pact, but one way or the other it was the place where Hillary Rodham Clinton was trapped. Or perhaps too much can be made of a marriage \u2013 we might also remember that, in 2016, she <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2016/nov/11/clinton-won-more-votes-trump-won-the-election-and-its-not-the-first-time\">won the popular vote</a>.</p> <p>The story of the real Hillary Rodham Clinton may or may not be a great modern tragedy. You can ascribe to her one or other flaw (pride is always a good contender); you can ask did she, or the US, deserve her outrageous and misogynistic fate. But Sittenfeld knows that a novel about defeat is not what liberal America needs right now, because liberal America has already suffered too much sorrow and disbelief. The US desperately needs a fantasy. <em>Rodham</em> is a wonderful, sad dream of what might have been \u2013 it contains so much yearning and so many regrets. It is impossible not to sympathise with the project, while still insisting that the best novels are about difficulty, compromise and moral hazard. <em>American Wife</em> was a real novel. <em>Rodham</em> is a political fiction, which is something else.</p> <ul> <li><p>Rodham by Curtis Sittenfeld is available in audio and ebook, and to pre-order in hardback.

  "<p>The World Health Organization will establish an independent and impartial inquiry into the source and handling of the coronavirus outbreak, once the pandemic is brought under control, a virtual meeting of its annual governing body was set to agree on Tuesday.</p> <p>The proposed inquiry, mirroring previous WHO-led inquiries such as the one following the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ebola\">Ebola outbreak</a> in west Africa, arguably stops short of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/18/world-health-assembly-what-is-it-and-what-is-the-coronavirus-inquiry-china-taiwan-origins\">fully independent inquiry</a> sought by Australia and the US, but represents a compromise brokered by a powerful alliance led by the European Union and India.</p> <p>The WHO-led inquiry set out in a resolution being put to the UN World Health Assembly on Monday, and negotiated over the past week, is probably less independent and less directed at China\u2019s role in informing the WHO than some critics of China wanted.</p> <p>But the likely terms of reference will give scope to examine China\u2019s cooperation with the WHO and the powers the organisation possesses to demand greater cooperation from member states.</p> <p>The compromise came after the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, told the assembly he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/18/china-facing-pressure-over-covid-19-and-taiwan-at-world-health-assembly\">supported a comprehensive evaluation</a>, including into the sources and transmission routes of the virus.</p> <p>\u201cChina supports a comprehensive evaluation of the global response to the epidemic after the global epidemic is under control, to sum up experiences and remedy deficiencies,\u201d said Xi. \u201cThis work needs a scientific and professional attitude, and needs to be led by the WHO, and the principles of objectivity and fairness need to be upheld.\u201d</p> <p>He insisted that China had been transparent and open throughout, acting quickly to share information about the disease with the WHO, but said the world needed to be able to respond more quickly in future.</p> <p>Xi also pledged $2bn in financial support over the next two years to help deal with Covid-19, especially in developing countries. China will also make any self-developed Covid-19 vaccines a \u201cpublic good\u201d to help with the efforts to curb the pandemic, he said.</p> <p>Calling the pandemic \u201cthe most serious global public health emergency since the end of the second world war\u201d, Xi said: \u201cAll along we have acted with openness and transparency and responsibility.\u201d</p> <p>He repeatedly directed his remarks to Africa, highlighting how much his country was doing to help the continent develop its health systems and break the shackles of debt.</p> <p>The WHO director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said he would set up the independent evaluation at the earliest appropriate moment, adding that it would look into the responsibility of all actors in good faith. The greatest failing, he said, would be not to seek to learn lessons. Short-term amnesia plagued the world\u2019s approach to global health, he said.</p> <p>Previous WHO inquiries into past pandemics have been hard-hitting, but have tended to shy away from criticising individual countries\u2019 performances, preferring instead to propose structural reforms. The WHO has for years debated the degree of autonomy nation states are allowed in terms of cooperating with WHO advice or recommendations. There is, however, a clear duty to keep the WHO promptly informed of potential pandemics.</p> <p>Any inquiry is unlikely to report before the US presidential election in November, so giving Donald Trump and China latitude to continue to publicise conspiracy theories about the source of the virus.</p> <p>Tedros had invited both Xi and Trump to take part in a virtual summit, but Trump did not respond.</p> <p>\u201cThe idea was to bring the two superpower leaders together in solidarity to fight the pandemic, and to do so at this historic world health assembly, as well as to try to create a sort of rapprochement in the increasing \u2018cold war\u2019 between China and America,\u201d said a source familiar with the invitation.</p> <p>Asked about his lack of response, Trump said at a White House event: \u201cI chose not to make a statement today. I\u2019ll be giving them a statement, sometime in the near future, but ... I think they [the WHO] have done a very sad job in the last period of time.\u201d</p> <p>The US was isolated in its hostility to the WHO, with even its closest ally, Australia, joining the chorus of support for the organisation\u2019s central role in overseeing the global response to the pandemic and calls to end the \u201chit and miss\u201d funding of the UN body. Trump has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/15/world-health-organization-why-has-trump-suspended-funding\">suspended all payments</a> to the WHO pending a review into its alleged \u201cChina-centric leadership\u201d and ineffectiveness. His aides have been discussing continuing to make a minimal payment so in part to retain influence over any inquiry. Trump said on Monday he would make a decision about WHO funding soon.</p> <p>The US health secretary, Alex Azar, told the assembly that the virus had spun out of control due to the WHO failings.</p> <p>\u201cThere was a failure by this organization to obtain the information that the world needed, and that failure cost many lives,\u201d he claimed.</p> <p>Without naming China, Azar added: \u201cIn an apparent attempt to conceal this outbreak, at least one member state made a mockery of their transparency obligations, with tremendous costs for the entire world.</p> <p>\u201cWe saw that WHO failed at its core mission of information sharing and transparency when member states do not act in good faith. This cannot ever happen again.\u201d</p> <p>In a hard-hitting speech, the UN secretary general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, said recent weeks had seen many expressions of international solidarity, but very little practical action. \u201cWe are all paying the price for implementing contradictory strategies,\u201d he said.</p> <p>He warned the disease had spread across the world, and was now heading for developing countries where he predicted it would be even more devastating.</p> <p>He said the WHO was irreplaceable and needed enhanced support, arguing: \u201cWe are as strong as the weakest health system.\u201d</p> <p>An inquiry to look back fully into how everyone reacted, he said, should wait until we have turned the page. \u201cNow is not the time,\u201d he insisted, arguing: \u201cNow is the time for unity. We stand together, or we fail.\u201d</p> <p>The French president, Emmanuel Macron, said the only priority worth talking about was ending the disease. The time demanded \u201cfreedom from complacency and unfounded accusations\u201d, a remark that could be directed at Washington\u2019s repeated claim that China may have deliberately spread the virus in the west.</p> <p>Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, threw her support behind the WHO, saying everyone needed to look at the sustainability of its financing.</p>",

I\u2019m here till 9am ET or so, when Joan E Greve will take over in Washington. </p> \n  <p>First, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ng-interactive/2020/may/15/coronavirus-map-us-latest-cases-state-by-state\">the figures from Johns Hopkins University</a> in Maryland:</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li>US cases: 1,486,469</li> \n   <li><strong>US deaths: 89,559</strong></li> \n   <li>New York cases: 340,661</li> \n   <li><strong>New York deaths: 22,013</strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <p>Other states heavily hit include New Jersey, Massachusetts, Michigan, Illinois, California, Pennsylvania and Connecticut. And cases are on the rise away from the more urban states.</p> \n  <p>The Trump administration spent Sunday continuing its pivot toward opening up the economy, in the face of crippling unemployment in an election year. But on Sunday night one of those independent voices who the president finds so irritating,<strong tabindex=\"-1\"> Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell</strong>, told CBS\u2019 60 Minutes, essentially, \u201cNot so fast.\u201d</p> \n  <p>\u201cThis economy will recover,\u201d Powell said, but \u201cit may take a while. It may take a period of time, it could stretch through the end of next year, we don\u2019t really know.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Powell also said unemployment could reach 25% and said the economy would not fully recover until Americans \u201cfeel they are safe\u201d.</p> \n  <p>Powell said: \u201c<strong>Assuming that there\u2019s not a second wave of the coronavirus</strong>, I think you\u2019ll see the economy recover steadily through the second half of this year \u2026 People will have to be fully confident, and that may have to await <strong tabindex=\"-1\">the arrival of a vaccine</strong>.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Short points to that end:</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li>Many experts fear a second wave of the coronavirus later in the year \u2013 one <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/14/rick-bright-testimony-coronavirus-trump-ousted-whistleblower\">Trump administration whistleblower</a> said last week the US was facing \u201c<strong>the darkest winter in modern history</strong>\u201d and spoke of the country being \u201cin deep shit\u201d.</li> \n   <li>Trump administration predictions about the development and availability of a vaccine are rated by most experts and even the Republican chair of the Senate health committee as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/10/trump-coronavirus-vaccine-senate-republicans\">hugely ambitious at best</a>.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <p>Powell\u2019s interview would always have seemed likely to stoke the president\u2019s ire \u2013 he also urged more stimulus spending by Congress, and though the House passed a $3tn bill on Friday the Republican Senate and White House don\u2019t want it.</p> \n  <p>And indeed <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1262205045359226880\"><strong>Trump went at CBS on Sunday night.</strong></a> But he was most exercised about the aforementioned whistleblower, Rick Bright, whose interview he said showed CBS and 60 Minutes were \u201cdoing everything in their power to demean our Country, much to the benefit of the Radical Left Democrats\u201d.</p> \n  <p>Trump attacked Bright, while characteristically claiming not to know him, and said \u201cthis whole Whistleblower racket needs to be looked at very closely, it is causing great injustice &amp; harm\u201d. </p> \n  <p>A whistleblower from the intelligence community, remember, triggered Trump\u2019s impeachment over his approaches to Ukraine for help against his political rivals.</p> \n  <p>Trump tagged Senator Susan Collins, who <a href=\"https://www.hsgac.senate.gov/media/minority-media/committee-approves-akaka-collins-whistleblower-protection-legislation\">authored</a> <strong>whistleblower protection legislation</strong>, and said he hoped the Maine Republican was \u201clistening\u201d. He also named the head of CBS, Shari Redstone, and said he hoped she would \u201ctake a look at her poorly performing gang\u201d.</p> \n  <p>In other news on Sunday night, the Axios website reported that Trump is <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1261640314709774338?s=20&amp;utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=newsletter_axiossneakpeek&amp;stream=top\">poised</a> to <strong>confirm his cut of all funding to the World Health Organization</strong> \u2013 in the middle of a pandemic.

  "<p>The Polish government intends to hold a presidential election in May, despite a growing chorus of voices saying that doing so amid a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">pandemic</a> would be unfair, undemocratic and potentially dangerous.</p> <p>Based on current polling, current president Andrzej Duda, an ally of the ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party, would be likely to gain more than 50% of the vote and thus win a second term in office without requiring a second round of voting.</p> <p>Incumbent politicians around the globe are receiving a boost in the polls during the uncertainty of coronavirus, as people seek stability during the crisis. Critics say the Polish government wants to capitalise on this rather than have a riskier election later on, when the public health and economic fallout from coronavirus could offer a very different backdrop.</p> <p>Poland currently has 2,420 confirmed cases of coronavirus and has seen 36 deaths. The country implemented some of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/10/coronavirus-several-eu-states-ban-mass-events-after-italian-lockdown\">earliest lockdown measures in Europe</a>, closing its airports and land borders more than two weeks ago, and the government hopes these strict measures could help avoid the exponential growth phase of the epidemic seen in western Europe.</p> <p>However, even as the lockdown measures have become progressively stricter in recent weeks, authorities have insisted that elections on 10 May go ahead. The rightwing PiS narrowly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/14/poland-populist-law-and-justice-party-increases-majority\">won a general election last autumn</a>, but lost control of the upper house of parliament. Controlling the presidency is key for the party to avoid political deadlock.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/29/lack-of-testing-raises-fears-of-coronavirus-surge-in-eastern-europe\">Lack of testing raises fears of coronavirus surge in eastern Europe</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Even as the government has introduced more restrictions on citizens\u2019 movement, forbidding them to leave the house except for essential business, it has refrained from officially declaring a state of emergency or a state of natural disaster, both of which require elections to be postponed.</p> <p>Jaros\u0142aw Kaczy\u0144ski, the powerful PiS chairman, has said in interviews that the vote must go ahead. In a late-night amendment to a parliamentary bill over the weekend, the government introduced a rule that senior citizens or those in quarantine could submit postal votes. Another amendment could soon be under consideration that would allow the entire public to vote by post.</p> <p>On Saturday, more than 40 NGOs called on the prime minister to introduce a state of natural disaster and postpone the vote. If the vote went ahead, \u201cthe election result would very likely not reflect the real preferences of voters, and the president\u2019s legitimacy to hold office in such conditions would be extremely weak\u201d, said the appeal. More than 500 doctors and medical professors have also signed an appeal calling on the vote to be postponed on the grounds that it would cause a health risk for those taking part.</p> <p>On Sunday, the candidate from the centre-right Civic Platform party, Ma\u0142gorzata Kidawa-B\u0142o\u0144ska, said that if the vote went ahead, the government would be responsible for any citizens who fell ill, and said she was suspending her campaign. Other candidates have not followed suit, but with public appearances or rallies impossible due to coronavirus, and political campaigning and point-scoring irresponsible during an epidemic, it is hard to see how any vote could be fair.</p> <p>Duda himself has hinted that the election could yet be moved: \u201cIf it did happen that the epidemic was raging \u2026 then in that situation, the election date could turn out to be unsustainable, but I am counting on it that we will be able to calmly hold these elections,\u201d he told state-run television over the weekend.</p> <p>As coronavirus wreaks havoc with the fabric of everyday life across the globe, a number of governments are wrestling with dilemmas of whether or not to go ahead with elections. On 15 March, both <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/15/french-urged-to-vote-in-local-elections-amid-coronavirus-lockdown\">France</a> and Germany\u2019s Bavaria held local elections amid much criticism, with many believing the vote contributed to the spread of the virus. The second round of French elections, scheduled for 22 March, was cancelled.</p> <p>A number of upcoming votes have been postponed due to coronavirus, including a presidential election in Bolivia scheduled for May and an Ethiopian general election in August. However, South Korea will push ahead with a general election planned for 15 April, promising that all 14,000 polling stations will be disinfected and equipped with hand sanitiser, and that patients with coronavirus can vote from hospital.</p>",
  "<p>The rise in Donald Trump\u2019s approval ratings \u2013 it would be misleading to call it a surge \u2013 appears to have shocked his opponents. Critics in the Democratic party and the media have noisily condemned and ridiculed his handling of the coronavirus outbreak, as have some scientists and economists.</p> <p>But it seems a growing chunk of the America public <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/28/trump-coronavirus-politics-us-health-disaster\">does not</a> agree.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/29/the-coronavirus-is-the-worst-intelligence-failure-in-us-history\">The coronavirus is the worst intelligence failure in US history | Micah Zenko</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The latest national poll, for ABC News-Washington Post, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/29/donald-trump-joe-biden-presidential-election-poll-results\">puts Trump</a> within two points of Joe Biden, on 47-49%, assuming the latter is the Democrats\u2019 nominee in November\u2019s presidential election. That\u2019s seven points up on February. Other polls also suggest a tightening race, especially in swing states.<br><br>While Biden still leads the race for the White House by a national poll average of just under six points, Trump\u2019s overall approval rating is also up on previous record lows, to around 47%, according to the <a href=\"https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/other/president_trump_job_approval-6179.html\">Real Clear Politics website</a>. Given the storm of mostly negative comment surrounding Trump\u2019s coronavirus performance, how can this be?<br><br>One obvious explanation for what is dubbed the \u201cTrump bump\u201d is that he is, after all, the president \u2013 and Americans, like citizens in <a href=\"https://www.irishtimes.com/news/world/out-of-his-depth-world-leaders-battle-coronavirus-with-mixed-results-1.4207078\">other countries</a>, tend to rally round their leaders at times of national emergency. In Italy, the prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, is up 27 points in one poll. France\u2019s previously deeply unpopular president, Emmanuel Macron, is up 14.<br><br>George W Bush saw his ratings go through the roof after the 9/11 attacks. His father, George HW Bush, hit 90%+ approval after the first Gulf war and held a parade to celebrate. By these measures, Trump should actually be doing much better in the polls. In fact, when asked whether the country is headed in the right direction under Trump, Americans say no by 55-38%.</p> <p>Such comparisons suggest the \u201cTrump bump\u201d phenomenon should be handled with care \u2013 and a lot of hand sanitizer.</p> <p>There are other reasons, too. Since the Covid-19 crisis erupted, and especially since the White House started holding regular, much-watched televised briefings, Trump has enjoyed something approaching a monopoly of media coverage, dominating the news cycles with dramatic policy announcements and updates.</p> <p>Rarely has the White House bully pulpit been so powerful. But his dominance of the public arena could yet backfire on the president.</p> <p>The fact that Trump\u2019s announcements have often been contradictory, ill-thought-through or plain false, and the fact he has reversed himself with alarming regularity \u2013 the latest U-turn being Sunday\u2019s decision to extend social distancing measures until the end of April \u2013 does not seem to put off many viewers. What they think they see is a man in charge.<br><br>Yet by casting himself as an all-powerful, all-seeing \u201cwartime president\u201d calling the shots in the biggest national health and economic emergency Americans have experienced, Trump is setting himself up for a fall. Many experts predict the measures he has taken so far will prove to be too little, too late and Covid-19 will spread more widely and for longer, and the death toll will begin to rise exponentially.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Trump\u2019s claim to be on top of things has also been helped by the uneven, patchy spread of the virus as of late March</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The impact of Trump\u2019s monopoly on messaging has been strengthened by the the political reality that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/28/joe-biden-campaign-coronavirus\">Biden</a>, for now, appears irrelevant \u2013 and risks being eclipsed by figures on his own \u201cside\u201d, such as New York\u2019s vigorous, tough-talking governor, Andrew Cuomo. That\u2019s good news for Trump.<br><br>Trump\u2019s claim to be on top of things has also been helped by the uneven, patchy spread of the virus as of late March. So far at least, the main hotspots are urban, predominantly in the north-east, and in Democratic cities such as New Orleans, Detroit and Chicago. Large swaths of mid-western and southern rural America are relatively unscathed at this point.</p> <p>This is where a lot of Trump supporters live. Many of them, and perhaps some independents and Democrats, too, may sympathize with Trump\u2019s barely repressed scepticism of recent weeks about the virulence and longevity of the pandemic, and with the importance he has attached to limiting economic damage to people\u2019s livelihoods (and Wall Street).</p> <p>Trump\u2019s gut instinct to dispute expert medical advice, without any evidence, plays into the anti-establishment, anti-science and Christian fundamentalist sentiments nurtured in Trump\u2019s Republican base. So, too, do his xenophobic attempts to blame the virus on foreigners and foes, principally China\u2019s communist leaders, immigrants and Europe.</p> <p>Ironically, the level-headedness, good judgment and common sense shown by a key adviser, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/28/coronavirus-new-york-dr-anthony-fauci\">Anthony Fauci</a>, a leading infectious disease expert, have made up for Trump\u2019s lack of those very qualities. Fauci has added gravitas to Trump\u2019s rambling, incoherent performances in front of camera. But vicarious leadership of this sort cannot work indefinitely.</p> <p>The real problems for Trump and his national savior act will begin when it becomes clear the administration\u2019s failure to instigate a nationwide testing regime, coupled with its refusal to order effective lockdowns of virus hotspots and tardiness in delivering life-saving equipment, is increasing the likelihood of a protracted, rolling nightmare of sickness and misery through the summer and fall.</p> <p>Based on a growing body of evidence from China, Italy and Spain, and prospectively the UK, an ineluctable, lethal spread of the virus may await Americans everywhere if such measures are neglected.

After downplaying the significance of the virus for weeks, he was forced to declare a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/13/donald-trump-coronavirus-national-emergency\">national emergency</a>. Having backtracked last week, asserting that the lockdown would <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/24/trump-coronavirus-us-easter-new-york-fauci-birx\">end by Easter</a> to avoid damaging the economy, he has now conceded it will have to last until the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/30/trump-says-keeping-us-covid-19-deaths-to-100000-would-be-a-very-good-job\">end of April</a>. It is true that his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/commentisfree/2020/mar/24/trump-pandemic-floundering-coronavirus-crisis\">approval ratings have gone up</a>, paralleling what happened with George W Bush after September 11. But Trump is clearly worried about the electoral consequences of a massive death toll and a recession that could see unemployment of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/26/us-unemployment-rate-coronavirus-business\">over 20%</a>.</p> <p>The difficulties experienced by national populists are unsurprising given they are no friends of the issues at the heart of this crisis: health, welfare and science. On the health front, the crisis reveals the folly of decades of underfunding and privatisation of the health system. Trump, Johnson and Salvini have embarrassing questions to answer in regard to their record as enemies of public healthcare. Furthermore, the crisis calls for a sea change in economic policy that is at odds with the ideological premises of national populism, which combines chauvinism on the cultural front and ultra-neoliberal policies on the economic front.</p> <p>The glaring need for state protection of strategic national industries, starting with health equipment and pharmaceuticals, is no anathema for national-populists who have already embraced trade protectionism. But the populist right has strongly opposed welfare measures that are becoming a matter of necessity <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/24/coronavirus-crisis-change-world-financial-global-capitalism\">to avoid social catastrophe.</a> Having repeatedly branded these policies as \u201cdangerous\u201d and \u201canti-patriotic\u201d, these politicians find themselves in the embarrassing situation of having to espouse them.</p> <p>Another skeleton in the closet is national-populists\u2019 disparagement of science. The coronavirus emergency confronts us with a threat that is best understood and measured through the lens of science. Epidemiologists and virologists have acquired media prominence and the public has been diligently following their recommendations. It is not clear whether this will lead to greater public trust in science and an erosion of the anti-science attitudes that national populist leaders have toyed with. However, it can be expected that citizens will take more heed of the risks flagged by scientists, including the climate emergency, which is also bound to exacerbate the spread of diseases.</p> <p>National-populists are well known for stoking people\u2019s fears. But the fears now prevalent are not of the kind these leaders are best positioned to exploit. Due to the urgency of health and economic worries, migration \u2013 the populist right\u2019s main enemy \u2013 has fallen in the list of priorities. Travel bans, and the fact that Europe and the US are the present focus of the pandemic, are leading to a drop in migration to these regions. In fact, we are now witnessing a historic reversal, with Mexico aiming to <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-52053656\">block</a><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-52053656\"> the border</a> with the US and African countries suspending flights from Europe, while UK farmers are organising charter planes <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/mar/28/fruit-and-veg-will-run-out-unless-britain-charters-planes-to-fly-in-farm-workers-from-eastern-europe\">to fly in farm workers from eastern Europe</a> to prevent fruit and vegetables being left unpicked. However, if the global economic crisis results in a new wave of migration like that of 2015, this scenario could drastically change \u2013 national-populists will try to validate their narrative of cosmopolitan globalisation as a dangerous vector of all sorts of ills.</p> <p>If the coronavirus crisis has momentarily disoriented the populist right, this does not mean it is vanquished. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/27/coronavirus-populism-trump-politics-response\">It would be misguided for the left</a> to believe that this crisis will work out in its favour. The health crisis is bound to be followed by a deep economic crisis, more similar to the Great Depression than to the 2008 financial crisis, and the populist right has already demonstrated its ability to prey on popular despair and find social scapegoats for economic ills. It can be expected that it will go down the same road, if anything becoming even more vicious.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/30/hungary-jail-for-coronavirus-misinformation-viktor-orban\">authoritarian measures</a> implemented on Monday by Viktor Orb\u00e1n in Hungary, with the suspension of parliament and the introduction of government by decree, may be the shape of things to come. In Italy, Salvini had no qualms about applauding Orb\u00e1n\u2019s move. We are also likely to see an exacerbation of anti-Chinese rhetoric. Trump made no apologies for calling Covid-19 \u201c<a href=\"https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/1239685852093169664?lang=en\">the Chinese virus</a>\u201d, while Steve Bannon <a href=\"https://adncuba.com/english/steve-bannon-covid-19-communist-party-virus-trump\">argued</a> that Covid-19 is a \u201cChinese Communist Party virus\u201d. Salvini <a href=\"https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/03/31/china-isnt-helping-italy-its-waging-information-warfare/\">has proposed</a> that \u201cif the Chinese government knew [about the virus] and didn\u2019t tell it publicly, it committed a crime against humanity\u201d, and allies in Brazil and Spain are adopting a similar line.</p> <p>Given the ties among national-populists, including their botched attempt to establish a \u201cnationalist international\u201d under the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/nov/21/steve-bannons-rightwing-europe-operation-undermined-by-election-laws\">auspices of </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/nov/21/steve-bannons-rightwing-europe-operation-undermined-by-election-laws\">Bannon\u2019s Movement</a>, this synchrony should not be taken as accidental. It has all the look of a coordinated strategy to channel the rage and despair caused by the crisis\u2019s brutal human and economic toll towards a racial and ideological enemy conveniently identified in the Chinese government. Along with self-proclaimed socialists, all opponents are likely to be smeared as \u201cChinese collaborationists\u201d: centrist US presidential candidate Joe Biden has already been termed <a href=\"https://www.nationalreview.com/2020/03/joe-biden-is-chinas-choice-for-president/\">\u201cChina\u2019s choice for president\u201d</a> by the conservative National Review.</p> <p>What may be in store is thus something much worse than the populist right of the 2010s: an extreme right using the whole arsenal of the red scare and rightwing authoritarianism to intimidate opponents and defend its interests from demands for meaningful economic redistribution. Though it has been confounded by this crisis, the populist right has not been suppressed.

Just as when Donald Trump imposed his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/12/coronavirus-global-recession-fears-intensify-as-trumps-europe-ban-fails-to-reassure\">European travel ban</a> selectively at first, the closing of frontiers in central and eastern Europe has a political significance that goes beyond mere sanitary demands. Politics in the time of plague is still politics. (This is why, by the way, the the much-discussed \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/15/experts-fashion-covid-19-reality-bites-trump-johnson\">return of the expert</a>\u201d is a fantasy, at best wishful thinking.)</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"7a98b795-e636-4e75-b443-22e9e6429f26\" data-atom-type=\"qanda\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Qanda\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/series/this-is-europe\">This is Europe</a> is a new stream of Guardian journalism that investigates the big challenges that transcend national boundaries, and seeks out the solutions that could benefit us all. These are testing times, and crises are not limited by national borders. But then neither are we. <br></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The sequence in which the Schengen provisions were suspended in central and eastern Europe tells us something important about societies in this region and perhaps even about the EU in general.</p> \n<p>First, there is the collective psychological dimension. The question of borders here is not just about geography or history, it is an existential one. For decades, post-communist countries have sought to escape Soviet influence in order to \u201creturn to Europe\u201d. The reasons were only partially economic. In all those memorable pictures of the fall of the Berlin wall in 1989, one can see crowds of east Germans who believed they were literally escaping the trap of history. Poles, Hungarians, Czechs and many other nations felt the same. In the 20th century, their central experience was that of cyclical collapse of their states, downfall of sovereignty and existential threat coming from two totalitarian systems. Their desire to join organisations such as Nato or the EU after the collapse of communism derived from their view that the west was a guarantor of institutional stability and personal safety. Joining the Schengen zone in particular, was seen as a way of finally leaving the geopolitical danger zone.</p> \n<p>Those countries should theoretically then have been the last, not the first, to close their borders in 2020. One of the reasons for this is that \u201creturning to Europe\u201d brought on the one hand modernisation and prosperity, but on the other a profound cost. One outcome of Schengen has been the <a href=\"https://www.ecfr.eu/specials/what_europeans_really_want_five_myths_debunked\">mass emigration</a> of well-educated workers. </p> \n<p>The brain drain of doctors has contributed to the dramatic situation facing many healthcare systems in the region. Long before the pandemic, Hungary had considered special contracts for young doctors to stop them emigrating en masse. In Poland, according to official OECD and Eurostat data, the number of practicing physicians per 1,000 inhabitants is <a href=\"https://data.oecd.org/healthres/doctors.htm\">only 2.4</a>. Whenthe UK announced new recruitment for the NHS of doctors from the EU, the understanding in Poland was that Britain\u2019s target was not France or Germany but farther east. Closing the borders has in fact been in the central and eastern European air for quite some time and the arrival of Covid-19 is just a catalyst.</p> \n<p>In spite of their extraordinary transformation since 1989 the post-communist states are also still perceived (including by their own citizens) as weak. True or false, this provokes neurotic reactions to almost any political threat. Radical political language and radical measures are taken because fear of another collapse of the state is still deep rooted. These real anxieties may gradually be eroding faith in joint EU solutions, such as the Schengen zone, which were previously seen as benign.</p> \n<p>The same reasons may explain why, for example, the response of Poles to their lockdown has turned out to be so disciplined and relatively well organised. If the state is weak \u2013 including the healthcare system \u2013 we want to stay at home and where possible organise for others. Voluntary networks in Poland cooking free meals for doctors or preparing additional Covid-19 tests are examples of such behaviour.</p> \n<p>There is therefore something of a perverse relief to the closing of borders in central and eastern European countries because of the pandemic. It might be only a fleeting feeling that will soon give way to a longing for European normality. However, it could also be the other way around.</p> \n<p>The second point relates to the way in which exceptional powers are a source of immense temptation for politicians, especially the illiberal populists in our part of Europe. Could they resist the lure of this extraordinary centralisation of power?</p> \n<p>In our city, Warsaw, like others around the globe, almost total silence reigns; drones take photographs of empty streets from above. But silence in the public sphere matters. In classical political philosophy it was associated with the danger of despotism. In The Spirit of the Laws Montesquieu writes about the deadly silence in the cities when the enemy is scaling the walls. Our adversary today has no legions. It is invisible \u2013 but that does not mean it is less threatening. Contrary to democracy, characterised by a robust and lively public sphere, in despotism people\u2019s interests and activities shift to the private sphere, where they focus on material goods and forget about the community. This threatens democracy, because while people are preoccupied, irreversible changes can be made to the political system.</p> \n<p>Silence in the public sphere will not be compensated for by the din online. In a more romantic era we thought the web and social media would give citizens better tools and make them more active. Today the passivity of citizen-followers is a well-established phenomenon, and our worries are about privacy and the lack of regulation of tech platforms. It is hard to assume that the internet will automatically become a remedy for the deserted public sphere.</p> \n<p>The spectre of a sanitary cataclysm effectively pushes democracy to the sidelines. In those countries where respect for democracy has been established over many years, it does not have to be dangerous. But things look different in places where illiberal populists have already started to translate the 2020 health emergency as the victory of the nation-state over a helpless EU, and the liberal rules-based multilateral order. In Hungary Viktor Orb\u00e1n has been allowed to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/30/hungary-jail-for-coronavirus-misinformation-viktor-orban\">rule by decree</a> during this state of emergency without any clear time limit and special measures include jail terms for spreading misinformation. Since 1989 no politician has been so powerful in the region.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/commentisfree/2020/mar/31/solidarity-members-eurozone-coronavirus-dutch-coronabond\">Without solidarity between members, the eurozone won't survive coronavirus | David Adler and Jerome Roos</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>In Poland, the government <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-poland-election/polish-presidential-challenger-urges-boycott-of-may-vote-halts-campaign-idUSKBN21G0NQ\">changed the electoral law</a> overnight to make sure the 10 May presidential elections go ahead, hoping that the only candidate able to organise a campaign is the current president, Andrzej Duda.

She didn\u2019t teach anybody else. </p> \n  <p>\u201cAnd she called me and said, is Andrew there? I said, \u2018No, mom, I\u2019m all alone here out on the island with my family.\u2019 And she said, \u2018Where is he?\u2019 And I said, \u2018He\u2019s up in Albany in the house with the big gates and the attack dog. And she said, \u2018Oh, that\u2019s too bad.\u2019 And I said, \u2018It\u2019s OK, mom. I love him and I\u2019ll make sauce for him, too.\u2019 And she started to cry, and then I said goodbye. That\u2019s what happened.</p> \n  <p><strong>Governor Cuomo: </strong>You\u2019ve always been good at manipulation. You\u2019ve always been the meatball of the family.

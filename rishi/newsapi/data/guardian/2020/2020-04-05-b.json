  "<p>Good morning, this is James Murray bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Monday 6 April.</p> <h2>Coronavirus</h2> <p><strong>The UK prime minister Boris Johnson has been admitted to hospital for tests after showing persistent symptoms of coronavirus 10 days after testing positive. </strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/05/boris-johnson-admitted-to-hospital-with-coronavirus\">A Downing Street spokeswoman said</a>: \u201cOn the advice of his doctor, the prime minister has tonight been admitted to hospital for tests. This is a precautionary step, as the prime minister continues to have persistent symptoms of coronavirus 10 days after testing positive for the virus.\u201d Johnson on 27 March became the first leader of a major power to announce that he had tested positive. He has been isolating in his Downing Street flat since.</p> <p><strong>NSW police have launched a criminal investigation into the Ruby Princess cruise ship coronavirus disaster. </strong>The ship has been the focus of intense criticism since its 2,700 passengers were allowed to freely disembark in Sydney on 19 March. At least 11 passengers from ship have now died, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/05/criminal-investigation-launched-ruby-princess-cruise-ship-coronavirus-disaster\">more than 30% of Australia\u2019s total Covid-19 deaths</a>. NSW police commissioner Mick Fuller said on Sunday the investigation will look at the actions of every agency involved as well as the cruise ship operator. \u201cThere\u2019s clear evidence now when it stopped in New Zealand Covid-19 has come off that ship and at least 10 people have died in Australia from Covid-19,\u201d Fuller said. \u201cThe only way I can get to the bottom of whether our national biosecurity laws and our state laws were broken is through a criminal investigation.\u201d</p> <p><strong>The US surgeon general has told the country to expect a \u201cPearl Harbour\u201d moment in the next week, as Covid-19 deaths reach unprecedented levels. </strong>\u201cIt\u2019s going to be the hardest moment for many Americans in their entire lives, and we really need to understand that if we want to flatten that curve and get through to the other side, everyone needs to do their part,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/05/pearl-harbor-us-surgeon-general-coronavirus-deaths-donald-trump-white-house-briefing\">Jerome Adams told NBC News\u2019 Meet the Press</a>.

The Cubs were famously inept. Generations of fans at their historic, ivy-clad Wrigley Field had witnessed nothing but failure and underachievement since their last World Series victory in 1908. Even the White Sox, their cross-city rivals, managed a World Series win in 2005 having started the season as 66-1 shots, but the Cubs\u2019 drought moved beyond a century with no sign of any relief.</p> <p>But just a year adrift of Gale\u2019s absurd prediction, in 2016, the Cubs made it through to the World Series for the first time since 1945. They were up against the Cleveland Indians who, in a nice twist, had the second-longest championship drought \u2013 a mere 68 seasons, compared to the Cubs\u2019 108. When the Indians jumped to a 3-1 series lead, including consecutive wins at Wrigley Field in its 100th year, for Cubs fans, all hope once again seemed lost.

It was an interesting time to be in the States in any case, with nothing on the news but wall-to-wall election coverage as the presidential race between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton went into its final few days. It felt like an escape to step from bright California afternoon sunshine into the welcoming darkness of a sports bar in Pasadena as the teams warmed up more than 2,000 miles away to the east.</p> <p>The bar was already packed in anticipation, with Cubs fans outnumbering those rooting for Cleveland by at least 10 to one. While reality so rarely lives up to expectation, Game 7 was an instant classic, with all the ebb and flow of fortunes and sudden instants of electrifying brilliance and high drama that sets baseball apart.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/series/index.html?vertical=Sport&amp;opinion-tint=false&amp;title=My%20Favourite%20Game&amp;description=In%20our%20new%20series%2C%20Guardian%20writers%20recall%20the%20great%20sporting%20contests%20they%20will%20never%20forget&amp;read-more-link=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fsport%2Fseries%2Fmy-favourite-game&amp;links=false\" data-alt=\"MFG\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/series/index.html?vertical=Sport&opinion-tint=false&title=My%20Favourite%20Game&description=In%20our%20new%20series%2C%20Guardian%20writers%20recall%20the%20great%20sporting%20contests%20they%20will%20never%20forget&read-more-link=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fsport%2Fseries%2Fmy-favourite-game&links=false\">MFG</a> </figure>  <p>The Cubs got on the board early, as the first batter up hit a long home run over the centre field wall. The Indians tied it in the third, went 3-1 down in the next and 5-1 down by the middle of the fifth. No sooner had Cubs fans started to believe than Cleveland roared back, with two runs to make it 5-3.</p> <p>It was 6-3 Cubs by the middle of the eighth, a three-run cushion with six outs needed for victory. But baseball is a sport like few others, since a single swing of the bat can score one, two, three or even four runs to turn a game on its head. With the score back to 6-4 in the bottom of the eighth and a runner on second, Rajai Davis hit a home run that tied the game at 6-6. For the fifth time in history, Game 7 of the World Series was going to extra innings.</p> <p>And then, it started to rain, delaying the finale for almost half an hour. So it was past midnight in Cleveland when Michael Mart\u00ednez came to the plate, nearly four and a half hours after the first pitch, with two men out, a runner on first and the Cubs 8-7 in front. Still, there was just one swing of the bat in it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0d2bb6b51a45e12a9ceedadd1884e1097861999d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0d2bb6b51a45e12a9ceedadd1884e1097861999d/0_0_4878_3402/1000..jpg\" alt=\"Cubs fans celebrate outside Wrigley Field back in Chicago\" width=\"1000\" height=\"697\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cubs fans celebrate outside Wrigley Field back in Chicago.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Charles Rex Arbogast/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A home run would mean a \u201cwalk-off\u201d victory for the Indians.

But many supporters believe the senator should continue collecting delegates, which will serve as leverage to shape the party platform at the national convention.</p> <p>\u201cCampaigns are an important way to maintain that fight and raise public consciousness on those issues,\u201d Sanders <a href=\"https://www.nbc.com/late-night-with-seth-meyers/video/sen-bernie-sanders-talks-about-the-2020-race-and-vice-president-joe-biden/4141900\">said</a> on NBC\u2019s Late Night with Seth Meyers on Tuesday. \u201cSo that\u2019s, I think, one of the arguments for going forward.\u201d</p> <p>Biden has largely avoided pressuring Sanders, well aware he will need support in the fall if he is the nominee. But he\u2019s not waiting for Sanders either. In recent weeks, Biden has begun making overtures to progressives and young voters. In a fundraising call on Friday night, Biden revealed that he had spoken to Sanders about his search for a running mate.</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s a friend,\u201d Biden said. \u201cI don\u2019t want him to think I\u2019m being presumptuous but you have to start now deciding who you\u2019re going to have background checks done on as potential vice-presidential candidates and it takes time.\u201d</p> <p>Like Biden, Sanders has been sharply critical of Trump\u2019s handling of the coronavirus outbreak. But they diverge on how they would harness the federal government to respond to a future pandemic.</p> <p>\u201cOur healthcare is without equal in the developed world in being dysfunctional and unfair and expensive,\u201d said Wendell Potter, former head of communications at Cigna who is now president of Business for Medicare for All. \u201cAnd I think this experience is going to bring into sharp focus how bad we are in terms of providing healthcare.\u201d</p> <p>As the crisis deepens, support for a single-payer system has climbed. In a <a href=\"https://morningconsult.com/2020/04/01/medicare-for-all-coronavirus-pandemic/\">survey</a> this month by Morning Consult, support for Medicare for All rose to 55%, its highest point since June 2019. From February to March, net support for Sanders\u2019 sweeping healthcare proposal nearly doubled from 11 points to 20 points.</p> <p>Sanders\u2019 advocacy has not moved his rival. Biden was recently pressed on MSNBC to explain why universal healthcare isn\u2019t a better option as millions of Americans stand to lose coverage in the coming months, a shift in the way questions about the sweeping proposal are typically framed.</p> <p>\u201cSingle-payer will not solve that at all,\u201d Biden replied. He said overhauling the US healthcare system would take too long and advocated instead for expanding the Affordable Care Act.</p> <p>In recent weeks, the Sanders campaign has stopped actively fundraising and instead leveraged its extensive donor list to raise money for charities helping Americans suffering from the outbreak. His team has surveyed supporters for ideas on how Congress can provide economic relief, circulated petitions demanding protective equipment and safety protections for Amazon and Walmart workers, and even adapted its digital organizing app, Bern, to help connect users with resources and aid.</p> <p>Sanders frequently hosts roundtable discussions. On one occasion he sought to channel a wartime president, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, hosting a fireside chat.</p> <p>The campaign says it raised more than $4.5m for the charities and more than 14 million people have viewed its livestreams.</p> <p>Sander has also used his perch in the Senate to influence the debate over the response to the crisis. When three Republican senators objected to a provision in the $2tn rescue package that expanded unemployment insurance, Sanders threatened to block the bill unless they dropped their opposition.</p> <p>\u201cOh my God, the universe is collapsing!\u201d he said, mocking their concern that the bill might give some struggling Americans extra financial support in a time of crisis. \u201cOh my word, will the universe survive?\u201d</p> <p>The recovery package, the largest ever in American history, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/25/senate-passes-coronavirus-stimulus-package\">passed</a> unanimously.</p> <p>On Friday, Sanders released a slate of priorities for the next stimulus package that his campaign touted as \u201cthe boldest legislation ever written in modern history\u201d.</p> <p>They include monthly cash payments of $2,000 monthly to all individuals, including undocumented immigrants, a freeze on rent and mortgage payments, hazard pay for essential workers and using Medicare to pay all medical costs incurred during the pandemic.</p> <p>The plan is almost certainly a nonstarter in a Republican-controlled Senate wary of expanding federal relief beyond what was included in the last package.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3282a51b2d0b82c0ead7bc34bb98a8038d2d9971\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3282a51b2d0b82c0ead7bc34bb98a8038d2d9971/0_73_4416_2650/1000..jpg\" alt=\"Bernie Sanders outside the Senate chamber in Washington DC on 25 March 2020.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bernie Sanders outside the Senate chamber in Washington DC on 25 March 2020.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Erik S Lesser/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>\u2018Unprecedented moment\u2019</h2> <p>It remains unlikely that Sanders can dramatically reshape the Democratic primary. He is almost hopelessly behind Biden in the delegate count and many of the biggest contests left are in states that appear more favorable to the former VP, like <a href=\"https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/president-primary-d/georgia/\">Georgia</a>, <a href=\"https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/president-primary-d/ohio/\">Ohio</a> and <a href=\"https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/president-primary-d/pennsylvania/\">Pennsylvania</a>.</p> <p>The next test comes on Tuesday, when Wisconsin is scheduled to hold its primary despite calls from Sanders and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/03/wisconsin-election-coronavirus-pandemic\">several legal challenges</a> to postpone it. Sanders will likely need a strong performance in the state to keep alive the already dim prospect of a comeback. A new <a href=\"https://law.marquette.edu/poll/2020/04/01/new-marquette-law-school-poll-finds-strong-support-for-coronavirus-closings-even-as-it-shows-substantial-economic-impact/\">poll</a> from Marquette Law School found Sanders trailing Biden by nearly 30 points in the battleground state.</p> <p>Sanders knows he has a decision to make. He is, as he tells every interviewer, \u201cassessing\u201d his options. Fundamentally, he believes the pandemic has changed the calculus.</p> <p>Is it possible to fall short of his presidential ambitions but succeed in his decades-long battle to remake US society?</p> <p>\u201cRight now in this unprecedented moment in American history,\u201d Sanders told <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/whoopi-goldberg-spars-with-bernie-sanders-on-the-view-why-are-you-still-in-the-race?ref=scroll\">The View</a>. \u201cI think we need to have a very serious look at how we need to go forward.\u201d</p>"

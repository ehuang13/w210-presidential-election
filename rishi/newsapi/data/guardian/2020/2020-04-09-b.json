There has been a lot of progress in ramping up testing capabilities, with pretty much all countries on the continent now theoretically able to test their citizens for the disease. As elsewhere however, there are shortages in the key chemicals needed for the tests, and that\u2019s causing problems.</p> \n  <p>This is particularly true in South Africa, which has the highest number of cases and has adopted a strategy based on aggressive screening and testing to try to stamp out any clusters and outbreaks of the disease before it can spread.</p> \n  <p>Officials in South Africa have yet to decide whether to extend the lockdown in South Africa, now in its third week.

One possibility may be to lift some restrictions but maintain strict rules to limit social distancing, but, they say, nothing is decided.</p> \n  <p>Other governments across the continent will face similar decisions in coming days and weeks.

The other person who runs or cycles just behind this leading person in the slipstream then moves through that cloud of droplets.</p> \n   <p>The slipstream is the zone that arises right behind a person when they are walking or cycling, and which pulls the air a bit along with this moving person, as it were.</p> \n   <p>Cyclists like to position themselves in the slipstream of others to reduce their air resistance. But someone who walks or runs also has such a slipstream. We have seen that no matter how that zone forms, droplets end up in that air stream.

We are told, by government, that he is \u201cimproving\u201d \u2013 and more recently, today, by a spokesman, that he is \u201cin good spirits\u201d. However, fear around the severity of his condition, and uncertainty around how long he will be absent from leading the country, has inevitably led to worries around the government\u2019s handling of communications around Johnson\u2019s health. Governments have, historically, struggled with delivering this kind of news.</p> <p>No government relishes the prospect of delivering bad news. And all governments have familiar ways of approaching the problem. Sluggish statistics are buried in budgets. Press releases are unsubtly reordered. Eye-catching announcements are thrown out on the same day that an otherwise negative story would dominate.</p> <p>The scepticism that this communication spin breeds can be a big problem in a crisis, never more so when dealing with something so sensitive and important as the health of the prime minister. Compared to the cases of past prime ministers who have fallen seriously ill, the government has been fairly timely in delivering news of serious changes to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/08/boris-johnson-improving-sitting-up-bed-chancellor-says-coronavirus\">Boris Johnson\u2019s condition</a>. But there are reasons why sceptics worry.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/02/government-publish-data-coronavirus-deaths\">Why isn't the government publishing more data about coronavirus deaths? | Jeni Tennison</a> </p> </aside>  <p>During a crisis, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/02/government-publish-data-coronavirus-deaths\">transparency has to be the watchword</a>. Losing the support of the public and the confidence of the media can badly damage trust in the government\u2019s response and increase panic and confusion. The best approach is to get ahead of the bad news, to spell out that worse is to come and that times will be difficult. After an initial burst of characteristic optimism, Boris Johnson did just this: he told the public that he would \u201clevel\u201d with them that \u201cmany more families are going to lose loved ones before their time\u201d.</p> <p>The news that the prime minister had been taken into intensive care was shocking. But it also caught many by surprise \u2013 the message from the government had until then focused on Johnson\u2019s continued commitment to his workload and, as Johnson himself set out in a tweeted video, his improving condition. It shows up the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/07/boris-johnson-illness-horror-coronavirus\">harsh reality of this virus</a> - how quickly it can turn far more serious.</p> <p> When prime ministers have fallen ill on the past, governments have often deliberately restricted how much information was shared with the public. Towards the end of 1918, as the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/audio/2020/apr/09/lessons-from-the-1918-spanish-flu-pandemic\">Spanish flu spread across the globe</a>, David Lloyd George\u2019s sore throat developed into a full-blown case. He collapsed and was hospitalised, but the seriousness of his condition \u2013 the prime minister was on a ventilator for more than a week \u2013 was kept quiet.</p> <p>In July 1953, when Winston Churchill had a stroke, it was kept quiet. With his assumed successor Anthony Eden in hospital himself, cabinet ministers found themselves discussing whether Churchill could remain in office without the news leaking until October, when it was hoped Eden would have recovered. Following that botched operation on an ulcer, Eden would be in considerable pain throughout his premiership \u2013 but details of the medication he used to manage that pain were not shared with the public and the extent of his drug use during the 1956 Suez crisis has long been a controversial question for historians.</p> <p>This approach is not confined to history, or the UK. When Bernie Sanders had a heart attack last year during the race to become the Democrat candidate in the US presidential election, his team did not immediately relay the news to the press. After Hillary Clinton fell ill with pneumonia in the 2016 contest against Sanders, her press secretary was forced to admit that \u201cin retrospect, we could have handled it better in providing more information \u2013 that\u2019s on us\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/apr/09/uk-coronavirus-live-lockdown-extended-boris-johnson-in-hospital-covid-19-latest-updates\">UK coronavirus live: Boris Johnson 'continues to improve' in intensive care; death toll in Scotland rises by 81</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Political leaders and their teams are still wary of revealing details of ill-health \u2013 for fear that any perception of weakness will be seized on by opponents, unsettle the public or be misreported by the press. There is a personal element as well \u2013 patients, however important, want to protect medical details, and there are family members whose privacy needs to be protected too. Which won\u2019t stop journalists seeking to check that bad news is not being withheld. The era of Twitter is a big contrast to 1953, when one of the first people to know about Churchill\u2019s condition was Pamela Berry, whose husband\u2019s family owned the Daily Telegraph. It was never leaked.</p> <p>The fact that the message came out so strongly that Johnson was doing well, until worse news arose, might be that his condition deteriorated rapidly; it could equally be the case that Downing Street was attempting to manage an increasingly worrying situation, or that the prime minister himself wanted to present a positive picture.</p> <p>The prime minister will no doubt accept the interest in his health. It comes with the job. But it is also a reminder that, as coronavirus particularly shows, anyone can get ill. At a time when so many people are being affected by this disease, political leaders should not view illness as a weakness.</p> <p>\u2022 Catherine Haddon is senior fellow at the Institute for Government</p>",

Reflecting the grim state of affairs, Biden on Wednesday marked the moment with little fanfare.</p> <p>\u201cThis primary is over \u2013 but this campaign is just beginning,\u201d he wrote in a fundraising email to supporters, with the subject line \u201cBernie\u201d. In the appeal, he added that he was \u201cso damn proud\u201d to be the Democratic nominee.</p> <p>It was result that seemed unlikely just two months ago, when Biden finished fourth and fifth against his Democratic rivals in the Iowa and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/feb/10/new-hampshire-primary-bernie-sanders-pete-buttigieg\">New Hampshire</a> contests respectively, and came in a distant second behind Sanders in Nevada. But black voters <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/feb/29/south-carolina-primary-voters-joe-biden-bernie-sanders\">revived his candidacy</a> in South Carolina, in a remarkable turnaround that set in motion his unstoppable march to the nomination.</p> <p>After accumulating an all-but indomitable lead over Sanders in March, Biden\u2019s grasp of the nomination was hardly in doubt. But the coronavirus forced the race into a state of suspended animation, as more than 15 states delayed their primaries and candidates were forced to cancel traditional campaign events.</p> <p>Now with primary race firmly behind him, Biden can turn to what is certain to be an extraordinarily divisive and wildly unpredictable general election campaign.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"32ed99fc664fc945ce330cf8332582c49beb7e53\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/32ed99fc664fc945ce330cf8332582c49beb7e53/60_0_1800_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"From a makeshift TV studio in the basement of his Delaware home, Biden connects with voters by internet live streams and TV appearances.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">From a makeshift TV studio in the basement of his Delaware home, Biden connects with voters by internet live streams and TV appearances.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThank goodness we can finally get to work,\u201d his wife, Jill Biden, said during a virtual fundraiser on Wednesday afternoon. \u201cWe could never presume that before.\u201d</p> <p>Like most Americans, Biden is homebound for the foreseeable future. From a makeshift TV studio in the basement of his Delaware home, he communicates daily with staff and policy advisers while connecting with voters by internet live streams and TV appearances. But Biden has struggled to find his voice in the midst of this national crisis.</p> <p>Though Trump, too, has been forced to suspend campaign activities, he delivers daily coronavirus task force briefings that critics argue increasingly resemble in tenor and length his raucous <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/24/donald-trump-coronavirus-briefings-2020-campaign-rallies\">Make America Great Again rallies</a>.</p> <p>Biden, who has spent most of his life in government, has walked a fine line in criticizing Trump\u2019s handling of the virus. Eager to avoid a \u201cpolitical fight\u201d with the president in a moment of crisis, he is also keenly aware that the pandemic and related economic devastation will likely determine who occupies the White House in a year\u2019s time.</p> <p>Biden and Trump spoke by phone for the first time this week to discuss the federal response to the outbreak. The idea for the call came from the White House counsellor Kellyanne Conway, who urged him to stop criticizing the president and instead offer his support.</p> <p>\u201cHe had suggestions,\u201d Trump said, describing the call as \u201cwonderful\u201d and \u201cwarm\u201d. But he added that it \u201cdoesn\u2019t mean I agree with those suggestions\u201d.</p> <p>Biden mostly echoed Trump\u2019s account, calling the president \u201cgracious\u201d. In an interview on CNN, Biden said he told the president that leadership was about \u201ctaking responsibility\u201d and then \u201claid out what I thought he should be doing\u201d.</p> <p>Any such goodwill was short-lived. By Wednesday evening, Trump had returned to the playbook he employed against Hillary Clinton to devastating effect. From the presidential podium, he slung all manner of insults an innuendo, referring to his rival as \u201cSleepy Joe\u201d and raising suspicion without reason as to why Barack Obama had withheld his endorsement during the primary. Obama has made clear that he would not get involved in the election until a nominee was chosen.</p> <p>Biden also recently spoke to Sanders by phone to let him know he was beginning to vet potential running mates. He told Sanders that he felt it was \u201cpresumptuous\u201d to move forward with the selection process while his rival remained in the race, but believed it was something that could not wait any longer.</p> <p>Biden likely won\u2019t amass the delegates to win the nomination until June. And then the coronavirus has thrown into doubt whether the party will be able to hold its convention in Milwaukee, where Biden would formally accept the Democratic nomination. The event was postponed from July to August, but Biden recently suggested that it may have to be a \u201cvirtual\u201d if the outbreak has not subsided by then.</p> <p>National Democrats, haunted by the bitter fallout from the 2016 primary, were encouraged by Biden\u2019s victory. In a string of consecutive victories, Biden built a broad coalition of African American voters, suburban women and working-class white people, winning key midwestern contests that Clinton lost four years ago. Now Biden faces the task of unifying the party, particularly the young, progressive voters who remain deeply skeptical of his candidacy.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"85db80c86d05e1124d29f1844b66d6d302b52b45\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/85db80c86d05e1124d29f1844b66d6d302b52b45/0_139_4200_2521/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Joe Biden has struggled to create grassroots appeal like Bernie Sanders.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Joe Biden has struggled to create grassroots appeal like Bernie Sanders.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Brittany Hosea-Small/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In his remarks on Wednesday, Sanders re-committed to vigorously campaign on Biden\u2019s behalf, even though he would nonetheless keep his name on the ballots in an effort to influence the Democratic platform and continue to elevate his message. It remains an open question how the former rivals will campaign together and whether Sanders will leverage his massive list of small-dollar donors to fundraise for Biden, who has struggled to create a comparable grassroots appeal.</p> <p>There are limits to Sanders\u2019 ability to deliver his followers, particularly the independents most drawn to his anti-establishment rhetoric. In 2016, surveys estimate that roughly <a href=\"https://twitter.com/b_schaffner/status/900123391155482624\">1 in 10 </a>Sanders supporters voted for Trump, while others backed a third party candidate. The president on Wednesday <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1247914464319504385\">invited</a> \u201cthe Bernie people\u201d to join him, pointing to issues like trade as an area of common ground between Trump and Sanders.</p> <p>Hours after ending his campaign, Sanders outlined how Biden could win over his supporters in an appearance on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert.</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s not going to adopt my platform,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cI got that, alright? But if he can move in that direction, I think people will say: \u2018You know what, this is a guy I think who we should support and would support.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Already progressive groups are weighing in, outlining demands and concessions that hope to see from Biden in exchange for their active support of his campaign.</p> <p>\u201cExclusively anti-Trump messaging won\u2019t be enough to lead any candidate to victory,\u201d a coalition of youth-led groups wrote in an open letter to Biden. \u201cWe need you to champion the bold ideas that have galvanized our generation and given us hope in the political process.\u201d</p> <p>Aware of the consequences of disunity, Biden has aggressively stepped up his outreach to progressive groups in recent weeks and has already made overt gestures, adopting policy proposals championed by his leftwing rivals.</p> <p>In a lengthy statement that praised Sanders for his \u201cpassionate advocacy\u201d, Biden appealed directly to his legions of dedicated supporters.</p> <p>\u201cI see you. I hear you, and I understand the urgency of what it is we have to get done in this country,\u201d he said. \u201cI hope you will join us.

In doing so, he grossly misstated what that settlement entailed. </p> <p>In January, the conservative group Judicial Watch announced that it had settled a 2017 lawsuit against the state of California. The settlement required LA county to remove inactive voters from its voter lists, and required California to direct other counties to do the same. All parties to the settlement agreed there was no admission of liability or wrongdoing by LA or California. </p> <p>Judicial Watch estimated that as many as 1.5 million people would have been removed from voter lists in LA county. But, there\u2019s no evidence than any of those people voted illegally. Judicial Watch said most of that 1.5 million would have ben \u201cvoters who have moved to another county or state or have passed away\u201d.</p> <p>At the time of the settlement, Paul Mitchell of the nonpartisan research firm Political Data Inc told the AP that the case was insignificant because it pertains to inactive voters who \u201care not getting voting materials, they are not casting ballots, they are not showing up in precincts\u201d.</p> <p>In other words, the settlement got LA county to update old records. </p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-08T23:12:10.075Z\">at 12.12am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5e8e54388f08ec70ceced379\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-08T22:46:51.189Z\">11.46pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Fact check: ventilators</strong></p> <p>\u201cIt looks like we\u2019re in great shape from the bed standpoint.

The estimates vary depending on the number, speed, and severity of infections, of course, but even the availability of testing affects the number of ventilators needed.... current estimates of the number of ventilators in the United States range from 60,000 to 160,000, depending on whether those that have only partial functionality are included.

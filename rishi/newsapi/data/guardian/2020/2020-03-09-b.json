  "<p>Good morning, this is James Murray bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Tuesday 10 March.</p> <h2>Top stories</h2> <p><strong>Fears of a global recession amid the spread of coronavirus worsened overnight, as stock markets and commodity prices plunged. </strong>With the FTSE and the Dow Jones both falling by more than 7%, and crude oil slumping by 30%, markets had their <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/09/ftse-plunges-to-below-6000-amid-global-coronavirus-sell-off-oil\">worst day since the global financial crisis in 2008</a>. The Guardian\u2019s economics editor, Larry Elliott, writes that \u201cCrash Monday\u201d is the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/09/coronavirus-crash-monday-is-the-price-were-paying-for-a-decade-of-cheap-money\">natural consequence of a fragile economy</a> \u201cmasked by perpetually low interest rates\u201d brought into sharp focus by the coronavirus outbreak. Scott Morrison will warn today that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/10/morrison-warns-coronavirus-hit-could-be-worse-than-gfc-amid-recession-predictions\">the signs point to a recession worse than the GFC</a> as he launches an appeal for businesses to \u201chold on to your people\u201d, including casual employees, if they succumb to Covid-19. Meanwhile, Italian hospitals <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/09/italian-hospitals-short-beds-coronavirus-death-toll-jumps\">have started to report bed shortages</a> as the country recorded its highest number of deaths in a 24-hour period. The head of Italy\u2019s prison system, Francesco Basentini, said a \u201cseries of rebellions\u201d had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/09/coronavirus-six-die-in-prison-protest-linked-to-italian-clampdown\">broken out throughout the country</a>. Six inmates died after they broke into a prison infirmary and overdosed on methadone.</p> <p><strong>The former Indigenous affairs minister Nigel Scullion is under fire after it was revealed that money from a fund for alleviating Indigenous disadvantage was handed out to the mining giant Fortescue Metals. </strong>The retail firm Wesfarmers, two NRL clubs, and Catholic and Anglican welfare organisations were also awarded millions of dollars. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/mar/09/mining-giant-given-millions-in-grant-by-coalition-from-fund-for-indigenous-disadvantage\">Scullion approved more than $560m worth of funding before the federal election in 2019</a>. Current Indigenous affairs staff said Scullion had awarded grants to 12 projects the department had advised against and ignored 28 of their recommended projects. These included school nutrition programs for Indigenous children and cadetships in the NSW Legal Aid Commission.</p> <p><strong>The New York attorney general says Prince Andrew will not voluntarily cooperate in the Epstein inquiry. </strong>The Manhattan US attorney, Geoffrey Berman, said: \u201cContrary to Prince Andrew\u2019s very public offer to cooperate with our investigation into Epstein\u2019s co-conspirators, an offer that was conveyed via press release, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/09/prince-andrew-will-not-voluntarily-cooperate-epstein-investigation-lawyer-says\">Prince Andrew has now completely shut the door on voluntary cooperation</a> and our office is considering its options.\u201d In a notorious interview with the BBC, the Duke of York denied allegations he had sex with a young woman provided by the disgraced billionaire. Epstein was found dead in his prison cell last year while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges.</p> <h2>Australia</h2> <p><strong>What are the symptoms of Covid-19 and what do I do if I think I have it?</strong> Australian health authorities have provided a stream of continuously updated advice about the coronavirus and it can be confusing to navigate.

Pell\u2019s counsel, Bret Walker SC, argues that the jury and the court of appeal were so swept away by the cardinal\u2019s accuser \u2013 by his testimony and his demeanour in the witness box \u2013 that they downplayed the evidence in Pell\u2019s favour.

  "<p>Donald Trump uses nativist anger to put his government beyond empirical argument. His presidency has eroded the norms of political conflict. He poses an ever-present danger to democracy. This November, Mr Trump is up for re-election. His effort is built to an alarming degree on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jan/30/brad-parscale-trump-social-media-rasputin-campaign-manager\" title=\"\">exploiting</a> the United States\u2019s lack of privacy safeguards around voting intention.</p> <p>Digital campaigning in the US is a largely unregulated field with little oversight of the ways in which voters are targeted or manipulated. Politicians in the US want to target specific voters to increase their base\u2019s turnout, convert the undecided and suppress their opponent\u2019s support. The evidence suggests that Trump\u2019s campaign rests on a data-gathering juggernaut that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jan/30/brad-parscale-trump-campaign-manager\" title=\"\">wants</a> \u201cto know who [voters] are and how [they] think\u201d. </p> <p><a href=\"https://townhall.com/columnists/bradparscale/2020/01/27/trump-rally-data-show-a-clear-winning-coalition-in-2020-n2560202\" title=\"\">Mr Trump\u2019s team</a> and other allied conservative groups are <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/political-campaigns-track-cellphones-to-identify-and-target-individual-voters-11570718889\" title=\"\">focusing</a> on voters\u2019 smartphones and their location histories. Phone apps often broadcast their location to data brokers and advertising firms. It does not take much to work out where the phone\u2019s owner lives and works. The data can show where they going jogging or if they go to church, or if they attended an anti-Trump protest on a given day. While apps\u2019 privacy policies might say that location information is used for advertising, the use of such data for invasive political purposes is rarely disclosed. Apps do not make it easy to tell how they collect information and with whom they share it.</p> <p>As a result, techniques such as \u201c<a href=\"https://www.propellant.media/geofencing-marketing-company-providers/\" title=\"\">geofencing</a>\u201d, which allows campaigns to reach people in a particular area, are becoming widespread. Last year, Brian Burch, the president of CatholicVote.org, a conservative group, <a href=\"https://catholicvote.org/peek-at-these-numbers/\" title=\"\">claimed</a> its work in Wisconsin identified 91,373 mass-attending Catholics who were \u201cnot even registered to vote\u201d. This in a state where Mr Trump <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2020/02/06/803508851/how-political-campaigns-are-using-geofencing-technology-to-target-catholics-at-m\" title=\"\">defeated</a> Hilary Clinton by only 22,748 votes. Democrats do it too, but are way behind. Last year, Beto O\u2019Rourke\u2019s team was able to identify people\u2019s mobile ID numbers during a rally with musician Willie Nelson. These were used to match people with email addresses to identify \u201cBeto\u201d supporters.</p> <p>India\u2019s Narendra Modi is a leading exponent of such campaigning. In 2018, it was <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/896cf574-31c0-11e8-b5bf-23cb17fd1498\" title=\"\">revealed</a> that the default permission settings of his NaMo app gave it almost full access to the data stored on users\u2019 phones, including audio, photos and videos, contacts and location services. Cybersecurity researchers said the app was sending user data to a US-based analytics company \u2013 allegedly without users\u2019 permission. In the US, data collection from apps is legal as long as it is disclosed. The European Union <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/reform/rights-citizens/how-my-personal-data-protected/how-data-my-religious-beliefs-sexual-orientation-health-political-views-protected_en\" title=\"\">forbids</a> the collection of sensitive data \u2013 like that of religion, health or political opinions \u2013 without explicit consent. The concern is that although EU law has been <a href=\"https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/eu-gdpr-uk-dpa-2018-uk-gdpr\" title=\"\">imported</a> into UK statute, it may be unwound in the years ahead. This would open the door to the kind of deceptive practices seen in the US that have undermined user privacy and have given rise to new legal and ethical <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2019/12/11/the-donald-trump-campaign-is-deploying-phone-location-tracking-technology/\" title=\"\">concerns</a> in this year\u2019s presidential campaign. </p>",

Analysts said the political dispute is likely to delay the start of the intra-Afghan talks.</p> <p>Abdullah and Ghani competed against each other in presidential elections in 2014 with similar disputed results. The disagreement led to the creation of a \u201cchief executive\u201d position for Abdullah, an extra-constitutional advisory role aimed at warding off instability.</p> <p>The Afghan media outlet TOLOnews reported on Monday that Ghani had offered Abdullah 40% of his cabinet and a role overseeing peace negotiations with the Taliban, but that the talks foundered over how much power Abdullah himself would wield.</p> <p>The second contested result in the presidential polls has added to the frustrations of Afghans, already dealing with a deteriorating security situation, high unemployment and uncertainty over the country\u2019s future.</p> <p>\u201cAfter signing the deal between Taliban and Americans I was so optimistic to witness peace,\u201d said Mohammad Mohammadi, 27, a medicine student in Herat. \u201cI haven\u2019t lived in peace in my life but today\u2019s events destroyed my ambitions.

Elsewhere, many events have been cancelled and a handful of schools shut.</p> <p>With more than 500 cases in the US and the numbers rising, the question is: what measures will the US government take and will the country see widespread shutdowns?</p> <p>\u201cYou should absolutely have the expectation that at some point coming up, this will be necessary,\u201d Dr William Hanage, an epidemiologist at the Harvard School of Public Health, told the Guardian. \u201cAnd have a plan for how you are going to do it, how you are going to look after the most vulnerable in the community, and how you are going to do it without turning your entire city and community upside down and inside out.\u201d</p> <p>As of Monday morning, at least<strong> </strong><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/1/d/18oVRrHj3c183mHmq3m89_163yuYltLNlOmPerQ18E8w/htmlview?usp=sharing&amp;sle=true#\">500 people</a> have tested positive for coronavirus in the US and 21 had died. So far, 80% of patients experience a mild form of the illness, which can include a fever and pneumonia, and many of these cases require little to no medical intervention. But that has raised concerns it could spread to vulnerable groups because infected people assume they just have a bad cold.</p> <p>\u201cThis is an intensely serious situation. However, there\u2019s a lot you can do to reduce the risk to yourself and others,\u201d Hanage said. \u201cYour risk of getting it, per day, is actually quite low. So people should not panic but they should prepare.\u201d</p> <p>The top advice to prevent the spread of coronavirus is regular hand washing, changing to fresh clothes at home, coughing and sneezing into the crook of the arm, not shaking hands and avoiding touching the face.</p> <h2>Are schools going to close?</h2> <p>Steps have been taken in places such as Washington state and New York City. Some schools there have closed down after parents or students tested positive for coronavirus.</p> <p>Globally, however, nearly 300 million children are out of school because of the coronavirus, according to Unesco. Italy, where at least 366<strong> </strong>people have died, has ordered the closure of all schools and universities in the country <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/04/italy-orders-closure-of-schools-and-universities-due-to-coronavirus?CMP=share_btn_tw\">until 15 March</a>.</p> <p>There are many unknowns about the role of children. At first, they appeared to not get the virus. Further investigation showed that it was because they have mild symptoms when infected and early research focused on the most dangerous cases. Now, the question is how much of a role children are playing in spreading the disease, if any.</p> <p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t close schools, you might run the risk having viral fountains in the middle of your community,\u201d Hanage said.</p> <p>Bioethicist Kelly Hills said school closures could lead some parents to form unofficial daycares with a few parents as supervisors of a group of kids while the others work. This could create a similar disease fountain as in school, just possibly without the education.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ers.usda.gov/topics/food-nutrition-assistance/child-nutrition-programs/national-school-lunch-program/\">The 29.7 million US children</a> who rely on free or low-cost lunch at school could also suffer.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ecf1beed37f4ef0fa221dc6fe242e866174b48cb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ecf1beed37f4ef0fa221dc6fe242e866174b48cb/0_0_5796_3634/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Some New York pharmacies have run out of face masks \u2013 but the CDC recommends people do not wear masks.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"627\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Some New York pharmacies have run out of face masks \u2013 but the CDC recommends people do not wear masks.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Justin Lane/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cToo many people in America live paycheck to paycheck for this [school closures] to really be something that is an easy answer,\u201d said Hills.</p> <p>She does expect more school closures in the near future and anticipated sports competitions, professional or amateur, to be cancelled or played in empty stadiums.</p> <p>In China, government officials went as far as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/15/coronavirus-outbreak-wuhan-china\">to lock down the city of Wuhan</a>, where the virus was first detected in December, in a practice known as cordon sanitaire. This concept dates back to the medieval ages, and while there is <a href=\"https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/03/china-s-aggressive-measures-have-slowed-coronavirus-they-may-not-work-other-countries\">evidence it slowed the spread of coronavirus</a>, public health experts said it was best for the US to avoid it.</p> <p>When more extreme measures are taken, particularly if they are poorly communicated, it can breed fear, stigmatization and violence. It can also create distrust in the government, media and healthcare institutions.</p> <p>Angela Rasmussen, a virologist at Columbia University, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/angie_rasmussen/status/1235613590691827712\">tweeted</a>: \u201cRather than playing cordon sanitaire whack-a-mole with communities across the country, I\u2019d like to see these resources go toward engaging the public on how to stop virus spread. Incentivizing employers to allow telecommuting. Providing safety nets to vulnerable people.\u201d</p> <h2>If shutting down cities is not the answer, what is?</h2> <p>China was also successful at making testing widely available and free, something the US has failed to do.</p> <p>The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) initially prevented labs from developing their own tests, then sent out faulty kits and had strict guidelines for who should be tested. Once these issues were addressed, more than a hundred cases were identified in a few days.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>This is an intensely serious situation.

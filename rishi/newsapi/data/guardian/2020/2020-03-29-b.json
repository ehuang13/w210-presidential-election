  "<p>Donald Trump has gained ground on his probable challenger in November\u2019s presidential election and is in a \u201cnear tie\u201d with Joe Biden, according to a new poll released on Sunday.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/poll-shows-trump-and-biden-in-a-competitive-race-for-the-white-house/2020/03/28/515cb8ba-7037-11ea-b148-e4ce3fbd85b5_story.html?tidr=a_breakingnews&amp;hpid=hp_no-name_hp-breaking-news%3Apage%2Fbreaking-news-bar&amp;itid=hp_no-name_hp-breaking-news%3Apage%2Fbreaking-news-bar\">Washington Post-ABC News poll</a> put the former vice-president ahead by 49% to 47% among registered voters. In February, the same poll put the US president seven points behind.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/28/joe-biden-campaign-coronavirus\">#WhereIsJoe: Biden campaign tries to stay relevant amid coronavirus</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Amid the coronavirus crisis, respondents favoured Trump on the economy and Biden on healthcare.</p> <p>Reporting the poll, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/poll-shows-trump-and-biden-in-a-competitive-race-for-the-white-house/2020/03/28/515cb8ba-7037-11ea-b148-e4ce3fbd85b5_story.html?tidr=a_breakingnews&amp;hpid=hp_no-name_hp-breaking-news%3Apage%2Fbreaking-news-bar&amp;itid=hp_no-name_hp-breaking-news%3Apage%2Fbreaking-news-bar\">the Post said</a> it \u201ctests only national sentiment, which would translate into the popular vote, not the state-by-state competition for an electoral college majority\u201d.</p> <p>In 2016, Trump beat Hillary Clinton in the electoral college despite losing the popular vote by nearly 3m ballots.</p> <p>In key swing college states, the 2020 race is tight. According to the realclearpolitics.com polling average, for example, <a href=\"https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2020/president/wi/wisconsin_trump_vs_biden-6849.html\">Wisconsin</a> is a tie and Trump is 1.3% ahead in <a href=\"https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2020/president/fl/florida_trump_vs_biden-6841.html\">Florida</a> while Biden leads by around four points in <a href=\"https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2020/president/mi/michigan_trump_vs_biden-6761.html\">Michigan</a> and <a href=\"https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2020/president/pa/pennsylvania_trump_vs_biden-6861.html\">Pennsylvania</a>.</p> <p>The same site\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.realclearpolitics.com/\">general election average</a> puts Biden nearly six points ahead.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/28/joe-biden-campaign-coronavirus\">Some critics</a> of the former vice-president have attacked his response to the coronavirus outbreak.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m chomping at the bit,\u201d Biden told reporters on a recent video call from his Delaware home. \u201cI wish I were still in the Senate, you know, being able to impact on some things. But I am where I am.\u201d</p> <p>And Trump is the man in the White House. On Friday, the polling guru Nate Silver <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NateSilver538/status/1243622207357702146\">said on Twitter</a>: \u201cAlmost nothing about what Joe Biden is doing for the next few weeks is gonna matter much for November. And almost everything about what Donald Trump is doing is going to matter a lot.\u201d</p> <p>On Saturday, Trump visited Norfolk, Virginia, for the departure of a hospital ship bound for New York harbour. He also stoked an extraordinary confrontation with New York\u2019s governor, Andrew Cuomo, by suggesting some sort of enforced quarantine for New York, New Jersey and Connecticut.</p> <p>An incredulous Cuomo said any such quarantine order would amount to a \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/28/donald-trump-virginia-usns-comfort-travel\">federal declaration of war</a>\u201d. Trump backed off.</p> <p>Biden has not yet secured the Democratic nomination for 2020 but he is well ahead of the Vermont senator Bernie Sanders in the delegate count. Amid widespread public lockdowns as the coronavirus spreads, many primaries have been delayed, leaving the race in limbo.</p> <p>The Post-ABC poll put Biden 55%-39% up over Sanders among Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents. The last such poll had Sanders in a healthy lead.</p>",

The taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, said on Friday evening that from midnight people should stay home for two weeks, until 12 April, in a significant tightening of curbs on social and commercial life. <br></li> \n   <li><strong>Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro insinuated that the number of coronavirus cases was being inflated for political purposes. </strong>He added: \u201cSome people will die. I\u2019m sorry. That\u2019s life.\u201d</li> \n   <li><strong>Syria said on Friday it was banning travel between cities and governorates</strong> as part of tightening measures to curb the spread of coronavirus. Syria has recorded five cases of corona virus so far but relief agencies worry that any outbreak could be lethal after years of conflict that has ravaged its healthcare system.</li> \n   <li><strong>The UK has again recorded its biggest daily rise in coronavirus deaths.</strong> In the last 24 hours, 181 people have died after testing positive for Covid-19. It comes after 115 deaths were recorded the day before. The UK death toll stands at 759, with 14,579 confirmed cases.</li> \n   <li><strong>Boris Johnson has tested positive for coronavirus</strong> and is exhibiting \u201cmild symptoms\u201d. In a video posted on Twitter, Johnson confirmed he had developed \u201ca temperature and persistent cough\u201d over the last 24 hours. The UK prime minister, 55, said he was now self-isolating and working from home and would continue to lead the national fightback against the virus. Matt Hancock, the UK\u2019s health secretary, also tested positive. </li> \n  </ul> \n  <figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n   <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"11250624-271c-4584-9cd8-37070f7dfdb5\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n    <div>\n     <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/sncNfd4YIYo?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n    </div>\n   </gu-atom> \n  </figure> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Spain recorded a new record single-day death toll.</strong> There have been 769 deaths in the past 24 hours, bringing the death toll to 4,858.

The country now has 64,059 confirmed cases up from 56,188 yesterday.</li> \n   <li><strong>The Spanish government has withdrawn 9,000 Chinese-made coronavirus testing kits</strong> from use after it emerged that they had an accurate detection rate of just 30%. </li> \n   <li><strong>The number of cases in Iran has risen to 32,332,</strong> while the number of deaths hits 2,378, according to the country\u2019s health ministry. </li> \n   <li><strong> </strong><strong>Covid-19 continues its spread across the African continent with 3243 cases and 83 deaths now recorded.</strong> South Africa has reported its first deaths resulting from Covid-19.

Italy had 919 new fatalities, taking the total to 9,134. The update follows a warning from the head of the country\u2019s national health institute that infections have not yet reached their peak and that lockdown measures will have to be extended.</li> \n   <li><strong>France extended its lockdown by a fortnight.</strong> France has recorded 299 Covid-19 deaths in the last 24 hours, the prime minister announced in a speech. Edouard Philippe said it was clear that the country was \u201cjust at the beginning of this epidemic wave\u201d. </li> \n   <li><strong>A spike in coronavirus patients means hospitals in and around Paris will reach saturation point within 48 hours, </strong>said the head of the French Hospital Federation.</li> \n   <li><strong>Four died on a cruise ship after the outbreak.</strong> Four people have died on a cruise ship stranded off the coast of Panama after a Covid-19 outbreak on board, the boat\u2019s owners have confirmed.</li> \n   <li><strong>The US approved a $2.2tn economic stimulus package.</strong> Congress has given final approval for a $2.2tn financial package designed to rush federal aid to workers, businesses and a healthcare system ravaged by the virus, after politicians united to overcome a last-minute attempt to delay its passage.</li> \n  </ul> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-03-28T00:40:29.843Z\">at 12.40am GMT</time></p> \n</div>"

  "<p>Dave\u2019s Mercury prize-winning debut album, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/dec/19/best-albums-2019-no-2-dave-psychodrama\">Psychodrama</a>, was the biggest-selling British rap album in the UK in 2019, certified gold for selling more than 100,000 units. Those numbers wouldn\u2019t even have landed him in the top 10 biggest rap albums in France last year, where <a href=\"https://djbooth.net/features/2020-01-09-france-got-something-to-say-album-sales\">artists from greater Paris sell more rap albums than acts from any other city</a>. But, while Dave won album of the year at this year\u2019s Brit awards, and gave a nationally televised performance decrying the prime minister as racist, at last month\u2019s Victoires de la Musique \u2013 France\u2019s equivalent of the Brits \u2013 none of France\u2019s black or Arab rappers were nominated in an album, artist or song category.</p> <p>Days after the ceremony, French music industry body SNEP, which is responsible for collating the charts, distributing royalty payments and more, declared rap music an \u201coverexposed phenomenon\u201d in <a href=\"https://snepmusique.com/actualites-du-snep/marche-2019-de-la-musique-enregistree-decryptage-des-resultats/\">their 2019 market report</a>. It argued that \u201cfan support for urban music must not eclipse the performances of other musical genres\u201d \u2013 an explicit call for less promotion and celebration of the most successful French popular music movement of all time.</p> <p>This popularity, SNEP said, would be \u201ccorrected\u201d as older listeners \u2013 who are assumed to listen to other types of music \u2013 started paying for subscriptions to streaming services. Unlike in the UK and US, SNEP does not count ad-supported streams or YouTube views towards sales \u2013 an unfortunate decision for rap, given that it is the country\u2019s most streamed genre. These constraints notwithstanding, last year French rappers were responsible for 16 of the 19 No 1 singles in France, and topped the album chart for 31 weeks.</p> <p>Domestic rap has become the soundtrack to a national identity crisis, viewed by its detractors as a threat to the cultural landscape of a country marked by bitter racial divides. Yet, after three decades of attempts to delegitimise it, many artists have come to ambivalently accept the persistent discrimination. There was no outrage at their being overlooked at the Victoires. Most musicians and industry figures I approached for comment were not prepared to speak publicly about prejudice within the industry, even while acknowledging it as omnipresent. One artist manager said: \u201cIt\u2019s not shocking, it\u2019s always been here. We work on the fringes, organise ourselves, create our own businesses and move forward.\u201d</p> <p>French rap\u2019s ascent from peripheral subculture to mainstream staple began during the golden era of 90s US hip-hop. Inspired by the political rhymes of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2016/dec/07/public-enemy-10-of-the-best\">Public Enemy</a>, <em>rap fran\u00e7ais</em> built its reputation on vociferous social criticism, opposing racism and police brutality. The commercial achievements of the groups Supr\u00eame NTM and Iam helped make France <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5kIjAikHbs\">the largest hip-hop market outside </a><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5kIjAikHbs\">the US</a>, which it remains to this day.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amX9hnr32A0\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/amX9hnr32A0?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>While American rap edged towards consumerism, French rap continued to reflect the social chasm of life in the <em>banlieues</em> \u2013 suburban housing estates \u2013 where France\u2019s migrants had become progressively ghettoised. France had been largely white until the 1950s. An increase in migrants from the country\u2019s North African former colonies throughout the 60s and 70s paralleled a period of immense economic change intensified by the oil crisis in the 70s. As successive governments failed to temper unemployment, a prominent far-right rhetoric emerged, scapegoating migrants for the economic malaise.</p> <p>As <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/jean-marie-le-pen\">Jean-Marie Le Pen</a>\u2019s xenophobic Front National party stoked racial tensions in the 80s, proposing to change the law to favour French nationals for jobs, rap became another target. In 1995, the group <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjalUVgq32E\">Minist\u00e8re Amer</a> were<a href=\"https://www.liberation.fr/france-archive/1995/08/31/ministere-de-l-interieur-contre-ministere-amer-une-plainte-a-ete-deposee-contre-le-groupe-de-rap_140412\"> charged</a> for an anti-police song, casting the first stone in a decades-long conflict between the interior ministry and rap. The same year, Supr\u00eame NTM were arrested while performing their song <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDlobk6WXI\">Police</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/11/16/news/2-french-rappers-get-jail-for-insults-to-police.html\">sentenced to six months in prison</a>.</p> <p>In the 2000s, rap found a new enemy in interior minister <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/nicolas-sarkozy\">Nicolas Sarkozy</a>. The future president led a decade-long campaign against rap, bringing libel charges against <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/23/world/europe/23iht-rapper.4.16422288.html\">La Rumeur</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/nov/11/arts.france\">Sniper</a>, and making it an imprisonable offence to \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/feb/07/france.jonhenley\">offend the dignity of the republic</a>\u201d. Sarkozy\u2019s issue with rap rested on its alleged anti-white racism, a declaration supported by more than 200 parliamentarians, who, following the 2005 French riots, <a href=\"https://www.lemonde.fr/societe/article/2005/11/24/des-parlementaires-reclament-des-poursuites-contre-des-rappeurs_713789_3224.html\">accused</a> multiple rappers of inciting violence and racism. The same year, Sarkozy\u2019s UMP party instituted <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/apr/15/highereducation.artsandhumanities\">a law</a> requiring schools to teach students the positives of colonialism.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"1a02f5a8ec12d82a7eed7e35a1d092ecd8c20f90\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1a02f5a8ec12d82a7eed7e35a1d092ecd8c20f90/0_0_5186_3457/1000.jpg\" alt=\"French rapper Gradur.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Political rhymes\u2019 ...

Before his campaign for re-election, his ally and interior minister Claude Gu\u00e9ant infamously declared that \u201c<a href=\"https://www.france24.com/en/20120205-france-minister-slammed-unequal-civilisations-politics-gueant\">all civilisations are not of equal value</a>\u201d. Journalist <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RphlDC?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">Rapha\u00ebl Da Cruz</a> says that Sarkozy\u2019s legal pursuits validated the anti-immigrant sentiment that most rappers had faced throughout their lives, \u201cresulting in a generation of rappers avoiding airing their grievances with politicians and police brutality, for fear of cancelled concerts, losing record deals or political reprisal\u201d.</p> <p>When Sarkozy stepped down in 2012, rap was in the midst of a renaissance, facilitated by the rise of the group<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN2ozTZNJC0\"> Sexion </a><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN2ozTZNJC0\">d\u2019Assaut</a>, who left social commentary behind to embrace a pop-friendly, confrontation-averse style. The group\u2019s success renewed major label interest and coincided with the streaming revolution. With access and distribution democratised, a new generation of minority French youths could now break into the charts \u2013 and make money.</p> <p>SNEP integrated streams into sales in 2016, and the resulting tidal wave of domestic rap that entered the charts was typified by French-Algerian brothers <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PODnRarD78\">PNL</a>, who independently sold a million copies of their album, Dans la L\u00e9gende. Like France\u2019s World Cup-winning football players \u2013 who in 2016 were up against an attempt by the French Football Federation to introduce a quota system to restrict players of African origin \u2013 France\u2019s black and Arab rappers rose from ostracised communities to provide the country with its most notable 21st-century cultural achievements. As Le Pen\u2019s daughter, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/marine-le-pen\">Marine</a>, made historic gains from the anti-Islam mood in the wake of the Paris terror attack in 2015, Muslim rappers such as PNL and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/jun/05/mhd-so-many-french-rappers-are-inspired-by-american-hip-hop-im-the-opposite\">MHD</a> emerged to front a domestic rap revolution from the throes of racial intolerance.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"b9f22bb6104bfcc0b8f5552c80c62854d84c7b89\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b9f22bb6104bfcc0b8f5552c80c62854d84c7b89/0_0_2048_1152/1000.jpg\" alt=\"PNL atop the Eiffel Tower.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"563\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Domestic rap revolution\u2019 ...

MHD, who is currently awaiting trial for a 2018 murder allegation, blended contemporary trap with the pop music of his Senegal and Guinea heritage, and, Sylla says, \u201ccreated space for a new generation of Afro-French artists such as <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqYxVsEaypk\">Ninho</a> and<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPGgnzc34tY\"> Aya Nakamura</a>, and even encouraged established rappers such as <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Stet_4bnclk\">Booba</a> to embrace their roots\u201d. As Le Pen\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/feb/05/marine-le-pen-promises-liberation-from-the-eu-with-france-first-policies\">popularity</a> led to a run-off with Emmanuel Macron in the 2017 presidential election, France\u2019s widening schism was underscored by a record breaking year for rap: 11 No 1 albums, with SNEP handing out more than 200 gold, platinum and diamond singles sales plaques to French rappers.</p> <p>But four months into 2018, SNEP hastily<a href=\"https://www.lebureauexport.fr/en/news/2018/04/france-snep-will-no-longer-take-free-streaming-into-account/\"> reformed</a> its chart criteria, disqualifying all streams played without a paid subscription. The organisation \u2013 composed of members from all major labels in France \u2013 insisted that the change (aligning with Germany and Italy, but not the US or UK) was made to ensure a sales system more reflective of revenue. However, an A&amp;R director of a major French record label, who spoke to me on the condition of anonymity, maintains the sudden change was \u201cclearly a response to rap\u2019s unanticipated success\u201d.</p> <p>The amendments did little to impede rap\u2019s growth, which in 2018 led to nine No 1 albums and 14 No 1 singles (almost twice the number of rap hits to ever top the US Billboard 100 in a year). SNEP retorted in January of 2019, this time with another revision to album classifications that divided the number of streams of the most played song on an album in half. Still, rap\u2019s success continued. In 2019, PNL\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/apr/05/pnl-deux-freres-review\">Deux Fr\u00e8res</a> was one of 10 No 1 French rap albums and one of five to be certified multi-platinum; former Sexion d\u2019Assaut frontman Gims <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2q5_KIs-wbY\">filled</a> the 81,000-capacity national stadium and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQK0f6wzww8\">Soprano</a> played two sold-out concerts to 100,000 fans in <a href=\"https://www.laprovence.com/actu/en-direct/5821137/2019-dans-le-retro-une-annee-marquee-par-le-double-de-soprano.html\">Marseille</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d8b9bdd65e9c1485134a956bfb0770ccb8f2b0ce\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d8b9bdd65e9c1485134a956bfb0770ccb8f2b0ce/0_0_2799_1867/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Soprano performs at Victoires de la Musique in 2018.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Soprano performs at Victoires de la Musique in 2018.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Thomas Samson/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And yet, at this year\u2019s<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKZLOOr4wGU\"> Victoires de la Musique</a>, rap\u2019s landmark achievements were whitewashed in favour of purveyors of the French <em>chanson</em> style. Aside from PNL\u2019s cursory nomination for an audiovisual award, decided by a public vote, only two rappers, both white, were nominated. Both lost. For the first time in 20 years, there was no category for urban album, previously known by the bizarre racial catch-all \u201crap, reggae or groove\u201d award. Victoires\u2019 president, Romain Vivien, <a href=\"https://www.tplmusique.org/romain-vivien-representer-la-filiere-musique-dans-son-entier/\">refuted claims</a> of a lack of minority representation,<strong> </strong>saying that the nominations merely reflected its members\u2019 sympathies, though this itself is arguably a sign of institutional racism.</p> <p>The Victoires, created by the ministry of culture as part of its objective to promote and protect French cultural heritage, were not designed for hip-hop, according to Jonathyne Briggs, author of Sounds French: Globalisation, Cultural Communities and Pop Music. \u201cRap has always been seen as something external, imported to France, only exacerbated by its connection to the culture of \u00e9migr\u00e9s\u201d, he says. Briggs believes the continued focus on traditional pop forms will do little to hinder rap\u2019s popularity, though: \u201cPop music is about conformity. Rap\u2019s nonconformity is still able to amplify discourse outside of existing structures.\u201d</p> <p>The late funk musician Manu Dibango <a href=\"https://www.lemonde.fr/culture/article/2020/01/31/au-fil-des-voix-militant-pour-la-diversite-culturelle_6027994_3246.html\">lamented</a> the homogeneity at this year\u2019s Victoires, claiming the list of nominees read like a \u201cvain search for diversity\u201d. According to Olivier Cachin, a journalist and presenter of rap TV shows for 30 years, what began as indignation 20 years ago is now an irreconcilable \u201cdivorce\u201d. From the humiliation of Celtic trio <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80hMEKlLVgQ\">Manau</a> infamously besting French rap royalty Supr\u00eame<em><strong> </strong></em>NTM, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_6KlvS992Q\">Arsenik</a> and MC Solaar to the first rap award in 1999 to the inexplicable exclusions in 2020, Cachin says the message to rap was always clear: \u201c<a href=\"https://www.francetvinfo.fr/culture/musique/victoires-de-la-musique/c-est-vu-comme-une-sous-categorie-pourquoi-les-victoires-de-la-musique-et-le-rap-n-arrivent-pas-a-accorder-leurs-violons_3822861.html\">You\u2019re not welcome</a>.\u201d Many believe it\u2019s time for rap to have its own award show, such as the Mobo or BET awards; a statement ceremony that, in France, would only serve to spotlight the gross racial divide within the industry.</p> <p>A spokesperson for SNEP suggested to me that rap\u2019s presence in France is merely cyclical, pointing to pop\u2019s success in 2019. \u201cIt\u2019s important to remember the biggest selling album of the year was <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fy1xQSiLx8U\">Ang</a><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fy1xQSiLx8U\">\u00e8le</a>\u2019s,\u201d they said, referring to the 24-year-old Belgian singer. \u201cWhile urban music comprises much of the top albums and singles, it doesn\u2019t reflect the interests of France as a whole, which are still largely pop, rock and <em>chanson fran\u00e7aise</em>\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"f44e3503067b32fddc58bdd7ef189139393d9bd4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f44e3503067b32fddc58bdd7ef189139393d9bd4/0_0_2953_4429/667.jpg\" alt=\"Aya Nakamura.\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Demarcated down ethnic lines\u2019 ... Aya Nakamura.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Record Company Handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It\u2019s a telling statement, one that aims to downplay the Frenchness of those listening to rap music, in keeping with how the terms \u201cchanson\u201d and \u201crap\u201d are demarcated down ethnic lines. Malian-French <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDFupjRKwZY\">pop</a> star Aya Nakamura was inaccurately labelled \u201c<a href=\"https://snepmusique.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Global-Music-Report-2019-_Site.pdf\">the voice of French rap</a>\u201d by SNEP. When PNL submitted their album Dans la L\u00e9gende for the Victoires in 2017, they declared the project not to be urban, but <em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEbJwZOkvDM\">chanson</a></em>. While they were not selected for the ceremony, their reasoning was later given as a reason for getting rid of the rap category.</p> <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/lanskywalker\">Lansky</a>, journalist for French rap website <a href=\"https://yard.media/\">Yard</a>, doesn\u2019t see these industry machinations as obstacles for French rap in the long-term: \u201cThe reality is that rap is the new pop, and many current artists labelled as pop, such as Ang\u00e8le, Louane and Kendji Girac, are looking to rap and related genres for inspiration.\u201d</p> <p>In the French charts so far in 2020, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/the-weeknd\">the Weeknd</a>\u2019s Blinding Lights provided a one-week break in nearly four otherwise continuous months of No 1 singles by black or Arab French rappers: Gradur, Gambi, Naps and Ninho. This is against the backdrop of Le Pen, whose newly named National Rally defeated Macron\u2019s La R\u00e9publique En Marche <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/may/27/eu-vote-confirms-french-far-right-marine-le-pen-national-rally-as-emmanuel-macron-main-opposition\">to win France\u2019s European </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/may/27/eu-vote-confirms-french-far-right-marine-le-pen-national-rally-as-emmanuel-macron-main-opposition\">elections in 2019</a>, preparing to challenge the incumbent president once again in 2022.</p> <p>French rap was once on the periphery of acceptable taste, loudly reporting on the cracks in France\u2019s supposed universalism. The attempts to quell it show how powerful it has now become, with its successful black and Arab rappers challenging the very idea of what it is to be French. As the anonymous A&amp;R director asserts: \u201cA genre that has been established in a country for more than 30 years cannot be qualified as a phenomenon. Today, rap is as much a part of France\u2019s culture as its cuisine, wine or bad faith.\u201d</p>",

About one in three Americans are concerned about paying their bills and affording basic necessities over next month, but that number includes 48% of Hispanics and 39% of blacks, in comparison to 23% of whites.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-21T13:06:29.416Z\">at 2.06pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e9edf8d8f08cd080212f82a\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/amanda-holpuch\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-21T12:40:55.504Z\">1.40pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Mayor: Georgia reopening decision 'reckless, premature and dangerous'</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>A Georgia mayor has criticized the governor\u2019s decision to re-open the state this week as \u201c<strong>reckless, premature and dangerous</strong>\u201d.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"071949b40ae8f0d6b3c5c0f64b4d5d2cfe26aa4a\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/071949b40ae8f0d6b3c5c0f64b4d5d2cfe26aa4a/543_0_2133_2667/800.jpg\" alt=\"Brian Kemp.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Brian Kemp.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ron Harris/AP</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n  <p>Governor <strong>Brian Kemp</strong>, a Republican, said businesses including bowling alleys, tattoo studios and hair salons would reopen this week. </p> \n  <p>The Democratic mayor of Savannah, <strong>Van Johnson</strong>, said Kemp\u2019s decision was \u201cnot based in any type of science or best practices\u201d.</p> \n  <p>\u201cPeople can see it for themselves.

  "<p>On the day of Donald Trump\u2019s election, economists predicted calamity.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/26/us-unemployment-rate-coronavirus-business\">Record 3.3m Americans file for unemployment as the US tries to contain Covid-19</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cWe are very probably looking at a global recession, with no end in sight,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/projects/cp/opinion/election-night-2016/paul-krugman-the-economic-fallout\">wrote Paul Krugman,</a> a columnist at the New York Times.</p> <p>The US president and his allies have spent the past three years crowing, mocking Krugman as a prophet of doom. What no one could have predicted is that when the doomsday prophecy came true, it would be the result of a lightning bolt not of Trump\u2019s own making.</p> <p>The scale of the economic devastation wrought by the coronavirus pandemic became clear on Thursday when it emerged that 3.3 million people filed for unemployment insurance last week. It was almost five times the previous record, set in 1982, and by some estimates the jobless figure could reach 12m to 15m before the storm has passed.</p> <p>Suddenly the political landscape has changed. A presidential election and races in the Senate and House are set to take place with an economy undergoing both the biggest contraction and the worst surge in unemployment ever seen. In Washington, a city of heroic statues and soaring monuments, the most relevant now is <a href=\"https://www.loc.gov/pictures/item/2011633289/\">the Franklin Delano Roosevelt Memorial</a>, with its bronze figures huddled in a Great Depression breadline.</p> <p>In the race for the White House, there are some key questions. Will Trump be blamed, justifiably or otherwise, for millions losing their jobs? Or will voters embrace his claim to be a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/22/trump-coronavirus-election-november-2020\">\u201cwartime president\u201d</a> and conclude this is no time to change? Can his likely opponent, Joe Biden, capitalise on his own strengths as a voice of competence and experience, to present himself as the moral leader the nation needs?</p> <p>For Trump, this is personal. As a billionaire businessman, he predicated his entire political identity on his ability to steward the economy by slashing regulations, shredding trade deals and reviving manufacturing towns.</p> <p>For three years he bragged \u201cJOBS JOBS JOBS!\u201d and never missed a chance to tout unemployment figures for the population at large \u2013 just last month, the rate was at a 50-year low of 3.5% \u2013 and African Americans and Latinos in particular. The true picture was more complicated and unevenly distributed, but the central message was: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/nov/16/harold-macmillan-never-had-it-so-good\">you\u2019ve never had it so good.</a></p> <p>Trump\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/24/opinion/coronavirus-trump-economy.html\">other vital sign of virility,</a> the stock market, has been smashed too, nearly all the gains of his presidency wiped out. It was this more than anything, perhaps, that belatedly persuaded him the virus could not simply be wished away.</p> <p>It is therefore no surprise the president is itching to get the economy fired up again. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/24/trumps-push-to-shorten-the-coronavirus-shutdown-proves-the-captain-is-flying-blind\">His push for an Easter Sunday</a> deadline may be ethically callous and scientifically ignorant but politically shrewd. It meant that as the apocalyptic jobless figures hit, he could present himself as already working to get it fixed.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"6155bf59346bec155a4c582ee3051f72130eaf4e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6155bf59346bec155a4c582ee3051f72130eaf4e/0_17_5000_3000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Brookline Avenue outside the closed Fenway Park is empty in Boston on Thursday on what was to be opening day in Major League Baseball.

The message, doubtless amplified by Fox News, will be: \u201cLook, I tried, but my hands were tied.\u201d</p> <p>Trump is about to sign Congress\u2019s $2.2tn aid package designed to prevent complete economic collapse. His treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, did most of the hard work but the president gets to claim the credit. For Democrats, like all opposition parties in wartime, there is a difficult balance in holding Trump accountable while not appearing to undermine national unity. They also have to work with Republicans to keep the money flowing until there is light at end of the tunnel.</p> <p>Henry Olsen, a senior fellow at the Ethics and Public Policy Center thinktank, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/03/25/were-not-killing-economy-over-coronavirus-were-putting-it-into-coma/\">wrote in the Washington Post</a>: \u201cWe should know by June if this approach works.</p> <p>\u201cIf it does, the number of Covid-19 infections will have plummeted, deaths from the virus will have flatlined, and people will be coming back to work in droves. It could be the biggest V-shaped economic recovery in US history \u2013 the political-economy version of the resuscitation of a patient after an induced coma.\u201d</p> <p>Olsen added: \u201cIt\u2019s too early to predict what the political fallout from a successful pirouette would be, but it\u2019s hard to see how it doesn\u2019t at least insulate President Trump from much criticism about the virus\u2019s arrival to begin with. Democrats can say he should have done more, but the fact remains that no other western leader did better to anticipate the onset of the coronavirus.</p> <p>\u201cTrump\u2019s critics are not going to change their stripes, but the few people who remain open to persuasion are as likely to credit Trump as to blame him.\u201d</p> <p>This is the best-case scenario for the president: presenting himself, however spuriously, as the man who led America through its greatest crisis since the second world war, early missteps long forgotten. Biden, meanwhile, is struggling to break through the cacophony and to master the internet, his thunder stolen by New York\u2019s Democratic governor, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/23/cuomo-wins-praise-for-wisdom-amid-coronavirus-crisis-as-trump-blusters\">Andrew Cuomo.</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/experts/william-a-galston/\">Bill Galston,</a> a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution thinktank in Washington and former policy adviser to Bill Clinton, said: \u201cMost people believe this kind of crisis plays to Biden\u2019s strengths. Against that, with the people involved in his campaign, he\u2019s not been very effective at showing that strength.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/26/us-coronavirus-stimulus-all-you-need-to-know\">US coronavirus stimulus checks: are you eligible and how much will you get?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThey\u2019re not very innovative. They don\u2019t seem to have a strategy to keep him in the conversation. They seem a little flummoxed by the technology of the situation.\u201d</p> <p>The worst-case scenario for Trump looks very different. If the death toll keeps climbing, big and small businesses are ruined and the economy sinks into 1930s-style wreckage, his early denialism will be played endlessly in election attack ads. His mendacious press briefings will be taken as proof that he could not rise to the challenge and Democrats will be more energised than ever to dispatch him.</p> <p>So far, polls suggest Trump is getting a bump like George W Bush after the 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks. A Gallup survey published on Tuesday showed 60% of Americans gave him positive reviews for his handling of the coronavirus outbreak, and his overall approval rating matched the highest point in his presidency, at 49%, included rises among independents and even Democrats.</p> <p>But this was taken before he reversed his reversal and went back to downplaying the virus, and before the unemployment figures delivered an almighty gut punch.</p> <p>There is a long way to go. It is hard to believe that Trump\u2019s impeachment trial ended only last month. In those terms, the November election is still a lifetime away.</p>",

Trump\u2019s campaign has spent about $1.34m on 18,982 ads that were shown to Facebook users at least 58m times since 1 March, a Guardian analysis of the Facebook political ad archive found.</p> <p>The Trump campaign\u2019s silence on coronavirus on Facebook stands in contrast to Trump\u2019s real-life behavior. The president has been tweeting non-stop about the topic for weeks, and has recently taken to holding daily, marathon press briefings to discuss the pandemic and the administration\u2019s response.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"3b07d23a9fc056d921b5fc964e04efc857eec267\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3b07d23a9fc056d921b5fc964e04efc857eec267/0_53_432_604/358.jpg\" alt=\"A Trump campaign ad from March 2020.\" width=\"358\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A Trump campaign ad from March 2020.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Facebook</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Building a wall on the US-Mexico border was the most common political issue mentioned in those ads, followed by attacks on Democratic party leaders and presidential candidates, as well as the news media.</p> <p>\u201cThey want open borders; they want crime,\u201d Trump says of Democrats in a video clip accompanying a typical immigration-themed ad. On 13 March \u2013 the same day that the global death toll passed 5,000 and Trump declared a national emergency \u2013 the campaign launched a tranche of advertisements declaring \u201cThe Do-Nothing Democrats\u2019 open border\u2019s agency is morally reprehensible\u201d and stating, \u201cI must put the safety of Americans above everything else\u201d.</p> <p>However, the majority ( 75%) of the 58m ad impressions received by Trump campaign ads since 1 March went to ads that made no mention of any political issue, beyond support for Trump. These include include an offer for a \u201c2020 Trump Gold Card Membership\u201d for a $35 campaign donation; contests to win a signed hat or meal with Melania Trump; and various Trump campaign products, such as \u201cOfficial Space Force\u201d merchandise, the \u201cOFFICIAL Trump Pence Keep America Great Dog Collar\u201d, St Patrick\u2019s Day-themed merchandise and plastic straws.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6adf769c5ff4e73c9eee74e62f61a02a0aa22f17\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6adf769c5ff4e73c9eee74e62f61a02a0aa22f17/0_0_419_731/287.jpg\" alt=\"Trump campaign ads featuring \u2018Black Voices for Trump\u2019.\" width=\"287\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Trump campaign ads featuring \u2018Black Voices for Trump\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Facebook</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The campaign also ran ads designed to appeal to two constituency groups: African Americans and Indian Americans.</p> <p>A series of \u201cBlack Voices for Trump\u201d campaign ads began running on 11 March.

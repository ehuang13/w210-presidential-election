  "<p>The coronavirus outbreak threatens to upend the organisation of the US presidential election and strike a blow to Donald Trump because of his reliance on big campaign rallies.</p> <p>Democratic rivals Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders both cancelled rallies in Cleveland, Ohio, on Tuesday, citing recommendations from public health officials to avoid assembling large indoor crowds. Sunday\u2019s televised debate between the men in Phoenix, Arizona, will take place without a studio audience or media \u201cspin room\u201d.</p> <p>That did not stop the Trump campaign announcing a \u201cCatholics for Trump\u201d coalition launch in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, on Thursday next week, where the president is expected to address thousands of supporters as if it were business as usual.</p> <p>\u201cWhile public health experts caution us against large gatherings, the commander-in-chief schedules a rally,\u201d <a href=\"https://twitter.com/davidaxelrod/status/1237606334410788866?s=20\">tweeted David Axelrod,</a> former chief strategist for Barack Obama. \u201cWhat message does that send?\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/10/coronavirus-concerns-hurdle-voters-primary-elections\">Election officials rush to make changes to address coronavirus concerns</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But as coronavirus worsens, with more than 1,000 cases now reported in the US, Trump could face overwhelming pressure to scale down or scrap his regular rallies, a move that is likely to hurt him more than Biden, his probable opponent in the November election.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/nov/01/trump-rallies-america-midterms-white-house\">Rallies are the lifeblood</a> of Trump\u2019s political identity. He held them in crucial places that rival Hillary Clinton failed to visit in 2016. He has staged <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_post-election_Donald_Trump_rallies\">nearly a hundred of them</a> since becoming president. He appears more at ease firing up a raucous crowd than in the staid formality of Washington.</p> <p>No less importantly, the rallies have become an integral part of Trump campaign\u2019s data gathering operation. The Politico website <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/08/trump-2020-campaign-hidden-voters-123382\">noted this week:</a> \u201cNearly 31,000 people signed up to attend Donald Trump\u2019s recent campaign rally in North Charleston, South Carolina. It didn\u2019t matter that less than half of them showed up.</p> <p>\u201cThe Trump campaign kept every one of their names and plans to spend the next eight months urging them to help the president\u2019s re-election efforts \u2013 knocking on doors, donating a few dollars, attending a meetup and, most importantly, voting on election day.\u201d</p> <p>In total, Politico added, the Trump campaign has identified more than 1.4 million potential voters from their events since inauguration day 2017, including about 126,000 who did not vote in the last four elections.</p> <p>Cancelling rallies could therefore cut off this crucial data supply. Among those who fear the political consequences is the rightwing radio talkshow host Rush Limbaugh, who this week <a href=\"https://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2020/03/09/democrats-want-to-shut-down-trump-rallies/\">pushed a conspiracy theory</a> that Democrats want to stop the rallies because some of their own members have been attending them.</p> <p>\u201cThis is why they want these rallies stopped,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is why \u2013 it\u2019s not because of public safety, not because of public health. These people \u2013 because as you point out, they\u2019re not making an effort to shut down every other opportunity for people to congregate.\u201d</p> <p>He added: \u201cIt makes perfect sense from their standpoint. If you can\u2019t beat Trump and if you want to stop the appearance of excitement about the Trump campaign, then stop the rallies. And if you\u2019re really worried that so many people attending rallies are actually Democrats, then you\u2019ve really gotta shut \u2019em down.\u201d</p> <p>The 2020 presidential election has already been buffeted by unexpected events. Senators who had planned to campaign in Iowa and New Hampshire found themselves spending the day at Trump\u2019s impeachment trial. But the coronavirus promises disruption on a grander scale for campaigns and voters.</p> <p>The MSNBC network host Chris Hayes said on Tuesday: \u201cYou think people are going to be going to the polls in Georgia in two weeks? In big public gatherings? That\u2019s an open question right now.\u201d Fellow presenter Nicolle Wallace wondered: \u201cWill there be conventions? Will there be debates? What will voting look like? Everything is up in the air.\u201d</p> <p>The \u201cCatholics for Trump\u201d event appears to be a test of whether the public will accept campaign events. Asked at a White House briefing on Tuesday whether the Trump campaign would continue to hold rallies, Vice-President Mike Pence said: \u201cThat\u2019ll be a decision that\u2019s made literally on a day-to-day basis.\u201d</p> <p>Biden\u2019s campaign, meanwhile, cancelled a get-out-the-vote event planned for Thursday in Florida, which will hold primary contests next week along with Arizona, Illinois and Ohio. The former vice-president plans instead to deliver an address in his hometown of Wilmington, Delaware, on Thursday regarding the US coronavirus response.</p> <p>This could give him an opportunity to appear presidential while, critics say, Trump flounders. Rallies and other public events, meanwhile, are not seen as Biden\u2019s strongpoint, so cancelling those may shield him from scrutiny and the risk of making gaffes.</p> <p>But analysts in Washington played down the significance of rallies to final election outcome. Elaine Kamarck, a senior fellow in the governance studies programme at the Brookings Institution thinktank, said: \u201cI just don\u2019t think this will matter one way or another. It\u2019s true believers that go to Trump rallies and they\u2019re not going to desert him.</p> <p>\u201cWe are talking about an electorate of 100 million or more. Whether you have 5,000 or 10,000 people at a rally makes no difference. There are probably 10 people in the United States who don\u2019t know what they think of Trump and they\u2019re so out of it they might not even bother to vote.\u201d</p> <p>John Zogby, a Democratic pollster, acknowledged: \u201cThe campaign rallies have been very important to him and he always scheduled them strategically. They give him a boost. He\u2019s a showman and this is Trump at his best.\u201d</p> <p>But he added: \u201cHe has other effective ways of communicating and he will use them. His support base will move along with these changes. The campaign are very sophisticated in their use of data and being able to adjust.\u201d</p>",

A number of passengers on Mello\u2019s Turkish Airlines flight left with him, waiting by the airline\u2019s counter for their luggage, some on hold with customer service. <br></p> <p>\u201cThere are just so many differentials that can happen,\u201d he said. \u201cI think there is one case (of coronavirus) in Turkey, but imagine in five days they find 400 people and then they say you have to stay 14 days in quarantine. It just wouldn\u2019t be great to go for five days and then end up stuck for 30 days.\u201d<br></p> <p>Reggie Chand, 34, and Esther Goundar, 32, were flying through Istanbul to Athens for a two-week trip to celebrate their fifth wedding anniversary. <br></p> <p>\u201cWe got checked in, we got our boarding tickets from here to Turkey, from Turkey to Athens,\u201d Goundar said. \u201cWe\u2019re waiting in the lounge area and then I got a text message from my friend: \u2018Hey, are you going to get stuck in Europe?\u2019\u201d <br></p> <p>Chand and Goundar are American citizens. They did not know when they canceled the trip they had been planning since October that the ban did not apply to them, but looking back, they still think they made the right decision. \u201cIt\u2019s too much risk,\u201d Goundar said. \u201cEven if the vacation goes well, and we come back, either way you stay two weeks on vacation and then stay isolated for two weeks. It\u2019s too much.\u201d<br></p> <p>The couple felt a mixture of disappointment and anger over the whole ordeal -- Chand had been on hold with Turkish Airlines for more than an hour, looking to get a refund for their tickets. <br></p> <p>\u201cI am kind of mad,\u201d Chand said. \u201cHe could have said, OK you have two days or three days, or I\u2019m going to talk to airlines so you can have something planned so nobody is stuck in Europe. What if we had gone and we were now stuck there?\u201d<br></p> <p>\u201cThat would have pissed me off,\u201d Goundar said. \u201cIf we were already on the flight and we were told you cannot go home for the next 29 days, we would not have enjoyed our vacation.\u201d<br></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e69af688f08c2df6d277ffe\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-12T03:44:13.733Z\">3.44am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>The president apparently misstated a number of things</strong> during his televised address.

As a result, the campaign is arguing that it\u2019s \u201cnearly impossible\u201d for Vermont senator Bernie Sanders to catch up to Biden\u2019s delegate lead. </p> <p>That\u2019s according to an internal campaign memo obtained by The Guardian. The memo comes a day after Biden trounced Sanders in the latest round of Democratic primary contests on Tuesday. </p> <p>\u201cVotes are still being counted, but it appears that we will net somewhere around 70-80 delegates from March 10 contests alone,\u201d the memo reads. \u201cFor context, on a day we expected would be the toughest day for us in the March calendar, we netted approximately the same number of delegates that we netted on Super Tuesday. This brings our total projected delegate lead to approximately 160.\u201d</p> <p>Sanders\u2019 path forward is precarious. He trails Biden by over 150 delegates. Biden beat Sanders in Michigan on Tuesday, the most delegate-rich state of the six and one that Sanders surprisingly won in 2016. Sanders in a press conference on Wednesday said he planned to still stay in the race but conceded the path is difficult for him. In a fundraising email to supporters, Sanders said: \u201cwe are winning \u2014 very clearly \u2014 the ideological debate, we are losing, right now, the electability debate.\u201d</p> <p>According to the memo, the Biden campaign sees the next few states as advantageous for the former vice president. \u201cThe states that vote next - Arizona, Florida, Illinois, Ohio, and Georgia - have been some of our strongest, and we expect to significantly expand our delegate lead in those highly-supportive, delegate-rich states. Of 682 delegates awarded in those states, conservative estimates have us winning more than 400 delegates and netting more than 150 delegates.\u201d</p> <p>The memo concludes: \u201cShould our broad base of support remain - and we have seen no signs that would indicate otherwise - it will be nearly impossible for Sanders to recoup his current delegate disadvantage.\u201d</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e69714b8f08c2df6d277e76\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-11T23:19:58.485Z\">11.19pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>It\u2019s unclear what, exactly, Donald Trump will say when he addresses the coronavirus threat tonight.

Getting Donald Trump out of office, which is why, I suspect, primary voters went for what they see as the safe choice instead of the candidate promising free healthcare, free college, free puppies and pizza every Friday (and who\u2019s going to pay for it? Billionaires!). That, or young people were too busy making TikToks to show up.</p> <p>What I\u2019m curious about is what comes next: will the legions of young people who knocked on doors and memed their hearts out for Sanders become so disillusioned by the Democratic party that they sit out the general election, write in Bernie Sanders, lodge a protest vote for Trump or leave the party altogether?

Bernie Sanders has staked his electability on his alleged unique ability to win swing states like Michigan, the so-called \u201crust belt\u201d states that had fallen to Donald Trump in 2016. In fact, some of the most questionable decisions of his 2020 campaign \u2013 doing a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/apr/16/bernie-sanders-draws-enthusiastic-cheers-in-surprising-fox-news-town-hall\">Fox News Town Hall</a> and touting a <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/meet-the-press/blog/meet-press-blog-latest-news-analysis-data-driving-political-discussion-n988541/ncrd1123066#blogHeader\">controversial endorsement</a> by Joe Rogan \u2013 were based on the rationale that Sanders alone could win back white working-class voters who had abandoned the Democratic party for Trump.</p> <p>Despite trailing in the polls by <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/amp/ncna1153246\">25%</a>, he had eked out a narrow but significant win over Hillary Clinton in the 2016 primaries. Sanders supporters hoped this would play out again on Tuesday night, but it was not to be. His <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/10/democratic-primaries-joe-biden-bernie-sanders\">loss to Joe Biden</a> might not shake the belief of Sanders and his supporters that he, and he alone, can defeat Trump in November, but it most likely does end his chance at winning the Democratic nomination.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7876bf7b6e72be13cbb23e887757d43718991067\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7876bf7b6e72be13cbb23e887757d43718991067/0_232_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bernie Sanders takes part in a FOX News Town Hall with co-moderators Bret Baier and Martha MacCallum in Detroit, Michigan, U.S., March 9, 2020.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bernie Sanders takes part in a FOX News Town Hall with co-moderators Bret Baier and Martha MacCallum in Detroit, Michigan, U.S., March 9, 2020.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lucas Jackson/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This should not really have come as a surprise. Despite all the hype after the first three primaries, in wildly unrepresentative and largely irrelevant states, Sanders was winning by pluralities between one-quarter and one-third of the vote. In several cases his support was only half that of 2016, suggesting his surprise success last time was as much anti-Clinton protest as pro-Sanders support. Even when the field started to thin, Sanders only won a majority in his home state of Vermont, and only barely so.</p> <p>While Super Tuesday was brutal for the large size of the Biden wins, the modest Sanders wins were equally telling. Despite massive campaigning efforts in terms of both money and personnel and very favorable poll numbers for weeks, Sanders won just 34% of the vote in California. Biden, who had barely campaigned in the Golden State, came second with 27%, just seven points behind.</p> <p>Read the full piece:</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/10/why-bernie-sanders-lost-michigan\">Why Bernie Sanders lost Michigan \u2013 and what it means for his campaign | Cas Mudde</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e68ea8c8f087df56e4c6778\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-11T13:47:53.821Z\">1.47pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a6418fc535385d4f9d1cb31c6c5b6f3305ca286e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a6418fc535385d4f9d1cb31c6c5b6f3305ca286e/0_133_4000_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Supporters of Democratic presidential candidate former Vice President Joe Biden attend a campaign rally at Renaissance High School in Detroit, Michigan.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Supporters of Democratic presidential candidate former Vice President Joe Biden attend a campaign rally at Renaissance High School in Detroit, Michigan.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jeff Kowalsky/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9cc3c850ab6376882e40f5411cc896ddc4e1a21d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9cc3c850ab6376882e40f5411cc896ddc4e1a21d/0_0_4377_2626/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Huntington Center is seen empty after Democratic presidential candidate Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders cancels his rally planned in Cleveland, Ohio.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Huntington Center is seen empty after Democratic presidential candidate Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders cancels his rally planned in Cleveland, Ohio.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Megan Jelinger/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e5fcb6c5d18cb1f45ad6032a3e6e449bd1dbb053\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e5fcb6c5d18cb1f45ad6032a3e6e449bd1dbb053/0_280_5568_3341/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Democratic presidential hopeful former Vice President Joe Biden speaks, flanked by his wife Jill Biden, at the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Democratic presidential hopeful former Vice President Joe Biden speaks, flanked by his wife Jill Biden, at the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mandel Ngan/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ae97aced02c4960ba40596cf511002a6e4e1f4a6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ae97aced02c4960ba40596cf511002a6e4e1f4a6/0_195_5845_3507/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Volunteers take down a rally stage for Democratic presidential candidate former Vice President Joe Biden in Cleveland, Ohio.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Volunteers take down a rally stage for Democratic presidential candidate former Vice President Joe Biden in Cleveland, Ohio.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Megan Jelinger/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e68e8668f087df56e4c6764\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/tom-perkins\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-11T13:36:17.574Z\">1.36pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">'Hard to comprehend\u2019: Sanders\u2019 loss in Michigan crushes staff and supporters</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>In the days leading up to a must-win Tuesday Michigan primary, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/bernie-sanders\">Bernie Sanders</a> criss-crossed the state, firing up thousands of supporters and taking the stage with star surrogates in a bid to repeat his momentum-shifting 2016 upset of Hillary Clinton.</p> <p>As the polls closed, it seemed to some that a surprise win might not be out of the question.

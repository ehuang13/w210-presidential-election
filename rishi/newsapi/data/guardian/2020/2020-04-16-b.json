There should be a more consultative mechanisms where states sit together. There needs to be cooperation. There should be a blueprint for working together.

All countries in the region are affected and under lockdowns of varying degrees, with international travel suspended and movement increasingly prohibited. <strong>Ivory Coast</strong> has the highest number of confirmed cases at 654. </p> \n  <p>Yet, across west Africa testing is very limited, with <strong>Ghana</strong> testing about 35,000 people so far and Nigeria only about 5,000. In Lagos, authorities have just begun the first community testing to determine the spread in the wider population, as so far tests have only been conducted on people who have recently travelled into the country or who have alerted authorities to their condition. </p> \n  <p><strong>Nigeria</strong>\u2019s government is racing to strengthen a chronically underfunded health system, with only a few hundred ICUs and ventilators for its 200 million people, according to medical unions. Nigeria spends 4% of GDP on health, which is among the lowest levels in percentage terms in Africa. <br><br>Nigeria already has an oxygen crisis, with 625,000 people dying each year due to hospitals not having enough oxygen provision. In recent weeks, strikes by doctors have further highlighted the difficulties in health services, amid complaints of unpaid salaries and poor working conditions.<br><br>The number of laboratories testing for Covid-19 are being quickly expanded and health centres built with help from the private sector. But there remain fears that even a moderate outbreak could overwhelm the system unless much more is done. </p> \n  <p>The financial toll of the lockdowns on the poor in west Africa is already becoming clear, with videos across social media of citizens pleading for food supplies and money. Lockdowns have been widespread but help is incredibly limited. <strong>Ghana</strong> has been among the more proactive countries, yet most are struggling to provide adequate supplies to more than a fraction of the people affected. <br><br>In <strong>Senegal</strong>, there are fears that more than 100,000 street children, known locally as Talib\u00e9s, who beg on the streets are at a greater risk of contracting the coronavirus. Many are homeless or living in squalid, congested Islamic boarding schools. Senegalese authorities say they are trying to help by providing education centres for 1,500 children. <br><br></p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-16T10:20:20.160Z\">at 11.20am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e982a158f08cf571cdb2071\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-16T09:53:31.483Z\">10.53am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Europe still in the midst of the Covid-19 storm, World Health Organization warns</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/apr/16/coronavirus-live-news-cases-worldwide-top-2-million-trump-doubts-china-death-toll?page=with:block-5e9823398f08ea7431f43ce7#block-5e9823398f08ea7431f43ce7\">More from the World Health Organization press briefing</a>, as the body\u2019s European regional director warns that the continent is still in the midst of the storm of the Covid-19 pandemic, with the number of cases nearing a million.</p> \n  <p>\u201cAs of today, Europe remains very much at the centre of the pandemic.

  "<p>March was supposed to be a big month for James Hayes.</p> <p>He and other organizers with <a href=\"https://www.ohioansforraisingthewage.org/\">Ohioans for Raising the Wage</a> have been campaigning to gradually raise the state\u2019s minimum wage \u2013 currently $8.70 an hour \u2013 to $13. The organizers planned to be stationed at the polls throughout the state during the primary election to get voters , already in a civic mindset, to sign petitions to help them get the measure on the ballot. They need to gather <a href=\"https://www.ohioattorneygeneral.gov/Legal/Ballot-Initiatives/Initiative-and-Referendum-Signature-Requirements\">442,958</a> signatures by 1 July to make that happen.</p> <p>But the Covid-19 pandemic waylaid the campaign. Ohio essentially canceled in-person voting for its primary, now at the end of April. Organizers have stopped collecting signatures to comply with state orders to avoid public contact \u2013 a strategy that these campaigns traditionally heavily rely on.</p> <p>\u201cEvery day we lose \u2026 the amount of volunteer hours and the resources goes up as well. It\u2019s really difficult,\u201d Hayes said. \u201cIt\u2019s heart-wrenching.\u201d Hayes and his group <a href=\"https://aboutblaw.com/PU7\">filed a lawsuit</a> in state court seeking to extend the deadline for collecting signatures.</p> <p>Ballot measures are a critical way of allowing activists to bypass partisan legislatures and allow voters to directly enact policies, something currently allowed in<a href=\"https://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/chart-of-the-initiative-states.aspx\"> some form in more than two dozen states</a>. They can be extremely expensive and take considerable organizing work to succeed.</p> <p>In recent years these efforts have been used to achieve sweeping expansions of democracy in the country, including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/nov/09/florida-amendment-4-felons-voting-rights-response-activists\">repealing</a> Florida\u2019s lifetime ban on felon voting, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/a/midterms-2018/ballot-initiatives\">expanding Medicaid</a>, and creating an independent redistricting commission in Michigan. The initiatives have been so successful that Republicans in several states have <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/15/us/referendum-initiative-legislature-dakota.html\">tried</a> to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jan/16/florida-amendment-4-ruling-voting-rights\">gut</a> them or<a href=\"https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2018/12/after-voters-passed-progressive-ballot-initiatives-gop-legislatures-are-trying-to-kill-future-ones/\"> make it harder to get referendums </a>on the ballot.</p> <p>Now, those efforts could be in peril as organizers face fast-approaching deadlines to gather tens of thousands, in many cases hundreds of thousands, of signatures. If social isolation measures persist, and lawmakers don\u2019t ease restrictions, these measures won\u2019t be on the ballot in November, leaving voters without a chance to vote on crucial reforms like expanding voting, LGBTQ rights and limiting gerrymandering.</p> <p>Though state lawmakers are scrambling to find alternatives for people to vote in upcoming elections, there has been no parallel effort to make it easier for organizers to get measures on the ballot for November.</p> <p>While organizers in Ohio could try again next year, that\u2019s not an option for Andy Moore, the director of People Not Politicians, who is based in Oklahoma. After the governor declared a state of emergency there, the secretary of state <a href=\"https://www.examiner-enterprise.com/news/20200331/state-questions-unlikely-to-make-oklahoma-ballot\">paused</a> all signature collection efforts.</p> <p>People Not Politicians needs <a href=\"https://ballotpedia.org/Signature_requirements_for_ballot_measures_in_Oklahoma\">177,958</a> signatures to put a constitutional amendment on the ballot that would strip Oklahoma lawmakers of their ability to draw electoral districts and instead give it to an independent commission evenly divided between Democrats, Republicans and Independents. Because redistricting takes place once every 10 years, and the next round is early next year, this is the last chance to reform the process for the next decade.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a free pass to politicians to gerrymander yet again,\u201d said Moore, whose group is still awaiting final approval to collect signatures. Once the measure is approved, they will have 90 days to collect the signatures. The effort has already had to cancel house parties and a planned 5K run in the shape of a gerrymandered district.</p> <p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have the luxury of waiting until next year,\u201d said George Shelton, who is leading a similar anti-gerrymandering effort in Arkansas. Unable to work towards the<a href=\"https://ballotpedia.org/Signature_requirements_for_ballot_measures_in_Arkansas\"> 89,151 </a>signatures they need to make the ballot, organizers are educating people online about what they can do to fix gerrymandering. Shelton and organizers have until 3 July.</p> <p>Organizers are considering different options to combat this epic hurdle. They\u2019re looking for new ways to get people to sign petitions, and posing legal challenges seeking to force state officials to extend the deadline or lower the number of signatures they need to get, said Chris Melody Fields Figueredo, the executive director of the Ballot Initiative Strategy Center, a group that works on progressive ballot initiatives.</p> <p>Moore also said officials should allow activists to gather signatures online. But that\u2019s currently not allowed in any state, said Amanda Zoch, who works on elections at the National Conference of State Legislatures. States have long required in-person, handwritten signatures for ballot signatures and tightly regulate who can collect them.</p> <p>A handful of efforts to allow voters to submit electronic signatures for referendums <a href=\"https://ballotpedia.org/Electronic_petition_signature\">failed</a> in recent years. In California, one of the referendums stalled by Covid-19<a href=\"https://ballotpedia.org/California_Electronic_Signatures_for_Initiative,_Referendum,_and_Recall_Initiative_(2020)\"> is an effort to create</a> a law to allow organizers to collect signatures for future referendums electronically.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a killer. We\u2019re done,\u201d said Michael Liddell, who organized the effort. \u201cThere\u2019s no point in even turning anything in. We\u2019re not going to make it.\u201d Some activists, he said, are requesting that California officials grant referendum organizers an extension to turn in signatures and let them collect signatures online.</p> <p>In Arizona, candidates can gather signatures online to qualify for the ballot, but organizers must still collect signatures in person to make a referendum appear on it. Activists <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=az+central&amp;oq=az+central&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j0l4j69i60l3.1236j0j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8\">filed lawsuits</a> in both state and federal court in recent weeks to be allowed to collect signatures online. Republicans in the state are opposing that request, <a href=\"https://tucson.com/news/state-and-regional/arizona-gop-urges-judge-to-reject-online-signatures-for-ballot-measures/article_8edf5b1d-b193-5b42-9708-ff13961b1b02.html\">citing the potential for fraud</a>.</p> <p>Some organizations are still forging ahead amid the Covid-19 outbreak.

Utah\u2019s Governor Gary Herbert, a Republican, <a href=\"https://www.deseret.com/utah/2020/4/2/21203003/olympia-hills-referendum-approved-salt-lake-county-council-governor-gary-herbert-executive-order\">issued</a> an executive order allowing organizers to distribute petitions electronically, but is still requiring Utah voters to sign them by hand and mail them in.</p> <p>But those efforts may be not be enough. Gathering enough signatures to get a measure on the ballot, even when there isn\u2019t a pandemic, requires herculean levels of organizing and funding. Moore said he gave up a full-time job at the University of Oklahoma running its infectious disease clinic (the irony is not lost on him, he said) to do this work.</p> <p>\u201cAt this point, with this epidemic, I don\u2019t think anybody really knows what\u2019s going to happen,\u201d he said.</p>",
  "<p>With compelling symmetry, four days after Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/04/keir-starmer-wins-labour-leadership-election\">tenure as Labour leader ended</a>, Bernie Sanders suspended his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/08/bernie-sanders-ends-2020-presidential-race\">presidential campaign</a>. The insurgencies they led first gathered pace in a political galaxy far, far away, back in 2015, before the era of Brexit or Trump. Both were implausible figureheads: little known outside left milieus, used to addressing sparsely attended meetings on rainy Thursday nights rather than mass rallies, men of a certain age who were largely rejected by their own generations leading movements disproportionately powered by those born after they had reached adulthood. And now their often <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/corbynism-croaks-and-labour-sees-the-light-dcpwm2rs0\">bitter critics</a> \u2013 whether on the right or centre \u2013 celebrate their defeats as something more profound: as a rout of the ideas and political vision they had come to represent.</p> <p>They are likely to be disappointed. Yes, the British and US new left have failed to achieve lasting political leadership in their own parties, let alone assume state power; their activists are currently demoralised and exhausted. Both found a mass reception for their ideas after the left had spent a generation in the wilderness, meaning they lacked personnel with political experience, all while being undermined by entrenched hostility from their own parties. But on neither side of the Atlantic is the left going anywhere.</p> <p>Their opponents saw the Corbyn and Sanders phenomena as mass irrationality and delusion, as flight from reality and<strong> </strong>an indulgence of impossible dreams. In truth, both emerged because of material conditions for millions of people that , far from improving, are about to plumb new depths. There was a reason why Sanders enjoyed the overwhelming support of <a href=\"https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2020/02/this-one-chart-explains-why-young-voters-back-bernie-sanders.html\">Democrats under 35</a>, or why more <a href=\"https://yougov.co.uk/topics/politics/articles-reports/2017/06/13/how-britain-voted-2017-general-election\">voters under 40 opted for Labour in 2017</a> than polling has ever recorded. This isn\u2019t a story of the supposed naive idealism of youth, slowly eroded by the experience of adulthood. If this cliche were true, then several polls in the 1980s wouldn\u2019t have suggested Ronald Reagan was <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1984/10/16/us/younger-voters-tending-to-give-reagan-support.html\">most popular among the young</a>, while Margaret Thatcher would not have <a href=\"https://www.ipsos.com/ipsos-mori/en-uk/how-britain-voted-october-1974\">won the youth vote</a> so decisively in 1983.</p> <p>The answer is straightforward. The free-market revolution promised to liberate the individual from the supposedly oppressive confines of the state and collectivism, to allow them to achieve their full potential unhindered. Instead, that \u201cfreedom\u201d was experienced as insecurity, which was only heightened by the aftermath of the financial crash. While nearly half of American baby boomers were homeowners by the age of 30, only just over a third of millennials have <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/25/the-homeownership-rate-is-falling-among-millennials-heres-why.html\">acquired a home</a> by the time they hit their thirties. The number of middle-income young adults in Britain who own a home has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2018/feb/16/homeownership-among-young-adults-collapsed-institute-fiscal-studies\">halved in two decades</a>, while getting a council house \u2013 stocks of which have been drastically depleted during the same period \u2013 isn\u2019t an option, and the privately rented sector <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/nov/20/housebuilding-data-shows-dearth-of-homes-for-affordable-renting\">devours their pay packets</a>.</p> <p>Those who went to university are clobbered with student debt, and even then an often low-paid, insecure job beckons. In no high-income country other than Greece have the under-30s suffered such a fall in income <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/363af3be-1236-11e8-940e-08320fc2a277\">as in Britain</a>. From cuts to social security to the shredding of youth services, so much that gave people a sense of security and the sense that things will get better has been stripped away. It is this that drove the Sanders movement, Corbynism, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/mar/31/podemos-revolution-radical-academics-changed-european-politics\">Podemos in Spain</a>; and although all failed to convince enough of the older generation, proving a fatal roadblock to victory, does anyone think the material conditions that led so many young people to seek radical answers will suddenly evaporate?</p> <p>The opposite, of course, is true. When lockdown finally ends, the vaccine is injected into our veins, and commuters pack again into buses and trains, the question of who foots the bill for economic calamity will beckon. \u201cNo one wants to hear it,\u201d says<strong> </strong>George Osborne, singing from his only hymn sheet, \u201cbut we\u2019re going to have to make uncomfortable choices about how we pay for this.\u201d Those who spent most of their adulthoods in the shadow of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/sep/11/lehman-brothers-collapse-where-are-the-key-figures-now\">Lehman Brothers\u2019 collapse</a> may find their wallets are going to be inspected again by Tory politicians. Unprecedented peacetime state interventionism has shifted what is deemed to be politically possible, while grand social injustices \u2013 how badly paid \u201cessential workers\u201d are, the economic insecurity of millions, the underfunding of the NHS, our shredded welfare state \u2013 have been painfully exposed. If now isn\u2019t the time for radicalism, then when?</p> <p>Here\u2019s how the story usually goes when the left is defeated. Disheartened and directionless, it is enveloped by infighting and bitterness, by the -internal spats its critics love to caricature as Monty Python-esque. This would be a grave error. While the likely Democratic nominee, Joe Biden, is politically closer to a \u201done-nation\u201d British Tory than a Labour politician, the US left has unquestionably radically repositioned the Democratic party\u2019s political centre of gravity. Keir Starmer\u2019s mandate is rooted in promising to abide by the core tenets of Corbyn\u2019s political prospectus. The British and US left must defend their political gains, resist sectarianism and strike broad political alliances.</p> <p>After its colossal defeats in the 1980s, Britain\u2019s left retreated into being a grumpy, isolated fringe; it fell into political opposition to its previous allies on the so-called soft left, many of whom then entered into alliance with the party\u2019s right. A repetition of history must be resisted. A coalition should be built between those who voted for Rebecca Long-Bailey or Starmer to defend the \u201c<a href=\"https://keirstarmer.com/plans/10-pledges/\">10 pledges</a>\u201d of the victor, from raising taxes on the rich to common ownership to extending the welfare state. The new left was an alliance between survivors of past political struggles, and a youth politicised by movements against war, tuition fees, tax avoidance, austerity and climate emergency. It is the latter group that must now assume its leadership.</p> <p>When the financial system crashed in 2008, the left had few ideas of its own in the bank, and was instead defined by slogans expressing what it was opposed to rather than any coherent vision of what a new society could look like. Now the left brims with policies and ideas that are not just appropriated by mainstream centre-left politicians but even raided by the political right. Those who were inspired by \u201cFor the many not the few\u201d in Britain, by \u201cNot me. Us\u201d in the US, by \u201c<em>\u00a1Si, se puede!\u201d</em> (\u201cYes, we can!\u201d) chanted in the squares of Spain have not gone anywhere. The age of corona and looming climate emergency demand an even more ambitious vision. The left has not triumphed, but it hasn\u2019t died either: and it may well be today\u2019s disappointed youth who will find vindication in a new world free of injustice that they may yet one day build.</p> <p>\u2022 Owen Jones is a Guardian columnist</p>",

Trump, clad in a baseball cap, strode into the Situation Room for a meeting with the coronavirus task force. He didn\u2019t stop by the group\u2019s daily meetings often, but he had an idea he was eager to share: He wanted to start a White House talk radio show.<br></p> <p>At the time, the virus was rapidly spreading across the country, and Mr. Trump would soon announce a ban on European travel. A talk radio show, Mr. Trump excitedly explained, would allow him to quell Americans\u2019 fears and answer their questions about the pandemic directly, according to three White House officials who heard the pitch. There would be no screening, he said, just an open line for people to call and engage one-on-one with the president.</p> <p>But that Saturday, almost as suddenly as he proposed it, the president outlined one reason he would not be moving forward with it: He did not want to compete with Rush Limbaugh.</p> <p>No one in the room was sure how to respond, two of the officials said. Someone suggested hosting the show in the mornings or on weekends, to steer clear of the conservative radio host\u2019s schedule. But Mr. Trump shook his head, saying he envisioned his show as two hours a day, every day. And were it not for Mr. Limbaugh, and the risk of encroaching on his territory, he reiterated, he would do it.</p> </blockquote> <p>If Trump had gone through with the idea, it\u2019s likely he would have faced severe criticism for spending two hours a day hosting a call-in show as the country struggled through a growing pandemic. </p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e9751118f08cf571cdb1af4\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/adam-gabbatt\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-15T18:35:13.338Z\">7.35pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">'Lock her up' protests against Michigan governor</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"88c8c9af17ad9582784cf234b4a59bf9c309eee5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/88c8c9af17ad9582784cf234b4a59bf9c309eee5/118_0_3601_2162/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dawn Perreca protests on the front steps of the Michigan State Capitol building in Lansing, Michigan today.

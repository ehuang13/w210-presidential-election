So far the March coronavirus appeal has generated $1bn.</p> \n  <p>The extra money would be used to help with testing, basic aid as well as the easing the logistics of continuing the delivery of aid in a pandemic. OCHA expects the biggest impact may be economic due to collapse in commodity prices, fall in trade flows, elimination of tourism and ending of remittances home.</p> \n  <p>Mark Lowcock, the head of the agency, is predicting for the first time in 20 years the proportion of people living in poverty will rise. One reason will be that the numbers classified as one step away from famine and dependent on food aid will rise from 130m to 260m. He is arguing with wealthy countries that unless they respond there will be a spate of famines, and problems stored up for as long as a decade, including migration and terrorism.</p> \n  <p>Overall OCHA has proposed $90bn could protect the poor with two thirds dedicated to social protection programs coming from the strengthened balance sheets of international financial institutions. The remaining third - $30bn \u2013 may will have to be delivered by humanitarian agencies funded by an increase in official development assistance.</p> \n  <p>Novel forms of protection are being experimented in low income countries, including open air education, less frequent food distributions, an increase in cash distribution through text messaging and on line education of health workers</p> \n  <p>The increased appeal comes despite a slower than expected spread of the virus than previously foreseen, but OCHA admits information on the spread of virus is still primitive in some countries such as Afghanistan and Yemen.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ea9bd138f087455863180d6\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/lorenzo-tondo\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-29T17:51:22.528Z\">6.51pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>A video emerged on Wednesday of an illegal horse race in Palermo, <strong>Italy</strong>, that went ahead in defiance of the coronavirus lockdown, writes <strong>Lorenzo Tondo</strong>, who is based in the city. </p> \n  <p>The clips show dozens of scooters, surrounding the horses that are running in a street near the University of Palermo.

  "<p>Michigan congressman Justin Amash late on Tuesday announced plans to jump into the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-elections-2020\">2020 presidential race</a>. Amash, a former Republican turned Libertarian, had toyed with the idea for a while. His argument has been that he could rally voters disaffected by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\">Donald Trump</a> but uninterested in voting for a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/democrats\">Democrat</a>.</p> <p>Amash, a five-term congressman, is known as a gadfly who has bucked Republican leadership and eagerly skirmished with his colleagues when he was a Republican. In July 2019 Amash, the only Republican congressman to vocally support <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-impeachment\">impeaching</a> Trump, left the Republican party.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/29/justin-amash-presidential-bid-libertarian\">Justin Amash explores running for US president as Libertarian</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In announcing the creation of his presidential exploratory committee, a largely ceremonial step in American politics, Amash said on Twitter: \u201cWe\u2019re ready for a presidency that will restore respect for our Constitution and bring people together. I\u2019m excited and honored to be taking these first steps toward serving Americans of every background as president.\u201d</p> <p>Here\u2019s what you need to know about the Libertarian presidential candidate.</p> <h2><strong>Who is Amash?</strong></h2> <p>Amash, 40, is a lawyer by trade who first served in the Michigan statehouse before ascending to the US Congress in 2010 during the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/tea-party-movement\">Tea Party</a> wave. Amash, in his first campaign, benefited from support from major Tea Party groups.</p> <p>In 2019 Amash left the Republican party in protest of its seemingly immovable support for Donald Trump. He decided to join the Libertarian party and has served as one of the few members of Congress not part of the Republican or Democratic party.</p> <h2><strong>Could Amash\u2019s candidacy have an impact in the 2020 presidential election?</strong></h2> <p>It\u2019s possible. Amash, a fiscal conservative, could siphon away right-leaning voters disinclined to vote for Trump from former vice-president Joe Biden. Or his candidacy could attract small-government Republicans away from Trump to the benefit of Biden.</p> <p>His chances of winning the presidency are slim. Amash is getting into the race late and no presidential candidate running on the Libertarian party has ever actually been elected president. They usually perform poorly.</p> <h2><strong>What is his relationship with Trump?</strong></h2> <p>Contentious. Amash has been a vocal critic of the president and the feeling is mutual. When Amash announced he was leaving the Republican party, Trump tweeted: \u201cGreat news for the Republican Party as one of the dumbest &amp; most disloyal men in Congress is \u2018quitting\u2019 the Party. No Collusion, No Obstruction! Knew he couldn\u2019t get the nomination to run again in the Great State of Michigan. Already being challenged for his seat. A total loser!\u201d</p> <p>(Amash, at times, has been mentioned as a potential candidate for statewide office but has never actually run for Senate or governor.)</p> <h2><strong>Does Amash have a chance?</strong></h2> <p>It\u2019s unclear what impact Amash will have in this election. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">coronavirus pandemic</a> has already upended some of the normal rules of presidential campaigning. Amash himself is a relative unknown compared with Trump or Biden as well.</p> <p>Almost a year ago <a href=\"https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/politics/2019/06/05/amash-presidential-bid-hurts-biden-michigan/1331256001/\">a poll</a> for the Detroit News found that Amash would draw about 10% of the vote to him in a three-way race. Biden, the poll found, would have the plurality with Trump trailing the former vice-president by just a few percentage points.</p> <p>But more recently data from Morning Consult <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MorningConsult/status/1255305498301210624\">suggested</a> that Amash\u2019s presence in the race would have essentially no impact at all.</p> <h2><strong>What happens next?</strong></h2> <p>Amash will have to move quickly to assemble a presidential campaign. That includes not just staffers but also the requisite amount of support to have any impact at all. Amash has already been in contact with the Libertarian party\u2019s chairman.</p> <p>But Amash will also have to devote a significant amount of time to ballot access,<strong> </strong>making efforts to appear on voters\u2019 ballots as a libertarian presidential candidate alongside Trump and Biden. That\u2019s been a persistent hurdle for third-party candidates. The Libertarian party is on the ballot of 35 states, meaning there\u2019s room for growth in a candidate like Amash.</p> <p>Still, it\u2019s an uphill battle.</p>",

Not even <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/president-trump-joke-dating-models-discussing-covid-19\">pandemic models</a>.</p> <p>One of those weird feeling questions was lobbed Trump\u2019s way on Tuesday, like a meatball dangling in the air of the East Room, waiting to be <a href=\"https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/heres-what-happens-when-a-pitcher-throws-a-meatball/\">crushed</a> in front of the cameras.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ve spoken about your friend who passed away,\u201d begged the hungry reporter. \u201cI was wondering if you have spoken to the families of anyone else who has lost a loved one to Covid-19. If there\u2019s any particular stories that have affected you.\u201d</p> <p>Lots of stories have affected Donald Trump. The story about his inaugural crowds. The story about him losing the popular vote by historic margins. The stories about his corruption and incompetence. The story about Russia conspiring to manipulate American voters to elect him. The story about his impeachment for trying to corrupt November\u2019s election.</p> <p>But the death of another person affecting him?</p> <p>\u201cWell, I have \u2013 I have many people. I know many stories,\u201d he warmed up. \u201cI\u2019ve spoken to three, maybe, I guess, four families unrelated to me.\u201d</p> <p>Since he first embraced the notion of being a wartime president, another 58,800 Americans have died from the pandemic. But our wartime leader could only find three, maybe four families to talk to. He is, you know, a busy man.</p> <p>Perhaps not too busy to tweet about anything he sees on the teevee. But often too busy for lunch, <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2020/04/26/trump-works-so-hard-he-often-misses-lunch-white-house-officials/\">according</a> to his new chief of staff, who says that\u2019s \u201cthe biggest concern I have\u201d. Which means the catastrophic death toll and unemployment numbers are less of a concern than a hangry Trump. Good to know where your priorities lie, Mark Meadows. Thank you for your service.</p> <p>Anyway, about those dead Americans.</p> <p>\u201cI did \u2013 I lost a very good friend,\u201d explained our wartime leader. \u201cI also lost three other friends \u2013 two of whom I didn\u2019t know as well, but they were friends and people I did business with, and probably almost everybody in the room did.\u201d</p> <p>So they were special, then, these friends you didn\u2019t know well, but did business with. Like everybody. Very moving.</p> <p>\u201cAnd it\u2019s a \u2013 it\u2019s a bad death,\u201d he continued. \u201cIt\u2019s not a \u2013 it\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s a bad thing. It grips on to some people. Now we found out that young people do extraordinarily well. That\u2019s why I think we can start thinking about schools, but of course, we\u2019re ending the school season.\u201d</p> <p>Yes, pandemics have a way of gripping on to people and delivering the bad deaths that are totally and completely different from the good deaths. Truly, your friends are lucky to have you, Mr President. It\u2019s just a shame they weren\u2019t young people.</p> <p>At this point, our wartime president gave up entirely on the premise of talking about the deaths of his friends to go on a springtime stroll through the open fields of his synapses.</p> <p>He talked about Purdue University in Indiana (\u201ca great state\u201d) and also some place called Harvard. Apparently they want to reopen, which is not, as they say at MIT, rocket science. These places are doing something Trump called \u201ccomputer learning\u201d, which, he pointed out, is not \u201ctele-learning\u201d. Not at all. That\u2019s the kind of thing you did at Trump University, which criminology students now claim to be a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/18/donald-trump-university-settles-president-lawsuit-25-million\">classic case</a> of fraud.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Trump may share the same burden as LBJ, but he plainly lacks his political sense to quit rather than seek re-election</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Previous wartime presidents have been racked by the nation\u2019s grief. Barack Obama cleared his schedule to talk and write to the families of soldiers killed in action, and visited with many. George W Bush <a href=\"https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2008/dec/22/bush-cheney-comforted-troops-privately/\">said</a> it was his \u201cduty\u201d to visit wounded soldiers and <a href=\"https://www.chicagotribune.com/opinion/commentary/ct-trump-purple-heart-george-bush-perspec-20160803-story.html\">endure</a> their parent\u2019s verbal abuse. Trump, of course, <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/families-fallen-share-personal-stories-past-presidents-reaching/story?id=50533206\">lied</a> about Obama\u2019s treatment of gold star families, while also telling one widow that her husband \u201cknew what he signed up for\u201d.</p> <p>But Obama and Bush never had to deal with the enormous magnitude of death that is Trump\u2019s record. The United States has now lost more lives to the pandemic than it did in Vietnam, when Lyndon Johnson was so anguished by a war he knew was unwinnable. LBJ was hardly the emotive type but even he <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/retropolis/wp/2017/10/18/trump-may-want-to-study-lincoln-master-of-the-wrenching-art-of-presidential-condolences/\">struggled</a> with how to respond to grieving families.</p> <p>Donald Trump, however, stands alone. He may share the same burden as Johnson, but he plainly lacks his political sense to quit rather than seek re-election. As the Washington Post <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/13-hours-of-trump-the-president-fills-briefings-with-attacks-and-boasts-but-little-empathy/2020/04/25/7eec5ab0-8590-11ea-a3eb-e9fc93160703_story.html\">calculated</a>, he has spent just four and a half minutes expressing condolences for the deceased in more than 13 hours of briefings.</p> <p>So our antihero glided blithely past another disastrous marker on his long descent into the depths of presidential failure: one million cases of a pandemic that he said just two months ago, would go down to zero and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/28/trump-coronavirus-misleading-claims\">disappear</a> \u201clike a miracle\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cAt the appropriate time, it will be down to zero, like we said,\u201d he explained on Tuesday, without divulging when it would be appropriate for the virus to disappear with the requisite decorum.</p> <p>You see, for Trump, 58,000 dead Americans is actually a win. Kind of like a big win-win, really. Remember that the experts said that even more people would die and the experts were wrong. So that\u2019s one win for him. And then they said he shouldn\u2019t impose travel restrictions on flights from China, but he did, so that\u2019s another win for him.</p> <p>\u201cSo I think we\u2019ve done a great job, in the sense that we were early,\u201d he explained. \u201cI think by banning China \u2013 by banning China and banning people coming in who would have been very heavily infected, we probably saved hundreds of thousands of lives. So on that, I\u2019m very proud.\u201d</p> <p>Never mind that 40,000 people <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/04/us/coronavirus-china-travel-restrictions.html?action=click&amp;module=Spotlight&amp;pgtype=Homepage\">entered</a> the country after his so-called ban. Trump thinks that only Chinese citizens were \u201cvery heavily infected\u201d and that \u2013 in the great ledger of life and death \u2013 his two wins outweigh 58,000 lost lives.</p> <p>While the world\u2019s scientists desperately search for a vaccine against the coronavirus, they may be missing an extraordinary case of immunity that stares us in the face every day. It\u2019s like someone brought the light inside the body, either through the skin or some other way.

But it was a wake-up call for Democrats: the fight for the White House and Senate in November will also be a fight for the rule of law.</p> <p>The Trump administration has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/may/30/donald-trump-judges-courts-justice-system\">brought a laser-like focus</a> to nominating and winning Senate confirmation for 193 judges \u2013 two supreme court justices, 51 circuit court judges (a quarter of the total), 138 district court judges and two US court of international trade judges \u2013 at a pace unmatched since the presidency of Ronald Reagan.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve never in my lifetime seen an election whose stakes were higher,\u201d said <a href=\"https://hls.harvard.edu/faculty/directory/10899/Tribe\">Laurence Tribe, </a>who was born in 1941 and is a constitutional law professor at Harvard University. \u201cThe transformation of the federal judiciary into a series of puppets for a very rightwing ideology will have lasting impact for decades.\u201d</p> <p>Trump and Mitch McConnell, the Republican majority leader in the Senate, aim to guarantee a long-term conservative skew on decisions that affect millions of people, including abortion rights, environment regulations, gun control, immigration rules and access to healthcare (having failed to overturn Barack Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act on Capitol Hill, the administration is now <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/02/us-supreme-court-aca-affordable-care-act-challenge\">trying to do so in the courts).</a></p> <p>The new wave of judges is dominated by young white men often rushed through the Senate with little regard for standard procedure. Critics say the chief criterion for selection is no longer experience or qualifications but ideology.</p> <p>Tribe commented: \u201cHe\u2019s appointed one person after another, with the cooperation of of majority leader McConnell and a very supine Senate, who would never have been accepted in the past and are not comparable to those appointed by Republicans in the past.\u201d</p> <p>The professor added: \u201cMany of them will be there for 30 or 40 years. And so the entire landscape of the federal judiciary as a guard rail against various kinds of abuse and violations of the rule of law has been dramatically weakened for the foreseeable future.\u201d</p> <h2>\u2018These judges are younger, more partisan, more political and really having a big impact on the lives of Americans\u2019</h2> <p>Progressives cite <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/03/us/trump-justin-walker-appeals-court.html\">Walker as a prime example.</a> He has only served as a federal district court judge in Kentucky since October. At the time of his appointment, the American Bar Association, which issues ratings on judicial nominees, said he was not qualified to serve because of his inexperience. ,He was eventually confirmed on a 50-41 vote.</p> <p>Walker is also a former clerk to Kavanaugh, who was narrowly confirmed to the supreme court after claims of sexual misconduct from decades earlier resurfaced. Walker did 162 media interviews, including 35 on Fox News (\u201cHe is a warrior with a backbone of iron\u201d), to defend his mentor, <a href=\"https://civilrights.org/blog/wilson-and-walker-are-conservative-extremists-and-thats-why-trump-chose-them/\">according to the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights.</a></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"84f766dcb7aae9b9bfdd5d052416e4bd8f5d0668\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/84f766dcb7aae9b9bfdd5d052416e4bd8f5d0668/0_0_5568_3712/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Donald Trump and Brett Kavanaugh at the White House in Washington DC on 8 October 2018.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Donald Trump and Brett Kavanaugh at the White House in Washington DC on 8 October 2018.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jim Watson/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Christopher Kang, chief counsel for Demand Justice, a progressive advocacy organisation, and who served in the Obama administration for nearly seven years, said: \u201cWe\u2019ve seen over the last three years the kinds of judges that President Trump has put in throughout the judiciary, from district courts all the way to the supreme court. They\u2019re younger, more partisan, more political and really having a big impact on the lives of Americans.\u201d</p> <h2>\u2018Overall, with his selection of judges, he\u2019s hit it out of the park\u2019</h2> <p>But conservatives disagree with this characterisation. <a href=\"https://www.heritage.org/staff/elizabeth-slattery\">Elizabeth Slattery,</a> a legal fellow at the Heritage Foundation thinktank in Washington, who went to school with Walker in Louisville, Kentucky, said: \u201cIt\u2019s true that he\u2019s young and new to the bench, but he had a background as an academic and his research was focused on administrative law and separation of powers. It just so happens the court he\u2019s been nominated to focuses very heavily on administrative law. So I think he\u2019s a great selection because he knows these issues very well.\u201d</p> <p>Slattery contends that Trump\u2019s selections haves been based on judicial philosophy rather than political ideology. \u201cMany of them are pretty young \u2013 a lot are in their 40s \u2013 so the expectation is that they will serve on these courts for decades to come,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s perhaps the longest-lasting legacy that any president can have but President Trump has really made this a high priority. Overall, with his selection of judges, he\u2019s hit it out of the park.\u201d</p> <p>Progressives, however, fear more Justin Walkers waiting in the wings. He is a member of <a href=\"https://fedsoc.org/\">the Federalist Society,</a> which favours an \u201coriginalist\u201d interpretation of the constitution and has created a pipeline of young conservative lawyers. Its alliance with Trump has helped him win over Christian evangelicals and other doubters on the right. Many pointed to Trump\u2019s release during the 2016 election of a shortlist of judges for the supreme court vacancy at the time as a political masterstroke that secured their vote.</p> <p>The courts barely featured in 10 Democratic primary debates. Even so, liberal supreme court justices <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jul/05/rbg-to-mp3-ruth-bader-ginsburg-inspires-classical-music-album\">Ruth Bader Ginsburg</a> and Stephen Breyer will be 87 and 82 respectively at the time of the elections in November.</p> <p>Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee, <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/16/politics/joe-biden-supreme-court-african-american-woman-nominee/index.html\">has already committed</a> to putting the first African American woman on the supreme court. But Kang said: \u201cHe needs to go a step further and explain literally who are some of the African American women that he\u2019s considering.</p> <p>\u201cThere are a lot of fantastic potential candidates out there who could really help excite progressives about how he would view the courts and how he would seek to restore balance and fairness.\u201d</p> <p>But the White House alone is not enough. If Biden wins the presidency and Republicans retain control of the Senate, a long war of attrition looms. McConnell refused to sanction a vote on dozens of Obama\u2019s judicial nominees, most infamously <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2016/mar/16/obama-nominates-merrick-garland-supreme-court-dc-appeals-court-judge\">his supreme court pick Merrick Garland.</a></p> <p>Kang added: \u201cPeople may focus on McConnell blocking Merrick Garland\u2019s nomination to the supreme court, which was obviously a horrific display of anti-democracy, but what he did in the lower courts is no less appalling. On the circuit courts, over the last two years of President Obama\u2019s term, he only allowed two circuit court judges to be confirmed, which is the fewest since the 1800s.</p> <p>\u201cAnd judges overall, even if you include district court judges, was 22, which was the fewest since President Truman. That\u2019s very intentional and I think that\u2019s exactly what we could see if Republicans maintain the majority and there\u2019s a Democratic president.\u201d</p> <p>This year, 23 Republican Senate seats are up for grabs; Democrats only need to flip four to regain control. Such is the courts\u2019 power to block legislation that much of the Democratic agenda is on the line.</p> <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/importantmeagan?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">Meagan Hatcher-Mays,</a> director of democracy policy for the Indivisible Project, a progressive grassroots movement, said: \u201cIt\u2019s going to be critically important not just to throw Trump out of office this year, but to also flip the Senate so that we can actually move forward with some of our progressive priorities and that includes judges, because pretty much every single piece of progressive legislation that passes through Congress under a Democratic president is going to be challenged in court by Republicans.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.pfaw.org/spokespeople/marge-baker/\">Marge Baker</a> is executive vice-president at People For the American Way, an activist group that has created a web page entitled <a href=\"https://www.pfaw.org/vote-the-courts-2020/\">Vote the Courts 2020</a> to \u201cidentify senators whose confirmation votes for unfit judges prove they don\u2019t deserve to keep their seats\u201d. Baker says: \u201cProgressives, independents, the public understands now in a way they haven\u2019t before the impact that these judges have on their daily lives.</p> <p>\u201cThey understand, frankly, because of the role that Mitch McConnell has played, how critical it is that you have not just a Democratic president, but also a Democratic Senate in order to process these nominations.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThey see decision after decision, the court rolling back voting rights, putting healthcare at risk, putting reproductive freedom at risk, environmental regulations, workers\u2019 rights \u2013 everything that people have come to depend on is being overturned and upended by the courts.\u201d</p> <p>Such battles are not fought in the supreme court alone. Although Chief Justice John Roberts and colleagues steal the limelight, McConnell himself has noted the importance of the lower courts. Appearing on the <a href=\"https://www.tonyperkins.com/get.cfm?i=LR20D11\">Washington Watch podcast</a> with Tony Perkins in April, the majority leader said: \u201cIt\u2019s important for your listeners to know that most litigation never makes it to the supreme court.</p> <p>\u201cMost complex litigation stops at the circuit court level. The level below that is district courts. They\u2019re also important, but their decisions are, of course, appealable to the circuit courts.\u201d \u201d</p> <p>Democrats are hoping to convince their own voters on the same point. Should the party take both the White House and Senate, it would be no surprise if two dozen judges appointed by Bill Clinton in the 1990s seek retirement or senior status to make way for younger liberals with decades of service ahead of them. This would be a sign that, after four years of the Trump-McConnell onslaught, the pendulum had begun to swing the other way.</p> <p>In a news and political cycle usually dominated by instant gratification, victory belongs to whoever can play the long game. Hatcher-Mays of Indivisible said: \u201cI would like to see Democrats be just as aggressive in getting their judicial nominees confirmed as Republicans have been, even if that means not getting Republican support, because the point is these positions are for life.\u201d</p>",

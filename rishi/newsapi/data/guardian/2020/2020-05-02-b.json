The government has been paralysed by a months-long political dispute over who won last year\u2019s presidential election, which prompted the US to withhold a billion dollars of funding, vital to the functioning of a country with little tax base.</p> <p>US President Donald Trump\u2019s decision to sign a withdrawal deal with the Taliban, in a bid to end America\u2019s long war, has thrust the civil conflict between Afghan factions into an uncertain new phase.

  "<p>Nearly three decades after Joe Biden faced sharp backlash over his treatment of Anita Hill, when she came before his Senate committee to accuse Clarence Thomas of sexual harassment, he urged lawmakers not to repeat the same mistakes when considering a sexual assault claim against another supreme court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh, by Dr Christine Blasey Ford.</p> <p>\u201cIt takes enormous courage for a woman to come forward, under the bright lights of millions of people watching, and relive something that happened to her,\u201d Biden <a href=\"https://time.com/5403068/joe-biden-on-christine-blasey-ford/\">said</a> in 2018, as he was laying the groundwork for a presidential run.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/01/joe-biden-denies-sexual-assault-allegation-tara-reade-statement\">Joe Biden denies sexual assault allegation from former staffer Tara Reade</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Ford, he said, \u201cshould be given the benefit of the doubt\u201d.</p> <p>That statement was read back to Biden during an interview on Friday, in which the presumptive Democratic nominee broke his months-long silence to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/01/joe-biden-denies-sexual-assault-allegation-tara-reade-statement\">unequivocally deny an allegation of sexual assault</a> by a former Senate aide, Tara Reade.

Period.\u201d</p> <p>For weeks Biden\u2019s campaign has grappled with how he should defend him while upholding the \u201cbelieve women\u201d ethos of the #MeToo movement that Democrats have embraced. In the years since Donald Trump was elected, Democrats have confronted sexual misconduct aggressively, policing their own ranks to draw a sharp distinction with Republicans on issues of gender, equality and accountability.</p> <p>Trump has been accused by more than a dozen women of sexual harassment, assault or rape. During the 2016 election, a recording emerged of him <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/07/donald-trump-leaked-recording-women\">bragging about groping women</a>. Trump has flatly denied the allegations, often attacking his accusers as opportunists and liars.</p> <p>Indeed, on Friday the president advised Biden to \u201cgo out and fight it\u201d.</p> <p>Speaking to the conservative conservative radio host Dan Bongino, Trump suggested the accusation could be false and even sounded a note of empathy for Biden\u2019s predicament.</p> <p>\u201cAll of a sudden you become a wealthy guy, you\u2019re a famous guy, then you become president, and people \u2026 that you\u2019ve never seen, that you\u2019ve never heard of make charges,\u201d Trump said. \u201cSo I guess in a way you could say I\u2019m \u2026 sticking up for him.\u201d</p> <p>Republicans have largely remained silent about Trump\u2019s record on women. By contrast, Democrats demanded Biden publicly address the matter and some have even called for him to step down as the presumptive nominee.</p> <p>\u201cDemanding more of Joe Biden\u2019s leadership is not in contradiction with our commitment to defeat Trump,\u201d said Ana Maria Archila, co-executive director of the Center for Popular Democracy. \u201cIt is, in fact, central to that effort.\u201d</p> <p>Yet Republicans have seized on the matter in an effort to renew the poisonous political fight that erupted over Kavanaugh.</p> <p>\u201cDemocrat double standard\u201d blared a memo from the Republican National Committee which portrayed Democrats as hypocrites who held the allegation against their nominee to a higher standard of proof than the one they used against Kavanaugh.</p> <p>\u201cThe double standard exhibited by Biden, prominent liberal women\u2019s groups and Democrat elected officials \u2013 some of whom want to be Biden\u2019s running mate \u2013 is glaring and cannot be allowed to stand,\u201d said Erin Perrine, a spokeswoman for Trump\u2019s election campaign.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ab146d60850568785346d7860d7639411c760e82\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ab146d60850568785346d7860d7639411c760e82/0_202_5516_3309/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Amy Klobuchar speaks to Ari Melber of MSNBC.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Amy Klobuchar speaks to Ari Melber of MSNBC.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Brian Cahn/ZUMA Wire/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But Karen Finney, who worked for Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2016 campaign, said Republicans were \u201cplaying with fire\u201d by attempting to create a \u201cfalse equivalency\u201d between Biden and Trump on the issue.</p> <p>Lis Smith, a senior adviser to Pete Buttigieg\u2019s Democratic presidential campaign, said: \u201cIf Republicans and Biden opponents push too hard on this, it will backfire on them and just raise the question of why President Trump has never addressed the scores of sexual misconduct allegations against him.\u201d</p> <p>Women are a core Democratic constituency. Since Trump\u2019s election, they have organized, voted and run for office in record numbers. In the presidential primary, excitement at the prospect of nominating a woman was eclipsed by fear of losing to Trump. Democrats chose Biden because they believed he was the most electable candidate. He has promised to choose a woman as his running mate.</p> <p>Lara Brown, director of the Graduate School of Political Management at George Washington University, said: \u201cIn this situation, the calculation that I think most Democrats will make is whatever Biden\u2019s problems are, Trump is worse on every level.\u201d</p> <p>Brown said accusations of hypocrisy can \u201chit more than the scandal itself\u201d, particularly when a candidate is attempting to define an opponent. But in this case, she said, the effort to brand Democrats as hypocrites would be undercut by Trump\u2019s record and Republican silence.</p> <p>Larry Jacobs, director of the Center for the Study of Politics and Governance at the University of Minnesota, said Republicans were attempting to \u201cneutralize\u201d Biden\u2019s appeal to suburban women who revolted from the party in 2018.</p> <p>But he said the controversy would probably be eclipsed by the economic fallout from the coronavirus outbreak and was unlikely to be a \u201cfront-of-mind issue for voters\u201d come November.</p> <p>Biden\u2019s public silence over the last month has put top female allies in the position of defending him while validating the experiences of women who come forward. Even so, party leadership and many of the women Biden is considering for vice-president, including Senators Amy Klobuchar and Kamala Harris and former Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams, have voiced their support in recent days.</p> <p>\u201cI have a great comfort level with the situation as I see it,\u201d the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, told reporters on Thursday, \u201cwith all due respect in the world for any woman who comes forward, with all the highest regard for Joe Biden.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fa9e402403f38207eaa39ca2c5c07b9962d7652e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fa9e402403f38207eaa39ca2c5c07b9962d7652e/0_249_5568_3341/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Stacey Abrams speaks to Jake Tapper of CNN.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Stacey Abrams speaks to Jake Tapper of CNN.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Brian Cahn/ZUMA Wire/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Pelosi said she had \u201ccomplete respect\u201d for the #MeToo movement but added: \u201cThere is also due process, and the fact that Joe Biden is Joe Biden.\u201d</p> <p>Juanita Broaddrick, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/clinton/stories/broaddrick022599.htm\">who accused Bill Clinton of raping her in 1978</a>, accused Pelosi of being \u201chypocritical\u201d and \u201cdishonest\u201d.</p> <p>\u201c\u2018The fact is that Joe Biden is Joe Biden\u2019,\u201d she <a href=\"https://twitter.com/atensnut/status/1255957510256840706\">wrote on Twitter</a>. \u201cWhat the hell?

The former mayor changed his mind and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/21/mike-bloomberg-transfers-18m-to-democratic-national-committee\">instead</a> transferred $18m to the Democratic National Committee, the main organization charged with boosting the party\u2019s presidential nominee.</p> <p>It\u2019s possible Bloomberg could move more money as well. The Bloomberg campaign also transferred leases for over a dozen of its field offices to the DNC, adding to the DNC\u2019s campaign spaces around the country.</p> <p>Bloomberg himself is staying visible, working with the New York governor, Andrew Cuomo, to <a href=\"https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/amid-ongoing-covid-19-pandemic-governor-cuomo-and-mayor-mike-bloomberg-launch-nation-leading\">launch</a> a testing and tracing program. He spoke via video conference call during Cuomo\u2019s press briefing on Thursday. The governor, currently one of the most prominent Democrats in the country, said in late April that Bloomberg was working with him.</p> <p>A network of operatives and Bloomberg-connected political organizations is also active in Democratic presidential circles. Bill Knapp, a longtime Bloomberg adviser, recently joined Priorities USA, the Super Pac the Joe Biden campaign has signaled is its outside organization of choice for the general election.</p> <p>During Bloomberg\u2019s campaign, he poured almost $67m into a new digital and technology firm called Hawkfish. Hawkfish has stayed active since Bloomberg dropped out. The firm is reportedly in talks to work for Biden\u2019s presidential campaign although nothing is finalized.</p> <p>Hawkfish also got into negotiations to buy another Democratic analytics firm, Blue Labs Analytics, according to four Democrats with knowledge of those talks, but negotiations fell through. Hawkfish and Blue Labs still have ties.</p> <p>In Washington Democratic analytics circles Hawkfish has become a hot topic as a firm trying to elbow its way into the group of top-tier data analytics firms.</p> <p>The business discussions between Hawkfish and various campaigns and outlets within the Democratic campaign universe underscores how Bloomberg-connected operatives and groups continue to set down deep roots within the party.</p> <p>Some former digital and data staffers for the Bloomberg campaign have talked with Biden campaign officials about joining the campaign, according to a Democratic strategist with knowledge of those talks.</p> <p>The Biden campaign did not return a request for comment.</p> <p>\u201cI think Mayor Bloomberg has made it very plain, through his actions and his investments, his commitment to defeating Donald Trump and helping to elect Democrats across the country,\u201d said the former Michigan congressman Mark Schauer, who supported Bloomberg during the mayor\u2019s short-lived presidential campaign. \u201cI think those contributions are valuable, they\u2019re significant, and they\u2019ll have an impact this November.\u201d</p> <p>The end goal for Bloomberg, 78, is still somewhat murky.</p> <p>The former mayor has repeatedly said he would use his considerable resources to oust Trump from office. But the rapid expansion of Bloomberg-connected groups and operatives around Washington also suggests Bloomberg intends to hold a seat at the table among the most influential Democratic party leaders, albeit one outside of elected office.</p>",

The tension between reality and the text and aspirations of the Declaration of Independence was in the open again. Lunch-counter sit-ins and demands for the vote filled newspapers and TV screens. The fault lines were plainly visible \u2013 and the Soviet Union pounced.</p> <p>In 1960, the KGB embarked on a \u201cseries of race-baiting disinformation operations\u201d that included mailing Ku Klux Klan leaflets to African and Asian delegations to the United Nations on the eve of a debate on colonialism. At the same time, Russian \u201coperators posed as an African American organization agitating against the KKK\u201d.</p> <p>More than a half-century later, Russia ran an updated version of the play. Twitter came to host <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/the-russians-manipulated-our-elections-we-helped/2020/04/23/e44e9e76-5742-11ea-9000-f3cffee23036_story.html\">the fake accounts</a> of both \u201cJohn Davis\u201d, ostensibly a gun-toting Texas Christian and family man, and @BlacktoLive\u201d, along with hundreds of others.</p> <p>The Internet Research Agency (IRA), a Russian troll factory, organized pro-Confederate flag rallies. <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/04/18/us/politics/mueller-report-document.html\">As detailed by Robert Mueller</a>, the IRA also claimed that the civil war was not \u201cabout slavery\u201d and instead was \u201call about money\u201d, a false trope that continues to gain resonance among Trump supporters and proponents of the \u201cliberate the states\u201d movement.

In the late 1960s, \u201cencouraging \u2018anti-German tendencies in the West\u2019 was very much a priority\u201d.</p> <p>In 1964, with Russian assistance, Czech intelligence mounted <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/uncovering-operation-neptun-the-cold-wars-most-daring-disinformation-campaign/\">Operation Neptun</a>, sinking <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/stb-neptun-90039/page/n21/mode/2up\">Nazi wartime documents</a> to the bottom of the ominous sounding Black Lake, near the German border. The cache was then \u201cdiscovered\u201d \u2013 media pandemonium ensued. Four years later the mastermind of the scheme, Ladislav Bittman, defected to the US.</p> <p>Prior to 2016, Russia\u2019s most notable active measure using the US as a foil was the lie that Aids was \u201cmade in the USA\u201d. In retaliation for US reports of Soviet use of chemical weapons in Afghanistan, the KGB unfurled Operation Denver, a multi-platformed campaign that falsely claimed \u201c<a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=lWltDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT352&amp;lpg=PT352&amp;dq=#v=onepage&amp;q=\">Aids was an American biological weapon developed at Fort Detrick, Maryland</a>\u201d.

Trump\u2019s \u201cnavigable waters protection rule\u201d, which was published in January, narrows the definition of waterways to exclude ephemeral streams, wetlands, creeks and other headwaters which do not have visible water 365 days a year because they run intermittently or temporarily underground. For example, 90% of streams that connect to the Colorado river, which supplies water to seven western US states and two in northern Mexico, run only after rainfall or snowmelt.</p> <p>The rule, which has attracted widespread criticism from scientists, environmentalists, and the tourism sector, replaces an Obama era regulation that strengthened protection for about 60% of the nation\u2019s interconnected waterways. But it goes much further than just repealing Obama\u2019s 2015 rule, by allowing landowners and developers to dump directly into hundreds of thousands of waterways, and to destroy or fill in wetlands for construction projects.</p> <p>\u201cAccess to clean water is a fundamental right for all Americans. Trump\u2019s dirty water rule ignores the law and science and is a reckless rollback of clean water protections \u2026 which benefits industry polluters and harms countless Americans,\u201d said <strong>Letitia James</strong>, New York\u2019s attorney general, at a virtual press conference today.</p> <p>The lawsuit argues that the new rule will result in more pollution, flooding, and harm to fish and wildlife across the country \u2014 undermining decades of work to protect and enhance water resources - and will result in widespread economic losses.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re going into this fight with our three most reliable allies: the facts, science and the law,\u201d said <strong>Xavier Becerra</strong>, California\u2019s attorney general. In California, more than 40% of streams and half of all wetlands have been stripped of protection under the new definition, said Becerra. \u201cEven during the coronavirus pandemic, the administration hasn\u2019t stopped.\u201d He added, \u201cThe latest actions come at a time when the nation\u2019s health and economy can least afford it.\u201d</p> <p>The lawsuit, co-led by New York and Califnronia, was filed today in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. Also suing are the attorneys generals of Connecticut, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Jersey, New Mexico, North Carolina, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, Wisconsin, the District of Columbia and the City of New York.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/may/01/water-shutoffs-us-coronavirus-utilities-economy\">'It feels like nobody cares': the Americans living without running water amid Covid-19</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5eac76868f082b32fdd6bbf0\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/martin-pengelly\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-01T19:39:01.134Z\">8.39pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Donald Trump has <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/01/trump-tells-biden-to-fight-tara-reade-sexual-assault-allegation.html\">passed further comment</a> on the <strong>allegation against Joe Biden</strong>, in an interview with Fox News commentator and podcast host Dan Bongino.</p> <p>\u201cI would just say to Joe Biden, \u2018Just go out and fight it,\u2019\u201d Trump said, adding in typically contradictory style: \u201cHe\u2019s gonna have to make his own decision, I\u2019m not going to be telling him what to do.

This never happened.'</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Joe Biden has emphatically denied a sexual assault allegation against him, breaking weeks of silence to address the accusation that has roiled his campaign. </p> <p>\u201c<strong>They aren\u2019t true. This never happened</strong>,\u201d he said in a statement, released moments before his Friday appearance on Morning Joe. </p> <p>Tara Reade accused Biden of sexually assaulting her in the basement of an office building on Capitol Hill in 1993, when she was an aide in his Senate office. His campaign refuted the allegation in a statement, but this is Biden\u2019s first public comment on the accusation.</p> <p>He also calls on the National Archives to release any record of a complaint Reade said she filed. </p> <p>Here is the statement in its entirety: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>April was Sexual Assault Awareness Month. Every year, at this time, we talk about awareness, prevention, and the importance of women feeling they can step forward, say something, and be heard. That belief \u2013 that women should be heard \u2013 was the underpinning of a law I wrote over 25 years ago. To this day, I am most proud of the Violence Against Women Act. So, each April we are reminded not only of how far we have come in dealing with sexual assault in this country \u2013 but how far we still have to go.</p> <p>When I wrote the bill, few wanted to talk about the issue. It was considered a private matter, a personal matter, a family matter. I didn\u2019t see it that way. To me, freedom from fear, harm, and violence for women was a legal right, a civil right, and a human right. And I knew we had to change not only the law, but the culture. <br><br>So, we held hours of hearings and heard from the most incredibly brave women \u2013 and we opened the eyes of the Senate and the nation \u2013 and passed the law.<br><br>In the years that followed, I fought to continually strengthen the law. So, when we took office and President Obama asked me what I wanted, I told him I wanted oversight of the critical appointments in the Office on Violence Against Women at the Department of Justice and I wanted a senior White House Advisor appointing directly to me on the issue. Both of those things happened.<br><br>As Vice President, we started the \u201cIt\u2019s on Us\u201d campaign on college campuses to send the message loud and clear that dating violence is violence \u2013 and against the law. <br><br>We had to get men involved. They had to be part of the solution. That\u2019s why I made a point of telling young men this was their problem too \u2013 they couldn\u2019t turn a blind eye to what was happening around them \u2013 they had a responsibility to speak out. Silence is complicity. <br><br>In the 26 years since the law passed, the culture and perceptions have changed but we\u2019re not done yet.<br><br>It\u2019s on us, and it\u2019s on me as someone who wants to lead this country. I recognize my responsibility to be a voice, an advocate, and a leader for the change in culture that has begun but is nowhere near finished. So I want to address allegations by a former staffer that I engaged in misconduct 27 years ago.<br><br>They aren\u2019t true. This never happened.</p> <p>While the details of these allegations of sexual harassment and sexual assault are complicated, two things are not complicated. One is that women deserve to be treated with dignity and respect, and when they step forward they should be heard, not silenced. The second is that their stories should be subject to appropriate inquiry and scrutiny. <br><br>Responsible news organizations should examine and evaluate the full and growing record of inconsistencies in her story, which has changed repeatedly in both small and big ways. <br><br>But this much bears emphasizing.<br><br>She has said she raised some of these issues with her supervisor and senior staffers from my office at the time. They \u2013 both men and a woman \u2013 have said, unequivocally, that she never came to them and complained or raised issues. News organizations that have talked with literally dozens of former staffers have not found one \u2013 not one \u2013 who corroborated her allegations in any way. Indeed, many of them spoke to the culture of an office that would not have tolerated harassment in any way \u2013 as indeed I would not have.<br><br>There is a clear, critical part of this story that can be verified. The former staffer has said she filed a complaint back in 1993. But she does not have a record of this alleged complaint. The papers from my Senate years that I donated to the University of Delaware do not contain personnel files. It is the practice of Senators to establish a library of personal papers that document their public record: speeches, policy proposals, positions taken, and the writing of bills. <br><br>There is only one place a complaint of this kind could be \u2013 the National Archives. The National Archives is where the records are kept at what was then called the Office of Fair Employment Practices. I am requesting that the Secretary of the Senate ask the Archives to identify any record of the complaint she alleges she filed and make available to the press any such document. If there was ever any such complaint, the record will be there.<br><br>As a Presidential candidate, I\u2019m accountable to the American people. We have lived long enough with a President who doesn\u2019t think he is accountable to anyone, and takes responsibility for nothing. That\u2019s not me. I believe being accountable means having the difficult conversations, even when they are uncomfortable. People need to hear the truth.<br><br>I have spent my career learning from women the ways in which we as individuals and as policy makers need to step up to make their hard jobs easier, with equal pay, equal opportunity, and workplaces and homes free from violence and harassment. I know how critical women\u2019s health issues and basic women\u2019s rights are. That has been a constant through my career, and as President, that work will continue. And I will continue to learn from women, to listen to women, to support women, and yes, to make sure women\u2019s voices are heard.<br><br>We have a lot of work to do. From confronting online harassment, abuse, and stalking, to ending the rape kit backlog, to addressing the deadly combination of guns and domestic violence. <br><br>We need to protect and empower the most marginalized communities, including immigrant and indigenous women, trans women, and women of color. <br><br>We need to make putting an end to gender-based violence in both the United States and around the world a top priority. <br><br>I started my work over 25 years ago with the passage of the Violence Against Women Act. As president, I\u2019m committed to finishing the job.</p> </blockquote> <p>Read it <a href=\"https://medium.com/@JoeBiden/statement-by-vice-president-joe-biden-7a9593bd3012\">here</a>: </p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-01T12:03:29.178Z\">at 1.03pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5eac004f8f08f76ffc19f64a\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-01T11:59:37.376Z\">12.59pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Good morning \u2026</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>\u2026and welcome to another day of coverage of the coronavirus outbreak \u2013 and politics, both concerning the pandemic and tilted towards the election in November \u2013 in the US.</p> <p>The main news of the morning is that <strong>Joe Biden</strong>, the presumptive Democratic nominee for president, will appear on MSNBC\u2019s Morning Joe to answer questions for the first time about <strong>an allegation of sexual assault against him</strong>. </p> <p>In advance of the interview, Biden issued a statement:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I recognize my responsibility to be a voice, an advocate, and a leader for the change in culture that has begun but is nowhere near finished.

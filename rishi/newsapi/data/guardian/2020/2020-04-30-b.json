The spike protein is the main target of leading vaccine programmes around the world, and if it changes too much those vaccines may no longer work.

The government cannot immediately ensure a return to normality ... we are still in this pandemic.\u201d</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Autonomous moves by regions would be considered illegitimate, he added, opening the way for confrontations with regional chiefs set on defying the central government.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-30T14:01:54.973Z\">at 3.01pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5eaad1b78f08a459b6585143\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-30T13:26:58.472Z\">2.26pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>It\u2019s <strong>Simon Murphy</strong> here taking over the live blog while my colleague, <strong>Alexandra Topping,</strong> takes a well-earned break.

<p>\u201cWe\u2019re not yet at the peak of the distress as a result of the lockdown. It will emerge over the coming weeks,\u201d said Sir Peter Gluckman, who was the chief science advisor to New Zealand\u2019s prime minister from 2009 until 2018.</p> \n  <p>\u201cWith that will emerge some groups of people who will do well, they will find in the change opportunity, but many people who will be very uncertain, very scared, frustrated, angry, and we know from other disasters that about 10% or more even will progress to actual depression and to suicidality.\u201d</p> \n  <p>However Gluckman also said the country possessed unique assets that could see it navigate the coronavirus crisis better than other nations would.</p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/30/emotional-fallout-of-covid-19-lockdown-yet-to-peak-says-new-zealand-scientist\">Emotional fallout of Covid-19 lockdown yet to peak, says New Zealand scientist</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5eaa5da48f08745586318479\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/martinfarrer\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-30T05:10:32.755Z\">6.10am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>In the UK, the cabinet will meet today to discuss <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/29/social-bubbles-of-small-groups-could-be-early-step-out-of-lockdown\">when to start easing the lockdown</a> as the government deadline for testing 100,000 people per day looks like passing without the target being reached.

Under that scheme, people are referred for help by their GPs. In some cases, volunteers have called the person \u201cin need\u201d and they have no idea why they are being contacted. Mutual aid networks, in comparison, work almost street by street, with most doors have had a flyer offering help pushed through the letterbox. These networks are also not hamstrung by concerns about data protection and privacy regulations or worries about insurance.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/30/sitting-at-home-seems-wrong-coronavirus-volunteers-helping-the-nhs-a-photo-essay\">'Sitting at home seems wrong': NHS coronavirus volunteers \u2013 a photo essay</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5eaa57e48f0882b206dcfbe0\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-30T04:55:09.300Z\">5.55am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Dr Deborah Birx, the White House\u2019s coronavirus taskforce coordinator is known for her reassuring appearances at Donald Trump\u2019s erratic and often astonishing White House press briefings.<br></p> \n  <p>Most recently, a video of her face <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/26/coronavirus-birx-trump-disinfectant-remarks\">as the US president suggested injecting disinfectant </a>into human beings might cure coronavirus went viral.

  "<p>Fifa is preparing to press the authorities in Switzerland to prosecute Sepp Blatter for alleged corruption, after the Swiss attorney general dropped part of its investigation despite police reports listing years of apparent gifts and payments provided to the then <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/sep/29/jack-warner-banned-football-life-fifa-ethics-committee\">vice-president, Jack Warner</a>, in return for votes for Blatter in Fifa presidential elections. </p> <p>Senior Fifa officials are understood to be considering all options if the case against Blatter is discontinued, potentially including suing the attorney general\u2019s office for failing to prosecute.</p> <p>In two Swiss federal police reports seen by the Guardian, a conclusion is drawn that Warner wielded crucial votes to support Blatter and elect him Fifa president in 1998 and 2002 in return for \u201cpreferential treatment\u201d, including TV contracts for the 2010 and 2014 World Cups.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/apr/07/world-cup-likely-to-stay-in-qatar-despite-new-bribery-accusations-in-us\">World Cup likely to stay in Qatar despite new bribery accusations in US</a> </p> </aside>  <p>From 1990 to 2011 Warner was president of Concacaf \u2013 the Confederation of North, Central American and Caribbean Association Football \u2013 which had more than 40 countries as members and whose votes, invariably wielded as a bloc, were crucial in presidential elections.</p> <p>Blatter\u2019s tenure as president of Fifa, from his successful 1998 election campaign to his fall in 2015, was marked throughout by corruption allegations, which he denied, but efforts to oppose him, mostly marshalled by the Scandinavian countries\u2019 FAs, failed to garner sufficient votes.</p> <p>One police report states Warner and Concacaf had \u201calready been granted a financial advantage in May 1998\u201d a month before Blatter, previously the Fifa general-secretary, was elected president for the first time. The other report contains details of a 2005 contract signed by Blatter, granting the TV rights for the 2010 and 2014 World Cups to the Caribbean Football Union, of which Warner was also president.</p> <p>The report noted that a $14m payment from a broadcaster for the rights was diverted by means of a sub-agreement to a company owned by Warner. It states $3.78m was due back to Fifa under the terms of the agreement but the CFU never paid it and Fifa has never received it.</p> <p>\u201cOn the basis of the information at hand,\u201d the police report states in its conclusion, \u201ca link can be established between the preferential treatment of Warner and the Concacaf votes required for Blatter\u2019s election at the Fifa presidential elections in the years 1998 and 2002.\u201d</p> <p>In a statement the Swiss Office of the Attorney General confirmed it is ending one part of its investigation into Blatter for alleged \u201caggravated criminal mismanagement\u201d. This was opened in September 2015 as his presidency collapsed under multiple anti-corruption proceedings, mainly mounted by the US Department of Justice. The OAG said the concluded part relates to \u201cthe criminal investigation\u2019s facts and accusations regarding the contractual relationship with the Caribbean Football Union\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/dec/11/fifa-prepares-to-sue-michel-platini-and-sepp-blatter-to-get-15m-back\">Fifa prepares to sue Sepp Blatter and Michel Platini to get \u00a31.5m back</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Although the OAG said it continues to pursue other areas of its investigation, officials at Fifa working under Gianni Infantino, who replaced Blatter in February 2016, are said to be intent on pressing the case. Fifa as an organisation is formally classed as a victim in the proceedings and is taking legal action for the return of any money found to have been illicitly paid out. Some unfavourable comparisons are being drawn between the lack of prosecutions in Switzerland five years since investigations began and multiple convictions secured by the US authorities.</p> <p>Blatter has not been charged by US authorities and maintains his innocence of any wrongdoing. His representative said he had no comment to make. Warner is indicted for multiple corruption offences in the US, which he rejects, and he is contesting extradition proceedings from his home island of Trinidad. He did not respond to an email from the Guardian about the contents of the Swiss police reports.</p> <p>A Fifa spokesperson said in an official statement: \u201cFifa will continue to cooperate with all law enforcement agencies, including those in Switzerland, in the hope and belief that all those responsible for causing harm to football will finally be held to account.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Justin Amash\u2019s announcement that he is exploring a run for president on the Libertarian party\u2019s ticket set off a firestorm of debate as to whether his candidacy helps or hurts Donald Trump\u2019s re-election prospects.</p> <p>With paranoia of potential \u201cspoiler\u201d effects running high, <a href=\"https://thebulwark.com/justin-amash-should-not-run-for-president-this-year/\">Never Trump Republicans worked hard to deter Amash from running </a>and upon his announcement, influencers in the movement like <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JRubinBlogger/status/1255509011031613449\">Jennifer Rubin</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BillKristol/status/1255484652208390152\">Bill Kristol</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RadioFreeTom/status/1255541955704041474\">Tom Nichols</a> immediately denounced his candidacy.</p> <p>Their wariness is well supported by polling data, which shows <a href=\"https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2020/president/us/general_election_trump_vs_biden-6247.html\">Biden\u2019s consistent lead over Trump in general election</a> head-to-head polling <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2020/04/27/biden-leads-trump-2020-amid-coronavirus-concerns/3029325001/\">narrows when an independent or third-party option is </a>included. It is important to recognize that voters respond to generic independent or third-party candidate cues from their own ideological frame of reference: a progressive probably pictures a progressive candidate, a conservative, a conservative one.</p> <p>It isn\u2019t until these choices solidify into actual candidates and are presented to voters in a context that includes named party nominees that \u201ctrue\u201d third-party or independent receptivity becomes clear. The \u201cpulling from both sides\u201d issue from generic ballots probably distorts the attractiveness of these types of candidates.</p> <p>Further complicating matters, current polling still reflects the contested and contentious Democratic party nomination process. It will take some time for Democrats to consolidate around their party\u2019s nominee in rates comparable to Republican consolidation around Trump, which averages 90%. The inclusive head-to-head ballot test as well as <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/30/us/politics/trump-biden-enthusiasm-gap.html\">nominee enthusiasm</a> are still reflecting after-effects from the primary.</p> <p>We also know that as the election cycle swings into action and campaign activity kicks in, some voters previously open to third-party candidates \u201ccome home\u201d\u2013 which is why <a href=\"https://ropercenter.cornell.edu/blog/none-above-polling-and-third-party-candidates\">third-party candidates tend to underperform their polled vote shares</a>. The \u201ccoming home\u201d effect also affects independents, <a href=\"https://www.people-press.org/2019/03/14/political-independents-who-they-are-what-they-think/\">most of whom are \u201cleaners</a>\u201d, voters who initially say they\u2019re independent, but when prompted with a follow-up question asking whether they are more closely aligned to one party or the other, admit to having a party preference. These voters almost always end up voting for the candidate of the party they lean towards, which is why it is possible that Biden\u2019s large advantages on the generic ballot until now may be inflated.</p> <p>In 2016, the Libertarian party pulled voters from both sides of the ideological spectrum.</p> <p>Johnson\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUSDIZTSDDg\">unabashed admission to pot use </a>endeared him to thousands of younger voters. But Amash holds policy positions that these voters may find unacceptable.

But Trump\u2019s opposition<strong> </strong>appears based on a thinly veiled political calculus: the fewer Americans who vote, the better the political prospects for the Republican party.</p> <p>\u201cThey had things, levels of voting, that if you\u2019d ever agreed to it, you\u2019d never have a Republican elected in this country again,\u201d the president <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/08/trump-mail-in-voting-2020-election\">said in March</a>, dismissing Democratic efforts to expand mail-in voting.</p> <p>That Republican estimation has been at the center of many of the hotly contested fights over voting rules in recent years. The party has generally favored restrictions on voting, such as voter ID, while Democrats have pushed to make it easier to cast a ballot.</p> <p>When it comes to vote by mail, however, the calculation is <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/10/us/politics/vote-by-mail.html\">unsupported by evidence</a>. Making it difficult to vote by mail could actually wind up hurting the Republican party.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s become an explosive issue because President Trump and some others at the top of Republican party, including [RNC chair] Ronna McDaniel, have made it an issue,\u201d said Rick Hasen, a law professor at the University of California, Irvine. \u201cThat puts Republicans in somewhat of a bind, because in many places in the country, vote by mail is a successful and safe way that Republicans get the vote out among their supporters.\u201d</p> <p>A Stanford study examining the switch to vote by mail in California, Washington and Utah found that it <a href=\"https://siepr.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/publications/20-015.pdf\">did not</a> benefit Democrats or Republicans, and only modestly increased turnout.

It was a staple of our strategy,\u201d said Mac Stipanovich, a retired Florida Republican political operative, said of past campaigns. \u201cRepublicans probably ought not to be complaining about it.\u201d</p> <p>Even as Republican operatives are seeking <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2020/04/28/2020-vote-by-mail-battle-heats-up-213920\">to scale up</a> their vote-by-mail operations, congressional Republicans have staunchly opposed efforts in coronavirus stimulus bills that would make it easier to vote. They dismissed plans to require states to automatically mail everyone a ballot, expand early voting and implement online voter registration. So far, the parties have agreed on allocating <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/25/us/coronavirus-voting-stimulus.html\">$400m</a> to states to help them prepare for elections, a fraction of the minimum $4bn <a href=\"https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/estimated-costs-covid-19-election-resiliency-measures\">experts say</a> is needed.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s really disappointing that our political leaders aren\u2019t all working to ensure that every eligible American is able to cast a ballot that will count,\u201d said Myrna P\u00e9rez, director of the voting rights and elections program at the Brennan Center for Justice. \u201cThere used to be a point in time where having free and fair access to the ballot was a bipartisan issue.\u201d</p> <p>Currently, <a href=\"https://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/all-mail-elections.aspx\">five US states</a> conduct their elections entirely by mail, while access to mail-in balloting varies widely in others. To run an election that relies heavily on vote by mail would require investing millions of dollars in ballots, staffing, new technology and messaging,<a href=\"https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/estimated-costs-covid-19-election-resiliency-measures\"> according to</a> the Brennan Center.</p> <p>In Orange county, California, switching to vote by mail took three or four years of planning and cost at least $3m, said Neal Kelley, the county\u2019s registrar of voters. In Washington state, it took five years to transition to an all vote-by-mail system. Most US election offices \u2013 some with just one or two full-time employees \u2013 do not have the resources to make this transition in time for November without support.</p> <p>\u201cThe clock is ticking,\u201d said Amber McReynolds, the chief executive of the National Vote at Home Institute and Coalition, which advocates for vote by mail.</p> <p>In recent weeks, Democrats and voting groups have filed a slew of lawsuits \u2013 taking aim at restrictive state laws that require voters to give an excuse to vote by mail or have an in-person witness for their ballots. Advocates also want states to pick up the cost of postage on mail-in ballots and registration forms, calling it an unconstitutional poll tax.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There used to be a point in time where having free and fair access to the ballot was a bipartisan issue</p> <footer> <cite>Myrna P\u00e9rez</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But Republicans in Texas, Wisconsin, New Mexico and Nevada have opposed these lawsuits.

Election offices were overwhelmed with absentee ballot requests, and some voters never received ballots at all. Turnout didn\u2019t drop as severely as many projected, but voters in Milwaukee were forced to wait hours in line to vote. At least 52 people<a href=\"https://apnews.com/b1503b5591c682530d1005e58ec8c267\"> have since tested positive for Covid-19.</a></p> <p>Without action, there could be similar consequences in November. There might be a delay in issuing ballots, and voters might get their ballots too late to vote, said Michael McDonald, a University of Florida political science professor. A nefarious actor could intentionally slow down the election process by making multiple ballot requests, forcing the election official to investigate (<a href=\"https://www.wbay.com/content/news/Green-Bay-City-Clerk-responds-to-spring-election-concerns--569845391.html\">one clerk</a> in Wisconsin reported a voter requested a ballot 11 times).</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re already seeing failure in a low-turnout election. It\u2019s not gonna get any better in a high-turnout election,\u201d McDonald said.</p> <p>More voting by mail will also slow down reporting of election results, since election officials would have to count ballots coming in after election night. This could leave room for a candidate to question the legitimacy of the results.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m concerned not only that a delay in reporting results will leave room for people to claim fraud, but also potentially for a candidate who\u2019s ahead in an early count to claim victory while the votes may shift as additional votes are counted,\u201d Hasen said.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/23/coronavirus-fight-to-vote-us-voters\">'We can\u2019t afford to wait': coronavirus could shut out droves of new US voters</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Breaking from Trump, some Republican officials have embraced vote by mail, though modestly.

Before Branch\u2019s federal appellate confirmation, she was a judge on Georgia\u2019s court of appeals, her 11th circuit biography <a href=\"http://www.ca11.uscourts.gov/judges/hon-elizabeth-l-branch\">says.</a></p> <h2><strong>John K Bush</strong></h2> <h2><strong>Sixth </strong><strong>circuit </strong><strong>court of </strong><strong>appeals</strong></h2> <ul> <li><p><strong>Eastern and </strong><strong>western </strong><strong>districts of Kentucky; </strong><strong>eastern and </strong><strong>western </strong><strong>districts of Michigan; </strong><strong>northern and </strong><strong>southern </strong><strong>districts of Ohio; </strong><strong>eastern, </strong><strong>middle</strong><strong> and </strong><strong>western </strong><strong>districts of Tennessee.</strong></p></li> </ul> <p>Since ascending to the appellate bench, Bush\u2019s decisions have indicated a pattern with the potential to undermine oversight and civil rights, progressive court-watchers contend. Bush, 55, and Judge Joan Larsen, who is also a Trump appointee, upheld the dismissal of a lawsuit that involved an airline employee who was terminated after complaining to company higher-ups about safety concerns involving her supervisor.</p> <p>The former employee, a technical writer whose work involved operations and maintenance manuals for pilots, claimed that she was protected from the firing despite being an \u201cat will\u201d worker. She cited an Ohio law that prohibits firing people if doing so is in violation of public policy. She contended that she was protected under this law, arguing that public safety was public policy, says PFAW.</p> <p>In his January opinion, Bush wrote that she \u201cfailed to provide clear notice \u2026 that she was invoking a governmental policy in her complaints\u201d, meaning her \u201cdismissal did not jeopardize any public policy, and the facts of her case do not trigger Ohio\u2019s public-policy exception to the at-will employment doctrine\u201d.</p> <p>In July, Bush voted to affirm the dismissal without trial of a free speech case. In that lawsuit, protesters had claimed that they were wrongfully arrested while trying to protest against the Kentucky Farm Bureau for alleged discriminatory policies.</p> <p>\u201cBush is one of the earliest judges that was put on the court by Trump and therefore he has one of the longest records \u2013 and his record is broad and deep and bad in a wide variety of cases,\u201d Mincberg said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to find a single area where Bush hasn\u2019t written a decision, or dissent, that would take the law backwards.\u201d</p> <p>Before Bush\u2019s confirmation, Buzzfeed <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/zoetillman/one-of-trumps-judicial-nominees-blogged-under-a-pen-name#.yf0mEWZK5\">reported</a> that he had likened abortion to slavery in a pseudonymous blogpost, writing that they were the \u201ctwo greatest tragedies in our country\u201d.

  "<p>Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, is facing growing pressure to publicly address an allegation of sexual assault made by Tara Reade, a former aide to his Senate office. <br><br>The former vice-president has remained silent about the accusation, a position that is seen as increasingly untenable in the wake of new reporting.

Now Democrats, who widely embraced the \u201cbelieve women\u201d ethos of the #MeToo movement, are grappling with how to respond.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/24/joe-biden-sexual-assault-claim-tara-reade-deserves-to-be-heard-katie-halper\">Tara Reade says Joe Biden sexually assaulted her. She deserves to be heard | Katie Halper</a> </p> </aside>  <p>On Wednesday, the New York Times reported that women\u2019s rights activists are quietly pushing Biden to break his silence, urging him to make a statement before the end of April, which is Sexual Assault Awareness Month. According to the Times, some of the women\u2019s groups involved <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/29/us/politics/tara-reade-joe-biden.html\">drafted</a> a public letter that they have not released, which praises Biden\u2019s work as an \u201coutspoken champion for survivors of sexual violence\u201d while encouraging him to \u201cmodel how to take serious allegations seriously\u201d.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/biden-himself-should-address-the-tara-reade-allegations-and-release-relevant-records/2020/04/29/55a36694-8a45-11ea-9dfd-990f9dcc71fc_story.html?itid=sf_opinions-the-posts-view\">An editorial in the Washington Post</a> called on Biden to address the claims against him and release any records related to Reade\u2019s employment, including any complaints she may have filed while working in his office.</p> <p>\u201cTara Reade deserves to be heard, and voters deserve to hear her,\u201d the paper\u2019s editorial board wrote on Wednesday. \u201cThey deserve to hear from Joe Biden, too.\u201d</p> <p>Reade was one of eight women who came forward <a href=\"https://www.thecut.com/2020/04/joe-biden-accuser-accusations-allegations.html\">last year</a> with stories involving unwanted touching or displays of affection by Biden.

She told the paper that she was asked to serve drinks at an event because Biden liked her legs and, when she refused, was sidelined and eventually pushed out of his employ. </p> <p>A year later, in an interview with the leftwing podcast commentator Katie Halper, Reade alleged that Biden had pinned her against a wall and digitally penetrated her in the basement of a Capitol Hill office in the spring of 1993. She said she had not come forward with the allegation sooner because she was scared of the backlash and was still grappling with what had happened to her.</p> <p>Reade said she filed a report in the Senate and claims she was forced out of his office after complaining to her supervisors, a charge disputed by several former Biden aides but corroborated in part by people she said she told at the time and in the years after.</p> <p>In an interview this week with the conservative website the Daily Caller, Reade called on Biden to release any documents related to her employment.

The second woman, Lorraine Sanchez, said Reade had told her that she had been sexually harassed by her former boss while working in Washington DC.</p> <p>Last week, <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2020/04/24/new-evidence-tara-reade-joe-biden/\">the Intercept published</a> the transcript of a 1993 call to Larry King\u2019s CNN talkshow featuring a woman from California inquiring vaguely about what her daughter could do about the \u201cproblems\u201d she encountered while working in the office of a \u201cprominent senator\u201d.

The group wants to force the state to immediately remove voters it suspects have moved from the voter rolls.

But now that the election had passed, Kelly said he saw no ethical obstacle preventing him from hearing the case. \u201cIn light of the fact that this case cannot now affect any election in which I would be a candidate while the case is being decided, there is no ethical bar to my participation in the consideration of the petition for review or the merits of the case if the petition for review is granted,\u201d Kelly wrote in a Wednesday order. Karofsky\u2019s 10-year term begins on 1 August, and she will narrow the conservative majority on the court from 5-2 to 4-3.</p> \n  <p>Stephen Gillers, a law professor at NYU and an expert on judicial ethics, said he did not see anything improper in Kelly\u2019s decision. \u201cIt is rare but not unheard of for a judge who recuses to unrecuse,\u201d he wrote in an email. \u201cJudge Kelly is still a judge and the matter is before his court.

Before it was blocked by a lower court in 2016, it prevented around 30,000 people from registering to vote. </p> \n  <p><strong>Kris Kobach</strong>, the former Kansas secretary of state nationally known for his anti-immigrant views and support of voting restrictions, championed the measure, saying it was necessary to prevent non-citizens from registering to vote in his state.

The court noted that \u201cat most\u201d 39 non-citizens had registered to vote in Kansas over the last 19 years. Many of those cases, the court be explained by administrative error, and did not justify the burden placed on 30,000 voters. </p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/rickhasen/status/1255520426798862339\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Whoa!

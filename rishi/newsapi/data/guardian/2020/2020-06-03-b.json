  "<p>Texas Democrats plan to use Zoom to create an army of voter registration volunteers, a novel approach to work around the state\u2019s severe restrictions on voter registration during the Covid-19 pandemic. The effort comes as voter registration efforts, both in Texas and around the US have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/23/coronavirus-fight-to-vote-us-voters\">effectively stalled</a> just months before the presidential election.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/01/trump-mail-in-voting-election-2020-election-attacks\">\u2018It could have a chilling effect\u2019: why Trump is ramping up attacks on mail-in voting</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Texas makes it <a href=\"https://www.thenation.com/article/archive/texass-voter-registration-laws-are-straight-out-of-the-jim-crow-playbook/\">extremely difficult </a>to conduct voter registration drives, even outside of the pandemic. The state requires anyone who wants to do so to become a <a href=\"https://www.sos.state.tx.us/elections/pamphlets/deputy.shtml\">volunteer deputy registrar</a>, a process that requires going to a county-run training. Only Texas residents who are eligible to vote in the state can get the certification. Texas has 254 counties, but someone can only legally register voters in the county in which they are deputized and their certification expires at the end of every even-numbered year.&nbsp;</p> <p><a href=\"https://nationalvoterregistrationday.org/toolkit-for-individuals/rules-for-voter-registration-drives/\">Some states</a> place no restrictions on voter registration drives at all, while others have more modest ones in place like requiring groups to register with the state before they begin their drive. Civil rights groups have long called the Texas requirement a form of voter suppression. </p> <p>\u201cTexas has some of the strictest voter registration laws in the country,\u201d said Beth Stevens, voting rights legal director at the Texas Civil Rights Project. \u201cIn Texas, volunteer deputy registrars can be criminally prosecuted for what most of us would consider administrative errors while they\u2019re registering people.\u201d</p> <p>Working around the state\u2019s barriers, the Texas Democratic party plans to partner with a local election official in Travis county to conduct a mass deputization during its virtual state convention this week. More than 2,000 people have already signed up for the training on Saturday, which will allow the party to get an unprecedented number of people certified at once.</p> <p>\u201cThis is the party adapting and coming up with a creative solution to work around a legal framework that is absurd,\u201d said Luke Warford, director of voter expansion for the Texas Democratic party, which hopes to add at least 2 million new voters to the rolls this year.</p> <p>Bruce Elfant, who oversees voter registration in Travis county, home of Austin, will administer the session and certify those who attend. If a volunteer wants to register voters in another county, they have to take their certificate to their local election official, who can then officially deputize them.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if we\u2019ve ever done anything this big,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve certainly never done anything remote like this.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>He added that he made an offer to the state Republican party to conduct an identical training session during the party\u2019s convention in July, but has yet to hear back. James Dickey, the chairman of the Texas Republican party, said in a statement that the party was planning for a training for its convention in Houston in July and had already registered more than 89,000 new voters using a \u201cphone-and-mail based process that doesn\u2019t require deputy voter registrars.\u201d</p> <p>Elfant said voter registration had \u201cflatlined\u201d in his county. Under normal circumstances, the county would add a few thousand voters to its rolls each month. But in the last few months, his office had added just 500 total, he said. In Tarrant and<a href=\"https://www.hctax.net/Voter/Voter_Demographic/VoterVisualization\"> Harris</a> counties, two of the biggest in the state, officials said they have also seen similar dips in voter registration. </p> <p>Heider Garcia, the election administrator in Tarrant county, hypothesized the drop in voter registrations was because state motor vehicle licensing offices, usually a hub of voter registrations, have been closed. Advocacy groups have also been unable to conduct voter registration drives in person.</p> <p>The Democratic plan comes amid an increasingly bitter war over voting in the state, long a Republican stronghold which Democrats believe they can turn in their favor because of changing demographics. Democrats have brought a number of lawsuits challenging Texas\u2019s restrictions on mail-in voting. Nationally, Republicans are spending at least <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/18/republicans-devote-20m-and-50000-people-into-efforts-to-restrict-voting\">$20m on voting litigation</a> and want to recruit up to 50,000 volunteers to watch the polls in November.&nbsp;</p> <p>Texas does not allow people to register to vote online, a policy advocates say is making it nearly impossible to register to vote in the state during Covid-19. Texas Democrats are suing over that restriction and launched a website in April aiming to serve as workaround.</p> <p>Warford said that the mass deputization would put the party in a position to aggressively register people once it was safe to do so.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cWe now have a whole new group of people that are ready to hit the ground running registering voters,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s super smart strategically for us.\u201d</p>",

One of the helicopters had Red Cross markings and the show of force is being investigated by the national guard, according to the Washington Post. </p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-06-03T03:30:37.346Z\">at 4.30am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ed703518f08f5e373013753\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-03T02:04:20.190Z\">3.04am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Thousands of protesters have rallied peacefully outside of the White House</strong> on Tuesday evening, chanting \u201ckeep the peace\u201d as night grew dark. </p> \n  <p>The crowd grew thinner after 8pm, an hour after the capital\u2019s curfew had set in, but several hundred remained outside of the fence. </p> \n  <p>When one protester climbed a lamp post and removed a street sign he was roundly booed by others. \u201cIt\u2019s not what we\u2019re about,\u201d George \u201cTJ\u201d Pierce, one of the protesters in the park, told the Associated Press.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ab535496fb54b2db3763d6efa0d0fbb221c401d9\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ab535496fb54b2db3763d6efa0d0fbb221c401d9/0_110_3320_1993/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Demonstrators gather in front of a fence surrounding Lafayette Park outside the White House on Tuesday evening\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Demonstrators gather in front of a fence surrounding Lafayette Park outside the White House on Tuesday evening.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jonathan Ernst/Reuters</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"24a451d17b688d05c6f6926bad79bef907171e6e\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/24a451d17b688d05c6f6926bad79bef907171e6e/0_0_4500_2700/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Demonstrators near Lafayette park on Tuesday evening\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Demonstrators near Lafayette park on Tuesday evening.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Olivier Douliery/AFP/Getty Images</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fec67f5d1bd1c4954a288b69cda504f04bc76eda\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fec67f5d1bd1c4954a288b69cda504f04bc76eda/0_113_3396_2038/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Hundreds of demonstrators marching toward Lafayette Park and the White House\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hundreds of demonstrators marching toward Lafayette Park and the White House.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Drew Angerer/Getty Images</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-06-03T02:32:53.966Z\">at 3.32am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ed6ff4d8f084df971c8ea0e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/julianborger\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-03T01:53:24.973Z\">2.53am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Analysis: Trump has normalised mayhem and the US is paying the price</strong></p> \n  <p>The sheer tumult of the Trump era, the unceasing torrent of events that were unthinkable even hours before, has left a nation constantly off balance, unable to find its bearing and grasp how far it has traveled.</p> \n  <p>The developments of the past 24 hours were a reminder of how slippery the downward slope has been. </p> \n  <p>More than <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/series/100000-dead-in-the-us\">a hundred thousand Americans are dead from a pandemic</a> after the government\u2019s botched response; there are armoured cars and troops outside Washington metro stations; men in combat gear carrying sniper rifles were seen perched in the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Charles_Lister/status/1267815222619799552\">open door of a helicopter</a> flying low over the commercial district.

A century later, it\u2019s still failing</strong></p> \n  <p><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/carol-anderson\">Carol Anderson</a>, the Charles Howard Candler professor of African American Studies at Emory University and the author of White Rage: The Unspoken Truth of Our Racial Divide, writes for The Guardian: </em></p> \n  <p>In 1919, as soldiers returned from the first world war, many white Americans saw African American men in military uniforms for the first time. That sight, and the challenge it posed to the political, social and economic order, was deeply threatening to them. Groups of armed white men hunted down and slaughtered hundreds of black Americans across the country. The wave of lynchings and race riots came to be known as the <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books/about/Red_Summer.html?id=2ogt4871j3sC\">Red Summer</a>.</p> \n  <p>The black community did its best to fight back, without protection from the state. In some cases, police actively participated in the lynchings. The US attorney general, A Mitchell Palmer, claimed that leftwing radicals were behind the uprisings \u2013 a false charge and one that further endangered African American lives. Palmer worked for President Woodrow Wilson, an ardent segregationist who screened Birth of a Nation in the White House and <a href=\"https://www.laphamsquarterly.org/roundtable/hatred-endorsed-president\">praised</a> the Ku Klux Klan even as it deployed terrorism to keep blacks away from the voting booth. Wilson <a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/42977761,%20pages%20691-692\">had been silent</a> while whites slaughtered African Americans in <a href=\"https://www.riverfronttimes.com/newsblog/2017/06/28/first-hand-accounts-show-the-horror-of-east-louis-1917-race-riot\">East St Louis</a> in 1917, and he did little to nothing in 1919 when they again attacked and killed black people, this time on an even more horrific and grisly scale.</p> \n  <p>When African Americans fought back, when they protested, when they made clear they would not quietly accept the destruction of their lives, Palmer mobilized the power of the federal government to brand black unrest as the work of the enemy of the state \u2013 communists. It was his version of peace without justice. To do this he ignored the destructive and violent white supremacy that his president had helped unleash. He remained unconcerned about the bold, brazen killing of black people. And he had no qualms about a criminal justice system in which being black meant the presumption of guilt.<br></p> \n  <p>More than 100 years later, in the wake of the brutal, merciless killings of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/george-floyd\">George Floyd</a>, Ahmaud Arbery and Breonna Taylor \u2013 not to mention an incident in which a white woman attempted to put a black birdwatcher in the crosshairs of the NYPD \u2013 our current attorney general, Bill Barr, does not appear to see injustice.

  "<p>Shortly before midnight on 8 November 2016, Hillary Rodham Clinton dozed off in the bedroom of her Manhattan hotel. The presidential candidate was exhausted from the rigours of a bruising election campaign and rattled by a flurry of early results that suggested the verdict was far from a foregone conclusion. She closed her eyes as the slight favourite to become the US\u2019s first female president. She opened them to a nightmare and a world turned upside down.</p> <p>Clinton\u2019s shock loss to Donald Trump \u2013 the embodiment of chaos to her bastion of control \u2013 left so much destruction in its wake (a victory party mothballed, shell-shocked staffers out of work, 66m futile votes) that it was easy to overlook the small matter of 2,000 hours of behind-the-scenes campaign footage, shot in a spirit of cautious optimism but now left to languish. Clinton\u2019s office suggested cobbling it together as an official record, an insider\u2019s account of what went wrong. But&nbsp;film-maker Nanette Burstein recoiled when the idea was put to her. \u201cToo soon,\u201d she says now. \u201cToo raw. Too disturbing for the public. I know I wouldn\u2019t want to watch that myself, never mind make it.\u201d</p> <p>Instead, Burstein received clearance to use the footage for a bolder, more wide-ranging project. <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11558924/\">Hillary</a>, the result, is a four-part biography that frames Clinton\u2019s life against the arc of the women\u2019s movement and recasts her career as a series of giant leaps and bounds. Significantly, it ends not in despair but in hope. Clinton, insists longtime adviser Cheryl Mills, is so much more than another stumbling pretender to the throne. She\u2019s a mould-breaker and a risk-taker. \u201cThe tip of the spear \u2013 the person who blazes the trail.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"872dc41094b07e17540b8915eafe54a6ba296199\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/872dc41094b07e17540b8915eafe54a6ba296199/0_0_4693_3157/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Every question is a potential hazard\u2019 \u2026 Nanette Burstein with Hillary Clinton.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"673\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Every question is a potential hazard\u2019 \u2026 Nanette Burstein with Hillary Clinton.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Katie Jones/Variety/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>If this makes it sound as if Hillary comes to praise Clinton not bury her \u2013 well, that\u2019s broadly the case (\u201clargely flattering\u201d, remarked the Hollywood Reporter). Yes, the documentary is at pains to cover its subject\u2019s myriad missteps and controversies, be it the lucrative Wall Street speeches, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2000/sep/21/hillaryclinton\">Whitewater real estate investment affair</a> or the overcooked saga of her <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/oct/18/clinton-emails-investigation-ends-state-department\">private email server</a>. But the talking heads are effectively defence witnesses, solid representatives of blue state USA. We hear nothing from Newt Gingrich, Sean Hannity, Lindsey Graham, or indeed any of her tormentors from the other side.</p> <p>This, Burstein says, was not for want of trying. \u201cBut Hillary is so toxic in that community that any association is seen as bad. I made it clear that it was an objective film and that I wanted their point of view. But they also knew that she was participating, which meant that it wasn\u2019t going to be some rightwing take-down of her \u2013 and anything short of that was unappealing. There was no upside, it was just a risk. All of them right away said no.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWxXICBBwCw\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/lWxXICBBwCw?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWxXICBBwCw\">Watch a trailer for Hillary</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>In the event, the director spent a week at the Clintons\u2019 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/apr/09/hillary-clinton-new-york-chappaqua-primary-election\">home in </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/apr/09/hillary-clinton-new-york-chappaqua-primary-election\">Chappaqua</a>, a hamlet 30 miles north of New York City. She sat with Hillary for 35 hours of interviews, going back over her various \u2013 and often conflicting \u2013 incarnations as lawyer, first lady, senator and globe-trotting secretary of state. Perhaps most compellingly, she sat with Bill, who brokenly recalls his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/06/bill-clinton-monica-lewinsky-affair-anxiety\">cataclysmic affair with Monica Lewinsky</a>, likening himself to a weary boxer who grabs for something, anything, that might momentarily distract him from the fight. \u201cI\u2019m a totally different person now than I was 20 years ago,\u201d he insists \u2013 and the physical evidence would appear to bear him out. The former president, arguably the consummate politician of his age, now looks hollowed out, diminished and somehow older than his years.</p> <p>As for Hillary, who can say for certain? \u201cShe\u2019s not a confider,\u201d one friend needlessly points out. Instead, she sits ramrod straight in her book-lined sitting room, sipping coffee as make-up artists periodically dip in to attend to her hair. She\u2019s candid, impressive and radiates a certain blunt warmth. But on a personal level<strong>,</strong> she\u2019s as guarded as Fort Knox. Every question is a potential hazard. It needs to be quickly checked for tripwires and trapdoors.</p> <p>There is, of course, good reason for this. With the possible exception of Trump, no US politician inspires such fear and loathing. She\u2019s like a bespoke trigger for the red state white male. There they are \u2013 the MAGA army, the deplorables \u2013 burning her effigy at a rally in Kentucky and hollering \u201cIron my shirt!\u201d inside the town hall meet-and-greet. \u201cSmile!\u201d orders a shaven-head in camouflage pants as the candidate walks by \u2013 and, ever the pro, Clinton duly obliges.</p> <p>But it\u2019s small wonder that her smile is a firewall and her laugh flak. She\u2019s hemmed in on both sides, damned either way, regarded as an establishment neocon by the left and a radical feminist harpie by the right. Depressingly, these prejudices sometimes hop the fence: Clinton\u2019s decision to remain in her marriage only proved how weak she was, right up until the moment it proved that she was Lady Macbeth, a cold-blooded careerist. \u201cI\u2019m the most investigated innocent person in America,\u201d she snorts at the end of one interview session, when she perhaps believes herself to be off-mic.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"e58bfc60212ead11d490bfba0a4a341a8dcb455d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e58bfc60212ead11d490bfba0a4a341a8dcb455d/0_0_1100_619/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Firewall smile \u2026 Hillary with Bill in the early days.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"563\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Firewall smile \u2026 Hillary with Bill in the early days.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sundance film festival</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Burstein previously co-directed The Kid Stays in the Picture, a spry documentary about the Hollywood producer Robert Evans. She freely admits to being a Clinton supporter and feels that most of her problems were caused by forces beyond her control, a reflexive sexism in the land at large. But Burstein does believe that, occasionally, Clinton could have handled herself better. Maybe relaxed her defensive lawyerly crouch, or eased back on the well-paid corporate speaking gigs \u2013 for the sake of her public image, if nothing else.&nbsp;</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The more you get used to seeing women in positions of power, the more likely you are to vote for it</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cIf she has a flaw \u2013 and she has a few \u2013 it\u2019s the optics. Maybe she\u2019s not in the pocket of Wall Street, but to give speeches at a time when the banks are being bailed out, all the while knowing she\u2019s going to run for president \u2013 it looks bad. And she has this self-righteous quality that is her blind spot. She thinks, \u2018Well, I\u2019m not doing anything wrong, no one should think I\u2019m doing anything wrong, so who cares what it looks like?\u2019 And that\u2019s what gets her into trouble again and again.\u201d</p> <p>Bill, no doubt about it, was more adept at rolling with the punches, charming his way out of trouble, while Barack Obama\u2019s special power was rising nobly above the fray. But it\u2019s a fools\u2019 game to use past giants as a kind of roadmap to the White House. Both men (each pioneers in their way) still had to contend with a different set of hurdles to those faced by Hillary. And both, finally, could afford to be looser, less apologetic and more at ease with who they are.</p> <p>\u201cGreatness of spirit is the most important quality that a politician can have,\u201d says Joe Klein, one-time Time magazine columnist and bestselling author of Primary Colors, a loosely fictionalised novel about Bill\u2019s 1992 presidential campaign. \u201cThe successful Democrats \u2013 Franklin Roosevelt, Harry Truman, John F Kennedy, Bill Clinton, Barack Obama \u2013 have all had it. To have greatness of spirit, you have to be optimistic and you have to at least give the appearance of openness.\u201d Hillary, he concludes, \u201cwas never going to be that\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"636c89f4a3f7932bd694bb9aa9eae343dc264ba2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/636c89f4a3f7932bd694bb9aa9eae343dc264ba2/0_86_2048_1434/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Above the fray \u2026 Clinton with Barack Obama.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"700\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Above the fray \u2026 Clinton with Barack Obama.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Barbara Kinney/Hulu</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Burstein, thank heavens, spies the obvious problem with this. \u201cIt\u2019s a very male thing to say. I mean, OK, maybe there\u2019s some truth to the idea that it\u2019s hard to pick a woman who has the kind of charm or the greatness of spirit that you see in a man. But is that because it doesn\u2019t exist? Or is it because it comes in a different package that we don\u2019t know how to recognise?\u201d</p> <p>Undeniably, Hillary offered a different package to the one presented by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\">Donald Trump</a>, the bait-and-switch conman who now sits in the Oval Office, presiding over a 100,000 Covid-19 death toll and an economy in the toilet. For all that, Burstein chooses to end her series not in the ash and rubble of November 2016, but amid the green shoots that have sprung up since. She spotlights the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/mar/06/somethings-happening-how-the-womens-march-inspired-a-new-era-of-resistance\">5 million-strong Women\u2019s March</a> that followed the inauguration, the 2018 midterms that turned the lower house blue and the vibrant attempts of Elizabeth Warren and Kamala Harris to run for president. Obviously, it would have been heartening if one had secured the Democratic nomination. But can\u2019t narrow defeats and near misses be markers of progress, too?</p> <p>\u201cWell, yeah,\u201d Burstein says. \u201cBecause change happens incrementally. The fact that all those women ran for president in and of itself is a triumph. What happened in the midterm elections \u2013 that\u2019s a triumph as well. Because this is how it works. The more you see it happening, the more you get used to it. And the more you get used to seeing women in positions of power, the more likely you are to one day vote for it.\u201d</p> <p>Clinton forged the path. Many others now walk it. Two steps forward, one step back.</p> <p>\u2022 Hillary is on Sky Documentaries and Now TV from 11 June.</p>",

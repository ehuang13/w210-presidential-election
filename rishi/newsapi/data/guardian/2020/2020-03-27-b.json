Ahead of the meeting, France, Italy and Spain and six other member states, called for \u201ca common debt instrument\u201d \u2013 in other words, a eurozone bond to raise funds for all member states.

In a nationally televised address Tuesday night, he urged governors to limit isolation only to high-risk people and lift the strict anti-virus measures they have imposed in their regions. <br><br>\u201cWhat needs to be done? Put the people to work. Preserve the elderly, preserve those who have health problems. But nothing more than that,\u201d said Bolsonaro, who in the past has sparked anger by calling the virus a \u201clittle flu\u201d. <br><br>The country\u2019s governors protested on Wednesday that his instructions run counter to health experts\u2019 recommendations and endanger Latin Americas largest population. <br><br>They said they would continue with their strict measures. The rebellion even included traditional allies of Brazil\u2019s far-right president. <br></p> \n  <p>Gov. Carlos Mois\u00e9s of Santa Catarina state, which gave almost 80% of its votes to Bolsonaro in the 2018 presidential runoff, complained he was blown away by the presidents instructions. <br><br>In a videoconference earlier in the day between Bolsonaro and governors from Brazil\u2019s southeast region, Sao Paulo Gov. Jo\u00e3o Doria threatened to sue the federal government if it tried to interfere with his efforts to combat the virus.<br><br>The governors weren\u2019t the only defiant ones. Virus plans challenged by Bolsonaro were upheld by the Supreme Court. The heads of both congressional houses criticized his televised speech. Companies donated supplies to state anti-virus efforts.<br><br>Bolsonaro told reporters in the capital, Brasilia, that he has listened to his US counterpart, Donald Trump, and found their perspectives to be rather similar.<br></p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e7c3ef48f08af215f6fb713\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time

The plan also provides $130bn to hospitals, and expands unemployment insurance.</p> \n  <p><strong>Senators overwhelmingly voted to pass the legislation, approving it 96-0.</strong></p> \n  <p>The House is expected to vote on the bill on Friday. \u201cWe are working to ensure that those who are unable to return to Washington will be able to express their views on this legislation remotely,\u201d said the House leader Steny Hoyer in a statement.</p> \n  <p>Lawmakers scrambled on Wednesday to smooth over snags as they rushed to pass the legislation, which provides direct payments to American families, and loans and grants to businesses.

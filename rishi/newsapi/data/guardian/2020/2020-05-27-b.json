  "<p><em>This story was reported in collaboration with OpenSecrets.</em></p> <p>A powerful new conservative organization fighting to restrict voting in the 2020 presidential election is really just a rebranded group that is part of a dark money network already helping Donald Trump\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/28/donald-trump-judges-create-new-conservative-america-republicans?CMP=series_embed_box\">unprecedented effort </a>to remake the US federal judiciary, the Guardian and OpenSecrets reveal.</p> <p>The organization, which calls itself the <a href=\"https://www.honestelections.org/\">Honest Elections Project</a>, seemed to emerge out of nowhere a few months ago and started stoking fears about voter fraud. Backed by a dark money group funded by rightwing stalwarts like the Koch brothers and Betsy DeVos\u2019 family, the Honest Elections Project is part of the network that pushed the US supreme court picks Brett Kavanaugh and Neil Gorsuch, and is quickly becoming a juggernaut in the escalating fight over voting rights.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/18/republicans-devote-20m-and-50000-people-into-efforts-to-restrict-voting\">Republicans devote $20m and 50,000 people to efforts to restrict voting</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The project announced it was spending $250,000 in <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/meet-the-press/blog/meet-press-blog-latest-news-analysis-data-driving-political-discussion-n988541/ncrd1182726#blogHeader\">advertisements </a>in April, warning against voting by mail and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0gFW4sb1lps&amp;feature=youtu.be\">accusing Democrats of cheating</a>. It facilitated letters to election officials in <a href=\"https://www.honestelections.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Colorado-Pre-litigation-Notice.pdf\">Colorado</a>, <a href=\"https://www.honestelections.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Florida-Pre-litigation-Notice.pdf\">Florida</a> and <a href=\"https://www.honestelections.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Michigan-Pre-litigation-Notice.pdf\">Michigan</a>, using <a href=\"https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/analysis-opinion/calls-more-purges-rest-shaky-data\">misleading data</a> to accuse jurisdictions of having bloated voter rolls and threatening legal action.</p> <p>Calling voter suppression a \u201c<a href=\"https://www.honestelections.org/the-voter-suppression-myth/\">myth</a>\u201d, it has also been extremely active in the courts, filing briefs in favor of voting restrictions in <a href=\"https://www.honestelections.org/the-honest-elections-project-filed-a-brief-in-state-court-defending-nevadas-duly-enacted-election-laws/\">Nevada</a>,<a href=\"https://www.honestelections.org/honest-elections-project-files-brief-in-virginia-on-witness-requirements-for-absentee-ballots/\"> Virginia</a>, <a href=\"https://www.honestelections.org/honest-elections-project-files-brief-in-texas-on-straight-ticket-voting/\">Texas</a>, <a href=\"https://www.honestelections.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/HEP-Amicus-Brief-2020-03-30-17_55_45.pdf\">Wisconsin</a> and <a href=\"https://www.honestelections.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/50_HEP-Amicus-Br-2020-03-26-19_13_01.pdf\">Minnesota</a>, among other places, at times represented by lawyers from the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/legal-issues/coming-to-trumps-defense-an-unconventional-lawyer-for-an-unconventional-president/2019/08/21/f877214a-9382-11e9-aadb-74e6b2b46f6a_story.html\">same firm</a> that represents Trump. By having a hand in both voting litigation and the judges on the federal bench, this network could create a system where conservative donors have an avenue to both oppose voting rights and appoint judges to back that effort.</p> <p>Despite appearing to be a free-standing new operation, the Honest Elections Project is just a legal alias for the Judicial Education Project, a well-financed nonprofit connected to a powerful network of dark money conservative groups, according to business records reviewed by the Guardian and OpenSecrets.</p> <p>\u201cThese are really well-funded groups that in the context of judicial nominations have been systematically, over the long term but also the short term, kind of pushing an agenda to pack the courts with pretty extreme right wing nominees,\u201d said Vanita Gupta, the president and CEO of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights. \u201cThe infrastructure that they\u2019ve built over the years has been a really important vehicle for them to do this.\u201d</p> <p>For nearly a decade, the organization has been almost entirely funded by DonorsTrust, known as a <a href=\"https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2013/12/donors-trust-franklin-center-alec-mercatus-center-dark-money/\">\u201cdark money ATM\u201d</a> backed by the Koch network and other prominent conservative donors, according to data tracked by OpenSecrets. In 2018, more than 99% of the Judicial Education Project\u2019s funding came from a single $7.8m donation from DonorsTrust.</p> <p>The Judicial Education Project is also closely linked to <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2019/investigations/leonard-leo-federalists-society-courts/\">Leonard Leo</a>, one of the most powerful people in Washington who has shaped Donald Trump\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/28/donald-trump-judges-create-new-conservative-america-republicans\">unprecedented effort to remake</a> the federal judiciary with conservative judges.</p> <p>The organization has deftly hidden the changes to its name from public view. In December, the Judicial Education Project formally <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6889358-Articles-of-Amedment-Judicial-Education-Project.html\">changed</a> its legal name to The 85 Fund, a group Leo backed to funnel \u201ctens of millions\u201d of dollars into conservative causes, <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/leonard-leo-crc-advisors-federalist-society-50d4d844-19a3-4eab-af2b-7b74f1617d1c.html\">according to Axios</a>. The Honest Elections Project is merely a <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6889355-The-85-Fund-Fictious-Name-Certificate-Honest.html\">fictitious name</a> \u2013 an alias \u2013 the fund legally adopted in February. The change was nearly indiscernible because The 85 Fund registered two other legal aliases on the same day, including <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6889356-The-85-Fund-Fictious-Name-Certificate-Judicial.html\">the Judicial Education Project</a>, its old name. The legal maneuver allows it to operate under four different names with little public disclosure that it is the same group.</p> <p>The Judicial Education Project is closely aligned with the Judicial Crisis Network, a group with unmatched influence in recent years in shaping the federal judiciary. The Judicial Crisis Network spearheaded the campaigns to get Gorsuch and Kavanaugh confirmed to the US supreme court, <a href=\"https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/analysis-opinion/conservative-group-behind-kavanaugh-confirmation-has-spent-years\">spending millions of dollars</a> in each instance. It has also spent significantly on critical state supreme court races across the country.</p> <p>There is a lot of overlap between the Honest Elections Project and the Judicial Crisis Network. Both groups share personnel, including Carrie Severino, the influential president of the Judicial Crisis Network. Both groups have been funded by The Wellspring Committee, a group Leo raised money for until it shut down in 2018. Both have also paid money to <a href=\"https://www.opensecrets.org/news/2018/11/trump-inauguration-money-links-secretive-dark-money/\">BH Group</a>, an LLC Leo once disclosed as his employer, that made a $1m mystery donation to Trump\u2019s inauguration.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ae693cf67675a1e7ab104313c04a22ed122393ff\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ae693cf67675a1e7ab104313c04a22ed122393ff/0_0_6000_4000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Honest Elections Project is part of the network that pushed the US supreme court picks Brett Kavanaugh and Neil Gorsuch.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Honest Elections Project is part of the network that pushed the US supreme court picks Brett Kavanaugh and Neil Gorsuch.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Doug Mills/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThis is a small community that is really trying to push forward these more suppressive tactics that will be challenged in court and having those judges on the bench, they\u2019re really hoping it\u2019s going to continue to rig the system in their favor,\u201d said Lena Zwarensteyn, who closely follows judicial nominations at the Leadership Conference. \u201cBy changing the rules of the game and who the referees are, they\u2019re trying to change the landscape.\u201d</p> <p>Neither the Honest Elections Project nor the Judicial Crisis Network responded to requests for an interview.</p> <p>The Honest Elections Project has become active as Republicans are scaling up their efforts to fight to keep voting restrictions in place ahead of the election. The Republican National Committee will spend at least <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/18/republicans-devote-20m-and-50000-people-into-efforts-to-restrict-voting\">$20m on litigation</a> over voting rights and wants to recruit up to 50,000 people to help monitor the polls and other election activities.</p> <p>Gupta said seeing a group that has been extremely successful in pushing judicial confirmations turn its attention to voting rights was alarming.</p> <p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t any surprise to those of us that do work in both of these spaces that our opponents [who] want to constrict access to voting, access to the courts, who are seeking an anti-inclusive, anti-civil rights agenda are one in the same,\u201d she said.</p>",

They recently came to public attention when Biden was accused by Tara Reade, a former staffer, of sexually assaulting her in a Capitol Hill basement in 1993.</p> <p>While vehemently denying that allegation in a TV interview on 1 May, the former vice-president simultaneously acknowledged the explosive potential of the archive\u2019s many other contents.</p> <p>\u201cThe fact is that there\u2019s a lot of things, of speeches I\u2019ve made, positions I\u2019ve taken, interviews that I did overseas with people, all of those things relating to my job, and the idea that they would all be made public in the fact while I was running for public office, they could be really taken out of context,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/01/us/politics/joe-biden-tara-reade-msnbc.html\">he told interviewer Mika Brzezinski</a> on MSNBC\u2019s Morning Joe program.</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019re papers or position papers, they are documents that existed and that \u2013 for example, when I met with [Vladimir] Putin or when I met with whomever, and all of that could be fodder in a campaign at this time.\u201d</p> <p>Biden, 77, also insisted that the collection does not contain personnel records, sending journalists on a wild goose chase through the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/04/joe-biden-tara-reade-senate-records-reject-request\">National Archives and Senate</a> in search of evidence of a complaint filed by Reade at the time of the alleged incident. The trail went cold, but the University of Delaware treasure trove remains tantalizing.</p> <p>Last week the Republican National Committee <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/rnc-ad-targets-university-of-delaware-records-amid-allegations-against-biden?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=pu_48&amp;utm_campaign=20200519_124569_&amp;utm_content=\">launched a digital advertising campaign</a>, raising questions about whether the university is keeping documents under seal related to the Reade allegation. One of the ads alleges: \u201cUniversity of Delaware is complicit in sexual assault cover-up.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.judicialwatch.org/\">Judicial Watch,</a> a rightwing activist group, is taking legal advice on whether it has grounds to take the university to court for access to the records. Its president, Tom Fitton, said on Thursday: \u201cIf we find that the documents are being withheld from us contrary to law, we are prepared to sue.\u201d</p> <p>Biden\u2019s defenders argue he is merely following precedent: past senators who ran for president have not been required to disclose all their papers. But Fitton contended: \u201cIt\u2019s not that they\u2019re being required; the question is whether the records are available under law. If he had them at his house, maybe there\u2019s an argument, but they\u2019re not at his house. They\u2019re at a university and subject to Foia [Freedom of Information Act].\u201d</p> <p>Biden\u2019s records were donated to the University of Delaware in 2012. The university did not respond to questions for this article but Andrea Boyle, a spokeswoman, <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/30/politics/biden-senate-papers/index.html\">told CNN</a> earlier this month that it is still \u201ccurating the collection\u201d, a process likely to continue well into 2021, and the papers will not be released until two years after Biden retires from public life.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It sets up the Republican line perfectly, which is, \u2018What\u2019s he hiding? How come he won\u2019t show us?\u2019</p> <footer> <cite>Larry Sabato</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>That is unlikely to deter newspaper editors sensing that Biden, first elected to the Senate in 1972 at the age 29, is likely to have skeletons in the closet. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/mar/15/joe-biden-democrats-trump-2020-president\">His long political career</a> includes the 1991 confirmation hearings for supreme court justice Clarence Thomas, accused of sexual harassment, as well as his support for a 1994 crime law that contributed to mass incarceration. Then there was his 2003 vote authorizing the invasion of Iraq, which he has since said he regrets.</p> <p>Furthermore, critics on the progressive wing of the Democratic party would be eager to scrutinize Biden\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/31/us/politics/banking-ties-could-hurt-joe-biden-in-race-with-populist-overtone.html\">links to the financial services industry,</a> a big player in Delaware. Conservatives might hunt for documents linking Biden\u2019s son, Hunter, to overseas business interests. In a replay of the 2016 campaign, when he encouraged Russia to hack Clinton\u2019s emails, Donald Trump may welcome a chance to make mischief by demanding \u201ctransparency\u201d.</p> <p>Larry Sabato, director of the <a href=\"http://centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/\">Center for Politics at the University of Virginia,</a> said: \u201cHis papers are much more voluminous than Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails, so I would expect there would be even more stories. Republicans are going to say, \u2018You just know there\u2019s some interesting material at the University of Delaware\u2019. No, there really isn\u2019t, but they know it\u2019s a safe thing to say because it can\u2019t be disproven before the election.\u201d</p> <p>There are practical objections, Sabato added, but Republicans will seek to turn those to their advantage. \u201cFirst of all, you couldn\u2019t publish it all or even open it all. He had an incredibly long career, a 50-year political career, and there are some personal items in there as well, from what I understand. How could you even manage to make it available to researchers, much less the general public, just a few months ahead of an election? It\u2019s not going to happen.</p> <p>\u201cTherefore, it sets up the Republican line perfectly, which is, \u2018What\u2019s he hiding? How come he won\u2019t show us?\u2019 No one out there is going to going to say, \u2018Well, of course, it\u2019s an enormous amount of material and why would he and most of it\u2019s junk,\u2019 which is true, by the way .\u201d</p> <p>Other presidential candidates have faced similar pressures. <a href=\"https://www.mullings.com/\">Rich Galen,</a> a campaign strategist for actor and former Republican senator Fred Thompson\u2019s unsuccessful 2008 bid, recalled: \u201cHis papers from the Senate were at the University of Tennessee and his opponents kept quacking about the fact that we had locked them up, literally, because we didn\u2019t want to go through every morning having some 12-year-old take five words out of a 300-word essay and have to defend it all day.</p> <p>\u201cSo we just said to hell with you, if that\u2019s what the fight is going to be about, then the fight will be about not getting access to the papers as opposed to what\u2019s in the papers. And it\u2019s a little hard to make the case that Biden won\u2019t give up the papers at the University of Delaware while Trump has been in federal court for 27 years to protect his financial records.\u201d</p>",

The death toll stands at 346,700. True death tolls and cases are likely to be significantly higher due to differing definitions and testing rates, delays and suspected underreporting.</li> \n   <li><strong>WHO warns of \u2018second peak\u2019 in areas where Covid-19 is declining. </strong>Countries where coronavirus infections are declining could still face an \u201cimmediate second peak\u201d if they let up too soon on measures to contain the outbreak, the World Health Organization said on Monday. The WHO emergencies chief, Dr Mike Ryan, told an online briefing: \u201cWe cannot make assumptions that just because the disease is on the way down now it is going to keep going down and we are get a number of months to get ready for a second wave. We may get a second peak in this wave.\u201d</li> \n   <li><strong>The UN refugee agency said Covid-19 had pushed its humanitarian work to near \u201cbreaking point\u201d in Yemen, a country devastated by five years of war</strong>. It <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/may/26/coronavirus-live-news-covid-19-uupdates-who-drops-hydroxychloroquine-trial-as-mexico-death-toll-questioned?page=with:block-5eccf3f38f08a1782fa81a50#block-5eccf3f38f08a1782fa81a50\">said</a> a growing number of families were resorting to begging, child labour and marrying of children to survive. A separate UN agency said it had only received around 15% of the funding required for the $3.38bn (\u20ac3bn) aid package for Yemen this year.</li> \n   <li><strong>Mexico City records thousands more deaths than usual, amid doubt over official Covid-19 toll. </strong>This year, Mexico City has issued <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/26/mexico-city-records-thousands-more-deaths-than-usual-amid-doubt-over-official-covid-19-toll\">8,072 more death certificates than the average</a> for the same period in the past four years, according to a study that suggests the country\u2019s coronavirus death toll could be significantly higher than the official figure of nearly 7,400. The report\u2019s authors found 37% more death certificates were issued in April 2020 than that month\u2019s average during the previous four years. By the end of May they estimated the number may grow to 120%.</li> \n   <li><strong>The UK death toll passed 47,000, according to new figures from the country\u2019s Office for National Statistics</strong>. This figure is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/may/26/coronavirus-live-news-covid-19-uupdates-who-drops-hydroxychloroquine-trial-as-mexico-death-toll-questioned?page=with:block-5ecce3d88f0886ce4f5da681#block-5ecce3d88f0886ce4f5da681\">higher</a> than the latest figure given by the UK government \u2013 nearly 37,000 \u2013 because it includes deaths in which Covid-19 is given as a \u201csuspected\u201d cause. The UK government figure only includes deaths of patients who have tested positive for the coronavirus.</li> \n   <li><strong>Russia reports record one-day rise in deaths. </strong>Russia has announced that 174 people with coronavirus have died in the past 24 hours, a record one-day amount that has pushed the nationwide death toll to 3,807. Officials reported 8,915 new cases, pushing its overall case tally to 362,342.</li> \n   <li><strong>White House brings forward Brazil travel restrictions by two days. </strong>The US has amended the timing of its Brazil travel ban to come into force at 11.59pm Washington time on Tuesday. It came as Brazil recorded a daily death toll higher than the US for the first time (807 versus 620). Brazil has the world\u2019s second highest number of infections. In its original announcement, the White House said the travel restrictions would come into force on 28 May.</li> \n   <li><strong>Dutch PM Mark Rutte did not visit dying mother due to Covid-19 restrictions. </strong>The Dutch prime minister, Mark Rutte, was unable to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/26/dutch-pm-mark-rutte-did-not-visit-dying-mother-due-to-covid-19-restrictions\">visit his dying mother</a> in her final weeks because he obeyed coronavirus restrictions against visiting care homes, his office has said. His mother did not die of Covid-19, although there had earlier been an outbreak of the disease in the home where she was living, Dutch media reported.</li> \n   <li><strong>UK PM\u2019s aid refuses to apologise or resign over lockdown breach. </strong>The British prime minister Boris Johnson\u2019s senior adviser, Dominic Cummings, has refused to apologise or resign for breaching lockdown rules. Cummings drove 264 miles from London to his parents\u2019 estate in Durham, despite suspecting that both he and his wife had coronavirus. Cummings <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/25/dominic-cummings-refuses-to-resign-or-apologise-for-lockdown-breach\">also admitted to having taken a second trip</a>, to a beauty spot 30 miles from Durham, which he claimed was necessary to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2020/may/25/dominic-cummings-says-he-drove-to-barnard-castle-to-test-his-eyesight-video\">check his eyesight</a> was good enough for the longer drive back to London.</li> \n   <li><strong>WHO suspends hydroxychloroquine trial. </strong>The World Health Organization has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/25/who-world-health-organization-hydroxychloroquine-trial-trump-coronavirus-safety-fears\">suspended testing the malaria drug hydroxychloroquine in Covid-19 patients</a> due to safety concerns.

See you all tomorrow!</p> \n  <p>My colleague Simon Burnton will take it from here. In the meantime, these are the main developments from the last few hours: </p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Confirmed cases worldwide near 5.5m. </strong>According to the Johns Hopkins University coronavirus tracker, infections worldwide number at least 5,495,061. The death toll stands at 346,232. True death tolls and cases are likely to be significantly higher due to differing definitions and testing rates, delays and suspected underreporting.</li> \n   <li><strong>WHO warns of \u2018second peak\u2019 in areas where Covid-19 is declining. </strong>Countries where coronavirus infections are declining could still face an \u201cimmediate second peak\u201d if they let up too soon on measures to contain the outbreak, the World Health Organization said on Monday. The WHO emergencies chief, Dr Mike Ryan, told an online briefing: \u201cWe cannot make assumptions that just because the disease is on the way down now it is going to keep going down and we are get a number of months to get ready for a second wave. We may get a second peak in this wave.\u201d</li> \n   <li><strong>Mexico City records thousands more deaths than usual, amid doubt over official Covid-19 toll. </strong>This year, Mexico City has issued <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/26/mexico-city-records-thousands-more-deaths-than-usual-amid-doubt-over-official-covid-19-toll\">8,072 more death certificates than the average</a> for the same period in the past four years, according to a study that suggests the country\u2019s coronavirus death toll could be significantly higher than the official figure of nearly 7,400. The report\u2019s authors found 37% more death certificates were issued in April 2020 than that month\u2019s average during the previous four years. By the end of May they estimated the number may grow to 120%.</li> \n   <li><strong>White House brings forward Brazil travel restrictions by two days. </strong>The US has amended the timing of its Brazil travel ban to come into force at 11.59pm Washington time on Tuesday. It came as Brazil recorded a daily death toll higher than the US for the first time (807 versus 620). Brazil has the world\u2019s second highest number of infections. In its original announcement, the White House said the travel restrictions would come into force on 28 May.</li> \n   <li><strong>Dutch PM Mark Rutte did not visit dying mother due to Covid-19 restrictions. </strong>The Dutch prime minister, Mark Rutte, was unable to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/26/dutch-pm-mark-rutte-did-not-visit-dying-mother-due-to-covid-19-restrictions\">visit his dying mother</a> in her final weeks because he obeyed coronavirus restrictions against visiting care homes, his office has said. His mother did not die of Covid-19, although there had earlier been an outbreak of the disease in the home where she was living, Dutch media reported.</li> \n   <li><strong>UK PM\u2019s aid refuses to apologise or resign over lockdown breach. </strong>The British prime minister Boris Johnson\u2019s senior adviser, Dominic Cummings, has refused to apologise or resign for breaching lockdown rules. Cummings drove 264 miles from London to his parents\u2019 estate in Durham, despite suspecting that both he and his wife had coronavirus. Cummings <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/25/dominic-cummings-refuses-to-resign-or-apologise-for-lockdown-breach\">also admitted to having taken a second trip</a>, to a beauty spot 30 miles from Durham, which he claimed was necessary to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2020/may/25/dominic-cummings-says-he-drove-to-barnard-castle-to-test-his-eyesight-video\">check his eyesight</a> was good enough for the longer drive back to London.</li> \n   <li><strong>WHO suspends hydroxychloroquine trial. </strong>The World Health Organization has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/25/who-world-health-organization-hydroxychloroquine-trial-trump-coronavirus-safety-fears\">suspended testing the malaria drug hydroxychloroquine in Covid-19 patients</a> due to safety concerns. The WHO\u2019s director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, cited <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/may/22/hydroxychloroquine-trumps-covid-19-cure-increases-deaths-global-study-finds\">a paper published last week in the Lancet</a> that showed people taking hydroxychloroquine were at higher risk of death and heart problems than those who were not taking it. In light of the study, he said, the organisation would pause the hydroxychloroquine arm of its solidarity global clinical trial.</li> \n   <li><strong>Coronavirus measures \u2018disastrous\u2019 for children, says Dutch watchdog. </strong>The coronavirus pandemic will have a \u201cdisastrous\u201d impact on children\u2019s rights worldwide, making them more vulnerable to forced labour and underage marriage, a rights group said on Tuesday. School closures left boys and girls more vulnerable to child labour, early marriage and teenage pregnancy, while millions would fall into extreme poverty because of the coronavirus outbreak, the NGO KidsRights said.</li> \n   <li><strong>Australia will not open the country\u2019s borders \u2018anytime soon\u2019. </strong>Australia will not open the country\u2019s borders \u201canytime soon\u201d, the PM, Scott Morrison, said on Tuesday, but added the country would continue its discussions with neighbouring New Zealand about a trans-Tasman safe travel zone. \u201cI was speaking with Prime Minister Ardern this morning, and we\u2019ll continue to have our discussions about the trans-Tasman safe travel zone,\u201d Morrison told the National Press Club in Canberra.</li> \n   <li><strong>Masks too dangerous for children under two, Japan medical group says. </strong>Children under the age of two shouldn\u2019t wear masks because they can make breathing difficult and increase the risk of choking, a Japan medical group has said, launching an urgent appeal to parents as the country reopens from the coronavirus crisis.</li> \n   <li><strong>Saudi Arabia to revise curfew times. </strong>Saudi Arabia will revise curfew times this week, and lift them entirely across the kingdom with the exception of the holy city of Mecca, starting on 21 June, state news agency reported in a statement early on Tuesday. Bans on domestic travel, holding prayers in mosques, and workplace attendance in both the government and private sector will be lifted, starting 31 May, the statement added. For Mecca, the curfew time will be adjusted to 3pm-6pm and prayers will be allowed to be held in mosques from 21 June.</li> \n   <li><strong>Iceland eases national alert. </strong>Iceland eased its national alert against the coronavirus on Monday, allowing for public gatherings of up to 200 people and night clubs and gyms to reopen as the country nears complete recovery from the outbreak. Iceland, which limited the virus spread through a meticulous test-and-trace strategy and a full lockdown, has confirmed 1,804 infections and 10 deaths. But there have been only five reported new cases in May, and more than 99% of infected persons have recovered.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/26/coronavirus-latest-at-a-glance-26-may\">Coronavirus latest: at a glance</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-26T06:22:11.474Z\">at 7.22am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ecca31d8f0864e579f17a87\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-26T05:56:05.986Z\">6.56am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Global report: 'disaster' looms for millions of children as WHO warns of second peak</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The coronavirus pandemic will have a \u201cdisastrous\u201d impact on children\u2019s rights worldwide, making them more vulnerable to forced labour and underage marriage, a rights group has said, as the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/world-health-organization\">World Health Organization</a> warned of an \u201cimmediate second peak\u201d in cases if restrictions were lifted too soon.</p> \n  <p>Millions of children would fall into extreme poverty because of the outbreak, which has left governments short of money for health and education for the young, Dutch NGO KidsRights said.</p> \n  <p>The NGO\u2019s warning came as the WHO emergencies head, Dr Mike Ryan, spoke of a potential second wave of infections at any time, especially if measures to halt the first wave were lifted too soon.</p> \n  <p>He said: \u201cWe cannot make assumptions that just because the disease is on the way down now it is going to keep going down and we are get a number of months to get ready for a second wave.

WHO emergencies head Dr Mike Ryan told an online briefing, \u201cWe cannot make assumptions that just because the disease is on the way down now it is going to keep going down and we are get a number of months to get ready for a second wave.

They were applied \u2013 hours after the tweets initially went out \u2013 because Trump\u2019s tweets violated Twitter\u2019s \u201ccivic integrity policy\u201d, a company spokeswoman confirmed, which bars users from \u201cmanipulating or interfering in elections or other civic processes\u201d, such as by posting misleading information that could dissuade people from participating in an election.</p> <p>Trump responded on Tuesday evening with a pair of tweets that repeated his false claims about voting and accused Twitter of \u201cinterfering in the 2020 Presidential Election\u201d. \u201cTwitter is completely stifling FREE SPEECH, and I, as President, will not allow it to happen!\u201d he <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1265427539008380928\">wrote</a>. <a href=\"https://www.eff.org/issues/bloggers/legal/liability/230\">Federal law</a> protects the rights of internet platforms to moderate the third-party speech they publish.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s tweets include numerous false statements about California\u2019s plan to expand access to voting by mail in November due to the coronavirus outbreak. The tweets now feature a light blue exclamation point icon, with the message \u201cGet the facts about mail-in ballots\u201d. The alert label may not be visible when the tweets are embedded in another web page, such as below.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1265255845358645254\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">....living in the state, no matter who they are or how they got there, will get one. That will be followed up with professionals telling all of these people, many of whom have never even thought of voting before, how, and for whom, to vote. This will be a Rigged Election. No way!</p>&mdash; Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1265255845358645254?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 26, 2020</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>Clicking on the alert will link users to a \u201c<a href=\"https://twitter.com/i/events/1265330601034256384\">Twitter-curated page</a>\u201d that variously describes Trump\u2019s claims as \u201cunsubstantiated\u201d and false. The Twitter page also aggregates tweets from a number of journalists and publications explaining why Trump\u2019s statements are false.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s claims about California on Tuesday were blatantly wrong. The state is not sending a ballot to anyone who lives in the state but rather those registered there. Sam Mahood, a spokesman for the secretary of state, Alex Padilla, said in an email only active voters in the state would be mailed ballots.</p> <p>As states prepare for an unprecedented surge in mail-in voting because of the Covid-19 pandemic, Trump has repeatedly made baseless claims that this will lead to fraud. Voter fraud is <a href=\"https://www.brennancenter.org/issues/ensure-every-american-can-vote/vote-suppression/myth-voter-fraud\">extremely rare</a> and one analysis found just <a href=\"https://thehill.com/opinion/campaign/494189-lets-put-the-vote-by-mail-fraud-myth-to-rest\">143 convictions involving</a> mail-in ballot fraud since 2000, representing 0.00006% of the ballots cast during that time period.</p> <p>Trump, who voted by mail in Florida in March, has made it clear that he opposes any effort to make it easier to vote by mail for all eligible voters, including sending an absentee ballot application to all voters, a measure the Republican National Committee does not oppose. In March, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/30/trump-republican-party-voting-reform-coronavirus\">he said</a> Democratic efforts in Congress to expand mail-in voting would make it so \u201cyou\u2019d never have a Republican elected in this country again\u201d. Studies have shown neither Democrats nor Republicans benefit from a switch to a vote-by-mail system.</p> <p>Trump also attacked efforts to increase mail-in voting in Michigan and Nevada last week. He falsely <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/20/trump-threatens-cut-states-election-funding-mail-in-ballot-plans\">said Michigan</a> was sending absentee ballots to all registered voters; in fact the state was only sending an absentee ballot application. Trump later deleted his tweet and reposted a new one accusing the secretary of state of unlawfully sending the applications, something the secretary of state says is well within her authority.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s campaign manager, Brad Parscale, lambasted Twitter\u2019s decision in a statement, framing it as an attempt by \u201cSilicon Valley\u201d to \u201cobstruct and interfere with President Trump getting his message through to voters\u201d. Parscale also asserted that Twitter\u2019s \u201cclear political bias\u201d was a reason that the Trump campaign pulled its advertising from Twitter \u201cmonths ago\u201d.</p> <p>Twitter <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/oct/30/twitter-ban-political-advertising-us-election\">banned all political advertising</a> in November 2019, more than six months ago. At the time, Parscale decried the global policy change as \u201canother attempt by the left to silence Trump and conservatives\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/oct/30/twitter-ban-political-advertising-us-election\">Twitter to ban all political advertising, raising pressure on Facebook</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Experts on misinformation raised questions about whether Twitter\u2019s measure would be effective. Mike Caulfield, head of the Digital Polarization Initiative of the American Democracy Project, noted that the \u201cGet the facts\u201d phrasing could further entrench misinformation with its \u201clegitimizing tone\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cGet the facts implies there is a debate where facts are being marshalled in evidence,\u201d he <a href=\"https://twitter.com/holden/status/1265406538602053632\">wrote</a> on Twitter. \u201cIt elevates the claim.\u201d</p> <p>Claire Wardle, the director of First Draft News, also questioned whether Twitter\u2019s information page would be effective in changing any minds.</p> <p>\u201cIf we are to consider the reasoning behind this, it\u2019s not a belief that this will change anyone\u2019s minds, it\u2019s to provide necessary context to a tweet that should be taken down, but if they did that would lead to more conspiratorial thinking,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re stuck between a rock and hard place.\u201d</p>"

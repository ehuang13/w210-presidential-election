The masks will be sent to each of Japan\u2019s more than 50 million households starting the week after next, first to areas seeing a spike in cases.</p> \n   <p>\u201cYou can use soap to wash and re-use them, so this should be a good response to the sudden, huge demand for masks,\u201d he said.</p> \n   <p>The leader of the opposition Democratic Party for the People, Yuichiro Tamaki, this week called on Abe to declare a state of emergency, while the Japan Medical Association pointed to a crisis at hospitals in some regions, where beds for virus patients are full and doctors and nurses are getting infected.</p> \n   <p>\u201cAbe has always been \u2018economy first\u2019,\u201d said Jesper Koll, CEO of fund manager WisdomTree Japan. \u201cIf you declare an emergency, it is definitely the end of \u2018Abenomics\u2019, the end of \u2018economy first\u2019.\u201d</p> \n   <p>Twitter users were scathing, with Abe and mask references trending on Thursday. \u201cIs the Japanese government for real? This is a total waste of tax money,\u201d wrote a user with the handle Usube.<br></p> \n   <p>It\u2019s not the first time Abe has faced criticism for his coronavirus strategies.</p> \n   <p>Some have said his initial response to the virus outbreak was sluggish, with charges from critics that he played down the threat in the hope that Tokyo could go ahead and host the now-postponed Summer Olympics this year. Abe denied the claims.</p> \n   <p>Critics say he should act now on a state of emergency, fearing a surge in infections after crowds gathered in some places to attend traditional cherry blossom viewing parties last month, despite calls to stay home. Abe\u2019s wife, Akie, was blasted after pictures emerged of her at one such event, but Abe defended her, saying it was a private gathering at a restaurant.</p> \n   <p>Though small compared with outbreaks in the United States, Europe and China, coronavirus infections are on the rise in Japan - with more than 2,500 confirmed cases as of Thursday morning and 71 deaths, according to NHK public broadcaster. A record of more than 90 new cases appeared in Tokyo alone, its biggest one-day increase, Kyodo news agency said.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c1a05f1379b37de7f49a242ef74cffad8cc18acc\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c1a05f1379b37de7f49a242ef74cffad8cc18acc/0_0_4433_3077/1000..jpg\" alt=\"A businessman wearing a protective mask walks at Shinjuku in Tokyo, Japan.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"694\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A businessman wearing a protective mask walks at Shinjuku in Tokyo, Japan.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kimimasa Mayama/EPA</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-02T10:15:05.226Z\">at 11.15am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e8598678f087564da1e43e6\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/helenasmith\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-02T07:48:00.242Z\">8.48am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>In a worrying sign, a refugee camp in Greece has been placed under quarantine after 20 of its in-place residents were diagnosed with coronavirus, reports Helena Smith in Athens. </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Officials began testing people in the facility after a woman from the camp was discovered to have contracted the virus after giving birth in an Athens hospital this week. </p> \n   <p>Those who tested positive were among a group of 63 traced through the woman although officials none were displaying symptoms of the novel virus, the migration ministry said.

Coronavirus has turned etiquette on its head and what once were gestures of friendship are now acts of daring. Fundamentally, society used to run on the idea that we were all welcome in one another\u2019s space; suddenly, civility amounts to how much distance we keep between ourselves, and how much we shield others from our presence. It is one hell of a gear shift. And it is also important not to overcorrect, not to judge one another from a thousand yards, not to needlessly insult one another in situations that are not, actually, that endangering.

She had flown from Michigan to New York in a red pantsuit on 8 November, expecting to celebrate the first female president at Hillary Clinton campaign\u2019s watch party. Instead, she was <a href=\"https://apnews.com/238a424cb76c44cf93b4ef616dea5a26/clinton-casts-her-ballot-it-most-humbling-feeling\">left stunned</a> by Donald Trump\u2019s victory. And she dreaded spending Thanksgiving with her extended, politically divided family in their home town just outside Detroit.</p> <p>Born Katie Rogala, her family mostly steered clear of politics during her childhood in Livonia, Michigan, though her dad\u2019s veteran status meant patriotism surrounded them. Fahey considered herself an independent, and worked at a recycling coalition after college, doing improvisational comedy \u2013 even starting an improv festival from scratch. (She married her improv co-star Sean Fahey in 2013, but the pair recently divorced.)</p> <p>That year, eager to find a unifying topic to focus on over turkey and stuffing, Fahey turned her attention to gerrymandering. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to talk about who we voted for because that was always leading back to literally people being like, \u2018You\u2019re evil for thinking that way,\u2019\u201d Fahey said. \u201cSo I thought, man, I wonder if systemic reform, getting back to one person, one vote would be something that appeals to everybody.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"77bec749050bbee19f5591ec0f208e006fbb2d50\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/77bec749050bbee19f5591ec0f208e006fbb2d50/237_0_3600_2160/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Katie Fahey in Slay the Dragon.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Katie Fahey in Slay the Dragon.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Participant Media</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>While the practice of politicians redrawing district lines in their favor dates to the early 1800s in Massachusetts, recent technology has taken gerrymandering in America to the extreme. Now, following each decennial census count, it\u2019s legal for state politicians to hire mapmakers to use software that precisely manipulates bizarrely squiggled districts \u2013 resembling everything from <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2014/05/15/americas-most-gerrymandered-congressional-districts/\">a praying mantis</a> to <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/26/us/pennsylvania-gerrymander-goofy-district.html\">Goofy kicking Donald Duck</a> \u2013 to cram their opponents into a limited area or otherwise guarantee votes.</p> <p>Michigan is one of the most gerrymandered states in the US. Leaked emails have even revealed a Republican aide <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/25/us/michigan-gerrymandering.html\">boasted about packing \u201cDem garbage\u201d into select districts</a> during the 2011 GOP legislative redrawing.</p> <p>On 11 November 2016, Fahey posted a <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/katie.rogala.3/posts/10153917724442633\">Facebook status</a>: \u201cI\u2019d like to take on gerrymandering in Michigan, if you\u2019re interested in doing this as well, please let me know :).\u201d Within hours, she\u2019d created a new Facebook group and soon, the non-partisan <a href=\"https://votersnotpoliticians.com/\">Voters Not Politicians</a> (VNP) was born. Fahey was the face of a movement. Well, almost.</p> <p>For the next few months, Fahey never met her supporters. They strategized and bonded online, something Fahey said helped build her confidence because \u201cit\u2019s easier to be vulnerable behind a screen\u201d. But by March 2017, she and her fellow volunteers were ready to hold meetings across the state asking residents how they would like to see a new redistricting system work.</p> <p>\u201cEverybody just thought that was absolutely absurd that you would talk to people before changing the constitution,\u201d she said of the skepticism her plan received from political insiders. \u201c[I thought] isn\u2019t this how democracy works?\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s in those meetings that Fahey\u2019s improv experience came in handy. She had an ease onstage, and in front of crowds \u2013 rumors even circulated that she was a paid actor, a plant supplied by the Democrats and that her whole Facebook-origin story was an elaborate hoax. \u201cA lot of people were more skeptical and more dismissive of us being able to be the \u2018real deal\u2019 because of my age and gender,\u201d she said.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>A lot of people were more skeptical and more dismissive of us being able to be the \u2018real deal\u2019 because of my age and gender</p> <footer> <cite>Katie Fahey</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Voters Not Politicians\u2019 final proposal emerged after 33 days: take the power out of the politicians\u2019 hands, starting with the 2021 redistricting, by creating a 13-person citizens\u2019 committee, composed of four Republicans, four Democrats and five unaffiliated people.</p> <p>But that was just the beginning. To get it on the ballot as a proposed constitutional amendment in the November 2018 midterm election, they would need 315,000 signatures in the next 180 days and, with limited funds and virtually no experience, they were starting at a huge disadvantage. \u201cNormally, before you\u2019d announce, you\u2019d have your constitutional language written and you would have raised millions of dollars,\u201d Fahey says. \u201cLiterally, we had just opened our bank account the day before because we couldn\u2019t figure out how.\u201d</p> <p>An undeterred and perpetually smiling Fahey led 4,000 volunteers, many of whom had also never been politically active, to contribute their skills, down to the woodcarver who helped make their clipboards. <a href=\"https://www.freep.com/story/entertainment/movies/julie-hinds/2018/10/18/jennifer-lawrence-michigan-proposal-2-election-2016/1681511002/\">Jennifer Lawrence</a> and <a href=\"https://fox17online.com/2018/10/20/schwarzenegger-in-east-lansing-terminate-gerrymandering-with-prop-2/?fbclid=IwAR15809_D_cME9bBgidfdPVDfz1hmHBizbJEkeObGd3oL0AJ3X8bnD45cc0\">Arnold Schwarzenegger</a> chimed in with support. Even Republican voters and legislators were eager to sign and \u201cthe only people who would ever say no were usually people who were involved in the redistricting process before or somehow really, really involved in partisan politics\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWithout Katie, I believe, we would not have been successful,\u201d said Hal Gurian, a Republican from Traverse City who volunteered for the campaign. \u201cShe was a hands-on leader who worked diligently with as many volunteers as she had time to meet personally or talk with on the phone.\u201d</p> <p>Defying predictions, Voters Not Politicians managed to get more than 425,000 signatures two months before the deadline. On election day, the proposal, Prop 2, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/nov/27/gerrymandering-michigan-citizens-voters-not-politicians\">passed with a sweeping 61% </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/nov/27/gerrymandering-michigan-citizens-voters-not-politicians\"> of the vote</a>.</p> <p>\u201cPeople don\u2019t realize their own power. A lot of people, especially women, in the campaign, were so reluctant to go into leadership positions,\u201d Fahey says, noting that after the campaign ended \u201cwe had, like, 17 people who ended up running for local office\u201d.</p> <p>Next year, Michigan\u2019s district lines will be redrawn by voters, not politicians for the first time.</p> <p>\u2022\u2022\u2022</p> <p>Slay the Dragon will be released this week during a census year \u2013 when the US population will be carefully counted in order to determine the size of electoral districts next year.</p> <p>It\u2019s clear that Fahey\u2019s hard-won movement is a threat to Republicans across the country during that process. Michigan\u2019s Republican party and activists continue to try and block the change with <a href=\"https://www.bridgemi.com/michigan-government/judge-rejects-gop-bid-delay-michigan-redistricting-commission\">multiple lawsuits</a>, claiming it is unconstitutional and discriminatory.</p> <p>But Fahey is hoping the momentum from VNP can be replicated in the 35 other states that <a href=\"https://ballotpedia.org/State-by-state_redistricting_procedures\">still use congressional redistricting</a>. She self-identifies as a \u201cdemocracy entrepreneur\u201d. (That label worn by anyone else could seem insufferable, but on Fahey, who radiates an infectious earnestness, it works.) And she founded a national not-for-profit last year called <a href=\"https://thepeople.org/\">the People</a>, which hopes to create Katie 2.0s across the country by giving frustrated citizens the tools to tackle systemic issues they care about, such as the partisan primary process and election security.</p> <p>To be successful, those initiatives might need people like Katie at the forefront. \u201cShe is an inspiring, motivating and tireless leader,\u201d Gurian said.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I\u2019d be more excited about governing than I would about running or feeling like I have to follow the party line because that\u2019s just not me</p> <footer> <cite>Katie Fahey</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>While the impact of her work can\u2019t be measured quite yet, the ripple effects are clear. In early March, the Democrat-majority Virginia senate <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/06/us/virginia-legislature-redistricting.html\">voted to relinquish their power</a> in favor of a committee.

Though her platform started with a Facebook post, she has no public Instagram and a modest Twitter presence. Even the fact that she\u2019s the face of Slay the Dragon doesn\u2019t sit well with her. And don\u2019t expect her to run for office anytime soon. \u201cI\u2019d be more excited about governing than I would about running or feeling like I have to follow the party line because that\u2019s just not me,\u201d she said.</p> <p>For now, she spends what little free time she has taking her dogs to the park or escaping from \u201creal-world problems\u201d with video games. Role-playing fantasies are her favorite, including, of course, Dragon Quest.</p> <p>\u201cI think what I like about them is \u2013 this is so dumb \u2013 you have these different characters who all play their role and even if there is a main character, your team is only stronger because everybody\u2019s bringing their strengths to the table,\u201d she says.</p> <p>\u201cThat is just so how I live my life.\u201d</p> <ul> <li><p>This article was amended on 3 April 2020 to correct the city in Michigan where Fahey grew up.</p></li> </ul>",

The UK, as host of the Cop26 talks, is still aiming for all countries to come forward with fresh targets on their greenhouse gas emissions.</p> <p>The EU pledged it would sustain its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/dec/11/eu-aims-to-stir-global-action-with-pledge-on-climate-crisis\">push for a bloc-wide \u201cgreen deal\u201d</a> that would involve stiffer cuts in emissions and a target of net zero emissions by 2050. Frans Timmermans, the vice-president of the European commission, said: \u201cWe will not slow down our work domestically or internationally to prepare for an ambitious Cop26.\u201d</p> <p>A clear benefit of moving the talks is that their original start date of 9 November was days after the US presidential election. That timing posed problems for negotiators, because Donald Trump has begun the process of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/nov/04/donald-trump-climate-crisis-exit-paris-agreement\">withdrawing the US from the Paris accord</a>, a decision that will take legal effect on 4 November.</p> <p>Some observers are hoping that a new president could change the course of the world\u2019s most powerful economy and second biggest emitter. \u201cAmerican voters are increasingly likely to reject Trump\u2019s science denial on both coronavirus and climate change and instead elect Joe Biden president,\u201d said Paul Bledsoe, a former climate adviser in Bill Clinton\u2019s White House, now with the Progressive Policy Institute in Washington. \u201cDelaying Cop26 until 2021 means that Biden might have the chance to re-establish US climate leadership.\u201d</p> <p>Whether or not there is a change of administration, the delay has an advantage for countries negotiating with the US, said Nathaniel Keohane, a senior vice president at the Environmental Defense Fund in the US.</p> <p>\u201cUnder the original schedule, the Cop was going to be overshadowed by the US elections regardless of the outcome,\u201d explained Keohane. \u201cThe shift in schedule will allow countries to react and respond. If a Democrat wins in November, then by the time of the Cop, the US will have re-entered Paris and will be able to send a high-level political delegation, giving an important and positive boost to the talks. And if Trump is re-elected, other countries will have had time to absorb that information by the time of the Cop and know definitively that they have to move on without the US.\u201d</p> <p>This will be the first year in nearly three decades of annual climate negotiations under the 1992 UN Framework Convention on Climate Change that no talks are held.</p> <p>However, given the scale of the coronavirus crisis, by the end of a nearly four-hour meeting on Wednesday it was clear a decision had to be made quickly. Questions were raised over the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/mar/18/cop26-boris-johnson-urged-resist-calls-postpone-climate-talks-coronavirus\">potential problems with a postponement</a>, in delaying vital work by countries on their emissions plans, but none of the parties objected to the final decision.</p> <p>It may take months for a new date for Cop26 to be decided, with hopes that it could take place in early spring at the soonest. The UK is still committed to holding the summit in Glasgow, and is working with the Scottish government on logistics, and with its scientific advisers on when might be safe to hold a summit in which it is hoped civil society and activists will play a key role.</p> <p>For now, the immediate goal of green campaigners is to ensure that recovery plans from the coronavirus crisis do not <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/01/financial-help-for-airlines-should-come-with-strict-climate-conditions\">entrench investment in high emissions</a>. There is a danger that some countries are using the pandemic to roll back environmental protections and commitments \u2013 in the US, for instance, the Trump administration has revoked clean car standards and in the EU, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/27/carmakers-accused-of-using-covid-19-weaken-environmental-laws\">carmakers have lobbied for a watering down</a> of their emissions obligations.</p> <p>\u201cCop26 being put on hold should make governments double down on their efforts to ensure a green and just way forward in handling this health crisis and the climate emergency,\u201d said Jennifer Morgan, the executive director of Greenpeace International. \u201cGoing back to business as usual is completely unacceptable: this pandemic shows there are huge lessons to be learned about the importance of listening to science and the need for urgent collective global action.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Even before the pandemic there were postponements. Before that, there were protests. From a large armchair positioned beneath his own portrait, the 82-year-old president of Guinea is not answering the key question preoccupying his country whether or not he wants to remain in situ until he is 94.</p> <p>In the Sekhoutoureah presidential palace in Conakry, wearing a short-sleeved shirt and trousers, Alpha Cond\u00e9 is flanked on one side by a large photograph of himself alongside Barack Obama in the White House. On the other, framed photographs on a table show him shaking hands with the Turkish leader, Recep Erdo\u011fan, and with China\u2019s Xi Jinping. There\u2019s also a golden bust of Chairman Mao and a hefty book about the Beninese politician Robert Dossou.</p> <p>On 22 March, Guinea <a href=\"https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-guinea-election/guinea-referendum-backs-constitutional-changes-that-may-extend-presidents-rule-idUKKBN21E387?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=worldNews\">voted in a referendum</a> on allowing Cond\u00e9 to change the constitution. The electoral commission said almost 92% voted in favour of the changes. At least 42 people died in violent protests that preceded the vote.</p> <p>The new constitution will enshrine gender parity and wealth distribution in law, ban child marriage and female genital mutilation (FGM), and provide a \u201cspecific fund\u201d for young people, women and people with disabilities, Cond\u00e9 says.

But with two days to go it was <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-51689308\">unexpectedly postponed</a>. \u201cGuinea, homeland of pan-Africanism, cannot isolate itself from its fellow countries,\u201d the president told the nation in a sober television address.</p> <p>The vote finally went ahead on 22 March, but has been mired in controversy. The opposition, who reject the result, have boycotted the electoral register and removed 37 deputies from legislative elections that took place on the same day.

Will he now run for president again? And how could Cond\u00e9 \u2013 a former law professor at the Sorbonne who was opposition leader for more than four decades who was exiled and imprisoned by dictators, and welcomed as a champion of change by international leaders \u2013 consider undermining the still fragile system of democracy that he helped implement?</p> <p>Before Cond\u00e9\u2019s arrival, Guinea had a history of leaders outstaying their welcome. Sekou Tour\u00e9 ruled a one-party state modelled on Maoist China from independence in 1958 till he died in office in 1984. His successor, Lansana Cont\u00e9, was just as tenacious, hanging on, with increasing senility, until 2008. Moussa Dadis Camara, a military captain, then ruled for barely a year, orchestrating elaborate show trials on television before he was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/dec/16/guinea-aide-shoot-camara\">shot in the head</a> by an exasperated bodyguard in 2009.</p> <p>Cond\u00e9 seemed like an improvement. Once condemned to death by Tour\u00e9 and imprisoned for two and a half years by Cont\u00e9, he was elected with 52.52% of the vote and re-elected in 2015 with almost 58%. But many Guineans are not so much against him as against a third mandate.</p> <p>Guinea is a country of great natural resources. The coastal area is lush with mangroves and fertile farmland for pineapples, mangoes, rice and potatoes. Inland there are generous deposits of iron ore and Guinea is the biggest exporter of bauxite to China.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"63d6617cfb1884e4895189da4d4e4010091b9b62\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/63d6617cfb1884e4895189da4d4e4010091b9b62/0_184_5520_3312/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A broken ballot box on the ground outside a polling station in Conakry on the day of Guinea\u2019s constitutional referendum\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A broken ballot box on the ground outside a polling station in Conakry on the day of Guinea\u2019s constitutional referendum.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Cellou Binani/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But poverty levels are extremely high. Even in the capital, Conakry, the electricity supply is capricious, with frequent power outages. Sometimes there is running water; more often, a trip to the local well. Less than two-thirds of the population can read, and the average income is less than $900 (\u00a3727) a year. Guinea also has one of the highest rates of economic migration in Africa. Young people are often unemployed, while 90% of women undergo FGM in some form.</p> <p>On assuming power, Cond\u00e9 famously remarked that he had inherited a country, not a state. Now he defends his record with reminders of the situation in 2010. \u201cWhen I arrived, Guinea was on its knees. Completely on its knees,\u201d he says. \u201cWe had never completed a programme with the IMF. They called us the \u2018basket case\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>Reforms included an overhaul of the army. There was an attempted coup in 2011. Then there was Ebola. The <a href=\"https://www.who.int/csr/disease/ebola/ebola-6-months/guinea/en/\">first case identified </a>was in Guinea in 2013. Three years later, and after more than 2,500 deaths, Guinea was declared Ebola-free.</p> <p>\u201cI did not have the time to draw up a new constitution,\u201d says Cond\u00e9.</p> <p>Under his rule, Guinea has seen undeniable improvements. In 2016 and 2017 the mining industry grew by 50%. The 240- megawatt Kaleta hydroelectric facility should provide Conakry\u2019s residents with stable power. The 450-megawatt Souapiti dam is due to open next year and could provide the energy required for factories.</p> <p>Refining bauxite into aluminium rather than simply exporting the raw material would add far more to the state\u2019s coffers and in theory trickle down to the population: <a href=\"https://www.anafic-gn.org/#\">Anafic</a>, one of the president\u2019s landmark policies, implemented last year, guarantees that 15% of mining revenues will go towards local infrastructure.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"b0212a034c824f0d18dbbb5432fa6c233c5fa14b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b0212a034c824f0d18dbbb5432fa6c233c5fa14b/0_900_2000_1200/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Alpha Cond\u00e9 pictured at the People\u2019s Hall in Conakry in 2010\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alpha Cond\u00e9 pictured at the People\u2019s Hall in Conakry in 2010.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: J\u00e9r\u00f4me Delay/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Asked if his time in power has changed him, Cond\u00e9 says circumstances remain the same as when he was in opposition. \u201cSince my youth I have wanted to serve my country, and serve Africa,\u201d says the president, who believes he doesn\u2019t get the recognition he deserves. \u201cPeople in Guinea have a short memory.\u201d</p> <p>Since October more than 40 people have died in protests organised by the Front National pour la D\u00e9fense de la Constitution (FNDC), an organisation consisting of civil society, politicians and activists. These have mainly taken place in the district of Ratoma in Conakry, the fiefdom of Cellou Dalein Diallo, one of Conde\u2019s main political rivals. Many of the inhabitants are Peuhl, an ethnic group related to the Fulani. On the day of the vote, 10 people died according to the FNDC (the government <a href=\"https://www.lemonde.fr/afrique/article/2020/03/31/des-milliers-de-guineens-sont-alles-voter-on-ne-les-a-pas-forces_6035037_3212.html\">says it was six</a>).</p> <p>\u201cInvestigations are happening,\u201d says Cond\u00e9. He blames tensions on the opposition: \u201cWhen one doesn\u2019t have a credible political programme, one can lower oneself to the subjective: race or ethnicity.\u201d</p> <p>But, he says, the tears in the social fabric can be repaired. \u201cIt will disappear with the next generation. The more young people have work, the less they will be manipulated.\u201d</p> <p>Four decades in opposition gave Cond\u00e9 time to nurture a grandiose vision for his legacy. \u201cMy mission is to make Guinea one of the most developed countries in Africa. I want the person who comes after me to no longer have to resolve the problems of electricity, nor the problem of water, nor the problem of roads,\u201d he says.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>In elections in Guinea, when you put in \u2018yes\u2019, it comes out \u2018no\u2019</p> <footer> <cite>Restaurant owner, Conakry</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cThe countries that develop the fastest \u2013 how long have their leaders been in power?

Now he says: \u201cIt\u2019s the party who decides.\u201d</p> <p>He knows everyone wants the answer. In previous interviews, he has pointed out that there are no term limits in countries considered bastions of democracy. \u201cA constitution, a referendum, what is more democratic than that?\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2019/dec/17/guinea-protests-turn-bloody-in-fight-to-stop-presidents-third-term\">Guinea protests turn bloody in fight to stop president's third term</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In the country, there is widespread cynicism as to the legitimacy of the vote. As the manager of a restaurant overlooking the fishing port in Conakry puts it: \u201cIn elections in Guinea, when you put in \u2018yes\u2019, it comes out \u2018no.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Ecowas, called in to conduct an audit after the postponement of the referendum, has done little to put voters at ease. They confirmed the OIF\u2019s findings that approximately 2.5 million votes are in doubt, cast by people who are either dead, too young or have been counted twice. The coronavirus pandemic meant elections went ahead on 22 Marchwithout international observers. \u201cWe don\u2019t know if the voters have been removed,\u201d says Dram\u00e9. \u201cThere is no guarantee that the recommendations of Ecowas have been respected.\u201d</p> <p>Cond\u00e9 believes the ballot box is the best way to solve the impasse. Should he stand again for president, his main rivals will likewise be familiar faces. Diallo, leader of the Union of Democratic Forces of Guinea party, and Sidya Tour\u00e9, head of the Union of Republican Forces, were prime ministers under Lansana Cont\u00e9. They do not symbolise a fresh start. \u201cThey aren\u2019t a new generation of politicians but former civil servants,\u201d says Cond\u00e9. \u201cI\u2019ve won elections; none of them have.\u201d</p> <p>On Tuesday, Cond\u00e9 announced a curfew because of coronavirus. So far, the number of cases in Guinea remains low, with fewer than 40 cases.</p> <p>As the president talks of infrastructure, there is little mention of leaving Guinea with the democratic infrastructure that term limits established.</p> <p>Forty years fighting in opposition do not seem to have trained Cond\u00e9 in the art of letting go. One thinks of his memoir, in which he was asked about football, one of his great passions. \u201cI would dribble, but never pass the ball,\u201d he answered.</p>",

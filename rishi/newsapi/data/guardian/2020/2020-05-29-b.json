  "<h2>Jimmy Kimmel</h2> <p>It\u2019s been an altogether brutal week of news, but \u201cwhile racial injustice is tearing this country apart\u201d, said Jimmy Kimmel on Thursday night, in reference to protests over the killing of George Floyd, a black man, by Minneapolis police, Donald Trump \u201cis going to war with Twitter\u201d.</p> <p>Trump has been apoplectic about the tech company since earlier this week, when it&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/may/28/donald-trump-move-against-twitter-factchecking-could-backfire\">factchecked his misleading tweets on mail-in voting</a>&nbsp;as a widespread cause of voter fraud (there is no evidence to support this, and many states with Republican governors have used mail-in voting for years).</p> <p>Twitter tagged his tweets as \u201cpotentially misleading\u201d with a \u201cget the facts about mail-in ballots\u201d link to articles disproving Trump\u2019s claim.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFHVSz7ooak\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/XFHVSz7ooak?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Trump\u2019s attempt to discredit mail-in voting is \u201cpart of his multi-pronged \u2018looks like I\u2019m gonna lose so I\u2019ll make every case I can to say I was cheated\u2019 campaign\u201d, said Kimmel.</p> <p>So on Thursday, in retaliation to Twitter\u2019s factchecking, he \u201cpicked up his executive Sharpie\u201d and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/28/donald-trump-social-media-executive-order-twitter\">signed an executive order</a> that would limit legal protections for social media companies. The order was intended, he argued, to make it so \u201csocial media companies that engage in censoring or any political conduct will not be able to keep their liability shield\u201d.</p> <p>Naturally, he also raged about Twitter on Twitter, tweeting: \u201cTwitter is now interfering in the 2020 Presidential Election. They are saying my statement on Mail-In Ballots, which will lead to massive corruption and fraud, is incorrect, based on fact-checking by Fake News CNN and the Amazon Washington Post \u2026 Twitter is completely stifling FREE SPEECH, and I, as President, will not allow it to happen!\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/may/28/jimmy-kimmel-recap-trump-twitter-feud-spacex\">Kimmel: 'Only a matter of time until Trump would be in a Twitter feud with Twitter'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThis is crazy,\u201d said Kimmel of the president\u2019s response. \u201cThis would be like if he declared war on Arby\u2019s because they said there are 550 calories in his curly fries.\u201d</p> <p>He continued: \u201cIn a nutshell, the president is mad at an app on his phone, and is using the power of his office to retaliate. This is what is on his mind as the death toll from coronavirus is over 100,000 now.\u201d</p> <p>Trump continued to escalate his Twitter attacks on Thursday, telling reporters he would \u201cshut down\u201d the platform if his attorneys could find a way because it\u2019s \u201climiting his freedom of speech\u201d. The argument is \u201cobviously insane\u201d, said Kimmel.</p> <p>\u201cHe is Mr Twitter. And by the way, if he\u2019s so mad at Twitter, why doesn\u2019t he stop using it? He can\u2019t, because he loves it. He loves mashing those angry little thumbs.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>The US has shown \u201cgross incompetence \u2026 at the highest levels\u201d in dealing with the Covid-19 pandemic, according to Samantha Power, who served as US ambassador to the United Nations under Barack Obama.</p> <p>Speaking to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/philippe-sands\">Philippe Sands</a> for the online version of the Hay festival, Power said that Donald Trump\u2019s administration had failed to learn from the countries hit by the coronavirus before the US.</p> <p>\u201cWe could have had an awful lot in place before it struck in earnest on the continent,\u201d she said, highlighting the \u201cgross incompetence\u201d shown \u201cnot by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/15/coronavirus-us-health-care-worker-death-toll-higher-official-data-suggests\">the heroic health workers and public servants</a> who are on the frontlines, but at the highest levels, diminishing the threat posed by the pandemic in its early stages\u201d.</p> <p>Power served for four years as Obama\u2019s human rights adviser and from 2013 to 2017 in his cabinet and as US ambassador to the UN. The coronavirus outbreak in the US has been \u201cmishandled for a set of reasons that go well beyond the pandemic, a scepticism about science and evidence and global cooperation,\u201d she said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fa71dca344b9baa89e30af3deed44ca4c895abe2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fa71dca344b9baa89e30af3deed44ca4c895abe2/0_0_3500_2335/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Underestimated \u2026 Trump supporters in Hershey, Pennsylvania, in November 2016.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Underestimated \u2026 Trump supporters in Hershey, Pennsylvania, in November 2016.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Carlo Allegri/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>She admitted that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/obama-administration\">the Obama administration</a> had \u201cdefinitely underestimated the potency\u201d of \u201ca view represented by President Trump but shared by millions of Americans, that the international system has ripped us off, that we have been giving more than we\u2019ve been getting\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWe saw the pain caused, of course, by economic globalisation and saw the degree to which many in our own communities were being left behind. But the idea that that would be laid squarely on political globalisation or on alliances or on the United Nations, it was not accurate, it seemed like too big a leap to get the fuel and the momentum that Trump has given it, so we were wrong to underestimate that,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Power was asked by Sands if there was any coming back for the US after what he called \u201calmost irrecoverable\u201d damage done to the support for global order by the Trump presidency. Power said it wasn\u2019t just about Trump threatening to pull out of the World Health Organization, and withdrawing the US from organisations including Unesco and the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/unitednations\">United Nations</a>&nbsp;human rights council.</p> <p>\u201cThere is that. But maybe even more damaging than that is the pullback from alliances that are at the heart of effective multilateralism \u2026 How do you recover the belief among German, French, British, Irish, Spanish citizens that when America attaches its name to an agreement, whether a climate agreement, or an Iran nuclear agreement, that is going to be an enduring signature?\u201d she said. \u201cWhat Trump has jeopardised more than anything is the sense of American constancy, [that] we\u2019re going to be there when you need us. And that\u2019s going to be the hardest thing of all, I think to build back that trust.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4a17f4c052b4d131e59f050c68d13df2433c3424\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4a17f4c052b4d131e59f050c68d13df2433c3424/0_0_3397_2269/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Joe Biden campaigning in Detroit in March.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"668\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hopeful \u2026 Joe Biden campaigning in Detroit in March.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Paul Sancya/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Power was hopeful that Joe Biden will emerge the victor at this <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-elections-2020\">November\u2019s presidential election</a> due to Trump\u2019s handling of the pandemic. </p> <p>\u201cYou can holler <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/dec/18/what-is-fake-news-pizzagate\">fake news</a> and be kind of tribal in terms of your party mentality.

I\u2019m going to hand you over to my colleague <strong>Sarah Marsh</strong> in London. Here\u2019s the latest from the Minneapolis protests: </p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Protests against police brutality have continued in cities across the US, including Minneapolis, Denver, New York and Oakland following the killing of George Floyd. </strong>Floyd, a 46-year-old black man, died in police custody after a white officer handcuffed hum kneeled on his neck for several minutes as Floyd pleaded that he could not breathe.</li> \n   <li><strong>In Minneapolis, police abandoned the 3rd precinct police station, which has been a major protest site.</strong> Crowds breached the station and set the entrance on fire. Elsewhere, businesses were looted and blazes set as the evening wore on.</li> \n   <li><strong>Donald Trump tweeted about the protests, calling those involved \u201cthugs\u201d and threatening to send in the national guard.</strong> Trump described the city\u2019s mayor, Jacob Frey, \u201cvery weak\u201d and wrote: \u201cwhen the looting starts, the shooting starts.\u201d</li> \n   <li><strong>In response, to the president\u2019s comments, Frey said during a press briefing: \u201cWeakness is pointing your finger at someone else during a time of crisis.\u201d</strong> The city\u2019s mayor said he had ordered the evacuation of officers from the 3rd precinct after reports of \u201cimminent threats to both officers and the public\u201d.</li> \n   <li><strong>The Minnesota National Guard </strong><strong>sent 500 soldiers to St Paul, Minneapolis and surrounding areas after the state\u2019s governor</strong><strong> declared a state of emergency. </strong>Governor Walz wrote in the proclamation that he supported peaceful protests but \u201cunfortunately, some individuals have engaged in unlawful and dangerous activity, including arson, rioting, looting, and damaging public and private property\u201d.</li> \n   <li><strong>The US attorney\u2019s office and the FBI in Minneapolis said earlier on Thursday they were conducting \u201ca robust criminal investigation\u201d</strong> into the death and making the case a priority. The FBI is also investigating, focusing on whether Floyd\u2019s civil rights were violated.</li> \n  </ul> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-29T07:01:07.860Z\">at 8.01am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ed0b0908f0898700351e5e2\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-29T06:50:08.046Z\">7.50am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Frey faced questions about the apparent absence of police and the National Guard on the city\u2019s streets. He was pointedly asked by one reporter: \u201cwho is in charge?\u201d. He directed questions about the role of police to the city\u2019s commissioner, but called the protests \u201cunacceptable\u201d.</p> \n  <p>Frey:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>There is a lot of pain and anger right now in our city. I understand that, our entire city recognises that. What we have seen over the past several hours and past several nights in terms of looting is unacceptable. Our community cannot and will not tolerate it ... We are working with our officers right now of course, with resources provided by the state ... It was clear as of last night [that] we needed additional help and we got that, some form the state and we are expecting more as well.\u201d </p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ed0aee28f0898700351e5de\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-29T06:44:43.759Z\">7.44am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Frey, in that press conference just now, also addressed the decision to abandon the city\u2019s third precinct police station. He said he made the order for police to evacuate the building, which it appears has since been significantly damaged by fire, after reports of \u201cimminent threats to both officers and the public\u201d</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The symbolism of a building cannot outweigh the importance of the lives of our officers or the public.

Louisville, Kentucky, as protesters turned out to demand justice for <strong>Breonna Taylor</strong>, a black woman fatally shot by police in her home in March.</p> \n  <p>It comes amid demonstrations across the country following the death of a black man, <strong>George Floyd</strong>, in Minneapolis police custody.</p> \n  <p><strong>Louisville Metro Police</strong> confirmed in a statement early Friday that there were at least seven shooting victims, at least one of whom is in critical condition. The statement said there were some arrests, but police didn\u2019t provide a number. Police had initially confirmed reports of gunfire around 11:30 p.m.</p> \n  <p>Police spokesman Sgt. Lamont Washington told The Associated Press that all seven were civilians. Around 500 to 600 demonstrators marched through the Kentucky city\u2019s downtown streets on Thursday night, the Courier Journal reported. </p> \n  <p>Understandably, emotions are high, Louisville Mayor <strong>Greg Fischer</strong> tweeted just before midnight, sharing a Facebook post asking for peace that he said was written on behalf of Taylor\u2019s mother. </p> \n  <p>Taylor, a 26-year-old emergency medical tech, was shot eight times on March 13 after Louisville narcotics detectives knocked down the front door. No drugs were found in the home.</p> \n  <p>Attention on Taylor\u2019s death has intensified after her family sued the police department earlier this month. The case has attracted national headlines alongside the shooting of <strong>Ahmaud Arbery</strong> in a Georgia neighborhood in February. <br></p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ed09c758f084e882655acf5\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-29T05:24:53.075Z\">6.24am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>As the US grapples with a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/28/george-floyd-minnesota-governor-national-guard-protests\">third night of protests</a> over the death of George Floyd in police custody in Minneapolis, here is what we know so far:</p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/28/george-floyd-protests-what-we-know-so-far\">George Floyd protests: what we know so far</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ed09aed8f087e3ca0f65835\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-29T05:22:38.991Z\">6.22am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"85e45214b5100392da2ba230044752fa9fa6a972\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/85e45214b5100392da2ba230044752fa9fa6a972/0_182_4946_2967/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Unrest continues over the death of George Floyd\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Unrest continues over the death of George Floyd</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stephen Maturen/Getty Images</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"aedf20a97152427c41e1f15d458c41885aa4cb1a\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/aedf20a97152427c41e1f15d458c41885aa4cb1a/0_322_4895_2938/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Protesters look at a burning liquor store across the street from the Minneapolis Police Department 3rd Precinct during protests over the arrest of George Floyd\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Protesters look at a burning liquor store across the street from the Minneapolis Police Department 3rd Precinct during protests over the arrest of George Floyd</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tannen Maury/EPA</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b4afc770b9a3c05f099855d9771caadf6eeaa455\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b4afc770b9a3c05f099855d9771caadf6eeaa455/0_232_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Protesters gather around after setting fire to the entrance of a police station as demonstrations continue in Minneapolis\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Protesters gather around after setting fire to the entrance of a police station as demonstrations continue in Minneapolis</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Carlos Barr\u00eda/Reuters</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ed099698f084e882655acec\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-29T05:11:54.922Z\">6.11am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Minneapolis mayor <strong>Jacob Frey</strong>: \u201cWe all need to work together to ensure the safety of our friends, family, and Minneapolis residents.

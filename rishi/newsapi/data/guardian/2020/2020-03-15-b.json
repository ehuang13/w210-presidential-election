  "<p>Donald Trump is \u201cstrongly considering a full pardon\u201d for Michael Flynn, his first national security adviser who pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his dealings with the Russian ambassador before Trump took office.</p> <p>Flynn cut a deal as part of special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/apr/18/mueller-report-read-in-full-trump-russia-document-what-does-it-say\">investigation</a> of Russian election interference and links between Trump and Moscow.</p> <p>He initially cooperated with the investigation, which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/apr/18/mueller-report-read-in-full-trump-russia-document-what-does-it-say\">concluded last year</a> without establishing criminal conspiracy but did lay out extensive evidence of contact between Trump aides and Russia and possible obstruction of justice by the president himself.</p> <p>Flynn, who was fired as national security adviser <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/17/us/politics/michael-flynn-donald-trump-national-security-adviser.html\">after only 24 days in the role</a>, has not yet been sentenced but a number of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2018/dec/05/robert-mueller-who-charged-list-trump-russia-inquiry-latest-indictments-flynn-manafort-cohen-what-happens-next\">Trump aides and associates</a> have been convicted and jailed in cases arising from Mueller\u2019s work.</p> <p>Flynn faces possible prison time.</p> <p>He sought to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jan/14/michael-flynn-seeks-to-withdraw-guilty-plea-trump\">withdraw his guilty plea</a> in January, \u201cbecause of the government\u2019s bad faith, vindictiveness and breach of the plea agreement\u201d.</p> <p>His change in tack came after he hired a new lawyer, Fox News pundit Sidney Powell, a longtime critic of the Mueller inquiry <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/01/17/maga-lawyer-behind-michael-flynn-legal-strategy-098712\">who has peddled numerous false conspiracy theories</a> on the investigation and other Trump policies and issues in prime time interviews.</p> <p>On Sunday, Trump <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1239242219019735042\">tweeted</a>: \u201cSo now it is reported that, after destroying his life &amp; the life of his wonderful family (and many others also), the FBI, working in conjunction with the Justice Department, has \u2018lost\u2019 the records of General Michael Flynn. How convenient.</p> <p>\u201cI am strongly considering a Full Pardon!\u201d</p> <p>Although Trump did not cite specific reports, Powell <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SidneyPowell1/status/1239030427932856321?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Etweet\">had tweeted hours earlier</a> an unsubstantiated claim that \u201c<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/FBI?src=hashtag_click\">#FBI</a> still hiding evidence of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Flynn?src=hashtag_click\">#Flynn</a>\u2018s innocence\u201d.</p> <p>Powell, who has also repeatedly retweeted antisemitic conspiracy theories, has contended in rambling legal filings that FBI officials altered an interview summary with Flynn and conspired to prevent him from obtaining legal counsel before he was interviewed.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s use of the presidential pardon power has proved <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/mar/28/trump-lawyer-presidential-pardon-flynn-manafort-mueller\">vastly controversial</a>, as he has commuted sentences or pardoned prominent supporters including former sheriff Joe Arpaio and former New York City police commissioner Bernie Kerik.</p> <p>In cases related to the Russia investigation, Trump has flirted with the notion of pardoning or granting clemency to Paul Manafort, his former campaign chair who was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/aug/21/paul-manafort-convicted-of-tax-in-virginia-federal-court\">found guilty of financial charges</a>, and to Roger Stone, a longtime ally who was found guilty of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/nov/15/roger-stone-guilty-verdict-wikileaks-hacking-case-latest-news\">lying to Congress and tampering with a witness</a>.</p> <p>\u201cSomebody has to stick up for the people,\u201d Trump said in February.</p>",
  "<p>Governor Ron DeSantis last week declared a state of emergency in Florida in the face of the coronavirus as millions of Floridians are set to vote on Tuesday in a crucial delegate-rich primary that will help determine whether Bernie Sanders stays in the Democratic presidential nomination race against Joe Biden.</p> <p>In Florida, the impact of the virus, if left unchecked, could be particularly harsh on the state\u2019s ability to allow people to vote or vote safely without fear of infection.</p> <p>The state is home to one of the largest elderly populations in the country, with around <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/FL\">20%</a> of the residents age 65 or older. While this age group tends to be a stable voting bloc for both political parties, it\u2019s also the most vulnerable to the virus \u2013 which has a mortality rate around 18% for those over 80 years old.</p> <p>DeSantis <a href=\"https://www.nbc-2.com/story/41884945/desantis-places-limit-on-florida-nursing-home-visits\">issued an executive order</a> barring people who may have been exposed to the virus from visiting nursing homes. He urged election officials throughout the state to consider moving their polling locations for the state\u2019s 17 March primary out of those locations.</p> <p>But over the weekend before election day, the state seemed to be lacking a unified response, with many polling stations in senior centers and retirement communities still operating at status quo.</p> <p>Workers at Country Aire Manor, Senate Manor Estates, and Crystal Lakes Manor \u2013 Pasco and Pinellas county polling sites all held in communities comprised entirely of people above 55 \u2013 said they had received no guidelines for the election, and were already receiving equipment to set up for Tuesday.</p> <p>\u201cAll locations will be open,\u201d said Robin Lehoux, who works at the parks and recreation department in Pompano Beach, Florida. She hadn\u2019t heard of any instructions from the state or local government regarding the Mullins Park Senior Center, a polling precinct where other senior programming had been shut down.</p> <p>But Florida\u2019s piecemeal response has been a stark departure from other election officials across the country <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/10/coronavirus-concerns-hurdle-voters-primary-elections\">implementing last-minute</a> measures to stave off concerns about contracting coronavirus at the polls. In Ohio, Secretary of State Frank LaRose ordered all polling stations in senior centers and nursing homes to be relocated. Louisiana\u2019s state\u2019s top election official, Kyle Ardoin, announced Friday the primary election next month would be postponed until June.</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019re playing catch up,\u201d said congressman Darren Soto, who represents a central Florida district that includes Orlando. Soto was still expecting a large voter turnout on Friday, and said he was focused on making sure voting precincts remained open so crowds were dispersed. \u201cThe main thing is to avoid long lines so people can conduct best practices.\u201d</p> <p>Some election officials are still taking full precautions.</p> <p>In Broward county, the local supervisor of elections announced this week the county was moving <a href=\"https://www.browardsoe.org/\">12 precincts </a>from senior centers and assisted living facilities to alternate locations. The county sent out postcards to all of the voters who would normally cast ballots there letting them know their locations had moved.</p> <p>Some senior living facilities don\u2019t want to move their polling locations because they are wary of having to transport residents, said Steve Vancore, a spokesman for the Broward county elections office. In such cases, the county elections office will make sure they have adequate cleaning and sanitization supplies, Vancore said.</p> <p>\ufeff</p> <p>State officials held a conference call with local supervisors of elections on Thursday to discuss sanitary measures they could take at the polls. In Volusia county, the supervisor of elections reminded voters they could bring their own pens to fill out ballots. In Marion county, elections officials have limited cleaning supplies and are encouraging people to bring their own from home, said Wesley Wilcox, the county\u2019s supervisor of elections.</p> <p>Florida is no stranger to adapting elections to emergencies.</p> <p>In 2018, Hurricane Michael derailed precincts in the panhandle, and forced election officials to extend voting hours and move locations. In 2016, a federal judge extended voter registration because of disruptions caused by Hurricane Matthew, despite opposition from Republican governor Rick Scott.</p> <p>But the state often only acts at the last minute. \u201cIt\u2019s a fight every time,\u201d said Brad Ashwell, the Florida director of All Voting is Local, an advocacy group. The organization was looking to support changes for the primary that could include an extension in vote-by-mail deadlines, poll worker recruitment, as elderly poll workers dropped out, and more state funds to advertise changes to the polling stations.</p> <p>\u201cIt seems like the freak out level is slowly creeping in here,\u201d Ashwell said. \u201cI don\u2019t sense anxiety among people. People are upset their conferences are being cancelled. But it doesn\u2019t seem like there\u2019s a real high levels of concern.\u201d</p> <p>Meanwhile, he said, the fears around Covid-19 could build on other issues that voters faced in the state. Under the pressure of lawsuit brought on by civil rights groups and Puerto Rican residents, the state has been attempting to provide bilingual language assistance at each station, which could be impacted if poll workers don\u2019t show up on Tuesday.</p> <p>And the state <a href=\"https://www.miamiherald.com/news/politics-government/state-politics/article218654810.html\">rejected</a> tens of thousands of mail-in ballots and absentee ballots in recent elections, stoking mistrust in that system.</p> <p>Danny Turkel, spokesperson for Voto Latino, an advocacy group focused on registering Latinx voters, said he predicted lower voter turnout in the election because of the state of emergency. He didn\u2019t think any specific community would be impacted, he said, but predicted that the uncertainty would keep voters at home.</p> <p>\u201cBeing from Miami, I\u2019m acutely aware of the difficulties people have,\u201d he said. \u201cThere were already obstacles in the way that the state has done nothing to improve.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI think it will show out in the numbers.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Ministers have been told they can no longer say there have been \u201cno successful examples\u201d of Russian disinformation affecting UK elections, after the apparent hacking of an NHS dossier seized on by Labour during the last campaign.</p> <p>The dropping of the old line is the first official admission of the impact of Kremlin efforts to distort Britain\u2019s political processes, and comes after three years of the government\u2019s refusal to engage publicly with the threat.</p> <p>Cabinet Office sources confirmed the position been quietly changed while an investigation into the alleged hacking of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/19/leaked-nhs-dossier-inquiry-focuses-on-personal-gmail-account\">451-page cache of emails</a> from a special adviser\u2019s personal email account by the security services concludes.</p> <p>Boris Johnson and his predecessor as prime minister, Theresa May, have both appeared reluctant to discuss Kremlin disinformation, with Johnson refusing to allow a report on Russian infiltration in the UK to be published before the election.</p> <p>Versions of the <a href=\"https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201719/cmselect/cmcumeds/1630/1630.pdf\">\u201cno successful examples\u201d statement</a> were regularly deployed in response to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jun/10/arron-banks-mps-call-for-police-investigate-russia-links\">allegations of Russian interference</a> in the Brexit referendum, to the frustration of MPs who believed a full investigation was necessary.</p> <p>Officials said the revised position about Russian interference was set out by Earl Howe, the deputy leader of the House of Lords, <a href=\"https://www.parliament.uk/business/publications/written-questions-answers-statements/written-question/Lords/2020-01-08/HL239/\">in a parliamentary answer earlier this year</a>, when he was asked if there were plans to investigate interference by foreign governments in December\u2019s election.</p> <p>The peer said the government was determined to protect the integrity of the democratic process in the UK. \u201cAs you would expect, the government examines all aspects of the electoral process following an election, including foreign interference, and that work is ongoing,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Stephen Kinnock, a Labour MP, said the government was being slow in acknowledging the disinformation threat from Russia. \u201cFrom the hacking of NHS emails to the St Petersburg troll factories and bot farms, it\u2019s clear that the Kremlin is pursuing a deliberate strategy of online disinformation and manipulation that is undermining our democracy.\u201d</p> <p>Security sources said that Russian strategy of \u201chack and leak\u201d and \u201cdisinformation and misinformation\u201d \u2013 which first came to prominence with the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jul/13/russia-indictments-latest-news-hacking-dnc-charges-trump-department-justice-rod-rosenstein\">hack of Democratic emails</a> in the run-up to the 2016 US presidential election that handed victory to Donald Trump \u2013 was becoming widespread internationally.</p> <p>Last month, the Foreign Office said Russia\u2019s GRU spy agency had carried out a series of <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/uk-condemns-russias-gru-over-georgia-cyber-attacks\">\u201clarge-scale, disruptive cyber-attacks\u201d in Georgia</a> \u201cin an attempt to undermine Georgia\u2019s sovereignty, to sow discord and disrupt the lives of ordinary Georgian people\u201d.</p> <p>But despite the strong words in support of an ally in the Caucasus, ministers had been reluctant to publicly call out any Russian disinformation efforts in the UK \u2013 and there has been little public acknowledgement of the NHS hack during the election, first reported by the Guardian.</p> <p>The scale of the Russian threat will be examined in the long-awaited report on Kremlin infiltration into British politics from the independent intelligence and security committee, which cannot be published until Downing Street appoints a new set of members following the election.</p> <p>Earlier this week, it emerged that among those in the frame were the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/mar/11/chris-grayling-to-head-body-that-will-have-final-say-over-russia-report\">error-prone former transport secretary Chris Grayling</a> and recently sacked environment minister Theresa Villiers.</p> <p>The NHS emails are believed to have been hacked from an adviser\u2019s personal Gmail account, and were <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/worldpolitics/comments/dkzlfc/officialsensitive_great_britain_is_practically/\">disseminated online via Reddit</a>, under the headline \u201cGreat Britain is practically standing on her knees working on a trade agreement with the US\u201d.</p> <p>Initially ignored, the documents covering six rounds of UK-US trade talks were eventually picked up by Labour from the posting <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/nov/27/jeremy-corbyn-reveals-dossier-proving-nhs-up-for-sale\">and produced </a><a

  "<p>The Scranton store where a young Joe Biden used to buy his candy is still in operation today, a stone\u2019s throw from the wood-slatted house where the presidential candidate grew up.</p> <p>It\u2019s called Hank\u2019s Hoagies now, in honor of the idiosyncratic Pennsylvania term for a sandwich on a long bread roll, and almost 70 years since Biden left Scranton, his presence lives on \u2013 in the form of a lifesize cardboard cut out lurking behind the store\u2019s front door.</p> <p>\u201cWe love him,\u201d Tom Owens, the owner of Hanks, said by way of explanation. \u201cHe\u2019s a great guy. I think he\u2019d be a great president.\u201d</p> <p>Biden\u2019s dream of becoming president had looked to be over at the end of February. The 77-year-old had lost, by some distance, the first three states of the Democratic primary, was<a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/02/01/politics/joe-biden-2020-campaign-finances/index.html\"> running out of money</a>, and had sagged badly in the polls.</p> <p>Yet Biden won South Carolina, the fourth state to vote, on 6 March with a surprisingly strong showing. Even so, few predicted what came next.</p> <p>Biden won 10 out of the next 14 states, on Super Tuesday picking up more delegates than anyone else. On the less super, but still delegate-heavy, Tuesday that followed, Biden won four out of six states and established a delegate lead that looks unassailable. </p> <p>Speaking after his first big win, Biden seemed as surprised as anyone, and not just because<a href=\"https://www.today.com/news/joe-biden-reacts-wife-jill-defending-him-protester-t175276\"> an anti-dairy protester had rushed</a> him on the stage.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"ce4f8bcd5f3bb8fbcc457e95641b536091e9439f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ce4f8bcd5f3bb8fbcc457e95641b536091e9439f/0_0_3500_2333/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Scranton, Pennsylvania: Biden\u2019s hometown.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Scranton, Pennsylvania: Biden\u2019s hometown.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark Makela/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThey don\u2019t call it Super Tuesday for nothing!\u201d Biden told his supporters in Los Angeles.</p> <p>\u201cTo those who\u2019ve [been] knocked down, counted out, left behind, this is your campaign,\u201d he said. \u201cJust a few days ago the press and the pundits had declared the campaign dead.\u201d</p> <p>Biden wasn\u2019t exaggerating. The influential, and frequently accurate, US polling site<a href=\"https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2020-primary-forecast/?ex_cid=rrpromo\"> FiveThirtyEight</a> had given Biden just a one in 12 chance of winning the nomination outright. Bernie Sanders was considered the most likely nominee \u2013 but not any more.</p> <p>Media coverage has shifted from talk of a contested convention, where neither Biden nor Sanders have enough delegates to win the nomination, to <a href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/joe-biden-dropping-hints-vp-150413413.html\">whom Biden will pick</a> as his running mate and <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/03/11/trump-will-corrupt-everything-sight-beat-biden-heres-whats-next/\">what a Biden-Trump election</a> will look like. Meanwhile, the ashes of Sanders\u2019 campaign are being sifted through to work out what went wrong.</p> <p>Super Tuesday not only handed back Biden the frontrunner status he held for much of 2019 \u2013 it handed him a big pot of money, too. <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/06/politics/biden-fundraising-bernie-brothers/index.html\">His campaign said</a> it had raked in $22m in the five days following that vote, a colossal amount considering it took Biden <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/02/01/politics/2020-democratic-race-financing/index.html\">three months to raise $23.2m</a> at the end of 2019.</p> <p>Biden\u2019s surge has little to do with Pennsylvania, which only votes on 28 April, and much more to do with<a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/nbcblk/black-voters-know-what-they-want-tuesday-it-was-joe-n1151001\"> his strong support</a> among African Americans in the south. Nevertheless, Biden\u2019s perceived earthy nature, which his Scranton childhood symbolizes, is a big selling point for voters hoping he could win back midwest states from Donald Trump in November.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/12/trump-coronavirus-election-impact-bernie-sanders-joe-biden\">\u2018Everything is up in the air\u2019: coronavirus fears upend US election campaigns</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cHe\u2019s an honest guy, the kind of guy you respect, which we seem to be lacking a little bit in our leadership now,\u201d Owens said. \u201cHe\u2019s down to earth.

Appearing at the Scranton Cultural Center \u2013 on the street where Biden grew up \u2013 Trump didn\u2019t hold back just because he was in Biden\u2019s hometown.</p> <p>Instead, Trump \u2013 who has faced much scrutiny over his own mental acuity \u2013 attacked Joe Biden\u2019s cognitive abilities, listing Biden\u2019s repeated gaffes and suggesting there is \u201csomething going on\u201d with the former vice-president.</p> <p>Biden didn\u2019t respond to Trump, who wasn\u2019t appearing in Pennsylvania by accident. Scranton, a town of 77,000 nestled in the rolling hills of north-eastern Pennsylvania\u2019s Wyoming Valley, is firmly a part of America\u2019s rust belt \u2013 a band of towns and cities stretching nearly a thousand miles from Wisconsin in the west all the way through Pennsylvania in the east.</p> <p>The communities in the rust belt suffered more than most from de-industrialization, as coalmines, steel plants and car factories closed, and some areas still suffer from chronic unemployment. Scranton was once home to the coal industry, and the city and region boomed in the 1930s and 40s, but the decline was just as swift. As the US turned to oil and gas for its energy, mines closed and jobs were lost.</p> <p>Biden and his family moved to Delaware in 1953 after his father struggled to find work in Pennsylvania. The future vice-president became a US senator for the state in 1973.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"5ec5895df634992907e701ebd5042c0b8ac704c1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5ec5895df634992907e701ebd5042c0b8ac704c1/0_0_4615_3077/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Joe Biden gets a hug from a supporter after he laid out his economic policy plan at the Scranton Cultural Center in Scranton, Pennsylvania.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Joe Biden gets a hug from a supporter after he laid out his economic policy plan at the Scranton Cultural Center in Scranton, Pennsylvania.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rick Loomis/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Trump swept into communities like Scranton in 2016, wooing disenchanted working-class voters who had previously voted for Democrats with his hazy promise to Make America Great Again. He<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/elections/2016/results/pennsylvania\"> won Pennsylvania</a> by 48.2% to Hillary Clinton\u2019s 47.5%, and he narrowly triumphed in Michigan, Wisconsin and Ohio, too.</p> <p>In 2020, that means Biden\u2019s background is a key part of his case to be the Democratic nominee. If he is chosen, it could prove crucial in recapturing those states and the White House. Biden\u2019s case for being the nominee is based, in part, around his ability to win in the midwest, and he will point to <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/03/10/us/elections/results-michigan-president-democrat-primary-election.html\">his convincing win in Michigan</a> on Tuesday as supporting evidence.</p> <p>That success in the rust belt was a long time in the making, and came after a concerted effort to make people aware of his upbringing: in the space of two weeks at the end of 2019 Biden was still pumping out shamelessly Scranton-specific advertisements, including \u201c<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Pr_NcJK5Tw\">Scranton Values</a>\u201d and \u201c<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S98mI1tTkVM\">A Kid from Scranton</a>\u201d.</p> <p>In those ads, as in person, Biden looks good for his 77 years. Straight-backed and easily 6ft tall, he looks little different from the decade-old cardboard version of him at Hanks, which apparently is a popular gift.</p> <p>\u201cI have the same cardboard cut-out. I got it for my mom,\u201d said Ailish Renton, who was buying a sandwich.</p> <p>\u201cShe likes him.

  "<p>Bernie Sanders had just dominated the Nevada caucuses, after strong showings in Iowa and New Hampshire, when the Vermont senator thundered on stage at the Cowboy Dance Hall in San Antonio to declare victory before a crowd of thousands.</p> \n<p>His speech that night was hardly different from the hundreds of speeches he had made before \u2013 and all the speeches he would make after.

Sanders not only lost Texas but a string of other contests that stripped him of his briefly held status as frontrunner, returning him to a more familiar role: long-shot insurgent chasing the establishment favorite.</p> \n<p>In frank but defiant remarks on Wednesday, Sanders acknowledged that he was \u201closing\u201d to Joe Biden after a stunning reversal of fortune. Biden, snatched only days before from the jaws of defeat, had just racked up four more victories, including in Michigan, a state that revived Sanders\u2019 presidential bid four years ago and where he had pinned his hopes of a comeback.</p> \n<p>Later that evening, Sanders folded himself into an armchair on the set of NBC\u2019s The Tonight Show in New York City.</p> \n<p>\u201cHow you feeling?\u201d host Jimmy Fallon <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flGJ4FxC33M\">asked</a> gingerly.</p> \n<p>\u201cI\u2019m feeling good,\u201d Sanders sighed. \u201cCould feel better.\u201d</p> \n<p>\u2022\u2022\u2022</p> \n<p><strong>Bernie Sanders had promised </strong>to build an unprecedented \u201cmulti-generational, multi-racial coalition\u201d of young people and working-class voters that would \u201csweep this country\u201d and transform American politics.</p> \n<p>\u201cYou cannot beat Trump with the same old same old kind of politics,\u201d he told supporters at a Super Tuesday rally in Vermont, where he had expected a celebration.</p> \n<p>But that night, voters in 10 of the 14 states holding primary contests disagreed, choosing instead a candidate who represents a return to the pre-Trump years.

Swing-district Democrats warned Sanders would hurt their chances of re-election, while members of the Democratic National Committee <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/27/us/politics/democratic-superdelegates.html\">plotted</a> to stop him if he arrived at the convention shy of the delegates needed to win the nomination outright.</p> \n<p>\u201cFrom the beginning, we knew this was going to be the fight of our lives,\u201d said Jennifer Epps-Addison, the president of the Center for Popular Democracy, which endorsed Sanders. \u201cWe\u2019re taking on not only the corporate elite of this party but the billionaire class, the pharmaceutical industry, the prison industrial complex, Wall Street, the insurance companies.\u201d</p> \n<p>Even so, the rapid alignment behind Biden, first by his former rivals and then by millions of voters, caught the campaign off guard. In a matter of days, the field shrank from seven top contenders to just two.</p> \n<p>Moderates, once paralyzed over which candidate to support, suddenly rallied behind the former vice-president. On the eve of Super Tuesday, Biden <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/02/joe-biden-rally-amy-klobuchar-beto-orourke\">won the endorsements of three former opponents</a> and more followed in a dramatic show of force that his team compared to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/kbeds/status/1236680535013015553?s=21\">the Avengers assembling.</a> Notably, Elizabeth Warren, Sanders\u2019 closest ideological ally, has not yet backed anyone.</p> \n<p>\u201cIn candor, the consolidation of candidates behind Biden happened sooner than anyone expected \u201d said the congressman Ro Khanna, one of Sanders\u2019 national co-chairs. \u201cThere was simply not enough time to build more broadly.\u201d</p> \n<p>\u2022\u2022\u2022</p> \n<p><strong>Bernie Sanders entered the primary with more built-in advantages </strong>than any of his rivals. His name recognition was sky high, he had an enviable list of small-dollar donors, an unshakable base of support and the experience of having just run a presidential campaign. Little changed from 2016, not the message nor the mission, not even the \u201cBernie\u201d logo. It would be a \u201cclass-conscious\u201d campaign for people who felt left out of the political process.</p> \n<p>\u201cHe represents the people who have been written off for much of their lives,\u201d Khanna said. \u201cFor the people who feel they haven\u2019t been heard, who feel marginalized, who feel the system hasn\u2019t been working for them, he is their voice.\u201d</p> \n<p>A heart attack in October nearly derailed his presidential bid. With Warren on the march and Sanders slumping, his candidacy appeared to be in freefall. But his loyal troops rallied to his side. A strong debate performance and a coveted endorsement from the congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez paved the way for a remarkable comeback.</p> \n<p>It proved to be a clarifying moment for the campaign. Sanders used the experience to connect more deeply with his supporters. At intimate town halls and on social media, his team elevated the economic struggles of people who couldn\u2019t afford medical treatment or prescription drugs. It was the foundation of the campaign ethos, \u201cNot me, us.\u201d</p> \n<p>But political reality set in after voting began. Despite his successes in the first three contests, Sanders struggled in a fractured field to retain the support he garnered four years ago. After the centrist vote coalesced behind Biden, he lost state he had won in 2016, when he was far less of a political force than he is today.</p> \n<p>Democrats\u2019 overriding priority in 2020 was to defeat Trump. And on that front, Sanders was losing to Biden.</p> \n<p>\u201cI cannot tell you how many people our campaign has spoken to who have said \u2013 and I quote \u2013 \u2018I like what your campaign stands for,\u201d Sanders said soberly from his hometown of Burlington last week. \u201c\u2018I agree with what your campaign stands for. But I\u2019m going to vote for Joe Biden because I think Joe is the best candidate to defeat Donald Trump.\u201d</p> \n<p>\u2022\u2022\u2022</p> \n<p><strong>Black voters have decided the Democratic nominee</strong> in every primary election since 1992. And this year, as in 2016, African Americans <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/politics/exit-polls-2020-south-carolina-primary/\">overwhelmingly</a> chose Sanders\u2019 opponent. In South Carolina, black voters propelled Biden\u2019s triumph and set in motion a turnaround that greatly narrowed the senator\u2019s path to the nomination.</p> \n<p>Supporters believe that Sanders\u2019 effort to make inroads with black voters over the past four years was obscured by Biden\u2019s longstanding ties to African American communities and his eight years as Barack Obama\u2019s loyal lieutenant. After being walloped in the south on Super Tuesday, Sanders\u2019 campaign <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gcY2Fhr5wo\">released</a> an ad that featured Obama praising the senator and saying emphatically \u201cFeel the Bern!\u201d But it did not yield the results he hoped.</p> \n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s a fundamental disconnect if folks still don\u2019t feel like he\u2019s the one who they can put their faith in after four years,\u201d said Cliff Albright, a co-founder of Black Voters Matter Fund.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"f9f21efff9a3b7798ba8c263372716406ca3df77\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f9f21efff9a3b7798ba8c263372716406ca3df77/0_165_4876_2927/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sanders visits custodian Davonta Bynes, from left, principal DaRhonda Evans-Stewart and social worker Kim Little outside a polling location in Detroit.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sanders visits custodian Davonta Bynes, from left, principal DaRhonda Evans-Stewart and social worker Kim Little outside a polling location in Detroit.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Paul Sancya/AP</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Ahead of the Michigan primary, Sanders earned the endorsement of the Rev Jesse Jackson, in what those close to him said was a deeply meaningful moment. In 1988, Jackson became the first black presidential candidate to win millions of votes on a similar platform of universal healthcare, a federal jobs guarantee and taxing the rich. Sanders, then the mayor of Burlington, was one of the few white public officials to endorse him.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe ideas resonate with black folks,\u201d Albright said. \u201cMedicare for All, free college, debt forgiveness, criminal justice reform, on those issues black folks are far closer to Bernie than to Biden. So it\u2019s not the ideas. It\u2019s this issue of electability.\u201d</p> \n<p>\u2022\u2022\u2022</p> \n<p><strong>Sanders now faces a legacy-defining decision: </strong>does he stay in a race that has become increasingly difficult for him to win or does he bow out now to begin the delicate process of unifying the party?</p> \n<p>Many supporters are not ready to see Sanders exit. Larry Cohen, a longtime Sanders confidant and chairman of his political non-profit, Our Revolution, acknowledged the senator faces long odds but urged him to keep competing. Every delegate Sanders accumulates in the primary, he argued, will be \u201ccritical to negotiations over the rules and party platform\u201d at the convention in Milwaukee this summer.</p> \n<p>\u201cIf he drops out now, those ideas are left with the delegates that he\u2019s won,\u201d Cohen said. \u201cThey\u2019re the voice for these issues.\u201d</p> \n<p>Further complicating the course ahead is a new challenge: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/12/trump-coronavirus-election-impact-bernie-sanders-joe-biden\">running for president in midst of a global health emergency</a>. The coronavirus outbreak has forced Sanders to abandon the stadium-size rallies that are a feature of his campaign.</p> \n<p>\u201cThis coronavirus has obviously impacted our ability to communicate with people in the traditional way and that\u2019s hurting us,\u201d he told reporters during a brief press conference in Burlington, where he has spent his time since cancelling an election night rally in Cleveland last week amid concerns about the virus.</p> \n<p>Yet the senator has signaled in recent days that he is unlikely to battle Biden to the bitter end. But he also made clear that there are issues on which he still intends to confront his opponent \u2013 and on which has the leverage to do so.</p> \n<p>On Sunday Sanders will appear at the next presidential debate, a long-sought one-on-one with Biden. At a press conference, he previewed a litany of policy questions that he planned to press Biden on: \u201cJoe, what are you gonna do?\u201d he intends to ask on issues from income inequality to student loan debt.</p> \n<p><strong>When Sanders launched his campaign in February </strong><strong>2019,</strong> he was asked what would be different this time. \u201cWe\u2019re gonna win,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/feb/19/bernie-sanders-announces-2020-run-presidency\">Sanders replied,</a> with the blunt assurance that thrills so many of his supporters.</p> \n<p>By his own admission, he is falling short of that goal. As Sanders fights for the future of his candidacy, there is also the sense that he has already accomplished more than he could have imagined in his nearly 50-year political career.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"d907cf5a90875b1ff42418617685d6dbcb0c3696\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d907cf5a90875b1ff42418617685d6dbcb0c3696/0_116_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sanders speaks during a rally in St Louis, Missouri, last week.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sanders speaks during a rally in St Louis, Missouri, last week.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lucas Jackson/Reuters</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Michael Kazin, a historian and co-editor of Dissent magazine, said Sanders has already achieved what many nominees and presidents never do: he has fundamentally shifted the ideology of the Democratic party on everything from healthcare and climate change to raising the minimum wage and taxing the rich.

Asked about the shortage, which left America lagging far behind South Korea and other countries, Trump said: \u201cI don\u2019t take responsibility at all.\u201d</p> <p>The past few weeks have also brought a cascade of false statements that sought to downplay the severity of the threat and wish it away. The coronavirus is not as bad as the seasonal flu, Trump has maintained, and will disappear in the warmth of spring.

He toured the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta wearing a \u201cKeep America Great\u201d cap, boasting of his \u201cnatural ability\u201d to understand the subject and making the bogus assertion that any American who needs a coronavirus test can get one.</p> <p>On Wednesday this week he addressed the nation from the Oval Office, live on primetime TV.

Trump <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/13/donald-trump-coronavirus-national-emergency\">declared a national emergency</a> that released $50bn for state and local governments.

Nobody elected Trump on the principle that he\u2019d be the hugger-in-chief or the consoler-in-chief.</p> <p>\u201cThe economy is his trump card at all times. There are people who say: \u2018I may not care for the tweets or his bombastic bluster but I\u2019m making money while he\u2019s in office.\u2019 But now people will get their monthly statement and ask: \u2018What happened to 10% of my portfolio?\u2019\u201d</p>",

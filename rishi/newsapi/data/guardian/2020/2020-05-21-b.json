  "<p>Britain and the US are facing calls to take some form of economic reprisal after China signalled that it was taking major steps to restrict civil liberties in Hong Kong <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/21/china-proposes-controversial-national-security-law-for-hong-kong\">by pushing through national security laws</a>.</p> \n<p>In an early sign of the British reaction, Lord Patten, the last British governor of Hong Kong and a passionate critic of Chinese regime, called the move a \u201ccomprehensive assault on the city\u2019s autonomy, rule of law, and fundamental freedoms\u201d.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/21/china-proposes-controversial-national-security-law-for-hong-kong\">'This is the end of Hong Kong': China pushes controversial security laws</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>He has recently written to the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, seeking assurances that the UK will not allow the Sino-British joint declaration to be torn up. The declaration, signed in 1985, made clear that Hong Kong\u2019s high degree of autonomy, rights and freedoms would remain unchanged for 50 years.</p> \n<p>In the US, Senator Ben Sasse, a Nebraska Republican on the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, condemned Beijing\u2019s plans, accusing the Communist party of \u201ctrying to kill Hong Kong\u2019s autonomy\u201d and promising action if Beijing goes ahead.</p> \n<p>\u201cBeijing\u2019s current proposal will effectively destroy the rule of law in Hong Kong and will give Chairman Xi\u2019s thugs legal cover to treat freedom-loving protesters as terrorists,\u201d Sasse said in a statement.</p> \n<p>The chair of the House foreign affairs committee, Michael McCaul, warned: \u201cAny law passed by the CCP that further stifles the freedom of the people of Hong Kong would only further erode the foundations of One Country, Two Systems, and will not be tolerated by the United States.\u201d</p> \n<p>Donald Trump has been piling new trade restrictions on China in recent weeks, partly in response to the Chinese handling of the coronavirus outbreak. But Republican Senators called for Trump in the specific case of Hong Kong to change the former UK colony\u2019s preferential trading status. A US government determination of the special administrative region\u2019s \u201cautonomy\u201d is a precondition for continued US preferential trade and investment terms distinct from those applied to China. Mike Pompeo, the US secretary of state, has already said it will be difficult to declare the region autonomous in view of recent arrests of protesters.</p> \n<p>The US president seems determined to make the threat posed by the Chinese Communist party the defining issue in the campaign for November\u2019s presidential election, so may need little encouragement to impose new economic tariffs. Steve Bannon, his onetime political aide, said Trump\u2019s three election themes will be China, China, and China.</p> \n<p>On Thursday, Trump told reporters at the White House that \u201cnobody knows yet\u201d the details of China\u2019s plan. \u201cIf it happens, we\u2019ll address that issue very strongly,\u201d Trump said, without elaborating.</p> \n<p>Given the long history of bipartisan scepticism towards China in Washington, Democrats are unlikely to oppose any measures. Indeed, pro-democracy legislators in Hong Kong such as Claudia Mo are already expecting Trump to respond to China\u2019s actions. \u201cChina\u2019s move might just be considered savage by outsiders, and there could be a huge political price to pay internationally,\u201d she said. \u201cIs it worth it?\u201d</p> \n<p>The UK government, by contrast, has been involved in a balancing act.</p> \n<p>Tighter UK takeover laws are due to be published soon, but the UK Treasury does not believe decoupling between the west and China is in anyone\u2019s interest. The UK is also the No 1 foreign direct investment site for China in Europe, even if trade between Germany and China dwarfs that of the UK.</p> \n<p>Politically, the UK does not want to jettison China. Lord Hague, a former Conservative foreign secretary, said this month that there was no major challenge facing the world that could be solved without the cooperation of China. That applies especially to UN climate change talks, a process in which the UK has the diplomatic lead.</p> \n<p>The UK intelligence agencies have also made the judgment that Chinese-owned Huawei firm could be at the heart of the UK\u2019s new 5G network, without compromising national security, a decision that has led to heated phone calls between Trump and Boris Johnson.</p> \n<p>But the pressure to change tack is growing. Tom Tugendhat, chair of the foreign affairs select committee, said this week UK relations with China had reached \u201ca turning point\u201d. He argued: \u201cThe UK has a special duty to respond since China is now directly and incrementally challenging the international rules-based system.\u201d</p> \n<p>The UK, he said, was dealing with a very different China from the China of 2010. \u201cUp until a decade ago, we saw that increased wealth led to increased democratisation. Well, that is not so any more.\u201d</p> \n<p>Labour\u2019s Asia spokesman, Stephen Kinnock, has also adopted a more active and assertive position.<br><br>But the perennial question is what in practical terms can the UK do to resist a takeover in Hong Kong, apart from express outrage. Extending the British National Overseas Passport offer to Hong Kong citizens is the normal demand.</p> \n<p>In a muted letter to the foreign affairs select committee, Raab said: \u201cIf there is any attempt to include national security legislation before wider concerns with rights and freedoms in Hong Kong has been addressed satisfactorily, it could further unsettle the situation.\u201d</p> \n<p>The UK Foreign Office said: \u201cWe are following reports and monitoring the situation closely. We expect China to respect Hong Kong\u2019s rights and freedoms and high degree of autonomy. As a party to the joint declaration, the UK is committed to upholding Hong Kong\u2019s autonomy and respecting the \u2018one country, two systems\u2019 model.\u201d</p>",

The long and grassy avenue sweeps down from the India Gate war memorial to the Rashtrapati Bhavan, or president\u2019s residence, with the circular Parliament House building in between. It was designed by British architects Lutyens and Herbert Baker following the 1911 decision to move the capital of the British Raj from Calcutta to Delhi.</p> <p>The geometric design, with wide avenues and sprawling lawns, was modelled on European capitals such as Paris but was also infused with Indian influences from the architecture of Hindu temples to the red-stoned grandeur of Mughal forts. The vista remains the only area in India designated grade 1 heritage status.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a71fb085488971475cdb14e9866e3e9ab1252558\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a71fb085488971475cdb14e9866e3e9ab1252558/0_0_4380_2920/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Donald Trump reviews a guard of honour during a ceremonial reception at Rashtrapati Bhavan.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Donald Trump reviews a guard of honour during a ceremonial reception at Rashtrapati Bhavan.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mandel Ngan/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Now, under a $3bn development plan, over the next four years an entirely new triangular parliament building will be erected next to the current heritage Parliament House, which was built in 1929, as well as a new residence for the prime minister. It will repurpose the north and south blocks into a national museum, demolish some newer ministry buildings and erect a vast new secretariat along either side of the vista, which will house all the government ministries currently scattered across Delhi. It will be the most significant transformation of the physical structures of government in India since independence; yet according to many opponents, it is not needed at all.</p> <p>The government and HCP Design, the architecture firm overseeing the project, say its necessity is not up for dispute. \u201cFrom the day after independence, parliament was too small, because the existing building was the council house for the British raj,\u201d said Bobby Desai, director of design at HCP. \u201cWe have limped along since then. It was certainly never designed to be a parliament building for a country of 1.4 billion people.\u201d</p> <p>Currently 550 representatives sit in the parliament, but is still based on the 1971 census when India\u2019s population was a just 580 million, meaning a single elected official now looks after an average of 2.5 million people. This will be up for review after 2026 and there are estimates it could raise the number of parliamentarians to over 900, thus requiring more seats.</p> <p>But opponents to the project have questioned why the Indian government cannot follow the example of ageing parliament buildings all over the world, from the French parliament to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2017/dec/01/a-tale-of-decay-the-houses-of-parliament-are-falling-down\">Houses of </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2017/dec/01/a-tale-of-decay-the-houses-of-parliament-are-falling-down\">Parliament in the UK </a>and the Senate in the US, and renovate the current structure, which is less than 100 years old.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4286a7a438bc0058ce7b3a84a98a09799332158d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4286a7a438bc0058ce7b3a84a98a09799332158d/0_0_3000_2002/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Central Secretariat in Delhi.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Central Secretariat in Delhi.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: jacus/Getty Images/iStockphoto</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Desai insisted that it was unsafe to do so, and that an entirely new building was the only option. \u201cThe current building has heritage status and physically can not be expanded any further, without being incredibly invasive,\u201d he said. HCP say their design will also create 75 acres more of public green space, including part of presidential estate being opened up for the first time as an arboretum showcasing India\u2019s biodiversity.</p> <p>With Delhi currently the most polluted city in the world, many have questioned why there are funds for this grandiose development but not to clean the city\u2019s toxic air. The coronavirus pandemic, and the massive financial strain it has put on India and its millions of migrant workers, has led many to argue that the billions could now be better spent on urgently needed healthcare and welfare. However, a petition for the vista development to be delayed due to the pandemic was rejected by the Supreme Court last week.</p> <p>\u201cEverything about this project has been flawed,\u201d said Anuj Srivastava, an architect who has been part of Lokpath, a group opposing the development. \u201cThere has been no transparency, no consultation and they are pushing forward with it so fast just so they can get it done before the next election. It\u2019s clearly nothing but a vanity project for prime minister Modi, to build parliament in his own image, at an unaffordable cost.. </p> <p>\u201cA heritage area like this is under strict architectural control but that seems to have been completely disregarded,\u201d Srivastava added. \u201cThe government is riding roughshod over all the committees and bodies which are supposedly meant to protect this area.\u201d</p> <p>The selection process that awarded the project to HCP, a firm known for their close ties to Modi, was accused of a lack of transparency.</p> <p>Desai acknowledged that there had been \u201cobjections\u201d to the lack of public consultation on a project. \u201cI\u2019m not saying we have absolutely achieved the mark of how public consultation should happen in these projects,\u201d said an HCP project spokesperson. \u201cI think there is some lack from both ends, both from us and also from the end of the government.\u201d</p> <p>Historian Sohail Hashmi said the project was problematic on both a practical and symbolic level. For the first time, it will see all government buildings concentrated in a single place. \u201cWe should be talking about distributing power and instead we have a design which will be the very embodiment of the concentration of power,\u201d said Hashmi. \u201cA monument to a crazed dictatorial desire to have all government in one place, under the watch of one man \u2013 our prime minister.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 21 May 2020.

  "<p>You could spend a lifetime preparing to interview John Malkovich. For starters, there are his films, about 90 of them \u2013 mainstream, indie, European arthouse, schlocky, literary, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/oct/29/being-john-malkovich-charlie-kaufman-review\">self-referential</a>, lots of stinkers and a few classics. But he says he doesn\u2019t even like movies. So then there are his more esoteric projects: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/nov/08/malkovich-malkovich-malkovich-catherine-edelman-chicago\">a </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/nov/08/malkovich-malkovich-malkovich-catherine-edelman-chicago\">photography exhibition by Sandro Miller in which Malkovich recreated</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/nov/08/malkovich-malkovich-malkovich-catherine-edelman-chicago\"> iconic portraits</a>, including Dorothea Lange\u2019s Migrant Mother; collaborations with classical musicians in which he reads out venomous critiques of the great composers. Finally, there is his real love \u2013 theatre. Fortunately, Malkovich doesn\u2019t expect you to have seen all his work. In fact, he gives the impression that he would be happy if you had seen none.</p> <p>I first interviewed him 27 years ago when he had just made <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0107206/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0\">In </a><a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0107206/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0\">the Line of Fire</a> \u2013 a thriller in which he plays an assassin determined to kill the president (and which is one of his classics). He didn\u2019t mention the film once in our hour-long meeting. Today, he is supposed to be promoting <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/ng-interactive/2018/mar/06/whats-on-netflix-and-amazon-this-month\">Space Force</a>, a Netflix comedy. Again, he doesn\u2019t mention it, until I ask at the end of our call. Instead, he talks about loss. All sorts of loss, from weight (shedding 32kg \u2013 5st \u2013 as a teenager) to hair to money \u2013 and even three siblings in their 50s. But, oddly, the more he talks about loss, in that hushed, melancholy voice, the more I begin to suspect he is one of life\u2019s unlikely optimists.</p> <p>Malkovich is 66, into his fifth decade in the film industry, and insists he has been winging it the whole time. \u201cI certainly never had a plan.\u201d Would it bother him if he never got another job offer? \u201cNo!\u201d He sounds positively enthused. \u201cIt would require a change in the way we live. But we already did that 12 years ago. So that would be fine.\u201d</p> <p>In December 2008, Malkovich lost his life savings. \u201cOur then business manager had invested pretty much everything we\u2019d ever made with somebody called Bernie Madoff.\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jan/12/bernie-madoff-prison-life-ponzi-supernova-podcast-experience\">Madoff defrauded thousands of investors out of an estimated $64.8bn</a> and was given a 150-year jail sentence in 2009. \u201cEverything I\u2019d ever made was gone.\u201d</p> <p>Malkovich had been directing a play in Mexico City and had just returned to New York. \u201cI saw a picture of Bernie Madoff in handcuffs and said to my wife: \u2018I\u2019m going to go to the corner to get a packet of cigarettes. I think we have a little problem with Madoff.\u2019\u201d How did he feel? \u201cYou know, that was a couple of days of shock, I suppose.\u201d He tells the story with such languid insouciance that I initially assume it must be for effect \u2013 but I don\u2019t think it is. This is the real Malkovich.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0b12278fb27bbbf8a3ef367278bb02c0c0df5a6f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0b12278fb27bbbf8a3ef367278bb02c0c0df5a6f/0_0_3600_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"John Malkovich as Dr Adrian Mallory in Space Force\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The final frontier ... Malkovich as Dr Adrian Mallory in Space Force.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Aaron Epstein/Netflix</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>How many millions did he lose? \u201cOh, I don\u2019t know. A lot. But I don\u2019t think it mattered that much. We just made changes to the way we lived and the money we spent.\u201d What changed? \u201cI had to do more work that paid for a number of years, and work all the time. And I stopped paying for everything. I just stopped paying for friends and family for a time. And we used to spend a lot of money producing movies that lost quite a lot of money. That stopped.\u201d</p> <p>Was he angry? \u201cNo. Not really. The first couple of days.\u201d Malkovich talks more slowly than anybody I know. Pretty much every word is accompanied by a pause. His language is flat and restrained \u2013 almost self-consciously untheatrical \u2013 even when telling the most dramatic stories. \u201cAfter a couple or three days, you go: \u2018You\u2019re lucky to be alive, you\u2019re lucky to have a job.\u2019 Almost no one has money in the banks. I read somewhere that a huge percentage of Americans wouldn\u2019t have $400 to put between their hands in an emergency.\u201d</p> <p>Malkovich grew up in a fairly privileged, but combustible, family in small-town middle America. His mother owned and edited the local paper in Benton, Illinois, and his father became an environmental journalist and activist. He grew up with three younger sisters and an older brother and has talked about the violence of his childhood \u2013 beatings from his father and his brother, Danny.</p> <p>Today, he says there was nothing remarkable about it. \u201cYou crossed the line and you got a beating. That was very common at that time. Sure, I had a lot of violence growing up, but so what?\u201d Is it true he would chase his brother with a butcher\u2019s knife? There is a long pause, even by Malkovich standards. \u201cMy brother didn\u2019t get anything he didn\u2019t deserve. That\u2019s not saying I didn\u2019t love him \u2013 he\u2019s gone now. He could be hilarious, very smart and extremely witty, but he was quite the torturer.\u201d Another pause. \u201cPeople get sick of being tortured.\u201d</p> <p>At the age of 16, he weighed 102kg (225lb) and was nicknamed Piggy. \u201cKids aren\u2019t very nice,\u201d he says. He went on a jelly-only diet and lost almost a third of his body weight. Yet even when he was mocked by his peers, he had style and self-belief. \u201cI used to play baseball and, when I was young, my father was my coach. He always said to me: if I cared about playing half as much as I cared about how I looked while playing, I could have been a very good baseball player.\u201d </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"14024c9e8b1d8984dbb9a71c578c26117e2968d3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/14024c9e8b1d8984dbb9a71c578c26117e2968d3/45_0_1165_1165/1000.jpg\" alt=\"John Malkovich with Michelle Pfeiffer in 1988\u2019s Dangerous Liaisons.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Life imitates art ... starring in 1988\u2019s Dangerous Liaisons opposite Michelle Pfeiffer, with whom he had an affair.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Warner Bros</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In fact, Malkovich had wanted to become a professional pitcher. He only started acting because he fancied a girl in the drama group. Even then, his route into acting took detours. He drove a bus, dabbled in biology and sociology at college, then studied theatre at two universities in Illinois \u2013 dropping out of both. He moved to Chicago and became a founding member of the Steppenwolf theatre group, alongside Terry Kinney, Jeff Perry, and Gary Sinise (who directed and starred with Malkovich in Of Mice and Men).</p> <p>In its early years, the theatre\u2019s ensemble also included Glenne Headly, whom he later married, and Joan Allen. The latter said the young Malkovich, who dressed in an array of purples and long scarves, was a cross between Oscar Wilde and Franz Liszt. He was compared to Brando after he burned up the stage in Sam Shepard\u2019s True West in 1980.</p> <p>Four years later, he received an Oscar nomination for his first (non-extra) film part, playing a blind man in <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087921/\">Places In </a><a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087921/\">the Heart</a>. <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0094947/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0\">Dangerous Liaisons</a> made him a household name in 1988. His on-screen affair with Michelle Pfeiffer was replicated off screen and led to the collapse of his marriage to Headly. He ended up with neither woman and suffered a year-long depression. In 1989, he made <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0100594/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0\">The Sheltering Sky</a> and fell in love with the second assistant director, Nicoletta Peyran, with whom he has been since.</p> <p>Slightly boss-eyed, balding by his early 20s, with legs like sequoias and an incipient belly, Malkovich made an unlikely leading man. But there was something about him \u2013 part brute, part beauty. He had grace, swagger, energy, sexuality. His contradictions made for a thrilling presence. The first time I met him, he gave a little bow when he introduced himself. He may have been 1.9 metres (6ft 2in) tall and heavily set, but he reminded me of a geisha.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I don\u2019t think anybody enjoys their family dying. I liked all mine. But what can you do? It\u2019s the final act in life</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In films, he has excelled at preening seducers. There are the obvious ones (the foppish predator Valmont in Dangerous Liaisons) and the less obvious (crazed Mitch Leary in In the Line of Fire is utterly bewitching). He can still be every bit as seductive today \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/sep/02/the-new-pope-review-john-malkovich-paolo-sorrentino-jude-law\">his fabulously vain John Paul III</a> in Paolo Sorrentino\u2019s classy TV series The New Pope is irresistible.</p> <p>Does he recognise himself in these characters? Not really, he says \u2013 apart from the vanity. \u201cMany of these characters are cold or cruel or intellectual.\u201d Is he cold in real life? He sounds hurt. \u201cMaybe shy sometimes. I don\u2019t think anybody who knew me would consider me cold. I may be wrong. And seducer the same \u2013 I wouldn\u2019t associate it with myself. Intellectual I wouldn\u2019t associate with myself. More class clown than any of that.\u201d</p> <p>He says he loves playing for laughs. One of my favourite Malkovich films is a little-known comedy called The Great Buck Howard, in which he plays a famous magician fallen on hard times. It is a gloriously hammy performance. He sounds delighted when I tell him. \u201cYeah, I enjoyed doing that immensely and am glad you noticed. I prefer to have fun.\u201d</p> <p>Really? There are so many stories of him being tough and intimidating, I say. \u201cI was athletic and I guess fairly strong in some ways, but don\u2019t consider myself tough; I don\u2019t consider myself someone looking for trouble.\u201d So these stories are apocryphal? Try me, he says. Well, what about the time you were mugged and ran home to get a knife, threw the mugger against a tree and said if he ever did it again he would be dead? \u201cIt\u2019s pretty apocryphal,\u201d he says. OK, the time you broke a bus window with your fist in temper? \u201cTrue. They wouldn\u2019t let me get on the bus.\u201d Were you in a lot of pain afterwards? \u201cI was, yes.\u201d</p> <p>Malkovich does bullying rage with aplomb on screen. He recently played a character based on Harvey Weinstein in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/jun/19/bitter-wheat-review-malkovich-and-mamets-monstrous-misfire\">the David Mamet farce Bitter Wheat</a>. So many actors tell you they need to be able to sympathise with their characters, but Malkovich\u2019s isn\u2019t having any of that. \u201cI don\u2019t feel the need to be sympathetic. I didn\u2019t see much in that character to feel sympathetic with.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"2d61284fc88ad82ad964b90793e5864842a4df55\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2d61284fc88ad82ad964b90793e5864842a4df55/0_0_1873_2050/914.jpg\" alt=\"John Malkovich playing a version of himself in Being John Malkovich.\" width=\"914\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I don\u2019t consider it to be so much about me as about the nature of celebrity\u2019 ... playing a version of himself in Being John Malkovich.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Cinetext Collection/Sportsphoto</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Was he shocked that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/11/harvey-weinstein-sentencing-rape-conviction\">Weinstein got a 23-year prison sentence</a>? \u201cI was shocked he even got a sentence. I don\u2019t know anybody who believed he would go to jail.\u201d He says it is too early to know whether the #MeToo movement has changed the culture of the film industry, but he hopes so. \u201cIt\u2019s a terrible thing if somebody\u2019s job depends on what sexual favour they will give in return for work.\u201d Was that the culture? \u201cSure.\u201d</p> <p>Did he experience it first-hand? \u201cWhen I was young, I had a professor in the theatre department who made some advances that were unwanted. I was 19, he was in his 50s.\u201d Malkovich says he was lucky. \u201cI just said it wasn\u2019t my thing, sorry. It was someone I was fond of and I liked. So life went on. I did transfer schools, but not really because of that. The Weinstein situation is very different. It was transactional. It\u2019s terrible for women, but it\u2019s horrific also just for the idea of work.\u201d</p> <p>Perhaps Malkovich\u2019s best-known film is Being John Malkovich \u2013 the brilliant absurdist comedy in which a puppeteer discovers a portal into the actor\u2019s head and then flogs tickets for it to the public. Malkovich plays Malkovich, or the Malkovich we think we know from his parts \u2013 serious-minded, arty, sleazy, with a volcanic temper. \u201cI don\u2019t consider it to be so much about me as about the future and about the nature of celebrity.\u201d He says that when he read the script, he loved it, but he asked the screenwriter, Charlie Kaufman, if he could direct it and Kaufman could make it about Tom Cruise. Kaufman gave him a firm no.</p> <p>For a number of years, Malkovich lived in France with his family (his children are 30 and 28). Now he is back in the US, living in Cambridge, Massachusetts, just outside Boston. Throughout lockdown, he has been at home with Peyran, now an academic, and their daughter, Amandine, who works in a grocery shop; his son, Loewy, is in Oregon, computer coding. No actors, then? \u201cOh, no!\u201d He sounds pleased.</p> <p>The actor has a reputation as a warmongering neo-con \u2013 he was in favour of invading Iraq and once said of the death penalty: \u201cI would have no problem pushing the switch while having dinner.\u201d But today he tells me he can\u2019t stand politics and hasn\u2019t voted since 1972\u2019s US presidential election, when he cast his ballot for the Democrat, George McGovern. \u201cI guess I think the system is pretty corrupt.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdpYpulGCKc\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/bdpYpulGCKc?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>The spoof is out there ... watch the trailer for Space Force.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Yet his latest project is a political satire. Created by the celebrated TV comedy writer Greg Daniels and Steve Carell, Space Force stars Malkovich as a slow-talking scientist alongside Carell\u2019s manic General Mark R Naird. It is uneven, but entertaining \u2013 part Dr Strangelove, part Veep, part soppy soap. Donald Trump has said <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2019/may/16/spacewatch-nasa-wants-one-point-six-billion-dollars-next-year-to-get-astronauts-to-moon-by-2024\">he </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2019/may/16/spacewatch-nasa-wants-one-point-six-billion-dollars-next-year-to-get-astronauts-to-moon-by-2024\">wants to get astronauts back on the moon by 2024</a>, but Malkovich says the concept predates the president\u2019s ambition. Does he think it is a good idea to revisit the moon? \u201cI don\u2019t know. It might be a better idea than creating more lethal versions of viruses in labs,\u201d he says, gnomically. \u201cBut it may not be the best idea we\u2019ve ever had.\u201d </p> <p>I ask why he is working so hard these days \u2013 for the love or the money? Both, he says. \u201cI always love working.\u201d Again, he says, he has been lucky.</p> <p>But you have not always been lucky, I say \u2013 I was staggered to read that three of his four siblings (all of whom became journalists) died in their 50s. It must have been devastating, I say. \u201cYeah,\u201d he says. \u201cBut what can you do about it? Amanda, then Mother, then Danny, then Rebecca \u2013 and that was all over a five-year period from 2009.\u201d Did it prompt an existential crisis? \u201cNo. I try not to worry about things I can\u2019t control. Unless, say, you had a terrible mother, I don\u2019t think anybody enjoys their family or siblings dying. I liked all mine. But what can you do? It\u2019s the final act in life.\u201d</p> <p>It is unusual to find someone so accepting. Does he have a religion, a guiding philosophy? \u201cNot really,\u201d he says. He tells me a story \u2013 about shooting a film in a small town in Canada and being asked to talk to a little boy with leukaemia, whose hair had fallen out. \u201cThey wanted me to talk to him because people somehow think people in the movies have some power to do good. He was self-conscious about his hair, and I said: \u2018We\u2019ve got the same haircut,\u2019 and he said: \u2018Yes, but not for the same reason.\u2019</p> <p>\u201cAnd that is how I look at life; I was very lucky. I\u2019ve been luckier than anybody I know. Luckier than all of the children in my family, all of whom were more interesting or more talented or smarter than me. So when things have happened that have been sad and difficult, I don\u2019t feel the need to complain about them.\u201d</p> <p>So, in a way, that is a philosophy, I say \u2013 and a surprisingly positive one for someone who sounds so relentlessly downbeat. \u201cYeah!\u201d he says, with an audible surge of enthusiasm. \u201cI\u2019ve never been a negative influence. I think I\u2019m quite a positive person, all in all.\u201d</p> <p><em><a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/title/81021929\">Space Force</a> is available to stream on Netflix from 29 May</em></p>"

Why do you believe Biden, and not Kavanaugh? Are they not both entitled to the same presumption of innocence, regardless of their political views? </p> \n  <p>Whitmer: \u201cYou know, Jake, as a survivor and as a feminist, I will say this. We need to give people an opportunity to tell their story. But then we have a duty to vet it. And <strong>just because you\u2019re a survivor doesn\u2019t mean that every claim is equal</strong>. It means we give them the ability to make their case, and the other side as well, and then to make a judgment that is informed. </p> \n  <p>\u201cI have read a lot about this current allegation. I know Joe Biden, and I have watched his defense. And there\u2019s not a pattern that goes into this.

We owe it to every woman who has a story <strong>to listen to that story, and then to vet that story,</strong> ask the questions and be critical thinkers, and then make a judgment, based on all of those pieces. I have done that in this instance. </p> \n  <p>\u201cAnd I will tell you this. I don\u2019t believe that it\u2019s consistent with the Joe Biden that I know.

But at the same time we pulled that back, I said ... I highly recommend [wearing masks] ... Unless you have a physical reason you can\u2019t wear the mask, and we understand that, but when you go into a retail store, that is the kind thing to do because I worry and we should all worry about the folks who are stocking shelves in grocery stores, the people who are [on] the check-out line who work there all day, and we got to try to protect them.\u201d</p> \n  <p>DeWine also <strong>stopped short of saying he would issue another stay-at-home order if cases started to rise</strong> after the reopening. </p> \n  <p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to watch numbers every single day,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we\u2019re going to communicate those numbers to the people of Ohio.

  "<p>One day in the autumn of 2015, a small but significant change was implemented at the Instagram offices in Menlo Park, California. Employees arrived at work to discover the rubbish bins under each desk had disappeared. The bins had allowed people to work efficiently \u2013 no one had to stand up to throw away a coconut water carton or wasabi pea wrapper after they\u2019d enjoyed the company\u2019s free food. But the bins weren\u2019t really Instagram\u2019s \u2013 they were installed by Facebook, which had purchased the photo-sharing app for $1bn in 2012.</p> <p>Kevin Systrom, Instagram\u2019s co-founder, didn\u2019t like the bins. He didn\u2019t like the cardboard boxes employees used to file papers and paraphernalia. He hated old, sagging birthday balloons. Instagram\u2019s offices, he explained, after removing the bins, should represent its ethos. They should be beautiful, simple, pristine \u2013 much like the app itself.</p> <p>Tech reporter Sarah Frier, author of <em>No Filter: The Inside Story of How Instagram Transformed Business, Celebrity and Our Cultur</em>e, explains this story is significant for three reasons. First, it demonstrates Systrom\u2019s aesthetic sensibilities. Second, it is indicative of his frustration with Facebook. (A year earlier he had torn down motivational posters belonging to the parent company, one of which said: \u201cDone is Better than Perfect.\u201d) And third, while the incident obviously affected Instagram employees \u2013 they dubbed it #trashcangate \u2013 it also represented an issue facing its users, who were, Frier says, \u201cintimidated about posting because they thought Instagram warranted perfection\u201d.</p> <p>In the decade since the invention of Instagram, social media has dramatically changed our lives. This pursuit of perfection has led to a rise in filter-inspired plastic surgery and a boom in oversized desserts that don\u2019t fit in your mouth, but fit perfectly into a little square posted online. How did this simple photo-sharing service get 1bn users in eight years? Does Instagram create or reflect our values? And, if the former, shouldn\u2019t we know a little more about the mindset and motivations of the men behind the app?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fd3f189c07edf1d670c0f4961cf6d91dc86707fa\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fd3f189c07edf1d670c0f4961cf6d91dc86707fa/0_0_2800_1680/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kevin Systrom, chief executive and co-founder of Instagram, who says he has no interest in leaving Instagram to run Twitter, despite the hopes of some on Wall Street that he would consider the job, in Menlo Park, Calif., June 22, 2015.

Frier interviewed a different person each day for a year after getting the book deal in 2018. Many spoke without Facebook\u2019s permission, and the majority of her sources remain anonymous. \u201cI realised that there was so much uncharted territory,\u201d she says. \u201cMy editor told me a book is ready to be written when you have 100 things in your pocket that nobody else has published.\u201d Frier surpassed this benchmark.</p> <p>One anecdote recalls Systrom saving actor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/ashton-kutcher\" title=\"\">Ashton Kutcher</a> from a 4am fire in a log cabin. In return, Kutcher helped Instagram grow credibility with celebs. (He hosted a party to introduce Systrom to superstars like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/ariana-grande\" title=\"\">Ariana Grande</a>, who the Instagram CEO didn\u2019t recognise.) Then there\u2019s the time the Instagram team celebrated the sale to Facebook with an all-expenses trip to the Trump International Hotel in Las Vegas, where they were greeted with personal congratulatory notes from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ivanka-trump\" title=\"\">Ivanka Trump</a>.</p> <p><em><strong>But gossip isn\u2019t</strong></em> at the heart of Frier\u2019s book and it\u2019s the mundane stories about Systrom that are most revealing. A Stanford alumnus who, at 25, worked in marketing at Google, he founded his company with software engineer and friend Mike Krieger in 2009. His original idea was a website called Burbn, which showed people where their friends were partying in real time. The name was inspired by Systrom\u2019s love of the whiskey. Throughout the book, Frier reveals his passion for prestige. Systrom enjoys fine drinks and bespoke bicycles \u2013 he snubbed Facebook\u2019s free coffee by importing beans that he only used at their \u201cpeak point\u201d (four days after roasting).</p> <p>\u201cI think that products are ultimately a reflection of their leaders,\u201d Frier says. \u201cHe wants everything to be at a level of quality because he believes in that quality.\u201d Systrom turned Burbn into Instagram when he realised there was a gap in the market for an app that helped people quickly share pictures from phones. But there was another problem he hoped to solve: back then, phone cameras were shoddy and took unattractive pictures. When Instagram launched, it offered filters that people could use to make their photos \u2013 and by extension, their lives \u2013 look more appealing.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"388700ca289dc6b3c4f6b7bfee70ad3b7af30fa6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/388700ca289dc6b3c4f6b7bfee70ad3b7af30fa6/0_559_2700_1620/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Zuckerberg used to end every staff meeting by shouting: \u2018Domination!\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Zuckerberg used to end every staff meeting by shouting: \u2018Domination!\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jessica Chou/The New York Times/eyevine</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>From the outset, his demand for quality shifted our reality. \u201cA filter on Instagram was like if Twitter had a button to make you more clever,\u201d Frier says. Instagram was heavily curated in its early days. Because there are no mechanisms to go viral on the app (users can\u2019t share posts), Instagram employees manually chose photos to push on its \u201cPopular\u201d page. \u201cInstagram had a hand in it in a way none of us on the outside would ever necessarily realise,\u201d Frier says.</p> <p>For example, in 2013, one Instagram employee dedicated his time to \u201cdiscovering pets\u201d. He tracked adorable dogs, birds and lizards in a spreadsheet before highlighting them on the official <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/instagram/\" title=\"\">@instagram</a> page. Frier chronicles how these decisions changed real lives. Courtney Dasher, for example, was a dog owner with a cute-looking pet named <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/tunameltsmyheart/?hl=en\" title=\"\">Tuna</a>. She quit her job and earned money via Instagram thanks to the decision of that employee. Dasher tells Frier that pictures of her dog helped fans cope with anxiety and depression. \u201cThe tastes of one Instagram employee directly affected the habits of the 2m people who now follow that dog,\u201d Frier says.</p> <p>How else have we been influenced by Instagram? Frier\u2019s examples range from how we organise bookshelves by cover colour to how once rarely visited tourist destinations are now trampled underfoot. \u201cBy constantly serving users images of visually appealing lives and hobbies,\u201d she says, Instagram forced people to \u201cmake their lives more worthy of posting about.\u201d She notes how leisure time became a status symbol \u2013 how Instagram gradually affected the economy, as people began to value experiences over things. More of us now \u201cpursue vacations in more picturesque settings,\u201d Frier says, in part because pictures taken in those locations look great on the \u2019gram. (She links the app with nine major retailers filing for bankruptcy in the US in 2017).</p> <p>And it\u2019s not just our lives that have to look interesting on Instagram \u2013 our faces do, too. Photo-editing apps, like Facetune, have boomed in popularity. Teens slim their noses, enhance their waists and hide their spots with the help of digital editing tools. One plastic surgeon told Frier that his clients now seek impossible-to-achieve adjustments inspired by the app. <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/kimkardashian/?hl=en\" title=\"\">Kim Kardashian,</a> owner of the seventh most popular Instagram account (and a famously large behind) can arguably be linked to the 20,000 people in the US who had a Brazilian bum lift in 2017.</p> <p>This isn\u2019t something Systrom actually wanted. Frier says that selfies and bikini shots were against the CEO\u2019s \u201cartistic sensibilities\u201d. These posts became popular despite the fact they were ignored by the official @instagram account. Yet Frier says that Instagram incentivised selfies and surgery through its metrics, if not its values. The choice to display numbers of followers and likes turned the app \u201cinto a game one could win\u201d. In 2017 a study by the <a href=\"https://www.rsph.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Royal Society for Public Health</a> found that Instagram was the worst app for teens\u2019 mental health. Was this an inevitable outcome?</p> <p>Frier starts her final chapter with a quote from an anonymous Instagram executive: \u201cEverything breaks at a billion.\u201d Instagram reached 1bn active monthly users for the first time in June 2018. \u201cI think at a certain point you lose control of something when it gets that big,\u201d she says, noting that 6m accounts on Instagram now have over 1m followers. \u201cThey wanted to build a better community, but they just didn\u2019t have the resources to do that, which is such a silly thing to say about a product that is part of a gigantic, well-sourced company, like Facebook.\u201d</p> <p><em><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/mark-zuckerberg\" title=\"\">Mark Zuckerberg</a> bought </strong></em>Instagram in April 2012, when the app had just 13 employees and hadn\u2019t made a single penny in profit. Zuckerberg declined to be interviewed for Frier\u2019s book, sending over a single emailed quote via a PR person. \u201cIt\u2019s simple,\u201d he wrote, when asked why he both purchased Instagram and committed to keeping the company independent, \u201cit was a great service and we wanted to help it grow.\u201d Despite the fact he refused to take part in Frier\u2019s reporting, <em>No Filter</em> is as much about Zuckerberg and Facebook as it is about Systrom and Instagram. (The word \u201cFacebook\u201d appears 1,179 times in the book, while \u201cInstagram\u201d appears 1,673.)</p> <p>\u201cA lot of times we think when a company has been acquired that their business story is over,\u201d Frier says. She argues this isn\u2019t the case here. The book chronicles the power struggles between Systrom and Zuckerberg. Frier believes Zuckerberg acquired Instagram due to his paranoia about competition. Consequently, Zuckerberg occasionally held Instagram back \u2013 after it reached 1bn users, the Facebook founder deleted a feature that automatically linked Facebook users to their friends\u2019 Instagram pages. He also prevented the company from hiring more staff and prioritised Facebook\u2019s content moderation over Instagram\u2019s. Ineffective moderation allowed troubling practices \u2013 such as the sale of opioids and the proliferation of self-harm \u2013 to flourish on Instagram.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1fd92787cb3a1ed70026eb181ee1481b75af435e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1fd92787cb3a1ed70026eb181ee1481b75af435e/0_180_5400_3240/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Instagram\u2019s founders, Kevin Systrom, left, and Mike Krieger, at the company\u2019s headquarters in Menlo Park, Calif.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Get the \u2019gram: Kevin Systrom with co-founder Mike Krieger.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christie Hemm Klok/New York Times/Redux/eyevine</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For every banal coffee bean anecdote about Systrom, there is a story that makes Zuckerberg look equally weird. In 2012, on the night the Instagram deal was finalised, the Facebook founder\u2019s sheepdog, Beast, bit the leg of Facebook deals director Amin Zoufonoun. He later joked that Zuckerberg showed more concern for the dog than the man. On a separate occasion, Zuckerberg lost a game of Scrabble to a teenager on a corporate jet and \u201cwas so frustrated he built a computer program to find him all the word options for his letters\u201d. He ended every staff meeting by shouting: \u201cDomination!\u201d</p> <p><em><strong>Both men</strong></em><em><strong> have</strong></em> had a profound impact on our lives and yet when we criticise Instagram, we often criticise women. Articles condemning beautiful influencers for earning millions on Instagram are viral fodder. \u201cThose stories take the airwaves and we don\u2019t think, \u2018How did we end up valuing this?\u2019\u201d Frier says. Though influencers are often denounced for not disclosing when they\u2019ve been paid to promote a product, Frier traces this issue back to Systrom. The founder was so dedicated to keeping Instagram aesthetically pleasing that he didn\u2019t want ads on the app to look like ads. (Once he even edited a brand\u2019s picture of French fries so they looked less soggy.)</p> <p>While we\u2019re busy criticising influencers, Instagram has also avoided scrutiny in other ways. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/mar/27/mark-zuckerberg-testify-congress-cambridge-analytica-data-scandal\" title=\"\">Zuckerberg was called before Congress in 2018</a> to answer questions about how Facebook allowed user data to be processed by the political firm <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/cambridge-analytica\" title=\"\">Cambridge Analytica</a>. Much was made of Facebook\u2019s role in helping <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\" title=\"\">Donald Trump</a> win the 2016 presidential election after Russian troll farms targeted divisive ads at Americans. And yet, six months after Zuckerberg\u2019s hearing, a Senate research group discovered that Russian ads had actually received more likes and comments on Instagram than Facebook. \u201cThe media spent a day writing about it, and then moved on,\u201d Frier says.</p> <p>It\u2019s easy (and perhaps enjoyable) to think that bikini shots and Brazilian bum lifts are Instagram\u2019s biggest impact on society \u2013 the reality is more complex. Because Zuckerberg allowed Instagram to maintain its independence, the app isn\u2019t tainted by Facebook\u2019s scandals. Yet ultimately, Zuckerberg still owns it \u2013 Systrom stepped down as CEO in 2018, partly because of contrasting values, partly because he wanted to return to his \u201ccreative roots\u201d. Now, one man controls Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, a global network of 2.5bn users.</p> <p>What next for Instagram? Frier says the site will continue to face moderation issues as Facebook is prioritised. She also believes advertising on Instagram will increase as Zuckerberg seeks a return on his investment. Frier also notes that the current coronavirus crisis may change the app. While some influencers are seeing their businesses crumble, others are becoming more creative by releasing books, video tutorials, workout classes and even their own filters. These changes might stick once lockdown is over.</p> <p>But is this really revolutionary? \u201cPeople still know the way to win at Instagram is to do something visually arresting,\u201d Frier says. \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to go away.\u201d From the moment Instagram introduced us to reality-adjusting filters, it changed the way we presented ourselves to the world. A striking observation in <em>No Filter</em> is that Instagram wanted to build a community that valued art and creativity. Instead, \u201cthey built a mall\u201d. While much is made of beautiful influencers flogging diet pills and luxury travel on the app, everyone on Instagram is selling their life in some way.</p> <p><em>No Filter by Sarah Frier is published by Cornerstone at \u00a320.

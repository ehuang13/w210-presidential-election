As the democrats take to the polls for the state\u2019s primary today, many analysts might overlook this long-ago swing state as an automatic win for former vice-president Joe Biden.</p> \n  <p>But Missouri is a bastion of Democratic voting blocs that can rally behind either Biden or Vermont senator Bernie Sanders: farmers, factory workers, elder black moderates, young progressive activists, conservative evangelicals ... take your pick.</p> \n  <p>While those distinctions typically only play into the <em>general</em> election, an increasingly tense showdown between supporters of moderate Biden and progressive Sanders could make Missouri more competitive than most analysts predict.</p> \n  <p>The one debate even more tense: whether it\u2019s pronounced Missour<em>ee </em>or Missour<em>ah</em>. Ask that and be prepared for a completely different type of fight. Here are two ways Missouri is a unique primary to watch.</p> \n  <p><strong>Region</strong>:<br><em>\u201cIs it the midwest, or south?\u201d </em>Both! Or neither, depending on who you ask. Located nearly dead center of the continental US, Missouri boasts a unique state culture that, at times, can reflect deep conservative attitudes of the south, while in other areas more reminiscent of the industrial rust belt.</p> \n  <p>For the 2016 general election, FiveThirtyEight\u2019s Harry Enten <a href=\"https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/missouri-could-be-a-swing-state-again/\">broke down</a> why the \u2018show me\u2019 state is such an important political outlier:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Missouri was a key swing state for much of the 20th century.

The station is in one of the city\u2019s poorest neighborhoods and is likely near 100% African American. That doesn\u2019t bode well for Democrats. The low turnout among black voters in Detroit was a big part of why Hillary Clinton lost in the primary and general. </p> \n  <p>However, several miles away, still on Detroit\u2019s east side, a steady number of voters stopped in a precinct in another economically struggling neighborhood. The station is within sight of about 10 vacant homes.

You know, what do we have to lose?\u201d <br></p> \n  <p>Charles said he sees the vote in Detroit breaking down along generational lines. His older friends and family support Biden because he was Obama\u2019s vice-president and they know and trust him. His younger friends and family support Sanders. Several other older voters who stopped in the station ahead of Charles said they planned to vote for Biden, but declined to discuss why. <br></p> \n  <p>Though he cast his ballot for Sanders, Charles doesn\u2019t believe the progressive candidate is better suited than Biden to beat Trump. He said he isn\u2019t sure about who would win in a match up between Trump and Sanders, but added: \u201cI\u2019m going to do my part. Anything can happen.\u201d Are there enough Sanders supporters in Detroit doing their part for the Vermont senator to repeat his 2016 upset of Clinton? Charles said he believes there are. </p> \n  <p>\u201cHe won it the last time, so I think he\u2019s going to get a good turnout this time around,\u201d he said. <br></p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-03-10T19:00:33.423Z\">at 7.00pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e67a5b88f085f0b8d945adc\" class=\"block is-summary\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-10T16:08:03.675Z\">4.08pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Lunchtime!

Retweeting Keane\u2019s thoughts on the ceremony, Trump said the honour was \u201cwell deserved\u201d.</p> \n  <p>Keane and Trump go back a long way, the four-star general and Fox News analyst, another New Yorker, having twice turned down offers to be Trump\u2019s secretary of defense but having served as an informal adviser.</p> \n  <p>Keane is a named source for Trump and his Generals, a recent book by Peter Bergen, who writes that the general became \u201calmost a shadow national security adviser\u201d to Trump at a time when the president was notably failing to get on with HR McMaster, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/feb/24/trump-hr-mcmaster-book-national-security-adviser\">the general who officially filled that role</a>.</p> \n  <p>Bergen, a CNN analyst, recounts Keane telling Trump one way to signal to North Korea he was serious about possible military action over its nuclear weapons programme would be \u201cto stop sending military families to South Korea\u201d. Trump, Bergen writes, subsequently ordered an evacuation of US civilians, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/dec/09/trump-seoul-evacuation-north-korea-book\">sending official aides into a panic</a>.</p> \n  <p>The order never went through.</p> \n  <p>Bergen also writes that Keane has not only offered Trump only positive advice.

Think of each district as holding a bucket of delegates. There are also two buckets of delegates in each state awarded based on the overall statewide vote.</p> \n  <p>On Tuesday, that makes for 51 buckets of delegates across the six states. Party rules say each viable candidate wins a proportion of the delegates in each bucket based on their share of the votes cast for the viable candidates in that bucket. Viable means they have past a 15% support threshold - almost certainly completely putting Tulsi Gabbard out of the equation.</p> \n  <p>Buckets that have an odd number of delegates are impossible to split evenly, meaning either Sanders or Biden is guaranteed to win at least one more than the other.</p> \n  <p>Say, for example, there are seven delegates in a bucket, and Sanders gets 51% and Biden gets 49% of the viable votes. In delegates, that\u2019s 3.57 to 3.43 a difference of just 0.14 delegates. But thanks to rounding, Sanders gets four and Biden gets three. If it was an even bucket with six delegates at play, they\u2019d get three each.<br></p> \n  <p>Nearly two-thirds of the 352 delegates at stake on Tuesday are in buckets with an odd number of delegates more than on any other night with more than one primary. Getting narrowly ahead in a tight race in those odd buckets is much more rewarding in terms of delegates.</p> \n  <p>Easy, eh?</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-03-10T13:03:49.325Z\">at 1.03pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e676ba38f08c2df6d276969\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-10T10:30:33.763Z\">10.30am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Is it all over for Bernie Sanders if Joe Biden wins in Michigan?

  "<p>There\u2019s nothing like a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-elections-2020\" title=\"\">US presidential election</a> cycle to prompt British pundits to think about Anglo-America as a \u201cthing\u201d. The UK is the 51st state in all but name, right? In reality, the similarities are more complex, and the differences are stark.</p> <p>You can understand where the idea comes from. On both sides of the Atlantic 40 years of Reaganite and Thatcherite policies of financial deregulation, union emasculation, and a sanguine attitude to de-industrialisation, have sculpted Anglo-American society in similar ways: declining <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/mar/07/life-expectancy-slumps-by-five-months\" title=\"\">life expectancy</a> among those whose communities destroyed as a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/jun/23/why-is-life-expectancy-falling\" title=\"\">consequence of these policies</a>; and a surviving population that blames immigrants for their problems.</p> <p>The political response to these economic and social conditions has been the election of two unsuitable philanderers, Donald Trump and Boris Johnson. Both were initially resisted by party elites, who then abjectly surrendered. All dissenters have been purged. Their advisers are bizarre, comic book villain-types such as Stephen Miller and Dominic Cummings.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/dec/10/socialism-america-history-politics-apple-pie\">Socialism is as American as apple pie. Yes, really | Nathan Robinson</a> </p> </aside>  <p></p> <p>However, the differences between Labour and the Democrats remain profound. The sudden revival of Joe Biden\u2019s fortunes is proof. Both parties are lazily described as being of the \u201cleft\u201d but really, America hasn\u2019t had a \u201cleft\u201d in the British sense as long as I\u2019ve been alive, which is a very long time.</p> <p>The Labour party was from its inception a socialist party, and even though <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jan/28/richard-burgon-backs-public-ownership-and-labour-clause-iv-revamp\" title=\"\">clause IV </a>was taken out of the party\u2019s constitution the ideology of public ownership runs strong in the membership and recent leadership of the party. The \u201cleft\u201d wing of the US Democratic party embraces the legacy of Franklin D Roosevelt\u2019s New Deal \u2013 but while his opponents in the 1930s called it \u201csocialism\u201d, it wasn\u2019t. Actual socialism never found a foothold in the US \u2013 perhaps because it was commonly called \u201cgodless socialism\u201d, especially in the south. America is a damned religious country. And Americans have traditionally had no problem with billionaires \u2013 perhaps because many of them fervently believe in the American myth that anyone can get rich if they work hard enough. The tragedy of Bernie Sanders is that he is a New Deal Democrat but insists on calling himself a socialist. You don\u2019t win in America using that language. The sudden revival of Biden\u2019s fortunes is proof.</p> <p>Then there\u2019s the governmental structures these political forces operate within. In Britain, the executive is housed in the legislature. Johnson leads a well-whipped majority and a prime minister with a majority of this size is in charge of an \u201celective dictatorship\u201d. In the US, the executive branch of government is separate from the legislature. This check on presidential power is profound, especially when, as is the case now, one of the branches of Congress is in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/nov/06/midterm-elections-2018-exit-polls-voters\" title=\"\">control of the opposition party</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7a452b3d395d74ef38b3fd9f95d4d5a326d2697b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7a452b3d395d74ef38b3fd9f95d4d5a326d2697b/24_0_1800_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Zac Goldsmith is sworn in as a member of the House of Lords.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Zac Goldsmith, who was elevated to the Lords \u2013 and returned to the cabinet \u2013 after losing his seat in the last election.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: House of Lords/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Barack Obama found that out when he tried to appoint <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2016/mar/16/obama-nominates-merrick-garland-supreme-court-dc-appeals-court-judge\" title=\"\">Merrick Garland</a> to the supreme court and the Republican-controlled Senate, which has the constitutional role of approving high court judges, would not give Garland the courtesy of a hearing.

It is elected. Senators need to pander to voters successfully, unlike for example, Zac Goldsmith, who was elevated to the Lords \u2013 and returned to the cabinet \u2013 after losing his seat in the last election.</p> <p>Then there is money. In the US there is tons of it surrounding elections. Unimaginable sums, really: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/aug/07/american-democracy-crisis-trump-supreme-court\" title=\"\">$6.5bn</a> was spent on the 2016 presidential election across all races, with most of that money going on broadcast media advertising. There has always been money in American politics, but in the past decade it has grown to narco-trafficker levels of cash.</p> <p>In 2010, the supreme court decided \u2013 in the case titled <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jan/21/citizens-united-v-fec-supreme-court-ruling-billionares\" title=\"\">Citizens United v Federal Election Commission</a> \u2013 that corporations had first amendment rights \u2013 free speech rights, like individuals \u2013 and putting restrictions on corporations giving money to air political advertisements in broadcast media was an infringement of that right. Since then the cash has flowed in and Americans are bombarded with paid political propaganda non stop.</p> <p>In the UK there is no first amendment and there are firm restrictions on political advertising on television and radio. Party political broadcasts are strictly rationed and election campaigns take place within tightly defined windows. But there is a \u201cfree\u201d press. Conservative politicians don\u2019t need to raise money for advertising, they get it for free. Every day, outside every newsagent, there is a rack of blaring headlines trumpeting Conservative policies or viewpoints. They\u2019re not far off the billboards that line US highways. Decades of exposure to them, and it\u2019s no wonder that Brexit won.</p> <p>Clearly, when it comes to propaganda channels, both countries have them, which brings me back to where I started: Anglo-America. Maybe some day Anglo-America will be a reality \u2013 after Brexit negotiations collapse, and the UK disintegrates, and England applies to become the 51st state. Then American politics and English politics will be the same. But that will not happen this electoral cycle or the next.

  "<p>Marta Rivera was an avid voter in Puerto Rico \u2013 one who enjoyed researching political candidates each election cycle in the US territory. Then, in 2017, Hurricane Maria swept through the island, destroying homes, killing thousands of people, and leaving millions of others stranded. Rivera became one of the tens of thousands of storm refugees who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/oct/12/florida-puerto-rican-influx-hurricane-maria\">moved to Florida</a> in the following months to try to build a new life.</p> <p>Now Rivera and the other hurricane refugees have become a vital voting bloc coveted by both the Democratic and Republican parties in the swing state, where elections are often won by just tens of thousands of votes. While the last census data counted about <a href=\"https://www.bebr.ufl.edu/population/research-report/estimating-migration-puerto-ricans-florida-using-flight-passenger-data-0\">50,000</a> in the group, later estimates say there could now be more than 130,000 people who have resettled in Florida.</p> <p>And they are largely politically active. Rivera, whose home was uninhabitable after the storm, moved close to her daughter, who already lived in the central Florida city of Gainesville. The septuagenarian left behind her church, her friends and other relatives. But she did not want to give up her right to vote, now more powerful than ever, since Puerto Ricans can only vote in the presidential primaries when living in the territory.</p> <p>But to have full representation, the community has also taken on a new battle on the mainland: Rivera is the lead plaintiff in <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/crt/section-4-voting-rights-act\">a lawsuit</a> demanding that Florida help Spanish speakers vote by providing bilingual ballots and poll workers. This is a legal right under the Voting Rights Act, but one that the state has historically neglected.</p> <p>The outcome of the case could change the primary election next week, and the course of the presidential election. \u201cIf Democrats want to win, they have to drive Hispanic turnout, specifically Puerto Rican and non-Cuban voters,\u201d said Daniel A Smith, a political science professor at the University of Florida who specializes in elections.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"d3b87f9e1573f9e2c5ea4997b5aa14bfaa0e2210\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d3b87f9e1573f9e2c5ea4997b5aa14bfaa0e2210/0_0_5472_3648/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Chef Jos\u00e9 Mend\u00edn and Maximo Silva play dominoes at La Placita, Mend\u00edn\u2019s restaurant in Miami.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Chef Jos\u00e9 Mend\u00edn and M\u00e1ximo Silva play dominoes at La Placita, Mend\u00edn\u2019s restaurant in Miami.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Zak Bennett/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Many Puerto Ricans fleeing to Florida arrived with the burden of trauma in the storm\u2019s aftermath, their finances stretched to the max. They also felt sidelined by the Trump administration after the federal government\u2019s <a href=\"https://gh.bmj.com/content/4/1/e001191\">insufficient response</a> to Hurricane Maria. \u201cHe could have done more for Puerto Rico,\u201d Rivera said in a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=2201&amp;v=z_MKoX2ZwbM&amp;feature=emb_title\">video</a> oral history. \u201cHe didn\u2019t do anything because he didn\u2019t want to.\u201d</p> <p>In a state where Trump <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/aug/02/florida-2020-election-latinx-voters-trump-democrats\">edged out</a> Hillary Clinton by a 1.2% margin (or about 113,000 votes) in 2016, that sentiment could influence the primary and general election this year. Especially since entire districts are being transformed by their new residents: in Osceola and Orange counties, for example, the Puerto Rican population has jumped a combined 12.5%, or 37,000 residents, <a href=\"https://www.orlandosentinel.com/news/florida/os-ne-census-florida-puerto-rico-population-increase-20190927-lx3i6rxghzhehhf3md6x7hgfmu-story.html\">after</a> Hurricane Maria. Both counties tend to vote Democratic, but the new residents could determine what happens this year.</p> <p>It\u2019s clear all parties are vying for their vote. Democrats Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren introduced and supported legislation to rebuild Puerto Rico since the storm. And Joe Biden has sweeping support from Puerto Ricans in both Florida and on the island, with a roster of <a href=\"https://www.sun-sentinel.com/news/politics/os-ne-biden-puerto-rico-endorsements-20191205-24n652qemrdu3dfgqnwip25qu4-story.html\">25 endorsements</a> from politicians in the community. Meanwhile, the Republican vice-president, Mike Pence, targeted the Puerto Rican voters when he <a href=\"https://www.wesh.com/article/vice-president-mike-pence-in-kissimmee/30548545\">stopped</a> in Kissimmee, Florida, earlier this year.</p> <p>There\u2019s no certainty how many people from the community will vote, or where their loyalties lie. Though a quarter of Florida\u2019s 21 million people identify as Latinx, the community is not a monolith. Cuban voters have historically voted Republican, but <a href=\"https://www.sun-sentinel.com/news/politics/fl-ne-cuban-american-poll-20190131-story.html\">younger generations</a> are moving further left. And while Puerto Ricans <a href=\"https://www.wesh.com/article/vice-president-mike-pence-in-kissimmee/30548545\">tend to vote</a> Democratic, the hurricane refugees largely helped elect as governor in 2018 the Republican Ron de Santis, who <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/states/florida/story/2018/08/16/desantis-heads-to-puerto-rico-to-stump-for-boricua-votes-in-florida-562208\">traveled</a> to Puerto Rico to show his dedication to the group.</p> <p>For Mario Rosa, who moved to Florida in 2018 after Hurricane Maria damaged his home in Puerto Rico, this election will be about restoring the image of the country. \u201cI feel that the current administration has sullied the reputation of the United States abroad.\u201d The 31-year-old, who plans to vote Democratic, hopes that candidates will at least keep Puerto Ricans in mind.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"b82766ae2cd14e44b28babb4c2a68d249c47a0c1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b82766ae2cd14e44b28babb4c2a68d249c47a0c1/0_0_5472_3648/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Puerto Ricans play dominoes, a popular game of luck and strategy commonly played in Puerto Rico, at La Placita, a restaurant by chef Jos\u00e9 Mend\u00edn that takes a modern approach to Puerto Rican food, in Miami, Florida.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Puerto Ricans play dominoes, a popular game of luck and strategy commonly played in Puerto Rico, at La Placita restaurant in Miami, Florida.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Zak Bennett/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But the community\u2019s voice could also be dampened if Florida election officials don\u2019t follow the rules.</p> <p>Two years ago, when Rivera registered to vote in Florida for the 2018 midterm elections, she found that the materials were completely in English, which she doesn\u2019t speak or read fluently. In the coming months, she and other storm refugees took part in a lawsuit to demand that Florida make Spanish-language ballots and assistance available in the 32 counties where the Puerto Ricans have settled.</p> <p>\u201cFor people to meaningfully participate in the democratic process, they should be able to understand what they are voting on,\u201d said Stuart Naifeh, a voting rights lawyer with Demos, one of the groups representing the case, along with advocacy group LatinoJustice PRLDEF and the labor union SEIU.</p> <p>Just before the November 2018 midterm election, a federal judge sided with Rivera and the other plaintiffs. But less than two days before the election, the lawyers found that Duval county, which includes Florida\u2019s largest city by population, had still failed to provide sample Spanish ballots during early voting.</p> <p>Nydia Irizarry, a 47-year-old Puerto Rican native and storm refugee who lives outside of Orlando, said she did her best to muddle through the ballot during the midterm election in 2018. But she ended up selecting candidates randomly and didn\u2019t fully understand the amendments. \u201cI didn\u2019t really know what I was doing,\u201d she said. \u201cI had to vote like a crazy person.\u201d</p> <p>Last year, after another push from Rivera and other plaintiffs, Governor DeSantis<a href=\"https://www.flgov.com/2019/04/11/governor-ron-desantis-directs-florida-department-of-state-to-address-availability-of-spanish-language-ballots-for-the-2020-elections/\"> directed</a> the state\u2019s top election official to direct all 67 Florida counties to offer ballot translation and \u201cSpanish-language voter assistance\u201d before the 2020 election. And a federal judge ordered the targeted counties to provide Spanish ballots, bilingual poll workers, toll-free Spanish-language hotlines, and online information.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"47831a33f0c11ff8ccab97d3b6752f32c3930008\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/47831a33f0c11ff8ccab97d3b6752f32c3930008/0_0_5379_3586/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Patrons stand outside El Bori, a popular food truck serving Puerto Rican cuisine, in Miami.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Patrons stand outside El Bori, a popular food truck serving Puerto Rican cuisine, in Miami.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Zak Bennett/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But state county election officials said they had trouble meeting the mandate. \u201cWe have been trying and trying and trying to recruit bilingual election poll workers, and I cannot invent them,\u201d Alan Hays, supervisor of elections in Lake county, Florida, said at a workshop for election officials last May, of which the Guardian obtained an audio recording.</p> <p>That gap could leave voters alienated. \u201cThey feel like their vote won\u2019t matter,\u201d said Kira Romero-Craft, an attorney with LatinoJustice PRLDEF, an advocacy group that filed the case along with Demos, about the Puerto Rican community. \u201cThey feel like they are not in this community, that they don\u2019t have a voice.\u201d</p> <p>In December, three months before Florida would hold the primary election, Hays said in an email that he had made some progress: his Spanish translator had recommended two fellow Spanish speakers to go through poll worker training. He was also trying to recruit more workers to have at least one at each precinct.</p> <p>But as with the midterms, it will only become clear in the next few days whether the lawsuit had the intended impact on the ground.</p> <p>Meanwhile, those who spent their lives voting on the island, without the full representation that Florida offers, the presidential election presents a new opportunity. And the ability to more significantly choose who will make it a little bit easier to rebuild their lives on new soil.</p> <p>\u201cHonestly I just want them to remember us, just to remember we exist,\u201d Rosa said.</p>",

The council exists to ensure a smooth transition of power and was instrumental in securing Mohammed bin Salman as crown prince in 2017.

He has inaccurately claimed that a vaccine will be available soon, that anyone who wants a test can get one and that the virus will be killed off by the spring weather. \u201cA lot of people think that goes away in April with the heat \u2013 as the heat comes in,\u201d he said last month. \u201cTypically, that will go away in April.\u201d</p> <p>And despite years of warnings from scientists that a pandemic would come someday, Trump has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/31/us-coronavirus-budget-cuts-trump-underprepared\">reduced the the White House national security staff and cut jobs addressing global pandemics</a>. He has sought to portray the coronavirus as a bolt from the blue. \u201cWho would have thought?\u201d he asked during a visit to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta. \u201cWho would have thought we would even be having the subject?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>When reality does not fit, Trump tries to find a workaround. Visiting the CDC while wearing a red \u201cKeep America Great\u201d cap, he suggested he would prefer that people exposed to the virus on a cruise ship be left aboard so they would not inflate the national total. \u201cI like the numbers being where they are,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t need to have the numbers double because of one ship that wasn\u2019t our fault ... I\u2019d rather have them stay on, personally.\u201d</p> <p>The blas\u00e9 president spent the weekend playing golf in Florida, then began Monday fundraising for his re-election before making <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/09/coronavirus-white-house-trump-pence-testing\">a fleeting appearance</a> at a White House briefing. On Twitter, he continued to deny the impact of the virus on tumbling stocks: \u201cSaudi Arabia and Russia are arguing over the price and flow of oil. That, and the Fake News, is the reason for the market drop!\u201d</p> <p>He also continued to express \u201cnothing to see here\u201d views out of step with the public mood. \u201cSo last year 37,000 Americans died from the common Flu,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIt averages between 27,000 and 70,000 per year. Nothing is shut down, life &amp; the economy go on. At this moment there are 546 confirmed cases of CoronaVirus, with 22 deaths.

Such comments have caused dismay among public health officials. Critics say the president is clearly out of his depth.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jan/11/donald-trump-rick-wilson-running-against-the-devil\">Rick Wilson</a>, a co-founder of the Lincoln Project and author of Everything Trump Touches Dies, said: \u201cWhen Trump is confronted with something that doesn\u2019t follow him on Twitter, that doesn\u2019t watch him on Fox News and doesn\u2019t come to his rallies, he\u2019s lost.</p> <p>\u201cTrump is a day trader. He runs out every morning and throws whatever he\u2019s got in his head against the wall. It does not do the country a service when he is strongly inclined to believe his own bullshit.\u201d</p> <p>Wilson, who has experience in crisis management, described the president\u2019s response so far as \u201cthe usual Trumpian irresponsibility and mendacity in one package\u201d. He added: \u201cPresidents get judged not on the easy stuff but the hard stuff. He\u2019s going to have people judging him on how he\u2019s handled this. He has not inspired confidence.\u201d</p> <p>Trump previously appeared blas\u00e9 and uncaring when Hurricane Maria devastated Puerto Rico. He memorably tossed paper towels into a crowd. But the coronavirus is on another scale altogether.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.hhh.umn.edu/directory/lawrence-jacobs\">Larry Jacobs</a>, director of the Center for the Study of Politics and Governance at the University of Minnesota, said: \u201cTrump has had a history of defying political conventions but the game is up. He has made a colossal mistake with how he\u2019s handling the coronavirus. He has put himself front and centre.</p> <p>\u201cHe has belittled experts, his administration has not made adequate preparations and he undermined existing precautions and steps that had been taken for just this emergency. His fingerprints are all over this.\u201d</p> <p>Jacobs added: \u201cTrump appears disconnected from reality. While every American is thinking about precautions and wondering about keeping their children home from school, Trump, by underplaying what\u2019s going on, is detached from the reality that middle America is struggling with.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>On April 4 1968, Martin Luther King Jr phoned a local pastor with the title of his Sunday sermon: \u201c<a href=\"https://www.mintpressnews.com/mlks-children-reveal-undelivered-king-speech-america-may-go-hell/240264/\" title=\"\">Why America May Go to Hell</a>.\u201d The civil rights leader was shot dead before he could address the parishioners of Ebenezer Baptist church in Atlanta. Over the next few weeks the United States found itself on the road to perdition. King\u2019s murder saw the country experience its greatest wave of social unrest since the civil war, with riots in 130 cities. In November of that year, Richard Nixon won a law and order election by stoking the unspoken bigotry that the street violence had done so much to revive. Donald Trump <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/02/opinion/floyd-trump-nixon-coronavirus.html\" title=\"\">thinks he can do the same</a> with the nationwide protests over police brutality toward African Americans in the wake of the death of George Floyd. But history does not repeat itself, people do.</p> <p>There are signs that Americans have grown to be significantly better than their previous selves. The protests have drawn wide support from society. Mainly peaceful demonstrations have been a showcase for America\u2019s diversity. Mr Trump\u2019s polling numbers have <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/us/politics/trump-campaign-virus-protests-polls.html\" title=\"\">plunged</a>. Surveys show that voters approve of the protests inspired by Floyd\u2019s death, and strongly disapprove of the president\u2019s response. There has been a sea change in <a href=\"https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-lots-of-white-democrats-ended-up-protesting-the-death-of-george-floyd/\" title=\"\">attitudes</a>, with Americans seeming to acknowledge that racism is a real problem for their society. The police officer who was seen suffocating Floyd with his knee has been charged with second-degree felony murder. Confederate statues and other relics to racism have come down in several states.</p> <p>There is also a long way to the 2020 presidential election. The demonstrations and violence may be a faraway memory by then. The political gaze may be fixed on a second coronavirus outbreak or the failing economy. The chaotic handling of the pandemic has left 100,000 dead and is evidence that Mr Trump is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/15/donald-trump-coronavirus-response-world-leaders\" title=\"\">not up to the job</a>. The past is also another country. The unrest today is against a backdrop of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/18/global-report-coronavirus-us-unemployment-could-hit-25-warns-fed-chairman-as-japan-enters-recession\" title=\"\">depression</a>, deprivation and deep inequality, not the full employment and roaring US economy of the late 1960s. The portents do not look good for a president running for re-election.</p> <p>The story of American politics since 1968 is dominated by a Republican party that gained a <a href=\"http://omarwasow.com/APSR_protests3_1.pdf\" title=\"\">political base</a> through Nixon\u2019s explicit appeals to whites who resented or were opposed to the civil rights movement. Republican leaders went on to <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1981/09/29/reagan-blames-crime-on-human-predator/2892636f-d176-48fb-b06b-39012eace1f4/\" title=\"\">weaponise racism</a> to remain in power, which they used to pursue policies that enriched the already affluent at the expense of ordinary workers. Mr Trump\u2019s Republicans are the \u201c<a href=\"https://portside.org/2020-03-18/how-racist-trumps-republican-party\" title=\"\">white grievance party</a>\u201d. This racism is laced with Trumpian <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2020/jun/05/george-floyd-protests-donald-trump-hydroxychloroquine-live\" title=\"\">stupidity</a>.</p> <p>African Americans have been left behind: being black in America, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/08/obituaries/devah-pager-dead.html\" title=\"\">studies</a> show, is like having a criminal conviction in terms of one\u2019s chances of finding employment. Black people often live in the poorest areas and suffer the highest rates of unemployment. Relative to white people, black people receive longer sentences for the same crimes, are treated more disrespectfully by police in routine interactions, and are more likely to be shot by law enforcement. Blacks have long outnumbered whites in US prisons despite representing a fraction of the total population. So stacked is the deck against them that black boys \u2013 even rich black boys \u2013 can never assume <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/03/19/upshot/race-class-white-and-black-men.html\" title=\"\">they can escape the poverty trap</a>. This is not a recipe for social comity.</p> <p>King understood this. His <a href=\"https://eu.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2020/05/29/minneapolis-protest-martin-luther-king-quote-riot-george-floyd/5282486002/\" title=\"\">warning</a> in 1967 that the worsening conditions for black Americans must be condemned as equally as riots is still true. \u201cA riot is the language of the unheard,\u201d said King. \u201cOur nation\u2019s summers of riots are caused by our nation\u2019s winters of delay. And as long as America postpones justice, we stand in the position of having these recurrences of violence and riots over and over again. Social justice and progress are the absolute guarantors of riot prevention.\u201d America must do more than listen to the unheard, it must hear them.</p>",
  "<p>Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, the British-Iranian dual national detained by Iran since 2016, has been told her furlough from prison will be extended beyond the previous cut-off date of early June, according to her lawyer. But she has not been informed she will be granted a full clemency, which would allow her to return to the UK.</p> <p>Her family said they were investigating the reports. They previously said they expected to hear on Saturday whether she was to be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2020/may/30/revolutionary-guards-block-clemency-for-nazanin-zaghari-ratcliffe\">given clemency</a>. Her lawyer, Mahmoud Behzadi-Rad, was reported by Iran International TV on Friday as saying only her furlough had been extended.</p> <p>Richard Ratcliffe, her husband, had said previous commitments on clemencies made by the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, meant she qualified for full release.</p> <p>Zaghari-Ratcliffe has served four years of a five-year sentence, and was released on furlough in March as the coronavirus outbreak entered Iran\u2019s prisons. She has been forced to stay at her parents\u2019 home in Tehran, and to wear a tag.</p> <p>Tens of thousands of prisoners were temporarily released, including half of what Iran described as security prisoners, in March.</p> <p>After appearing to have brought the coronavirus under control in late April and early May, the Iranian government discovered the disease was starting to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/04/iran-faces-crisis-amid-record-number-of-daily-coronavirus-infections\">rip through the country</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/04/iran-faces-crisis-amid-record-number-of-daily-coronavirus-infections\"> again</a>.</p> <p>Zaghari-Ratcliffe\u2019s family has had to endure a wait to hear whether she would be allowed to return to the UK to see her daughter, Gabriella, or would instead be forced to return to Evin prison in Tehran. The family senses Zaghari-Ratcliffe\u2019s fate is a contest between the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps and the ministry of foreign affairs, which would be content to see her granted clemency.</p> <p>If she is forced to stay indefinitely in Tehran, the family is certain to contrast her fate to the US prisoner Michael White, who was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/04/michael-white-us-navy-veteran-freed-iran\">released</a> this week after nearly a year of negotiations.</p> <p>The release occurred even though Iran is locked in a bitter conflict over the US pull-out from the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/iran-nuclear-deal\">2015 nuclear deal</a>, and Donald Trump\u2019s subsequent imposition of sweeping economic sanctions, which have crippled the Iranian economy and made the regime\u2019s fight against the coronavirus harder.</p> <p>The US, as part of an apparent prisoner swap, allowed Majid Taheri, an Iranian scientist imprisoned in the US for 16 months, to be released. He had been accused of violating US sanctions on Iran. A second Iranian scientist, Sirous Asgari, who had been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/28/iran-scientist-us-detention-coronavirus-sirous-asgari\">held by US</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/28/iran-scientist-us-detention-coronavirus-sirous-asgari\"> immigration authorities</a> for months, was also allowed to return to Iran.</p> <p>Trump tweeted: \u201cThank you to Iran. It shows a deal is possible!\u201d He added that it was in Iran\u2019s interests to reach an agreement on a new nuclear deal before the US presidential election. The Iranian foreign minister, Javad Zarif, tweeted: \u201cThis can happen for all prisoners. No need for cherry picking.\u201d</p> <p>The US has no direct diplomatic relations with Iran, and the swap was organised by Swiss intermediaries who act as the US representatives in Tehran.</p> <p>The UK Foreign Office, at least in public, has not been able to make progress in striking a comparable pragmatic deal with Iran, in the way that the US has managed to overcome huge political conflicts.</p> <p>Tulip Siddiq, the Labour MP campaigning for Zaghari-Ratcliffe\u2019s release, said: \u201cThe US has negotiated the release of another hostage from Iran. I\u2019m happy for Michael White and his family \u2013 but I would like to ask the UK government why they haven\u2019t done the same for Nazanin, so that she could be on a plane home right now too?\u201d</p> <p>Although both the UK and Iran deny there is a direct relationship, it is privately acknowledged that the return of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2020/jan/22/nazanin-zaghari-ratcliffe-pay-400m-debt-in-aid-urges-husband\">\u00a3400m owed by the UK to Iran</a> for more than 30 years, arising from an arms deal, would change the atmosphere surrounding Zaghari-Ratcliffe\u2019s fate.</p>",

But <strong>George Floyd</strong>\u2019s death has raised questions about whether Arradondo \u2014 or any chief \u2014 can fix the department. The city\u2019s own data going back to 2015 shows that when police officers use force, 60% of the time the person they\u2019re dealing with is black, though only 20% of the population is black.<br></p> \n  <p>\u201cI think the chief\u2019s heart is in the right place,\u201d <strong>City Council member Steve Fletcher</strong> said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think this department was ever going to let him get there. I think people understand he was in an impossible situation.\u201d </p> \n  <p>Fletcher argues that Arradondo was too lenient with discipline in his first year as chief as he worked to build department morale, which made getting rid of problem officers difficult later.</p> \n  <p>Arradondo\u2019s predecessor, <strong>Janee Harteau</strong>, was forced out over <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jun/07/justine-damond-death-mohamed-noor-minneapolis\">the fatal shooting of <strong>Justine Ruszczyk Damond</strong></a>. She said she received push-back from the union when she was trying to implement reforms and this week she called on police union President Lt. <strong>Bob Kroll</strong> to resign after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/01/bob-kroll-george-floyd-minneapolis-police-union-chief\">his controversial comments</a>.</p> \n  <p>The Minnesota Department of Human Rights filed civil rights charges related to Floyd\u2019s death and will investigate the Minneapolis Police Department to determine if it has engaged in discriminatory practices, <strong>Governor Tim Walz</strong> said this week.</p> \n  <p>Fletcher said he wants to examine whether the police department should be disbanded, saying he believes it\u2019s \u201cso broken it can\u2019t be fixed.\u201d<br></p> \n  <p>\u201cI think we need to rebuild from the ground up,\u201d said Fletcher, vice chair of the city\u2019s public safety committee. <br></p> \n  <p>Bob Bennett, an attorney who said he has sued the department \u201chundreds\u201d of times over police misconduct allegations, said Arradondo probably did the best he could, but the union has more sway than chiefs do over police conduct.</p> \n  <p>\u201cI know he wants to reform the department as much as anyone I\u2019ve ever met or seen,\u201d Bennett said. \u201cHopefully this whole mess will bring about some change.\u201d</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ed9e4e68f0854eb54d99384\" class=\"block is-summary\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-05T06:35:07.864Z\">7.35am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Today so far\u2026</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>\u201cWhat happened to Floyd happens every day in this country in education and health services and in every area of American life.

Bail would be lowered to $750,000 if they agreed to certain conditions, including forfeiting any personal firearms</p> \n  <p>Derek Chauvin is charged with second-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter in Floyd\u2019s death, which happened on Memorial Day, 25 May. Witness video shows Chauvin kneeling on Floyd\u2019s neck during an arrest, for almost nine minutes. Floyd pleads he cannot breathe, then stops moving.<br></p> \n  <p>Minnesota attorney general Keith Ellison <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/03/george-floyd-killing-derek-chauvin-charge-elevated-three-other-officers-charged\">announced the charges</a> against Thao, Lane and Kueng on Wednesday, also increasing the charge against Chauvin.</p> \n  <p>Here\u2019s the Associated Press:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Defense attorneys argued for lower bail. They told the court Chauvin was the training officer for Lane and Kueng, who had been on the job just four and three days respectively. Defendants don\u2019t normally enter pleas during their first appearances in Minnesota courts, which tend to be brief proceedings. Judge Paul Scoggin set their next court dates for 29 June.</p> \n   <p>If convicted, Chauvin faces a maximum of 40 years in prison on the murder count and 10 years for manslaughter. Under Minnesota law, aiding and abetting second-degree murder is tantamount a second-degree murder charge, so <strong>Thao, Lane and Kueng face the same potential penalties</strong> if convicted. A date for Chauvin\u2019s first court appearance has not been set.</p> \n   <p>The complaint against Lane, 37, notes that he asked about rolling Floyd on his side and wondered about delirium, but went on to say that Lane \u201ctook no actions to assist Mr Floyd, to change his position, or to reduce the force the officers were using against Mr Floyd.\u201d</p> \n   <p>The complaint against Kueng, 26, says he was positioned between Chauvin and Lane and could hear their comments. The complaint against Thao, 34, who was seen in the cellphone video standing near a crowd of bystanders, says the officer initially got a hobble restraint from the squad car, \u201cbut the officers decided not to use it and maintained their positions.\u201d</p> \n   <p>Governor Tim Walz and the Minnesota Department of Human Rights ordered a civil rights investigation of the police department to determine how to address its history of racial discrimination and find solutions for systemic change.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-06-04T20:10:07.371Z\">at 9.10pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ed934288f0854eb54d98f62\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-04T19:21:34.521Z\">8.21pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>As Nick Confessore of the New York Times put it on Twitter today, \u201cTrump began his term promising to build a wall to protect America from the world.

Instead he tries to divide us. We are witnessing the consequences of three years of this deliberate effort. We are witnessing the consequences of three years without mature leadership.\u201d</p> \n  <p>He also compared Trump\u2019s behaviour to Nazi propaganda and called the president\u2019s stunt on Monday, ordering the gassing of peaceful protesters so he could stage a photo op outside St John\u2019s church, an \u201c<strong>abuse of executive authority</strong>\u201d.</p> \n  <p>Trump <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1268347256748507136\">tweeted</a> back: \u201cProbably the only thing Barack Obama &amp; I have in common is that we both had the honor of firing Jim Mattis, the world\u2019s most overrated General.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Almost as inevitable as the abuse was the fact that the tweet contained a lie.

He did not ask for his resignation. <strong>The president has clearly forgotten how it actually happened or is confused</strong>. The president tweeted a very positive tweet about Jim until he started to see on Fox News their interpretation of his letter. Then he got nasty. Jim Mattis is a honorable man.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Unlike Mattis, Kelly has spoken out about Trump before, backing impeachment witness Lt Col Alexander Vindman and expressing quite wide disagreement. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/feb/13/ex-white-house-chief-staff-john-kelly-speaks-out-against-trump\">Asked in February</a> why he went to work for Trump in 2017, Kelly said he had been \u201cfascinated \u2013 not necessarily in a good way \u2013 but fascinated as to what <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-elections-2016\">that election</a> meant to our country\u201d.</p> \n  <p>Kelly and Mattis have been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jan/19/john-kelly-donald-trump-cliff-sims-book\">widely reported</a> to have been \u201cadults in the room\u201d in the first years of the Trump White House, willing to stand up to the president and obstruct his more dangerous impulses.

Shopping in physical stores, recreational activities, personal services, and a long list of other types of spending have been sharply reduced.</p> <p>As a result, the businesses that normally provide these goods and services have sharply reduced activity, or shut down entirely. Absent any policy response, most of the employees of these businesses would lose their jobs, and face a dramatic reduction in income. In contrast, those working in sectors whose output is still in demand, for example food retail and online businesses, face no reduction in income at all or even experience increased income.</p> <p>But they are still unable or unwilling to consume goods and services that require social contact, so they end up with a large involuntary increase in savings. </p> </blockquote> <p>But there is some good news....

My heart hurts more than my head over his infection. This virus does not discriminate. While kids are more resilient, they can suffer same severity of symptoms. I\u2019m applying a modified version of my remedies for his protocol with a focus on lots of vitamins. Since his sense of smell and taste have disappeared, I am feeding him healthy foods that I normally can\u2019t get him to touch. I kept a diary of the past week including my remedies and things that I did to stay sane through it all. \ud83d\ude4f Link in bio, as they say.</a></p> <p style=&quot; color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;&quot;>A post shared by <a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/cristinacuomo/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;amp;utm_campaign=loading&quot; style=&quot; color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px;&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;> Cristina Cuomo</a> (@cristinacuomo) on <time style=&quot; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;&quot; datetime=&quot;2020-04-22T17:41:41+00:00&quot;>Apr 22, 2020 at 10:41am PDT</time></p></div></blockquote> <script async src=&quot;//www.instagram.com/embed.js&quot;></script></body></html>\"></iframe> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ea0d82b8f0898fe360d660a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-22T23:50:19.249Z\">12.50am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>That briefing has now ended.

On Monday, the country posted 8,926 new cases, the lowest in weeks.</p> \n  <p>But concerns about the actual death toll of the disease have grown amid worrying reports from Dagestan and several other regions of hundreds of deaths from pneumonia, many of whom may have been infected with coronavirus but not tallied due to Russia\u2019s conservative autopsy standards. The country has tallied just 2,722 deaths from the disease.</p> \n  <p>The health minister of Dagestan, a southern Russian region of nearly three million people, said on Sunday that while officially 29 people in the republic had died of Covid-19, another 657 people had died of \u201ccommunity-acquired pneumonia,\u201d a sickness often contracted by those infected with coronavirus.</p> \n  <p>He also confirmed that more than 40 medics in Dagestan had died since the coronavirus crisis began, a concern that had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/05/painful-to-see-rise-in-russian-medics-falling-prey-to-covid-19-as-death-toll-questioned\">raised concerns across Russia</a>, but claimed that many had died of causes other than coronavirus.</p> \n  <p>Other regions also appeared to indicate that death rates from pneumonia were many times higher than from coronavirus. The St. Petersburg governor also announced late last week that 694 people had died from pneumonia since 1 March, while just 63 people had officially died of coronavirus and been added to Russia\u2019s tally of deaths from the disease.</p> \n  <p>Russia\u2019s mortality rate from the disease is considerably lower than other countries with more than 100,000 infections. The Kremlin has said that is attributable to the country\u2019s medical system, while critics have noted that deaths are tallied differently than in most countries in Europe and North America. New data from Moscow last week indicated <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/14/coronavirus-russia-defends-its-exceptionally-precise-covid-19-death-data\">nearly 1,600 people with coronavirus</a> had died since the outbreak began, but that just 639 were included on official death tolls from the disease after autopsies found other causes of death.</p> \n  <p>Many academics believe that excess death rates are the best way to evaluate the total death toll from the disease.

the situation is stabilising. </p> \n  <p>Health officials reported 8,926 new infections in the last 24 hours, bringing the country\u2019s total to 290,678, the second-highest in the world after the <strong>United States</strong>. </p> \n  <p>It was the lowest number of new virus cases since 1 May, when Russia announced 7,933 cases. </p> \n  <p>Russia\u2019s consumer health watchdog chief,

At least 315,187<strong> </strong>people have died over the course of the pandemic The number of deaths in the US is approaching 90,000, with 89,562 confirmed fatalities and 1,486,757 infections, according to the Johns Hopkins university tracker.</li> \n   <li><strong>US Federal Reserve Chair says unemployment could reach 25%. </strong>US Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said on Sunday that US unemployment could peak at 25%, but expressed optimism that the economy could begin to recover from a devastating recession in the second half of the year, assuming the coronavirus doesn\u2019t erupt in a second wave.</li> \n   <li><strong>Japan </strong><strong>falls into recession. </strong>Japan dived into its first recession since 2015, according to official data on Monday, with the world\u2019s third-largest economy contracting by 0.9% in the first quarter as it wrestled with the fallout from the coronavirus. The cabinet office reported a drop of 3.4% annual pace in seasonally adjusted real gross domestic product, or GDP, the total value of a nation\u2019s goods and services, for the January-March period, compared with the previous quarter.</li> \n   <li><strong>South Africa reports highest daily increase in cases. </strong>South Africa on Sunday reported 1,160 new coronavirus infections, the highest daily number since the first case was recorded in March \u201cAs of today, the total number of confirmed Covid-19 cases in South Africa is 15,515, with 1,160 new cases identified in the last 24 hour cycle of testing,\u201d the health ministry said in a statement.

Brazil has the fourth-highest number of infections worldwide, with 241,080, according to Johns Hopkins University figures. It has recorded 16,118 deaths. Meanwhile, Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro greeted hundreds of supporters and joined some in a series of push-ups who gathered before the presidential offices Sunday.</li> \n   <li><strong>Death tolls fall in UK, Spain and Italy. </strong>In a possible glimmer of hope, Sunday saw lower death tolls reported in the UK, Spain and Italy. The UK\u2019s daily coronavirus death toll was the lowest since lockdown began, with 170 deaths recorded. However, the Sunday and Monday figures tend to be lower than other days because of weekend testing rates. Meanwhile, Spain<strong> </strong>recorded its lowest single-day death toll in two months. Italy on Sunday recorded its lowest daily toll, 145, since lockdown was declared. There were 153 deaths registered during the previous 24 hour period.</li> \n   <li><strong>Move Rohingya on Bangladesh island to refugee camps, says UN chief. </strong>Hundreds of Rohingya rescued by Bangladesh and sent to a flood-prone island after being stranded at sea for weeks should be moved to existing refugee camps, the UN secretary general has said. </li> \n   <li><strong>WHO committee to discuss Taiwan exclusion. </strong>The World Health Organization (WHO) is to raise the question of Taiwan\u2019s participation as an observer at the World Health Assembly, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/18/world-health-assembly-what-is-it-and-what-is-the-coronavirus-inquiry-china-taiwan-origins\">which opens virtually on Monday</a>, before one of its committees. Diplomatic allies of Taiwan, including Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua and Paraguay, have formally requested to invite Taiwan to the meeting as an observer. The US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, has also said publicly he wants Taiwan in the room.</li> \n   <li><strong>India extends lockdown by another two weeks. </strong>India has extended its lockdown to 31 May, but with some easing of restrictions. States are being given greater power to reopen markets and standalone stores, bus and other public transport travel being allowed between and within states.

The UK\u2019s daily coronavirus death toll was the lowest since lockdown began, with 170 deaths recorded. This should be taken with a pinch of salt: due to hospital reporting delays, the numbers reported on Sundays and Mondays tend to be lower than other days. Meanwhile Spain<strong> </strong>has recorded its lowest single-day death toll in two months. Italy on Sunday recorded its lowest daily toll, 145, since lockdown was declared.

  "<p>Just three months ago, centrist Democrats were panicking. After strong performances in Iowa, New Hampshire and Nevada, the Vermont senator Bernie Sanders appeared poised to sail away with the nomination for president. Some in the party feared the self-identified democratic socialist would wreak havoc down the ballot.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/sep/23/susan-collins-maine-democrats-kavanaugh-controversy\">Could Susan Collins' vote for Kavanaugh help the Democrats flip the Senate in 2020?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cIf Bernie Sanders was at the top of the ticket, we would be in jeopardy of losing the House,\u201d the Louisiana congressman Cedric Richmond, a co-chair of Joe Biden\u2019s campaign, said on a February conference call. \u201cWe would not get the Senate back.\u201d</p> <p>The world looks different now \u2013 and so does the Senate map. With Biden the presumptive nominee and Donald Trump facing widespread criticism for his handling of the coronavirus crisis, election experts say the upper chamber is up for grabs.</p> <p>Republicans hold a 53-47 advantage, meaning Democrats will have to flip at least three seats to take the majority, assuming they win the White House. If they can\u2019t win the presidency, they will need four seats to control the Senate. Doug Jones, a Democrat, is considered an underdog for re-election in Alabama. If he loses, Democrats will need another Republican seat.</p> <p>But Jones\u2019s race is one of only a few chances for Republicans to flip a seat themselves. Other Democrats up for re-election, such as Gary Peters in Michigan, have started to pull ahead. The map is unfavorable for Republicans, with incumbents facing difficult re-election races in presidential battleground states like Arizona, Colorado and North Carolina.</p> <p>\u201cOver the course of the last several months the playing field has gotten a little bit bigger, and I\u2019d say Democratic prospects in some of these individual races have also seemed to get a little bit better,\u201d said Kyle Kondik, managing editor of <a href=\"http://centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/\">Sabato\u2019s Crystal Ball</a> at the University of Virginia Center for Politics.</p> <p>\u201cThe overall race for the Senate is more of a coin flip than maybe you would have described it at the start of the cycle.\u201d</p> <p>Democrats have managed to expand the map, in part thanks to Biden clearing the presidential primary field, which seems to have improved the party\u2019s prospects in states Trump carried in 2016, such as North Carolina and Georgia.</p> <p>\u201cA lot of Democrats were rightly worried that if you had a more progressive nominee, an avowed Democratic socialist on the ticket like Bernie Sanders, flipping a state like North Carolina \u2026 would have been much harder,\u201d said Jessica Taylor, Senate and governors editor for the <a href=\"https://cookpolitical.com/\">Cook Political Report</a>.</p> <p>Republicans are on defense in states they previously thought safe, most notably Montana. The state\u2019s Democratic governor, Steve Bullock, launched his Senate campaign in March. A <a href=\"http://helpslab.montana.edu/documents/western_states_2020_coronavirus_survey/PoliticsPolicy_Montana_Frequencies_01May2020_RELEASE.pdf\">recent poll</a> showed him leading the Republican incumbent, Steve Daines, by seven points, even though Trump carried Montana by 20 in 2016.</p> <p>\u201cI think the Democrats have done a better job of putting more races in play than the Republicans have,\u201d Kondik said, \u201calthough Republicans are just defending many more seats.\u201d</p> <p>Democratic candidates have seen better fundraising numbers, which party strategists say is a reflection of grassroots energy. For example, in Maine, in the first quarter of this year, Sara Gideon raised nearly three times as much money as the Republican senator Susan Collins.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2346d7aa482ee2854adbbc5906ce6a4b5dcbf865\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2346d7aa482ee2854adbbc5906ce6a4b5dcbf865/0_184_5626_3375/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Republican senator Susan Collins is believed to be vulnerable in Maine.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Republican senator Susan Collins is believed to be vulnerable in Maine.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michael Brochstein/ZUMA Wire/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Incumbent Republicans face the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/15/trump-2020-campaign-strategy-attack-biden\">same challenge</a> as the president: the financial devastation caused by the pandemic has robbed them of their best talking point \u2013 the strength of the US economy. As the unemployment rate climbs and many Americans lose health coverage, Democratic strategists are quick to point out that the administration has stayed in a lawsuit from Republican state attorneys general which seeks to overturn the Affordable Care Act.</p> <p>\u201cSenate Republicans, right now, today, support a lawsuit that could toss out critical protections for people with pre-existing conditions,\u201d said Benjamin Ray, senior director of campaign communications for the Democratic group <a href=\"https://www.emilyslist.org/\">Emily\u2019s List</a>.</p> <p>\u201cIt might sound unconscionable to kick people that have gotten sick in a global pandemic off of their health insurance, but it\u2019s what incumbent Republicans want.\u201d</p> <p>Democratic strategists insist Republicans are also suffering as a result of Trump\u2019s handling of the coronavirus crisis and his party\u2019s refusal to criticize him for it.</p> <p>Last month, the National Republican Senatorial Committee, Senate Republicans\u2019 campaign arm, circulated a 57-page memo which instructed candidates: \u201cDon\u2019t defend Trump, other than the China Travel Ban \u2013 attack China.\u201d</p> <p>After the Trump campaign lashed out, the committee was forced to backtrack, <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2020/04/27/trump-campaign-china-strategy-memo-213958\">saying</a> there was \u201cno daylight between the NRSC and President Trump\u201d.</p> <p>The NRSC did not offer a comment to the Guardian.</p> <p>Helen Kalla, a spokeswoman for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, said: \u201cRepublican senators have completely tied themselves to the president, and now they\u2019re on the hook and own the failed coronavirus response.\u201d</p> <p>With <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/05/12/politics/cnn-poll-federal-government-handling-of-coronavirus/index.html\">a majority of Americans</a> expressing disapproval of Trump\u2019s handling of the crisis, Democrats say Senate Republicans will suffer the consequences in November.</p> <p>\u201cIt is very clear what the Republican agenda is,\u201d Kalla said. \u201cI don\u2019t think voters are going to forget it.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>The Rev Jesse Jackson was born in the racially segregated south when Franklin Roosevelt occupied the White House and war raged in Europe. He was an eyewitness to the assassination of Martin Luther King, campaigned against the Vietnam war and twice ran for US president.</p> <p>But, now an elder statesman of 78, he has never seen anything like the coronavirus pandemic, which has infected more than 1 million Americans and killed more in April alone than died in Vietnam over 15 years. The world\u2019s most powerful and wealthy country also bears by far its biggest death toll: almost 90,000. It is enough to shake faith in American exceptionalism.</p> <p>\u201cOur military cannot defeat this germ,\u201d Jackson says by phone from Chicago, one of the hardest-hit cities. \u201cHaving the biggest banks, having the biggest military has no meaning in this kind of germ warfare. The frontline is not soldiers; the frontline is doctors and nurses. The planes are grounded, the bombs are irrelevant. It turns out that pride precedes a fall. Sometimes people have to learn that we don\u2019t control everything.\u201d</p> <p>Despite lockdown and Parkinson\u2019s disease, Jackson is still working with gusto at the Rainbow Push Coalition, a progressive organisation he founded in 1996. It has convened thousands of black doctors and lawyers and released a manifesto suggesting that high-risk groups, including African Americans, be prioritised for coronavirus testing.</p> <p>Jackson has twice written to Donald Trump urging testing for the 2.2 million people currently in prison. At a time when most Americans are looking inward, he has also called for massive intervention in Africa, a particularly vulnerable continent that is close to his heart.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"55dddb9dfcb17798d138912412644c022255a838\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/55dddb9dfcb17798d138912412644c022255a838/25_33_1319_1965/671.jpg\" alt=\"Jesse Jackson in 1988 in the battle for the Democratic presidential nomination.\" width=\"671\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jesse Jackson in 1988 in the battle for the Democratic presidential nomination.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Cynthia Johnson/The LIFE Images Collection via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWe\u2019re working virtually, making conference calls, using this time to organise people,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019ve talked to about 2,000 ministers around the nation over the past 10 days, trying to convince their congregations to honour the protocols and stay in the house.\u201d</p> <p>For a brief while it became voguish to indulge a comforting myth that the coronavirus was the great equaliser, touching the bus driver and Prince of Wales alike. But while infections do not discriminate, humans do. Despite making up only 13% of the US population, African Americans represent 30% of the deaths from the coronavirus.</p> <p>A Senate Democratic Policy and Communications Committee <a href=\"https://www.democrats.senate.gov/dpcc/press-reports/dpcc-report-racial-disparities-on-full-displaycovid-19-is-disproportionately-affecting-communities-of-color\">report </a><a href=\"https://www.democrats.senate.gov/dpcc/press-reports/dpcc-report-racial-disparities-on-full-displaycovid-19-is-disproportionately-affecting-communities-of-color\">last month concluded</a> that people of colour have less access to quality healthcare, are more likely to have a pre-existing health condition and suffer greater exposure to air pollution that puts them at higher risk of asthma. They also make up a disproportionate share of frontline workers, are less likely to be able to work from home and more likely to rely on public transport, and are hit hardest by poverty as layoffs continue to rise.</p> <p>\u201cWe know that people should honour the [social distancing] protocols, but some find it more difficult because of congested conditions or their transportation,\u201d says Jackson. \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/14/los-angeles-coronavirus-inequality-undocumented-healthcare\">A lot are untested and uninsured</a>. If you\u2019re uninsured, you can go to the hospitals only to be told you can\u2019t get service, so you end up resorting to your own home remedies, or you end up in the hospital too late.</p> <p>\u201cThat points to disparity in income and education and healthcare. It shows the black condition in America. The legacy of slavery and Jim Crow is very clear.\u201d</p> <p>Like Trump\u2019s regressive presidency, the virus is a shock to the system that forces a confrontation with class, race and structural inequality. What had been ambient noise for the privileged is suddenly vividly clear and difficult to ignore.</p> <p>\u201cAfter 400 years of slavery, segregation and discrimination, why would anybody be shocked that African Americans are dying disproportionately from the coronavirus?\u201d Jackson <a href=\"https://chicagocrusader.com/why-are-african-americans-dying-disproportionately-to-the-coronavirus/\">asked in a statement published on 7 April</a>, arguing that all past US presidents have failed to \u201cend the virus of white superiority and fix the multifaceted issues confronting African Americans\u201d.</p> <p>He adds, by phone: \u201cAmerica has decided the place of blacks in this society, which is beneath that of European immigrants. People say America is 244 years old, but Africans have been here 157 years before the constitution. We shouldn\u2019t say America was founded in 1776 \u2013 it started with slavery in 1619; so we\u2019re still invisible to that extent.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7948d55f3e787ee8e1543c3436b1e631cd0c5d13\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7948d55f3e787ee8e1543c3436b1e631cd0c5d13/0_0_3435_2305/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jackson at the 1972 Democratic convention in Miami, which nominated George McGovern.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"671\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jackson at the 1972 Democratic convention in Miami, which nominated George McGovern.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Wally McNamee/Corbis via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWe still make less, live under stresses and don\u2019t live as long. We\u2019re still looked upon as the other based upon skin colour, as some kind of irreparable sin in the society. People try to adjust to it but, when a pandemic sets in, the data comes out.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re about 60% of prisoners in this country. People are sick behind those walls. You can have 200 inmates sick with Covid-19 and the workers go home and they spread it. So the prisons become the epicentre of the untreated and untested and undetected.\u201d</p> <p>Itching to revive their economies, several southern states led by mostly white male governors are already reopening bowling alleys, cinemas, hairdressers, restaurants and other outlets against federal guidelines. A <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/gdpr-consent/?next_url=https%3a%2f%2fwww.washingtonpost.com%2fpolitics%2f2020%2f04%2f28%2fblack-activists-officials-see-major-threat-souths-plans-reopen%2f\">group of activists</a>, mostly black women, warned in a petition that reopening now \u201cis irresponsible and a death sentence for many of us\u201d.</p> <p>White privilege will offer no immunity in an interconnected society, says Jackson. \u201cIf blacks are the drivers and unprotected, the driven are hurt. If the cooks and waiters are unprotected, those they cook for are all unprotected. So we\u2019re more integrated than we realise on a daily basis.</p> <p>\u201cSo we really must have healthcare for all as one of the by-products of this pandemic. Anybody who\u2019s left out is a threat to those who are left in. When people as affluent as Prince Charles and Boris Johnson and athletes are affected, it means that the gated community did not protect you from the pandemic. If the poor are not protected, the rich are in jeopardy, because you cannot separate by community the poor from the rich, the white from the black.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e0dbd14c23583b71911f99a88a27e694605d5ec8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e0dbd14c23583b71911f99a88a27e694605d5ec8/608_479_2392_1668/1000.jpg\" alt=\"With Martin Luther King in 1968 a day before King\u2019s assassination at the same spot.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"697\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">With Martin Luther King in 1968 a day before King\u2019s assassination at the same spot.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Charles Kelly/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Roosevelt was tested by the Great Depression and second world war and rose to the challenge.

The infrastructure that [George W] Bush and Barack had put together on pandemics was ignored. He dismantled the infrastructure and did not pay adequate attention to the threat.</p> <p>\u201cAs the threat changed, we didn\u2019t have ventilators and respirators. All our preparation was for a financial fight or a military fight. He should have declared a national testing mechanism. There should have been a national lockdown to break the back of it. The attention should have been early; it was not.\u201d</p> <p>Trump has sought absolution at press briefings that sometimes run for more than two hours with a mix of self-congratulation, bloated exaggerations, broadsides at reporters and bad science. He recently ad libbed a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/25/donald-trump-coronavirus-disinfectant-sarcastic-tipping-point\">jaw-dropping proposal to study the merits of injecting disinfectant into coronavirus patients</a>. It has left his opponent in November\u2019s election, the former vice president Joe Biden, struggling to get a share of the limelight.</p> <p>\u201cTrump is using the daily press briefing as a platform to promote his politics while Biden is facing lockdown in his basement.

Biden\u2019s campaign fell apart after he quoted without attribution the then British Labour leader, Neil Kinnock, and was accused of plagiarism. Jackson, bidding to become the US\u2019s first black president, gathered 7m votes and finished first or second in 46 out of 54 primary contests. But he lost the nomination to Michael Dukakis, who went down to George HW Bush.</p> <p>Does it hurt that he will never be president? \u201cNo, it doesn\u2019t,\u201d he says firmly, \u201cbecause I was a trailblazer, I was a pathfinder. I had to deal with doubt and cynicism and fears about a black person running. There were black scholars writing papers about why I was wasting my time. Even blacks said a black couldn\u2019t win.\u201d</p> <p>Some of his foreign policy positions at the time, he points out, became widely adopted: a two-state solution for Israel and the Palestinians, the release of Nelson Mandela from prison in South Africa (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jan/08/thatcher-advisers-suspicious-jesse-jackson-visit\">he met Margaret Thatcher to plead for Britain</a> to drop its support for the apartheid regime). In 2000 he received the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the US\u2019s highest civilian honour.</p> <p>When Obama won in 2008, he praised Jackson for making his run possible. As Obama delivered his election night victory speech at Grant Park in Chicago before a crowd of 240,000, Jackson\u2019s tear-stained face was among the most indelible images. \u201cIt was a big moment in history,\u201d he recalls. \u201cI cried because I thought about those who made it possible who were not there \u2026 People who paid a real price: Ralph Abernathy, Dr King, Medgar Evers, Fannie Lou Hamer, those who fought like hell [at the Democratic national convention] in Atlantic City in 64, those in the movement in the south.\u201d </p> <p>Some felt that Obama should have pushed faster and further on racial justice in his two terms. But Jackson ranks him among the US\u2019s top presidents. \u201cFirst, given America\u2019s history in terms of race, he inspired indescribable pride. No 2, his family and their decency and dignity were a big deal.\u201d</p> <p>He points to the Paris climate accords, Iran nuclear deal, rapprochement with Cuba and rescue of the economy as signal achievements. \u201cHe stabilised the ship when the ship was sinking and got it back above the water. And no scandal. Trump creates a desire for Barack all over again. When he travelled around the world, he was the best face America\u2019s ever had.\u201d</p> <p>In March, Jackson endorsed Bernie Sanders, returning a compliment from 1988 when Sanders backed his campaign. \u201cHis ideas made the most sense to me,\u201d he explains. But after a promising start Sanders fell away, partly because of his failure to connect with older African American voters, where Biden dominated.</p> <p>\u201cHis campaign was [about] class without appreciating the caste dimension of poverty,\u201d Jackson explains by way of post-mortem. \u201cThere are 55 black members of Congress and he didn\u2019t have one. Maybe one or two black mayors, but he didn\u2019t cultivate an African American constituency.\u201d</p> <p>Biden, meanwhile, benefited from his \u201ckinship\u201d with Obama as well as Trump\u2019s repeated attacks that kept his profile up and his name on the front pages. \u201cThe opposition had no infrastructure for the black vote. In many ways, he inherited votes he didn\u2019t campaign for.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d1c0ab365ca2b0e711ca6df5ee832b9671430bc7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d1c0ab365ca2b0e711ca6df5ee832b9671430bc7/0_0_3000_2000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"With Bernie Sanders in March.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">With Bernie Sanders in March.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Scott Olson/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In recent weeks, Biden has been endorsed by Sanders, Obama, Hillary Clinton, House speaker Nancy Pelosi and the civil rights hero John Lewis in a show of party unity. Will Jackson support him enthusiastically? \u201cYeah, as an alternative to the present administration, but we\u2019ve not had a meeting with the black constituency on what our demands are.\u201d</p> <p>The ground is shifting under Trump and Biden\u2019s feet. Sanders argues that the pandemic, which has put more than 30 million Americans out of work, shows the failure of the US healthcare system. As an opportunity to reimagine the social contract, the present moment is being compared with Roosevelt\u2019s New Deal or the post second-world-war consensus in Britain.</p> <p>\u201cBiden won the delegates but Sanders won the issues,\u201d Jackson reflects. \u201cSanders\u2019 agenda will dominate the [Democratic national] convention. One of the by-products of this pandemic is going to be the need for healthcare for all. We can\u2019t afford not to have healthcare for all because if you see the gap between the 1% and 99%, the 1% can\u2019t hide from who it is that\u2019s caring for the masses. The real soldiers are not the investment bankers. It\u2019s the doctors and nurses. There is a new appreciation of the common people, doctors and janitors and truck drivers, what they call essential workers.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIn many ways,\u201d he says, \u201cas African Americans, we\u2019re at the the bottom of the foundation. The foundation is where it starts from. So when the foundation\u2019s in trouble, the whole building\u2019s in trouble.\u201d</p>",

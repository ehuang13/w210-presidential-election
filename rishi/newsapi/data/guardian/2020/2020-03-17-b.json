He also declined to bow out of the 2016 primary even after it was mathematically impossible to win the nomination, instead successfully pushing for a more progressive party platform and major rule changes. And at the same time that Sanders faces pressure from mainstream Democrats to exit, many on the left are encouraging him to stay in.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>They also make the point that, potentially, with primaries pushed back until the public has seen the full impact of the coronavirus outbreak, there might be a decided shift in mindset in favour of Sanders\u2019 policies on, say, healthcare and labor laws, by the end of the campaign.</p> \n  <p><strong>Read it here</strong> - <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/17/bernie-sanders-not-going-quietly-132641\">Politico: \u2018Who is going to advise him to drop out?\u2019: Bernie may not be ready for quick exit</a></p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e70b6788f085e564ad85a15\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-17T11:43:43.759Z\">11.43am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Frank LaRose, Ohio\u2019s Secretary of State, has been on CNN talking about the state\u2019s decision to cancel today\u2019s primary vote.</p> \n  <p>He told them that the decision had been taken after the guidance they were receiving about whether it was safe to proceed with the election \u201cchanged dramatically on Monday morning\u201d.

Prosecutors said the Russian company had \u201cno exposure to meaningful punishment\u201d and that the prosecution risked exposing investigative sources and methods.</p> <p>A day later, Prigozhin went on the attack, saying the dropped charges showed that the US government \u201cfeared publicity and just court proceedings\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThis means that the allegations that \u2018Prigozhin interfered in the US presidential election,\u2019 \u2018Concord interfered in the US presidential election,\u2019 or \u2018Russia interfered in the US presidential election\u2019 are mendacious and false,\u201d said Prigozhin, according to the statement released by his company.</p> <p>Prosecutors had previously complained that documents they had provided to the defence had ended up online, and had been hesitant to deliver more sensitive information to Concord\u2019s defence team.</p> <p>It is not clear whether the plans to file a lawsuit are serious, where the lawsuit will be filed, and why Prigozhin values the damages against him at $50bn.

If they want to see the devil, let them.\u201d</p> <p>A former restaurateur who met Putin in the early 2000s, Prigozhin later won lucrative contracts to supply food to Russian schools and soldiers. He has largely kept a low profile, but came under fire last year after more than 130 Moscow schoolchildren fell ill with dysentery. Concord Catering, a company previously tied to Prigozhin, was later ordered by a court to pay compensation to parents.</p> <p>US investigators have also alleged that he handled political projects for the Kremlin, like the St Petersburg-based troll farm, which investigators said was part of an influence campaign ordered by the Kremlin.</p> <p>Russian media have also reported <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jun/11/yevgeny-prigozhin-who-is-the-man-leading-russias-push-into-africa\">his ties to the Wagner paramilitary group</a>, which has fought in Syria, Ukraine and has a growing footprint in Africa. US authorities last year sanctioned a private jet they said belonged to Prigozhin and had made trips to Sudan and the Central African Republic, countries where the Russian mercenaries are active.

  "<p>In June 2010, Vladimir Putin\u2019s spies broke into the <em>Guardian</em>\u2019s Moscow office. This was a regular thing. Whenever I wrote a story that displeased the Kremlin, the FSB spy agency paid a nocturnal visit. On this occasion, the goons removed the office phone from its cradle and laid it demonstratively on the table. Apparently, they didn\u2019t like my coverage of big news from America.</p> <p>That week, the FBI had exposed a ring of deep-cover Russian sleeper agents. The undercover spies had been living in Boston, New York and Washington, in leafy suburban homes. Their task was to ferret out information from US officials and thinktanks. The agents had fake American names. Some had been there for decades, sent at the end of the cold war on a lonely mission, like satellites blasted into space.</p> <p>Since 2000, the FBI had been secretly watching the group. The bureau had a mole: a disillusioned Russian foreign intelligence officer, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jun/27/russian-double-agent-tried-absence\" title=\"\">Alexander Poteyev</a>. Poteyev gave the CIA details of Moscow\u2019s \u201cillegals\u201d, working under non-diplomatic cover. Some were husband and wife. Their children grew up in the US and Canada, speaking English and knowing nothing of their parents\u2019 real nationalities or furtive occupation.</p> <p>The BBC\u2019s security editor, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/correspondents/gordoncorera\" title=\"\">Gordon Corera,</a> has written a lively and engrossing account of the FBI\u2019s decade-long counterintelligence operation against the illegals, <em>Russians Among Us</em>. He talked to special agents whose job it was to watch them 24/7. The FBI placed bugs and broke into their homes. It monitored secret communications with Moscow, marital rows, even lovemaking.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Corera correctly notes that the US and UK were slow to appreciate Russia\u2019s malign intent once Putin became president</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Russia\u2019s foreign intelligence agency, the SVR, ran its agents along classic cold war lines, it turned out. From time to time, a courier codenamed Christopher Metsos flew to the US to meet individual members of his secret team. Money to fund their activities was hidden next to a semi-buried beer bottle. On another occasion, Metsos picked up cash from a Russian official, swapping bags in the New York subway.</p> <p>The FBI made interesting discoveries about how the illegals spoke to Moscow. The oldest tapped out coded radio messages. The youngest, the glamorous <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/oct/31/fbi-russian-spy-ring-anna-chapman\" title=\"\">Anna Chapman</a>, used a laptop to access a private wireless network, while meeting a handler in a Manhattan coffee bar. There was also steganography: encrypted text files magically hidden among innocent-looking photos of colourful flowers.</p> <p>This tradecraft was certainly ingenious, but what exactly did the spies achieve? None of them succeeded in learning US secrets. The FBI was able to warn off potential targets. Corera takes the view that the illegals were a genuine threat, on a par with the Cambridge spies who devastated British intelligence. The 21st-century Russians could have recruited a new generation of American double agents, he thinks.</p> <p>The counter-view is that the illegals were a throwback to a bygone era, by a regime that chucked Marxism-Leninism but kept the old KGB playbook. A prestigious SVR programme costing $50m ended in failure and embarrassment. The Kremlin was clearly furious. The 2010 break-in at the <em>Guardian</em>\u2019s office happened after I poked fun at the \u201camateurish and bungling\u201d behaviour of Moscow\u2019s ghost spies abroad, who used the identities of dead children.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"aa8e1e2ceed2ac28d195399f1c45c22464362155\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/aa8e1e2ceed2ac28d195399f1c45c22464362155/0_0_2000_1500/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Russian agent Anna Chapman in New York, June 2010\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Russian agent Anna Chapman in New York, June 2010.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Corera draws a link between the extraordinary events of that summer and Putin\u2019s subsequent revenge. The Obama administration decided to swap the illegals for four jailed Russians who had allegedly spied for the west. The exchange took place on the tarmac of Vienna airport. Watching from the Russian side was Alexander Zhomov, a veteran spymaster whom Corera likens to Karla, John le Carr\u00e9\u2019s fictional KGB super-chief.</p> <p>One of those traded by Moscow was an ex-officer from GRU military intelligence, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/mar/10/sergei-skripal-salisbury-poisoning-putin\" title=\"\">Sergei Skripal</a>. Skripal had spied for MI6. In 2018 the GRU sent two assassins to his home in Salisbury, where he lived under his own name. There, they poisoned him and his daughter, Yulia, in an operation redolent of the 2006 teapot murder of another Russian-born MI6 asset, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/19/alexander-litvinenko-the-man-who-solved-his-own-murder\" title=\"\">Alexander Litvinenko</a>.</p> <p>Corera correctly notes that the US and UK were slow to appreciate Russia\u2019s malign intent once Putin became president. In the 00s, MI6 stopped monitoring the SVR\u2019s London office, he reports. By 2005, at least 30 career spies were based at the Russian embassy in Kensington. Typically, the Russians would elude MI5 surveillance. \u201cIt was our C team against their A team,\u201d one British counter-espionage official tells him.</p> <p><em>Russians Among U</em><em>s</em> offers a persuasive account of how Moscow had adapted its espionage toolkit in the wake of the 2010 fiasco. Increasingly, the Kremlin uses a range of intermediaries to influence and subvert western politics. Some are oligarchs. Others are \u201cco-optees\u201d \u2013 Russians without formal spy training. There are also \u201ccyber\u201d illegals who, in 2016, remotely impersonated Americans on Facebook during the US presidential election.</p> <p>Did Moscow seek to influence the outcome of the EU referendum vote, in the same way it backed Donald Trump\u2019s long-shot campaign for the White House? Corera swerves around this question, alas. Theresa May and Boris Johnson say there was no \u201csuccessful\u201d interference, but refuse to define what that means. Corera doesn\u2019t examine recent donations by wealthy Russian emigres to Tory coffers.</p> <p>Overall, this is a compelling book that combines good storytelling with a subtle understanding of spy methods old and new. Corera notes that the government hasn\u2019t taken meaningful action against Russian money, even after the gruesome Skripal hit. Wealthy Russians can buy mansions as before and float their companies on the London stock exchange.</p> <p>With Johnson and \u201cglobal Britain\u201d, Russia\u2019s blurred espionage war is set to continue.</p> <p><em>Luke Harding is the author of Shadow State: Murder, Mayhem and Russia\u2019s Remaking of the West to be published in May by Guardian Faber. </em></p> <p><em>\u2022 Russians Among Us: Sleeper Cells, Ghost Stories and the Hunt for Putin\u2019s Agents </em>by Gordon Corera is published by William Collins (\u00a320).

  "<h2>Top story: Infection rate may be about to take off</h2> \n<p>Hello, Warren Murray here, and this will take a bit longer than singing Happy Birthday twice.</p> \n<p>Britons have been told to avoid pubs, bars, restaurants and non-essential travel in order to slow the spread of coronavirus, and to self-isolate if anyone in their family falls ill. The new government advice, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/16/pm-tells-britons-to-avoid-non-essential-contact-with-others\">something of a U-turn</a>, came during the prime minister\u2019s first daily press conference. Boris Johnson unveiled a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/16/new-data-new-policy-why-uks-coronavirus-strategy-has-changed\">series of stringent new restrictions</a>, including a 14-day isolation for all households where someone has symptoms; a warning against \u201cnon-essential\u201d contact; and an end to all mass gatherings. The death toll in the UK has increased to at least 55 people, including the first death in Wales.

The commission, in a report partly stemming from the 2016 EU referendum, is proposing measures to change the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/mar/17/online-political-ads-should-be-labelled-says-law-commission\">Victorian-era laws that govern how UK democracy operates</a>. In 2017, 42.8% of the total reported campaign advertising spend was online \u2013 much of it micro-targeted, making it hard to ensure electoral spending rules are observed and can be enforced. By contrast, printed material must by law identify its publisher. \u201cBeing able to track the origin of campaign material is also important for voters, as it enables them to assess its credibility,\u201d the report notes. Other recommended reforms include wider powers to suspend polling due to, for example, natural disaster or terrorism; letting courts throw out frivolous challenges to election results; and prison sentences for electoral fraud.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>More woe for Metro \u2013 </strong>A group of 17 Iranian customers is suing Metro Bank, saying their accounts were unfairly suspended without notice or explanation.

Data shows that over a period longer than the first world war 4,215 bombs and missiles were launched from Reaper drones or RAF jets in Syria and Iraq. A wide discrepancy has emerged between estimates of the number of civilians killed. The US-led coalition against Isis estimates all air raids caused 1,370 civilian casualties. Airwars, an NGO, says there were actually more than 8,000 and possibly more than 13,000.

  "<p>Heath officials in Ohio have postponed the state\u2019s primary vote just hours before polls were set to open, an 11th-hour decision that came after a judge denied the governor\u2019s request to postpone the vote because of the coronavirus.</p> <p>The health director, Amy Acton, declared a health emergency that would prevent the polls from opening out of fear of exposing voters and volunteer poll workers, many of them elderly.</p> <p>Arizona, Florida and Illinois were proceeding with their presidential primaries.</p> <p>Earlier on Monday, Ohio\u2019s Governor Mike DeWine recommended that his state postpone in-person voting during Tuesday\u2019s primary elections. DeWine said he alone did not have the authority to postpone the election, but lawyers would file a lawsuit to try to move the in-person voting date to 2 June.</p> <p>\u201cWe cannot conduct this election tomorrow,\u201d DeWine said, adding that Ohioans should not be forced to make the \u201cchoice between their health and their constitutional rights and their duties as [an] American citizen\u201d.</p> <p>Later on Monday, in an interview with CNN, DeWine said without drastic moves tens of thousands of poll workers, many of them \u201cover the age of 65\u201d would be in places where the virus could spread.</p> <p>\u201cWe in Ohio have to take very tough actions and I know people in Ohio today are very upset, I respect that,\u201d DeWine added.</p> <p>But a Franklin county court of common pleas judge declined to order the postponement on Monday evening. According to a <a href=\"https://www.nbc4i.com/news/state-news/dewine-postpones-in-person-voting-for-primary-until-june-2/\">NBC news affiliate</a>, Judge Richard Frye said he was reluctant to override the election date set by the Ohio legislature and that coronavirus has been an issue of concern since January.</p> <p>The attempted move by Ohio\u2019s governor was the latest example of elected American officials in executive positions taking extra steps to fight the pandemic. The White House on Monday announced new guidelines in an attempt to curb the spread of the virus. In a press conference announcing the new guidelines Trump said he thought postponing elections was \u201cunnecessary\u201d.</p> <p>Four states were set to hold primary elections on Tuesday as the Democratic frontrunner, Joe Biden, faces off against rival Bernie Sanders for the presidential nomination. In-person votes were still set to take place in Arizona, Illinois, and Florida, despite all facing pressure to stop mass gatherings or activities that could spread the virus.</p> <p>Georgia already postponed next week\u2019s primary and Louisiana has postponed its scheduled 4 April primary. Kentucky announced on Monday it would postpone its primary from 19 May to 23 June. \u201cMy hope is that this delay will allow us to have a normal election,\u201d the secretary of state, Michael Adams, said in a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/KYSecState/status/1239657695520739328\">video message</a>.</p> <p>Last week Ohio officials relocated 160 polling sites that originally were located in senior living facilities. In Illinois on Monday, Governor JB Pritzker ordered that events with gatherings larger than 50 people be canceled. The Illinois department of public health also offered <a href=\"https://www.elections.il.gov/Downloads/Misc/PDF/COVID-19%20Interim%20Guidance%20Election%20Polling%20Places.pdf\">guidance</a> for both poll workers and voters participating in the election on Tuesday, which includes practicing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/16/how-to-social-distance-convince-friends-family\">social distancing</a> and \u201ccleaning of visibly dirty surfaces followed by disinfection\u201d.</p> <p>Tammy Patrick, a former Arizona election official and a senior adviser at the bipartisan Democracy Fund, noted that many poll workers and election officials are elderly, the demographic that makes them particularly vulnerable to contracting the coronavirus. It\u2019s unclear what impact the election changes or the virus itself will have on election officials.</p> <p>\u201cWe don\u2019t know yet what impact this will have on not only the amount of poll workers we have,\u201d Patrick said. \u201c But the amount of election officials that do this work \u2026 they also have the ability to get sick \u2013 secretaries of state, all the state election boards, local boards.\u201d</p> <p>Florida\u2019s governor, Ron DeSantis, vowed again on Monday that the state\u2019s primary would go ahead.</p> <p>But veteran Democratic pollsters said the pandemic and varying state responses could dramatically change turnout.</p> <p>\u201cThe real answer is we have no idea [what will happen] unfortunately,\u201d said Democratic pollster Pete Brodnitz. \u201cI mean it\u2019s just not one unprecedented thing, it\u2019s an unprecedented thing combined with an unusual thing.\u201d</p> <p>The two remaining serious campaigns in the Democratic primary \u2013 former vice-president Biden\u2019s and Vermont senator Sanders\u2019\u2013 have drastically recalibrated their campaign schedules to give virtual town hall and tele-town hall events, to try to continue campaigning while preventing mass gatherings of people.</p> <p>The voting precautions come at a time when the Sanders campaign needs high turnout among young voters who generally favor him to help reverse the momentum back in his direction. Biden needs older Democratic voters to come out in droves to further fuel his lead in the primary.</p> <p>\u201cI mean we have the Sanders campaign which is pretty obviously in a downward direction,\u201d Brodnitz said. \u201cWhich means his supporters have to take that into account when they\u2019re ready to vote. And it\u2019s harder to motivate people under those conditions. And then you have the coronavirus which is going to be a particular concern to older voters.\u201d</p> <p>Cornell Belcher, another Democratic pollster, said all the unusual factors going into the elections on Tuesday meant that this \u201cis really uncharted waters\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what turnout\u2019s going to look like when you have such uncertainty and fear out there,\u201d Belcher said.</p> <p>Belcher added that it wasn\u2019t clear who had the advantage going into the primaries but he said it was arguable that \u201cBiden clearly has a broader coalition of voters. Does Biden have a stronger core base of voters than Sanders? I don\u2019t know if he does.</p> <p>\u201cSo the question will come \u2018does the broadness of Biden\u2019s support enough to overcome what I think is clearly a base energy advantage that Sanders has,\u201d Belcher said.</p>",

Biden can win over reluctant Latinos with a bold and progressive stance on immigration, she said.<br></p> <p>\u201cI hope that he doesn\u2019t eat up the lie that he has to be more conservative on the immigration issue,\u201d said Romero, who hasn\u2019t endorsed Biden or Sanders since her favoured candidate, Elizabeth Warren, dropped out. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t be afraid of an issue that is so important for Latino voters, water it down and not have policies that Latinos can get excited about.\u201d</p> <p>Arizona and Florida are both likely to be battlegrounds in the November election. In Arizona, one in three residents is Latino; in Florida, it\u2019s one in four.</p> <p>Early in his administration, Obama aggressively increased efforts to deport immigrants living in the country illegally. He\u2019d hoped to convince members of Congress and the public that he was serious about border security in order to secure a comprehensive immigration reform bill that would extend legal status to millions of people living in the US without authorization. The reform bill never passed, but the deportations disrupted families, drove fear in immigrant communities and left deep wounds.<br></p> <p>Any Democrat\u2019s immigration policies would be superior to Trump\u2019s, but that won\u2019t be enough to excite Latinos, said Tomas Robles, co-director of Living United for Change in Arizona, or LUCHA, a Latino organizing group that has endorsed Sanders.</p> <p>\u201cYou cannot depend on people\u2019s hatred or fear of Trump to inspire them to turn out in droves for Vice President Biden,\u201d Robles said to the AP. \u201cBernie has worked hard to motivate Latinos as a base. But the entire establishment part has failed at doing the same.\u201d</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e6f70828f088d7575594308\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-16T12:32:10.952Z\">12.32pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">US calls on Vietnam to release blogger Truong Duy Nhat</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The State department have issued <a href=\"https://www.state.gov/sentencing-of-blogger-and-radio-free-asia-contributor-truong-duy-nhat/\">a statement calling for the release of Truong Duy Nhat</a>, a weekly blogger for the Vietnamese service of Radio Free Asia. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/feb/05/truong-duy-nhat-vietnam-blogger-radio-free-asia-thailand\">He disappeared in January 2019</a>, a day after he applied for refugee status with the UN High Commissioner for Refugees in Bangkok, and reappeared in custody.</p> <p>Truong Duy Nhat was sentenced to a 10-year prison term last week.

Johnson was challenged about this at his Downing Street briefing, but left it to his chief medical officer, Chris Whitty to answer.</p> \n  <p>Whitty said: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Of course, we completely agree with the secretary general that testing is absolutely critical. </p> \n   <p>And within the UK, we have three levels of testing at the moment. We have testing in intensive care systems, which is across the whole system. We have testing in hospitals for people who have got pneumonia for people got milder disease, and we have the GP network, which is testing in the community.</p> \n   <p>The one thing which we did stop doing was testing based on geography ... at this stage geography is much less important in the disease. </p> \n   <p>We do intend to continue to scale up testing. But I think it\u2019s important to realise the scale of UK testing which has been substantial.

As the virus moves to low income countries, we are deeply concerned about the impact it could have among populations with high HIV prevalence, or among malnourished children. </p> \n   <p>That\u2019s why we\u2019re calling on every country and every individual to do everything they can to stop transmission.

Do it for yourself, do it for others. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>And he urged people around the world to stop hoarding. Tedros said: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We also asked people to express their solidarity by refraining from hoarding essential items, including medicines. Hoarding can create shortages of medicines and other essential products which can exacerbate suffering. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Tedros also warned against treating Covid-19 patients at home. He said: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We recognise that many countries have already exceeded their capacity to care for mild cases in dedicated health facilities. In that situation, countries should prioritize all their patients and those with underlying conditions. </p> \n   <p>Some countries have expanded their capacity by using stadiums and gyms to care for mild cases, with severe and critical cases cared for in hospitals. Another option is for patients with mild disease to be isolated and cared for at home.

Good luck with that.</p> \n   <p>No one knows for sure how to predict the unprecedented \u2013 or how to handle it. Initially there was a sense, certainly among the doctors to whom I have spoken,that Britain\u2019s position at the non-hysterical end of the spectrum was correct. The chief medical officer for England, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/mar/08/five-coronavirus-experts-guide-british-public-through-crisis\">Chris Whitty</a>, took the view that the illness, though highly contagious, was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/03/uk-government-coronavirus-plans-strip-fire-and-police-to-essentials-covid-19\">most dangerous</a> for those with a vulnerable immune system.

There were reasons only for contingencies.</p> \n   <p>As the virus expanded and other governments reacted differently, this stance was challenged. But Whitty had accepted that, if circumstances altered, policy would shift from \u201ccontain to delay\u201d. This was undermined as global hysteria rose to a peak. Other countries were reacting as had China and South Korea, and progressed to \u201clockdown\u201d. England\u2019s chief scientific officer, Sir Patrick Vallance, unwisely mentioned the technical term \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/13/coronavirus-science-chief-defends-uk-measures-criticism-herd-immunity\">herd immunity</a>\u201d, implying that Britain would over time develop resistance to coronavirus.

overall death toll from the virus currently sweeping the world.</p> \n   <p>Emissions from petrol and diesel engines were still at \u201cdangerous\u201d levels that could imperil the most vulnerable during this and future pandemics, said the European Respiratory Society (EPS), which is a member of the EPHA.</p> \n   <p>\u201cPatients with chronic lung and heart conditions caused or worsened by long-term exposure to air pollution are less able to fight off lung infections and more likely to die,\u201d EPS member Sara De Matteis said.</p> \n   <p>\u201cThis is likely also the case for Covid-19,\u201d added de Matteis, who is also an associate professor in occupational and environmental medicine at Italy\u2019s Cagliari University.</p> \n   <p>While there is currently no proven link between Covid-19 mortality and air pollution, one peer-reviewed study into the 2003 SARS outbreak showed that patients in regions with moderate air pollution levels were 84 percent more likely to die than those in regions with low air pollution.</p> \n   <p>According to the European Environment Agency, air pollution leads to around 400,000 early deaths across the continent annually, despite European Union air quality directives.</p> \n   <p>One Covid-19 hotspot, northern Italy, has particularly high levels of PM10 - microscopic particles of pollution due largely to road traffic.</p> \n   <p>The number of fatalities in Italy shot up by 368 to 1,809 on Sunday - more than half of all the cases recorded outside China.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div

In Scotland, authorities will continue to test key workers, including critical frontline NHS staff, to ensure the people who are so essential to managing the disease but also keeping a critical infrastructure going are not self-isolating unnecessarily.</p> \n  <p>Scotland is taking the same approach to the rest of the UK in considering asking elderly people to reduce social contact amid the coronavirus outbreak, the first minister said.</p> \n  <p>Sturgeon would not comment in detail about the stringent approach other countries have taken, but said: \u201cI\u2019m not privy to the advice and decision making in those countries. My responsibility is to follow the scientific advice we\u2019ve been given, to interrogate and scrutinise that advice and to apply judgement to it.\u201d</p> \n  <p>The first minister said that Scotland has already taken \u201cquite significant steps\u201d to tackle the outbreak and possibly prevent a second severe spike. \u201cAsking everyone who has a fever or a cough to stay in their house for seven days is a significant step and behaviour change that we\u2019re asking people to apply.\u201d</p> \n  <p>She added: \u201cThat advice of course is about how we slow the spread and reduce the impact, but we do that in a way that perhaps avoids a later perhaps just as severe spike later on.\u201d</p> \n  <p>The Scottish government\u2019s ban on mass gathering does not currently apply to schools, travel, shopping and work. Dr Catherine Calderwood, Scotland\u2019s chief medical officer, described blanket school closures that lasted a few weeks as ineffective.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>[You need] a minimum of three months in order to really suppress the spread of the virus in these type of institutions. The thought that children won\u2019t mix together for three months is impossible. </p> \n   <p>We therefore risk having children congregate to other areas together, the virus is spread amongst them, so you actually have measures put in which are ineffective in keeping virus from those groups of children.</p> \n   <p>To compare talking about closing the schools for two weeks, it\u2019s very very clear from the science that is not a scientific way to either prevent the spread of the virus nor indeed to protect vulnerable people.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-03-16T12:46:30.592Z\">at 12.46pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e6f6ed68f088d75755942f6\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/graemewearden\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-16T12:23:11.073Z\">12.23pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Fears of the pandemic prompting a global recession have driven the FTSE 100 in the <strong>UK</strong> down 7.2% to 4976 points.

There was a testy exchange where Sanders criticised Biden for his refusal to disavow a super PAC supporting his candidacy and his past comments on potential cuts to social security.</li> \n   <li>Joe Biden<strong> </strong><strong>vowed to choose a woman as his running mate</strong> if he won the presidential nomination.

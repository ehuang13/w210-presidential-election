  "<p>Good morning, this is Richard Parkin bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Thursday 16 April.</p> \n<h2>Coronavirus</h2> \n<p><strong>The Covid-19 pandemic has infected over two million people,</strong> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/apr/15/coronavirus-live-news-trump-suspends-who-funding-as-global-deaths-pass-125000?page=with:block-5e9750368f08cf571cdb1ae7#block-5e9750368f08cf571cdb1ae7\">with more than 130,000 dying from the disease globally</a>.

  "<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/elizabeth-warren\">Elizabeth Warren</a> has endorsed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/joebiden\">Joe Biden</a>, the third major endorsement for the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee in as many days as the party comes together in the run-up to the November <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-elections-2020\">general election</a>.</p> \n<p>Warren <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/05/elizabeth-warren-quitting-2020-democratic-presidential-race\">exited</a> the race last month after a disappointing showing on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/super-tuesday\">Super Tuesday</a>, where she finished third in primary voting in her home state of Massachusetts. As other former rivals quickly aligned behind Biden, most notably <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/amy-klobuchar\">Amy Klobuchar</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/pete-buttigieg\">Pete Buttigieg</a>, Warren waited, declining to immediately throw her support behind him or Bernie Sanders, an ideological ally.</p> \n<p>Sanders ended his campaign last week and endorsed Biden on Monday. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/barack-obama\">Barack Obama</a>, who remained publicly neutral during the primary, endorsed Biden on Tuesday.</p> \n<p>\u201cJoe Biden has spent nearly his entire life in public service. He knows that a government run with integrity, competence, and heart will save lives and save livelihoods,\u201d Warren wrote in a fundraising email sent to donors on Biden\u2019s behalf.</p> \n<p>\u201cAnd we can\u2019t afford to let Donald Trump continue to endanger the lives and livelihoods of every American,\u201d she added, in a strong statement amid the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">coronavirus crisis</a>.</p> \n<p>Warren was the last of Biden\u2019s major opponents to endorse him and her support helps the party present a united front against Trump as it prepares for what will probably be a historically divisive general election.</p> \n<p>Unlike in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-elections-2016\">2016</a>, when the Democratic primary race extended late into the summer, the process of choosing the party\u2019s nominee was relatively short, despite a record field. Though Biden likely won\u2019t accumulate enough delegates to officially claim the nomination until June, he started to build an insurmountable lead in early March and within weeks was the party\u2019s presumptive standard-bearer.</p> \n<p>The swift backing of his rivals will help ease the often-fraught process of bringing the party together after a hard-fought primary.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/12/democratic-primary-joe-biden-bernie-sanders-2020\">The Democratic primary was a wild, unpredictable ride \u2013 except the result</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Her endorsement comes as speculation builds around who Biden will choose as a running mate. Biden has been unusually forthcoming in discussing his search, vowing to choose a woman and many party leaders are urging him to consider his former rivals, Warren among them.</p> \n<p>Warren was the last major female candidate in a historic field of Democratic women and her demise led to vocal calls for Biden to choose a woman. Some of the party\u2019s more liberal members believe choosing Warren would help Biden appeal to progressives and young voters who remain deeply skeptical of his campaign.</p> \n<p>In her endorsement, Warren sought notes of unity, assuring liberal supporters that Biden is listening.</p> \n<p>\u201cWhen you disagree, he\u2019ll listen \u2013 not just listen, but really hear you,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd treat you with respect, no matter where you\u2019re coming from. And he has shown throughout this campaign that when you come with new facts or a good argument, he\u2019s not too afraid or too proud to be persuaded.\u201d</p> \n<p>In a email to her supporters, Biden said bluntly: \u201cYou\u2019re needed.\u201d</p> \n<p>The former vice president assured them that he, too, intended to fight for the \u201cbig, structural change\u201d that Warren championed and insisted that he is looking forward and \u201cnot trying to take us back to a country that never existed.\u201d</p> \n<p>\u201cI know, for some of you, that you might be skeptical of me or my campaign. I understand that,\u201d he wrote. \u201cBut I intend to earn your votes. And I intend to earn your trust.\u201d</p> \n<p>In an early overture to progressive voters, Biden adopted Warren\u2019s plan to overhaul the bankruptcy system, an issue over which they had clashed more than a decade ago, when she was a Harvard law professor and he was a senator from Delaware. The plan would roll back key provisions of a 2005 bankruptcy law Biden supported and Warren vocally opposed, even testifying against it before his committee.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"ec64ff6d-a5cb-4878-828d-bd6da8ce367e\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4yCY232AZ_8?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>In the email to donors, Warren recalled being sworn in to the Senate in 2013. As vice-president, he presided over the swearing in ceremony.</p> \n<p>\u201cJoe Biden was there the very moment I became a senator \u2013 he swore me in,\u201d she wrote. \u201cAnd when he did, he said, \u201cYou gave me hell! And you\u2019re gonna do a great job.\u2019\u201d</p> \n<p>Biden, 77, said he would create a committee to help him vet possible running mates by the end of the month. The selection process, which is typically shrouded in secrecy, will include between six and a dozen candidates, all women, and he will make his choice before the Democratic convention in Milwaukee, which was postponed to August because of the coronavirus pandemic.</p> \n<p>If elected, Biden\u2019s running mate would be the first female vice-president in history. Only two women have ever been chosen as running mates: the Alaska governor Sarah Palin in 2008 and the New York congresswoman Geraldine Ferraro in 1984.</p> \n<p>Biden has spoken on several occasions about the partnership that he shared with Obama as his vice-president and has told donors and voters that he is seeking a similar dynamic with his future running mate, who he believes should complement his experience.</p> \n<p>At a virtual fundraising event earlier this month, Biden said: \u201cI\u2019m going to need a woman vice-president who has capacities, has strengths where I have weaknesses.\u201d</p>",

The contest will unfold in a political landscape transformed beyond all recognition by the coronavirus pandemic that has already claimed <a href=\"https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html\">at least 14,000 </a>American lives and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/03/us-jobs-report-march-unemployment-coronavirus\">nearly 10m jobs</a>.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/09/biden-2020-bernie-election-trump-coronavirus\">Biden finally has an open field.

In the meantime, here\u2019s what we know about ventilator shortages in the US:</strong></p> \n  <p>It is true that some states, so far, have ended up with more ventilators than they originally projected they would need. California has loaned 500 ventilators to states like New York. California hospitals managed to increase their stock from 7,500 machines to more than 11,000, according to the state\u2019s governor, Gavin Newsom. \u201cThat has put less strain and pressure on the state\u2019s effort to procure additional ventilators,\u201d Newsom said.</p> \n  <p>However, that doesn\u2019t mean that there isn\u2019t a national shortage. The US has roughly 173,000 ventilators, according to the Center for Health Security at Johns Hopkins University. Experts from Harvard Medical School predict that the US could end up needing <a href=\"https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp2005689\">31 times that number</a> to treat coronavirus patients. <br></p> \n  <p>An article in the <a href=\"https://slack-redir.net/link?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nejm.org%2Fdoi%2Ffull%2F10.1056%2FNEJMp2006141\">New England Journal of Medicine published on Wednesday 25 March </a>categorically concluded that the US does not have enough ventilators to treat patients with Covid-19 in the coming months.<br></p> \n  <p>The authors, American public health experts, wrote: \u201cThere is a broad range of estimates of the number of ventilators we will need to care for U.S. patients with Covid-19, from several hundred thousand to as many as a million. The estimates vary depending on the number, speed, and severity of infections, of course, but even the availability of testing affects the number of ventilators needed.... current estimates of the number of ventilators in the United States range from 60,000 to 160,000, depending on whether those that have only partial functionality are included. The national strategic reserve of ventilators is small and far from sufficient for the projected gap. No matter which estimate we use, there are not enough ventilators for patients with Covid-19 in the upcoming months.\u201d<br></p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-14T22:49:16.774Z\">at 11.49pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e9638e18f08213494be6c1d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-14T22:29:05.181Z\">11.29pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Trump also based the WHO for praising China\u2019s \u201ctransparency\u201d.</strong></p> \n  <p>But the president himself praised China\u2019s transparency \u2014 on January 24. </p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1220818115354923009\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">China has been working very hard to contain the Coronavirus.

More on Donald Trump\u2019s unhinged White House briefing last night in a minute. First, the figures <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ng-interactive/2020/apr/13/coronavirus-map-us-latest-covid-19-cases-state-by-state\"><strong>according to Johns Hopkins University</strong></a>:</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li>US cases: <strong>582,431</strong></li> \n   <li>US deaths: <strong>23,647</strong></li> \n   <li>New York deaths: <strong>10,058</strong></li> \n   <li>New Jersey deaths: <strong>2,443</strong></li> \n   <li>Michigan deaths: <strong>1,602</strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <p>Yesterday, Andrew Cuomo, governor of New York, told reporters \u201c<strong><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/13/nyregion/new-york-coronavirus-reopen-plan.html\">the worst is over</a></strong>\u201d, if social distancing and other restrictions remain in place, and announced a partnership with six other north-eastern governors to work on reopening the regional economy.</p> \n  <p>Of course, Trump\u2019s public utterances clashed somewhat with such a cautious approach. </p> \n  <p>On Twitter, the president claimed <strong>authority over the states</strong> about reopening plans. The experts <a href=\"https://twitter.com/steve_vladeck/status/1249731213566324740\">dismissed</a> that claim.</p> \n  <p>Then at a White House briefing marked by attacks on reporters and the playing of a propaganda film half-ripped from Fox News, <strong>Trump made a claim for the ages</strong>:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>When somebody is the president of the United States, the authority is total. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Constitutional lawyers: Nope.</p> \n  <p>CNN, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/goldengateblond/status/1249829406719143937\"><strong>CBS reporter Paula Reid</strong></a> and most of the rest of the press corps: Incredulous.</p> \n  <p>Fox News?</p> \n  <p>Laura Ingraham: \u201cI thoroughly enjoyed today\u2019s coronavirus task force briefing. That was great. It was a tour de force!\u201d</p> \n  <p>Sean Hannity, from whose show much of Trump\u2019s propaganda film seemed to come, <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/media/texas-greg-abbott-states-reopen-before-may\"><strong>spoke to Texas governor Greg Abbott</strong></a>, who said: \u201cI think most states can reopen even sooner than later. We don\u2019t have to wait until 1 May.\u201d</p> \n  <p>That\u2019s the date by which Trump, the panjandrum of the White House podium, has said he would like to start reopening the shuttered US economy.</p> \n  <p>White House experts including the notably not-yet-fired Dr Anthony Fauci have cast doubt on that goal and said moving too swiftly to lift social restrictions <strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/12/trump-fauci-hahn-reopening-who-virus-stalk-human-race\">could cause a resurgence in Covid-19 cases</a></strong>. Trump says the decision is his alone and he will listen to his advisers \u2013 and also rely a lot on \u201cinstinct\u201d.</p> \n  <p>Let that sink in. While you do, here\u2019s some reading:</p> \n  <p>Washington bureau chief David Smith\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/13/trump-coronavirus-meltdown-media-authority\"><strong>take on that briefing</strong></a>, with an intro for the ages:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>A toddler threw a self-pitying tantrum on live television on Monday night. Unfortunately he was 73 years old, wearing a long red tie and running the world\u2019s most powerful country.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>And here\u2019s Tom McCarthy\u2019s timeline of Trump\u2019s coronavirus misinformation campaign:</p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/14/trump-coronavirus-alerts-disinformation-timeline\">'It will disappear': the disinformation Trump spread about the coronavirus \u2013 timeline</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n</div>"

The decision by the Russian watchdog could affect hundreds of ventilators that have been produced since April as Russian hospitals sought new supplies to prepare for a flood of coronavirus cases. </p> \n  <p>Five coronavirus patients, some reportedly attached to ventilators, died in the early hours of Tuesday after a fire broke out at the St George hospital in St Petersburg. A fire last week at a Moscow hospital treating coronavirus patients also killed one person. That fire may also have been tied to a faulty ventilator. Both hospitals were reportedly using Aventa-M ventilators produced by a state-run factory in Russia\u2019s Urals region. </p> \n  <p>An April tender showed that last month the St George hospital had ordered 237 ventilators from the factory, which is the only manufacturer of that ventilator in the country. <br></p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ebbbe068f08d99d46a15f24\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/emmanuel-akinwotu\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-13T09:34:56.619Z\">10.34am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The continuing ban on public and religious gatherings in Nigeria has led to increasingly divided reactions from Churches in Nigeria. </p> \n  <p>In recent weeks, two of the most influential mega-church pastors in the country have grown in hostility to the government\u2019s lockdown measures, and questioned the severity of the pandemic altogether.</p> \n  <p>Bishop David Oyedepo, the founder of Living Faith Tabernacle has been among the most ardent critics of the ban on places of worship. Its main branch on the outskirts of Lagos draws 50,000 people. Earlier this week Oyedepo said the closure of churches while hospitals and markets were open amounted to a conspiracy against Churches. <br><br>\u201cThere is something wrong; for people to be allowed to be in the market for six hours and can\u2019t be in church for two hours. I can smell a rat,\u201d he said this week. \u201cThe voice of darkness is influencing people at various levels, targeting the church because the growth and expansion of the church is the greatest headache of the devil. I declare churches open.\u201d </p> \n  <p>Pastor Chris Oyakhilome\u2019s Christ Embassy is spread around the world with a main branch in Lagos seating 30,000 people. The pastor has been a consistent critic of measures to tackle the pandemic. \u201cThe lockdown is not science,\u201d he said in a sermon on Tuesday. The wearing of facemasks in public was \u201can embarrassment to science\u201d, he added. He has also previously linked Covid-19 to 5G mobile phone networks, fuelling a conspiracy theory that has spread around the world.</p> \n  <p>Both church leaders have faced criticism for their comments, not least from fellow church pastors. Pastor Tunde Bakare, the head of The Citadel Global Community Church, where the main hall in Lagos seats 5,000, this week donated two church buildings and a private residence to Nigerian states for isolation centres. </p> \n  <p>\u201cChurches with multiple facilities, rather than their leaders criticising the government should collaborate with them,\u201d he said. \u201cThey must be prepared to offer some of their halls to the government as isolation centres, in support of the efforts of the government.\u201d<br><br>In a further boost to Nigeria\u2019s Covid-19 response, the Catholic Church in Nigeria this week donated all of its 425 medical facilities across the country to the government to serve as isolation and treatment centres. Nigeria\u2019s predominantly deeply religious population is evenly split between Christians and Muslims according to government surveys. </p> \n  <p>The effect of the lockdown on religious life has been immense. Yet many Nigerian Christians are increasingly calling on the country\u2019s mega churches to donate their now empty auditoriums as the country rushes to build its health capacity. New infections of Covid-19 in Nigeria are growing, now at 4,787, doubling in the last 12 days. 158 people have lost their lives and 959 people have recovered. </p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ebbba898f08d99d46a15ef8\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-13T09:15:35.176Z\">10.15am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Reuters have filed this update from Poland:</p> \n  <blockquote> \n   <p>Poland will extend its strict border controls until 12 June due to the coronavirus pandemic, its Interior Ministry said on Wednesday.</p> \n   <p>Poland closed its borders to foreigners in March to stop the spread of the coronavirus and has extended the restriction four times since then.

Call it the Screen New Deal. Far more hi-tech than anything we have seen during previous disasters, the future that is being rushed into being as the bodies still pile up treats our past weeks of physical isolation not as a painful necessity to save lives, but as a living laboratory for a permanent \u2013 and highly profitable \u2013 no-touch future.</p> \n  <p>This is a future in which, for the privileged, almost everything is home delivered, either virtually via streaming and cloud technology, or physically via driverless vehicle or drone, then screen \u201cshared\u201d on a mediated platform. It\u2019s a future that employs far fewer teachers, doctors and drivers. It accepts no cash or credit cards (under guise of virus control), and has skeletal mass transit and far less live art. It\u2019s a future that claims to be run on \u201cartificial intelligence\u201d, but is actually held together by tens of millions of anonymous workers tucked away in warehouses, data centres, content-moderation mills, electronic sweatshops, lithium mines, industrial farms, meat-processing plants and prisons, where they are left unprotected from disease and hyper-exploitation. It\u2019s a future in which our every move, our every word, our every relationship is trackable, traceable and data-mineable by unprecedented collaborations between government and tech giants.</p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2020/may/13/naomi-klein-how-big-tech-plans-to-profit-from-coronavirus-pandemic\">Naomi Klein: How big tech plans to profit from the pandemic</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ebb75ce8f08a55ecde58e3c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-13T05:00:58.509Z\">6.00am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Nature is healing in San Jose, California: </p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/helenrsullivan/status/1260410385452187649\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">oh my goat <a href=\"https://t.co/bvcaMIAHgz\">https://t.co/bvcaMIAHgz</a></p>\u2014 Helen Sullivan (@helenrsullivan) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/helenrsullivan/status/1260410385452187649?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 13, 2020</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ebb7d148f08a55ecde58e5e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-13T04:54:56.152Z\">5.54am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Thailand has recorded zero new coronavirus cases for the first time since 9 March, Rueters reports. </p> \n  <p>Thailand has 3,017 confirmed cases and<strong> </strong>56 deaths, according to <a href=\"https://www.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6\">Johns Hopkins University</a> data. </p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0a27ed82876dc5e0d74d4027305f041ef8a0eb5a\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0a27ed82876dc5e0d74d4027305f041ef8a0eb5a/0_237_5296_3176/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Street food sellers stand behind plastic divider sheet in Bangkok, Thailand, Wednesday, 13 May 2020.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Street food sellers stand behind plastic divider sheet in Bangkok, Thailand, Wednesday, 13 May 2020.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gemunu Amarasinghe/AP</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ebb76a68f08d99d46a15d56\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-13T04:45:47.425Z\">5.45am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Summary</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Confirmed deaths worldwide pass 290,000. </strong>According to researchers at Johns Hopkins University, at least 4,261,955 people around the world are known to have contracted the virus, while at least 291,964 have died since the pandemic began.<strong> </strong>The numbers, which are based on official and media reports, are likely to be significant underestimates due to suspected underreporting and differing recording and testing regimes.</li> \n   <li><strong>More than 147,000 Americans could die by early August \u2013 study. </strong>A newly revised coronavirus mortality model predicts more than 147,000 Americans will die from Covid-19 by early August, up nearly 10,000 from the last projection, as restrictions for curbing the pandemic are increasingly relaxed, researchers said on Tuesday. The current US death toll stands at 82,376.</li> \n   <li><strong>Brazil reports record deaths. </strong>Brazil reported a record <a href=\"https://covid.saude.gov.br/\">881 Covid-19</a> deaths in 24 hours on Tuesday, its health ministry said, taking its total to 12,400 and making it the world\u2019s sixth worst-affected country in terms of deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University <a href=\"https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html\">figures</a>. Its total of 177,589 confirmed cases is the world\u2019s seventh-highest.</li> \n   <li><strong>US Senate threatens sanctions on China over Covid-19 accounting. </strong>US Republican senators proposed legislation Tuesday that would empower President Donald Trump to slap sanctions on China if Beijing does not give a \u201cfull accounting\u201d for the coronavirus outbreak. The legislation will give Trump 60 days to certify to Congress that China has provided a full accounting on the Covid-19 outbreak to an investigation that could be led by the United States and its allies, or a United Nations body like the World Health Organization.</li> \n   <li><strong>Wuhan prepares to test 11 million residents. </strong>The Chinese city of Wuhan, the original centre of the pandemic, plans to test all 11 million residents for coronavirus, according to local media. It was widely believed that this will be done within 10 days. However, Chinese media reports have given some more clarity today, suggesting that while there is a citywide testing plan, the time limit is for each region on staggered start times.</li> \n   <li><strong>Twitter announces employees will be allowed to work from home \u2018forever\u2019. </strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/may/12/twitter-coronavirus-covid19-work-from-home\">Twitter will allow its employees to work from home \u201cforever\u201d</a>, chief executive officer Jack Dorsey said in a company-wide email Tuesday.

accounting\u201d for the coronavirus outbreak, AFP reports. <br></p> \n  <p>\u201cThe Chinese Communist Party must be held accountable for the detrimental role they played in this pandemic,\u201d said Senator Jim Inhofe, one of the sponsors of the \u201cCovid-19 Accountability Act.\u201d</p> \n  <p>\u201cTheir outright deception of the origin and spread of the virus cost the world valuable time and lives as it began to spread,\u201d he said in a statement.</p> \n  <p>The legislation will give Trump 60 days to certify to Congress that China has provided a full accounting on the Covid-19 outbreak to an investigation that could be led by the United States and its allies, or a United Nations body like the World Health Organization.</p> \n  <p>Trump must also certify that China has closed its highest-risk wet markets and released Hong Kong activists arrested in post-Covid-19 crackdowns.</p> \n  <p>Without certification, Trump would be authorised under the legislation to impose sanctions like asset freezes, travel bans and visa revocations, as well as restricting Chinese businesses\u2019 access to US bank financing and capital markets.</p> \n  <p>\u201cChina refuses to allow the international community to go into the Wuhan lab to investigate,\u201d said Senator Lindsey Graham, another sponsor of the bill.</p> \n  <p>\u201cThey refuse to allow investigators to study how this outbreak started.

  "<p>Republican Mike Garcia has defeated Democrat Christy Smith in the special election to fill the seat of the former US representative Katie Hill, who resigned amid scandal in late 2019.</p> <p>After a bitter political battle complicated and constrained by the pandemic, Garcia\u2019s win was a blow for Democrats who in 2018 had secured the suburban Los Angeles district for the first time in since 1990. But the candidates will soon have a rematch. Garcia will serve only five months before the seat is up for a vote again in November.</p> <p>The circumstances of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/oct/30/katie-hill-resignation-activists-vow-fight-female-democrat\">Hill\u2019s resignation</a> \u2013 she quit amid allegations that she had an affair with a staffer, and after private photos of her had been published online without her consent \u2013 had brought national attention to the race. Donald Trump, who endorsed Garcia and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/12/trump-foreshadows-how-he-could-undermine-presidential-election\">alleged that the election was \u201crigged\u201d</a> because of the opening of a new voting center in the district, also ensured that the race was closely watched, especially by Democrats who believed it would be a referendum on the president.</p> <p>In the election based almost entirely on mailed-in ballots amid stay-at-home orders due to the coronavirus pandemic, the full results will probably not be clear for days. Officials will accept ballots postmarked by election day, even if they arrive up to three days later.</p> <p>Still, Smith conceded on Wednesday afternoon as she trailed Garcia by 11 points in the results reported so far. \u201cWhile it\u2019s critical that we ensure every vote is counted and recorded, we believe that the current tally shows Mike Garcia is the likely victor in the 12 May special election,\u201d she said in her concession statement. \u201cThat said, this is only one step in this process, and I look forward to having a vigorous debate about the issues in the upcoming November 2020 election.\u201d</p> <p>As victory appeared assured, Garcia said his campaign\u2019s \u201cmessage of lower taxes and ensuring we don\u2019t take liberal Sacramento dysfunction to Washington prevailed\u201d.</p> <p>This is Garcia\u2019s first time taking public office. He ran unencumbered by a voting record, on a typically conservative platform. Though Democrats tried to paint him as a mini-Trump, Garcia more closely aligns with a new guard of young, moderate Republicans the party has sent out to woo the typically blue state. \u201cCalifornia Republicans have to learn to adapt to the local climate,\u201d said Bill Whalen, a Republican campaign strategist based in Sacramento. Garcia\u2019s victory may not guarantee he\u2019ll win a rematch against Smith in November, but it does give him a leg up, Whalen said.</p> <p>Smith, a state assembly member, lost despite earning the endorsements of Barack Obama and the Congressional Hispanic Caucus. Hill\u2019s unpopularity in the district, post-scandal, was a hurdle. Before the election, the <a href=\"https://cookpolitical.com/analysis/house/california-house/ca-25-race-replace-katie-hill-moves-lean-democratic-toss\">Cook Political Report</a> changed its assessment of the race from \u201clean Democratic\u201d to a \u201ctossup\u201d as the pandemic shut down traditional campaigning through door-knocking and town halls. Despite the challenges of campaigning, Democrats are still hopeful about Smith\u2019s chances in the general election. \u201cThe electorate will be very different then,\u201d said Rose Kapolczynski, a Democratic strategist based in Los Angeles. \u201cAnd I still think Smith will have a strong chance.\u201d</p> <p>Special elections are usually plagued with low voter turnout, though early numbers indicated that more people voted in this election than expected. All registered voters were automatically mailed a ballot, making this election a test case for November. California\u2019s governor, Gavin Newsom, recently announced that all Californians would have the option to mail in their ballots during the general election, amid uncertainty over how long the coronavirus crisis will limit people\u2019s ability to safely leave their homes.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/12/trump-foreshadows-how-he-could-undermine-presidential-election\">'It's all rigged': Trump foreshadows how he could undermine presidential election</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But it is wise to avoid projecting too much about the November elections based on this race, said Paul Mitchell, with the campaign research firm Political Data Inc. \u201cTo do so would be like predicting the championship based on the results of two-on-two basketball game before the finals,\u201d Mitchell said. He expects the same district will have 80% turnout in November, compared with less than half of that in the special election.</p> <p>According to the data available so far, 30% of registered Democrats and 46% of registered Republicans in the district voted from home. More than 103,000 mailed in ballots, and about 4,200 ballots cast in person have been counted so far. Local officials said in-person voting should be an option for those who wanted to register and vote provisionally the same day, as well as people with disabilities who need assistance or adaptive devices to vote.</p> <p>The president, who has previously disparaged efforts to increase voting opportunities, criticized Newsom\u2019s decision to keep restaurants and bars closed while installing \u201ca voting both [sic] system in a highly Democrat area (supposed to be mail in ballots only) because our great candidate, @MikeGarcia2020, is winning by a lot. CA25 Rigged Election!\u201d</p> <p>Traditionally, older, white and Republican voters are overrepresented in special elections, Mitchell said. Younger and minority voters, who lean Democratic, are more likely to vote in larger numbers in November.</p> <p>Although California is checkered with some red districts, it had been nearly 20 years since a Republican picked up a congressional seat in the state.</p> <p>The California election was among two races being closely watched this week as preludes to the general election in November, when many states will move to mail-in voting amid the coronavirus pandemic.</p> <p>In Wisconsin, the Republican Tom Tiffany, a state senator endorsed by Trump, easily won a special congressional election on Tuesday in a heavily conservative, rural <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/wisconsin\">Wisconsin</a> district. But Democrats are likely to watch his margin of victory \u2013 and consider it evidence of that party\u2019s gains if Tiffany\u2019s opponent Tricia Zunker performs better than the 20-point defeat the Democrats faced in district in 2018. Preliminary results show Tiffany leading by 14 points.</p> <p>\u201cFor Trump to win re-election, red areas have to get redder to balance out blue areas getting bluer,\u201c said the Wisconsin Democratic party spokeswoman, Courtney Beyer.</p> <p>But Tiffany dismissed the argument. \u201cAny time you lose by 14 points, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a moral victory,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a decisive victory here.\u201d</p> <p><em>Agencies contributed reporting</em></p>",

And it\u2019s a disgrace that it happened. And if you look at what\u2019s gone on, and if you look at, now, all of this information that\u2019s being released \u2013 and from what I understand, that\u2019s only the beginning \u2013 some terrible things happened, and it should never be allowed to happen in our country again.\u201d</p> <p>Yes, but, what exactly is Obamagate? Apart from the most terribly terrible thing that disgracefully disgraced this country a long, long time ago, in ways that should never, ever, happen to anyone. Oh no.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be seeing what\u2019s going on over the next \u2013 over the coming weeks,\u201d he continued, like the all-seeing, all-knowing troll he truly is. \u201cBut I \u2013 and I wish you\u2019d write honestly about it, but unfortunately, you choose not to do so.\u201d</p> <p>This cruel, cruel world is so unjust. Why can\u2019t people choose to write honestly about all this dishonesty?</p> <p>But honestly, what exactly is this mysteriously epic crime that is about to engulf the ex-president we shall now call Barack Obamagate?</p> <p>\u201cYou know what the crime is,\u201d Trump said, slapping down yet another pesky reporter. \u201cThe crime is very obvious to everybody. All you have to do is read the newspapers. Except yours.\u201d</p> <p>Read any one of the newspapers, except that one. And the other one. Yeah, that\u2019s right. Not that one either. You should skip over this rag, too.</p> <p>There\u2019s always the Epoch Times (motto: \u201cTruth and Tradition\u201d) of course. But frankly you need to go to a really trusted news source like One America News, Trump\u2019s new best friend in news, since Fox News turned <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/04/13/forced-choose-between-trump-fox-who-would-presidents-base-pick/\">weird</a> by asking questions about all its geriatric viewers dying from the coronavirus.</p> <p>\u201cWatching <a href=\"https://twitter.com/FoxNews\">@FoxNews</a> on weekend afternoons is a total waste of time,\u201d tweeted our commander-in-chief in the middle of the pandemic. \u201cWe now have some great alternatives, like <a href=\"https://twitter.com/OANN\">@OANN</a>.\u201d</p> <p>Thank goodness he can watch the TV at weekends without totally wasting everyone\u2019s time. Because only One America \u2013 not the other America of truth and the rule of law \u2013 had the courage to ask about a possible justice department investigation into all those Obama officials who were mysteriously present at the start of the Russia investigation.</p> <p>Kayleigh McEnany, the new White House press secretary, is nobody\u2019s fool. She couldn\u2019t possibly comment on a justice department matter like that. But as it happens, she had plenty to say about the transcripts the justice department is reviewing, which is totally different.</p> <p>\u201cThis president was exonerated by the Mueller reports,\u201d McEnany declared, \u201cand there are some real questions for these individuals who are saying one thing publicly and another thing privately.\u201d</p> <p>Damn right, Kayleigh. Why didn\u2019t these Obama people know everything that Robert Mueller uncovered after almost two years of investigation? They admitted they didn\u2019t have the evidence Mueller did. It\u2019s so obviously fishy.</p> <p>It\u2019s like saying it\u2019s safe to open up the country in the middle of a pandemic but insisting on daily tests for White House staff behind closed doors. It\u2019s like telling everyone else to wear a mask while refusing to wear one yourself. You can\u2019t say one thing publicly and another thing privately.</p> <p>Now there are some people who fear this kind of game is going to lead to something desperate, like indicting a former president or his senior aides. After all, a justice department that just <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/07/michael-flynn-criminal-case-trump-russia\">dropped</a> the case against Michael Flynn \u2013 who pleaded guilty in open court \u2013 has no core belief in justice.</p> <p>But that\u2019s not the point of this malarkey. This is Hunter Bidengate and Clinton emailgate. This is smeargate and distractgate. You should probably showergate after reading this.</p> <p>Trump has many good reasons to sail away to the land of smears. They\u2019re called the polls, and they are \u2013 for the sociopath sitting in the White House \u2013 even worse reading than the pandemic death tolls or the latest unemployment claims. Trump is <a href=\"https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/florida/\">losing</a> to Joe Biden by three points in Florida in the most recent Fox News poll, where he was supposed to have a lock on his re-election from his Mar-a-Lago mothership.</p> <p>That\u2019s on top of polls showing Michigan and Pennsylvania moving <a href=\"https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/president-general/\">decisively</a> against him, and Senate race polls turning <a href=\"https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/florida/\">close states</a> like Colorado and North Carolina into Democratic blowouts.</p> <p>In his hour of need, Trump wants us to forget about the lack of testing, tracing, vaccines and treatment. He wants us to proclaim Mission Accomplished and move on. He wants us to say things are bad, but they could be worse.</p> <p>If only something were worse than 80,000 dead Americans and almost 30 million unemployed.

  "<p>On Wednesday morning, Bret Chiafolo will have the surreal experience of listening to a live broadcast from the quarantined US supreme court as it debates whether his behavior during the 2016 presidential election was in breach of the constitution.</p> <p>Chiafolo was one of seven so-called \u201cfaithless\u201d electors who made <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/dec/19/electoral-college-faithless-electors-donald-trump\">national headlines</a> four years ago as they made a long-shot attempt to stop Donald Trump ascending to the US presidency. In the process, they raised fundamental questions about the workings of America\u2019s arcane system for choosing the occupant of the White House.</p> <p>Unlike direct democracies, US presidents are not elected by the popular vote of the American people. Instead, they are selected by 538 members of the electoral college \u2013 electors as they are known \u2013 who are in turn selected by political parties in each state.</p> <p>That anomaly led to the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/elections/2016/results/president\">victory of Trump</a> by 306 electoral votes to 232 for Clinton, even though she attracted the support of almost 3 million more Americans in the popular vote.</p> <p>Chiafolo, a Microsoft employee who lives outside Seattle, was one of the 538 members of the electoral college who in 2016 would technically decide the outcome of one of the most heated and ugly races in US history. Under normal circumstances, his vote would be a foregone conclusion \u2013 he would merely cast his ballot for the presidential candidate who had won his state of Washington, in this case Clinton.</p> <p>But Chiafolo had other ideas. He thought it more important to follow his own conscience and make a stand against Trump than to act like a \u201crobotic automaton\u201d, as he puts it, in following party lines.</p> <p>\u201cI had committed to put country before party \u2013 I believed it was my constitutional duty as an elector to oppose Donald Trump,\u201d he told the Guardian in an interview this week.</p> <p>Despite being a Democratic elector himself, he decided to vote for a moderate Republican, Colin Powell, in the hope that it would inspire other Republican electors in different states that Trump had won to withhold their vote from the president-elect. He was found in violation of state law and fined $1,000.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5e23b0d0ee9015152d3d9966db450adb611605a3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5e23b0d0ee9015152d3d9966db450adb611605a3/0_162_4480_2689/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Protesters at Georgia\u2019s capitol building call on members of the state electoral college to vote against Donald Trump.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Protesters at Georgia\u2019s capitol building call on members of the state electoral college to vote against Donald Trump.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Zuma Wire/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The case was brought to court and rose to the supreme court of Washington state, which upheld the fine.

Hamilton expressly singled out candidates who lack \u201crequisite qualifications\u201d, display \u201ctalents for low intrigue, and the little arts of popularity\u201d or who are susceptible to \u201cthe desire in foreign powers to gain an improper ascendant in our councils\u201d.</p> <p>In <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/19/19-465/139629/20200401140652396_19-465_bs_State.pdf\">counter-arguments</a>, lawyers for Washington state have warned that if the supreme court allows electoral college members to vote according to their individual consciences it would have \u201cbizarre and dangerous consequences\u201d. It would give the 538 electors more power than the millions of American voters, and \u201cprofoundly undermine public confidence in the value of participating in our democracy\u201d.</p> <p>Chiafolo said Wednesday\u2019s oral arguments would help to answer a question that should have been settled 200 years ago: \u201cDo electors have the freedom of voters or are they simply robotic automatons. Personally, I think it was always clear that it was always intended that there should be individual choice.\u201d</p> <p>He said he expects it to be an uphill battle attempting to convince the nation\u2019s highest court. \u201cThe supreme court has been increasingly politicized over the years and that might affect the judgment,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Representing Chiafolo and another \u201cfaithless\u201d elector in the Colorado case will be Lawrence Lessig, a constitutional law professor at Harvard. He said the supreme court\u2019s decision was crucial at a time when the country was heading into another hotly contested presidential election.</p> <p>\u201cThis case is especially important in the context of this election, as we maintain that there should be a human check or safety valve in the process of selecting the president,\u201d Lessig told the Guardian.</p>"

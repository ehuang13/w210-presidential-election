One likely casualty of a paired-down budget: an expansion to the state\u2019s health care program for undocumented immigrants over 65. </p> \n  <p>To help close some of the budget gap, the state will draw from $16 m in \u201crainy-day\u201d funds over three years. It will also attempt to negotiate a 10% pay cut with government workers -- cuts that will also impact Newsom and his staff.</p> \n  <p>But throughout the presentation, Newsom implored the federal government to take action, calling for support for the <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2020/05/12/house-democrats-pelosi-new-3-trillion-coronavirus-relief-plan-251407\">sprawling Heroes Act</a> package, which includes $875 billion for cash for state and local governments</p> \n  <p>\u201cThe federal government, we need you.

After initial blips, which saw police break up crowds in popular areas and a sudden alcohol ban in public places after Parisians celebrated their freedom after eight weeks in lockdown, one rule was relaxed on Wednesday: from now more than 10 people can gather in a private home, but only if its primary use is as a residence.

You may have seen this photo doing the rounds of late. Initially, we had no intention of sharing the photo but now that Matt\u2019s been laughing and talking on the radio about it, I thought I'd tell you how I came to take this photo. We were out for a family swim and we bumped into Matt and his family. It was all very cool - no one else around\u2026just his (and my family) enjoying the freezing cold water and having a laugh! As we were all leaving, he very politely obliged for a photo, leaning in with his @supervalu_irl bag keeping the social distance! . As he confirmed on the radio, he was holding a bag of swim gear and towels - not cans!! Both my husband and I agreed not to share the photo publicly but it got leaked through a family WhatsApp group a few days later and boom! it was then all over social media. We felt awful and really sorry about the whole situation; we wrote an apology letter to him but never got to deliver it. After hearing him on radio today, he obviously sees the funny side and the fact that the photo ultimately turned into one of the feelgood stories of the early summer. . While we never intended that the photo should leak anywhere, we were delighted that so many people \u2013 Matt included \u2013 got so much entertainment from the result. And the result? Irish people were delighted to welcome such a friendly and globally respected actor and activist to live amongst us while enjoying his privacy and one of the few good things that the virus has thrown up \u2013 precious and hassle-free time with his family in a country that respects and cherishes the important things in life. . Also, my daughters Ashleigh &amp; Jessica @cookingwithjessica_ (aged 9 and 11) learnt a very valuable lesson. They now see how something private can so quickly go viral and spin out of control. . Anyhow, all\u2019s well that ends well. . #mattdamon #cookingwithjessica #dalkey #lockdownlife</a></p> \n     <p style=\" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;\">A post shared by <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/mummycooks/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" style=\" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px;\" target=\"_blank\"> Siobhan Berry</a> (@mummycooks) on <time style=\" font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;\" datetime=\"2020-05-13T12:10:36+00:00\">May 13, 2020 at 5:10am PDT</time></p>\n    </div>\n   </blockquote> \n   <script async src=\"//www.instagram.com/embed.js\"></script> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-14T08:58:51.217Z\">at 9.58am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ebd03728f08a55ecde59b6b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-14T08:41:07.764Z\">9.41am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>One of <strong>Australia\u2019s</strong> largest brewers is tipping 90,000 kegs of beer down the drain.</p> \n  <p>Lion, which manufactures Tooheys, James Boag, XXXX and other well-known Australian beers, collected the untapped kegs from pubs and clubs in March, after the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/mar/23/job-losses-from-australias-coronavirus-shutdown-will-be-devastating\">Australian government declared pubs and restaurants had to shut to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.</a></p> \n  <p>The beer has now passed its shelf life and will be tipped into the wastewater treatment plants at the Tooheys and XXXX breweries, which will produce biogas to offset the breweries\u2019 natural gas use and be used to brew fresh beer.</p> \n  <p>The amount to be emptied is equal to 7.8m pints, 10.5m schooners, 11.8m stubbies, or 1.8 Olympic swimming pools.</p> \n  <p>Calla Wahlquist reports here:</p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/may/14/australian-brewers-tip-78m-pints-of-beer-down-the-drain\">Australian brewers tip 7.8m pints of beer down the drain</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ebcfae88f08a55ecde59b3c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-14T08:03:54.761Z\">9.03am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>More on the expulsion of the World Health Organization\u2019s (WHO) team from <strong>Burundi</strong>, days before the country\u2019s presidential election,<strong> </strong>has come from AFP: </p> \n  <blockquote> \n   <p>The foreign ministry, in a letter to WHO Africa headquarters and seen by AFP, said the UN agency\u2019s representative in Burundi and his three colleagues \u201care declared persona non grata and as such, must leave the territory of Burundi\u201d by Friday.</p> \n   <p>The directive, dated May 12, expels WHO\u2019s top official in Burundi, Doctor Walter Kazadi Mulombo, the country\u2019s coronavirus coordinator Dr Jean Pierre Mulunda Nkata, communicable diseases head Dr Ruhana Mirindi Bisimwa, and a laboratory expert in the testing for Covid-19, Professor Daniel Tarzy. </p> \n   <p>\u201cIt is the whole WHO team responsible for supporting Burundi in its response against COVID-19,\u201d a Burundian official told AFP, speaking on condition of anonymity. \u201cThey are expelled and the health minister has totally excluded WHO, accusing it of unacceptable interference in its management of the coronavirus.\u201d</p> \n   <p>The letter does not provide a reason for the decision.

There are 4,348,246 confirmed infections.The true figure is likely to be significantly higher as a result of underreporting or differing definitions of what constitutes a death from coronavirus.<br></li> \n   <li><strong>Moscow ascribes over 60% of coronavirus deaths in April to other causes. </strong>The city of Moscow said on Wednesday it had ascribed the deaths of more than 60% of coronavirus patients in April to other causes as it defended what it said was the superior way it counted the number of people killed by the novel virus. At 242,271, Russia has the second-highest number of confirmed cases in the world after the United States, but with 2,212 coronavirus deaths, it also has one of the world\u2019s lowest reported mortality rates.</li> \n   <li><strong>Trump criticises Fauci\u2019s warnings over reopening. </strong>US President Donald Trump on Wednesday has criticised a warning given by top US infectious disease expert Anthony Fauci this week about the dangers of reopening the economy too quickly. \u201cTo me it\u2019s not an acceptable answer especially when it comes to schools,\u201d Trump told reporters at the White House, noting he was surprised by the response Fauci gave to lawmakers in testimony to the US Senate on Tuesday.</li> \n   <li><strong>Italian doctors find link between Covid-19 and inflammatory disorder. </strong>Doctors in Italy have reported the first clear evidence of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/may/13/italian-doctors-find-link-between-covid-19-and-inflammatory-disorder\">link between Covid-19 and a rare but serious inflammatory disorder</a> that has required some children to undergo life-saving treatment in intensive care units. The mysterious condition emerged last month when NHS bosses <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/27/nhs-warns-of-rise-in-children-with-new-illness-that-may-be-linked-to-coronavirus\">issued an alert</a> to doctors after hospitals admitted a number of children with a mix of <a href=\"https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/toxic-shock-syndrome/\">toxic shock</a> and symptoms seen in an inflammatory disorder known as Kawasaki disease.</li> \n   <li><strong>China begins testing every resident in Wuhan. </strong>Chinese authorities <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/13/10-days-battle-wuhan-covid-19-testing-plan\">have plans to test every resident in Wuhan</a>, after a small outbreak was reported this week. The city in Hubei province, where the virus is believed to have originated with the first recorded cases, had reported few daily cases since early March and none since early April, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/11/now-it-starts-again-new-coronavirus-outbreaks-spark-unease-in-china\">until a cluster of six was confirmed at the weekend</a>. There is serious concern over the outbreak in Wuhan, despite the small size. He Qinghua from the bureau of disease prevention and control, told a press conference disease control was generally stable across the nation, but there were still challenges.</li> \n   <li><strong>Hong Kong to test hundreds of families. </strong>Hong Kong authorities are going to screen hundreds of families, local media is reporting, after its 23-day run of no local infections was broken with the diagnosis of Covid-19 in a 66-year-old woman with no recent travel history, and her five-year-old granddaughter.</li> \n   <li><strong>Japan is expected to lift the state of emergency for 39 of 47 prefectures. </strong>Japan is expected to lift the state of emergency for 39 of its 47 prefectures on Thursday, local media reported. The world\u2019s third-largest economy declared a nationwide state of emergency a month ago, urging citizens to reduce person-to-person contact by 80% in an effort to slow the pace of new infections and ease the strain on medical services.</li> \n   <li><strong>Japan suicides decline as lockdown causes shift in stress factors. </strong>Suicide in Japan <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/14/japan-suicides-fall-sharply-as-covid-19-lockdown-causes-shift-in-stress-factors\">fell by 20% in April compared to 2019, the biggest drop in five years</a>, despite fears of the coronavirus pandemic causing increased stress and many prevention helplines either not operating or being short-staffed. People spending more time at home with their families, fewer people commuting to work and the start of the school year being delayed are seen as factors in the fall.</li> \n   <li><strong>New Zealand announces NZ$50bn fund. </strong>Finance minister Grant Robertson has unveiled an unprecedented NZ$50bn fund to save jobs and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/14/new-zealand-budget-robertson-lays-out-50bn-plan-to-return-jobs-to-pre-covid-19-levels\">reduce unemployment to pre-coronavirus levels within two years</a>. The huge figure, announced alongside the annual Budget on Thursday, equates to about 17% of the nation\u2019s GDP and 17 times more than what a New Zealand government usually allocates to new spending in its budgets. Underscoring the massive challenges facing the economy as it emerges from lockdown, Robertson said the fund was \u201cthe most significant financial commitment in modern history\u201d.</li> \n   <li><strong>Virus may never be eradicated \u2013 WHO. </strong>The coronavirus that causes Covid-19 could become endemic like HIV, the World Health Organization has said, warning against any attempt to predict how long it would keep circulating and calling for a \u201cmassive effort\u201d to counter it. \u201cIt is important to put this on the table: this virus may become just another endemic virus in our communities, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/14/global-report-who-says-covid-19-may-never-go-and-warns-of-mental-health-crisis\">and this virus may never go away</a>,\u201d said Michael Ryan, the WHO\u2019s emergencies chief.

From this perspective, the best we can hope for from most people under crisis is selfish indifference; at worst, they will swiftly turn to violence. Our worst instincts must be repressed. This becomes a justification for authoritarianism and heavy-handed policing.</p> \n  <p>But studies of historical disasters have shown that this is not how most people actually behave. There are nearly always selfish and destructive people, and they are often in power, because we have created systems that reward that kind of personality and those principles.

There are 4,347,015 confirmed infections.The true fatalities figure is likely to be significantly higher as a result of underreporting or differing definitions of what constitutes a death from coronavirus.</li> \n   <li><strong>Moscow ascribed over 60% of coronavirus deaths in April to other causes</strong>The city of Moscow said on Wednesday it had ascribed the deaths of more than 60% of coronavirus patients in April to other causes as it defended what it said was the superior way it and Russia counted the number of people killed by the novel virus. At 242,271, Russia has the second-highest number of confirmed cases in the world after the United States, but with 2,212 coronavirus deaths, Russia also has one of the world\u2019s lowest mortality rates.</li> \n   <li><strong>Trump says Fauci\u2019s warning over reopening the economy too soon as \u201cnot an acceptable answer\u201d</strong>US President Donald Trump on Wednesday described as not acceptable a warning given by top US infectious disease expert Anthony Fauci this week about the dangers of reopening the economy too quickly. \u201cTo me it\u2019s not an acceptable answer especially when it comes to schools,\u201d Trump told reporters at the White House, noting he was surprised by the response Fauci gave to lawmakers in testimony to the US Senate on Tuesday.</li> \n   <li><strong>Italian doctors find link between Covid-19 and inflammatory disorder</strong>Doctors in Italy have reported the first clear evidence of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/may/13/italian-doctors-find-link-between-covid-19-and-inflammatory-disorder\">link between Covid-19 and a rare but serious inflammatory disorder</a> that has required some children to undergo life-saving treatment in intensive care units. The mysterious condition emerged last month when NHS bosses <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/27/nhs-warns-of-rise-in-children-with-new-illness-that-may-be-linked-to-coronavirus\">issued an alert</a> to doctors after hospitals admitted a number of children with a mix of <a href=\"https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/toxic-shock-syndrome/\">toxic shock</a> and symptoms seen in an inflammatory disorder known as Kawasaki disease.</li> \n   <li><strong>China begins testing every resident in Wuhan</strong>Chinese authorities <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/13/10-days-battle-wuhan-covid-19-testing-plan\">have plans to test every resident in Wuhan</a>, after a small outbreak was reported this week. The city in Hubei province, where the virus is believed to have originated with the first recorded cases, had reported few daily cases since early March and none since early April, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/11/now-it-starts-again-new-coronavirus-outbreaks-spark-unease-in-china\">until a cluster of six was confirmed at the weekend</a>. There is serious concern over the outbreak in Wuhan, despite the small size. He Qinghua from the bureau of disease prevention and control, told a press conference disease control was generally stable across the nation, but there were still challenges.</li> \n   <li><strong>Hong Kong to test hundreds of families</strong>Hong Kong authorities are going to screen hundreds of families, local media is reporting, after its 23-day run of no local infections was broken with the diagnosis of Covid-19 in a 66-year-old woman with no recent travel history, and her five-year-old granddaughter.</li> \n   <li><strong>Japan is expected to lift the state of emergency for 39 of 47 prefectures </strong>Japan is expected to lift the state of emergency for 39 of its 47 prefectures on Thursday, local media reported. The world\u2019s third-largest economy declared a nationwide state of emergency a month ago, urging citizens to reduce person-to-person contact by 80% in an effort to slow the pace of new infections and ease the strain on medical services.</li> \n   <li><strong>Japan suicides fall sharply as Covid-19 lockdown causes shift in stress factors</strong>Suicide in Japan <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/14/japan-suicides-fall-sharply-as-covid-19-lockdown-causes-shift-in-stress-factors\">fell by 20% in April compared to 2019, the biggest drop in five years</a>, despite fears of the coronavirus pandemic causing increased stress and many prevention helplines either not operating or being short-staffed. People spending more time at home with their families, fewer people commuting to work and the start of the school year being delayed are seen as factors in the fall.</li> \n   <li><strong>New Zealand announces NZ$50bn fund</strong>New Zealand\u2019s finance minister Grant Robertson has unveiled an unprecedented NZ$50bn fund to save jobs and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/14/new-zealand-budget-robertson-lays-out-50bn-plan-to-return-jobs-to-pre-covid-19-levels\">reduce unemployment to pre-coronavirus levels within two years</a>. The huge figure, announced alongside the annual Budget on Thursday, equates to about 17% of the nation\u2019s GDP and 17 times more than what a New Zealand government usually allocates to new spending in its budgets.

The state is narrowly divided politically and seen as a crucial state to win for both campaigns in the November presidential <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-elections-2020\">election</a>.</p> <p>The case also shows the extreme significance of state supreme court races, long overlooked, in shaping state policy. Justice Daniel Kelly, a conservative on the court, <a href=\"https://projects.jsonline.com/topics/election/2020/4/13/wisconsin-spring-election-results-april-7.html\">lost his seat</a> to Jill Karofsky, a liberal challenger, last month. Kelly, who is set to leave the court this summer, cast the deciding vote in the Wednesday ruling.</p> <p>In Wisconsin, conservatives hold a 5-2 majority on the state supreme court, and all but one of the conservative justices voted to strike down the order on Wednesday, saying Tony Evers, the Democratic governor, didn\u2019t follow proper procedure when he issued the order. Some businesses immediately opened after the ruling and some bars were<a href=\"https://www.wgmd.com/wisconsin-bars-flooded-with-patrons-hours-after-state-supreme-court-strikes-down-coronavirus-stay-at-home-order/\"> flooded</a> with patrons.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"583760fc84822f618b735e68a77327cb83e5b18b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/583760fc84822f618b735e68a77327cb83e5b18b/0_130_4607_2765/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dairyland Brew Pub opens following the Wisconsin supreme court\u2019s decision to strike down Tony Evers\u2019 safer-at-home order amid the coronavirus pandemic.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dairyland Brew Pub opens following the Wisconsin supreme court\u2019s decision to strike down Tony Evers\u2019 safer-at-home order amid the coronavirus pandemic.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: William Glasheen/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cRepublican legislators have convinced four justices to throw our state into chaos,\u201d Evers said in a statement.</p> <p>In a remarkable passage in a concurring opinion, Justice Rebecca Bradley drew comparisons between the case and <a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/323/214\">Korematsu v</a><a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/323/214\"> United States</a>, the 1946 US supreme court decision allowing the internment of Japanese-Americans during the second world war. She cited the case \u201cto remind the state that urging courts to approve the exercise of extraordinary power during times of emergency may lead to extraordinary abuses of its citizens\u201d.</p> <p>Since 2012, Republicans have held significant majorities in both chambers of the state legislature, in large part because they drew boundaries for districts at the beginning of the decade that gave them a severe political advantage. They have maintained that advantage even though the state is extremely competitive politically \u2013 Trump narrowly won the state in 2016, but Evers and other Democrats swept statewide races in 2018.</p> <p>Republicans have been trying to strip Evers of power even before he took office. During a 2018 lame duck session, Republicans quickly passed laws that stripped Evers and the state\u2019s incoming attorney general of some of their power. The move was ultimately upheld by the state supreme court in a <a href=\"https://madison.com/ct/news/local/govt-and-politics/wisconsin-supreme-court-ruling-upholds-lame-duck-laws/article_3ca70585-a462-5faa-97c7-37b1e25543b9.html\">4-3 vote</a> along partisan lines.</p> <p>The state supreme court also voted along partisan lines last month <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/06/wisconsin-primary-election-in-person-voting-coronavirus\">to override</a> a last-minute order from Evers to cancel in-person voting for the state\u2019s 7 April election. The decision was widely seen as a partisan effort to boost Kelly, who was on the ballot, but he wound up losing handily to Karofsky.</p> <p>The state supreme court is also expected in the near future to take up a closely watched case deciding whether Wisconsin election officials need to remove more than 200,000 people from the voter rolls ahead of the November election \u2013 a decision that could have huge political consequences in the state.</p> <p>Justice Rebecca Dallet, a liberal on the court, wrote in a dissenting opinion on Wednesday that the supreme court had done \u201cthe legislature\u2019s bidding\u201d in striking down the measure.</p> <p>\u201cThis decision will undoubtedly go down as one of the most blatant examples of judicial activism in this court\u2019s history,\u201d she wrote. \u201cAnd it will be Wisconsinites who pay the price.</p> <p>\u201cA majority of this court falls hook, line and sinker for the legislature\u2019s tactic to rewrite a duly enacted statute through litigation rather than legislation.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Stock market investors spent most of 2019 obsessing over the state of trade <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/01/global-markets-donald-trump-us-china-trade-war-coronavirus-covid-19\">relations between the US and China</a>. Now they can return to the subject in 2020. As the US presidential election approaches, Trump\u2019s anti-China stance on Covid is intensifying and this week produced a highly unusual piece of policy-making in Washington.</p> <p>The extraordinary episode was the order, more or less, from the US administration that a $600bn US federal pension fund should drop a long-planned investment in Chinese shares. Strictly speaking, the intended investment by the Thrift Savings Plan was merely a re-allocation of a portion of its portfolio into a global share index that includes China. But it was enough to enrage the White House.</p> <p>Investing in Chinese companies exposed the fund to the \u201cpossibility that future sanctions will result from the culpable actions of the Chinese government with respect to the global spread of the Covid-19 pandemic\u201d, said its blistering letter.</p> <p>Trump appeared to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/04/china-communist-party-coronavirus-us-trump\">threaten further action</a> in the same vein on Thursday by saying he would be \u201clooking at\u201d Chinese companies listed on US stock markets that do not follow US accounting rules. What does that mean? Forced de-listings? For good measure, he wondered what would happen if US just \u201ccut off the whole relationship with China\u201d.</p> <p>If a fresh front in the financial war with Beijing has been opened, what\u2019s next? Imposition of the sanctions threatened in the Thrift letter? A campaign to encourage patriotic Americans to rid their own pension plans of exposure China? Rip up phase one of the trade deal that was signed with Beijing in January?</p> <p>Any of the above would risk further turmoil in stock markets, which is probably not what Trump would prefer going into the polls. On the other hand, the real economy matters more and Trump seems resigned to the idea that recovery won\u2019t start in the US until the fourth quarter of this year, which may be too late for his electoral ambitions. More protectionist measures could become a serious campaigning option.</p> <p>For investors, it\u2019s yet another factor to consider amid the economic fallout from the pandemic. US-China relations have been merely a background theme this week to the appalling economic news. That could quickly change.</p> <h2>Once you\u2019re in, you\u2019re committed</h2> <p>The Takeover Panel is one of the faster-moving City watchdogs, so we should expect a ruling soon in a small but intriguing case: should the bidders for Moss Bros be allowed to drop their \u00a322.6m offer?</p> <p>If it were to happen, it would be a historic concession because the bidding principle is usually strict: once you\u2019re in, you\u2019re committed.</p> <p>One can understand, of course, why the bidder wants to invoke the \u201cmaterial adverse change\u201d, or MAC, clause, and wriggle out. The outfit called Brigadier \u2013 essentially a vehicle for a few wealthy investors \u2013 makes two main arguments. First, that Moss Bros\u2019s prospects have been damaged. Second, that the damage goes beyond what could have been imagined when the bid was launched on 12 March.</p> <p>The first point definitely seems correct. Moss Bros\u2019s shops are closed and physical distancing rules will be a killer for the summer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/30/uk-watchdog-vows-to-get-tough-with-uk-firms-over-stalled-refunds\">wedding season</a>, one big driver of demand for dress gear. Even Royal Ascot, though it\u2019s likely to happen next month, won\u2019t be open to punters in costumes.</p> <p>The effects of social distancing could also last for ages, Brigadier can argue, making the pandemic different from the 9/11 terrorist attacks in the US in 2001, the last time a bidder tried to invoke a MAC clause. In that instance, the Panel forced WPP to follow through with its offer for advertising agency Tempus.</p> <p>But Brigadier is surely on very weak ground in pleading that it was all unimaginable. One passage in the WPP/Tempus ruling still seems crucial: a bidder must show that exceptional circumstances \u201ccould not have reasonably been foreseen at the time of the announcement of the offer\u201d.</p> <p>It\u2019s true that the UK authorities were woefully relaxed about Covid on 12 March \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/apr/02/wrong-to-play-liverpool-v-atletico-says-citys-public-health-director-matthew-ashton\">Liverpool played Atletico Madrid</a> at Anfield the night before. But, come on, it was within the range of reasonable possibilities that the pandemic could rapidly get worse.</p> <p>Brigadier was free to await developments before bidding, but chose not to. Common sense says it should be held to its offer.</p>",

Police have since said the officers knocked and announced themselves before entering.</p> <p>Lawyers for Taylor\u2019s family and her boyfriend Kenneth Walker, who was with Taylor that night, say they did not. Walker said he thought he was witnessing a home invasion, prompting him to pick up his gun and fire a shot that hit an officer in the leg after a battering ram plowed through the apartment\u2019s door.</p> <p>Police responded by firing more than 20 times. Taylor was hit by eight rounds. According to an affidavit filed by Walker\u2019s defense lawyer Rob Eggert: \u201cYou could look through one of the bullet holes and see into the next-door apartment.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt was incredible that Ms Taylor was the only one killed,\u201d he added later in the document.</p> <p>No drugs were found. Taylor died. Walker was arrested and charged with the attempted murder of a police officer and first-degree assault. Three officers involved were reassigned pending an investigation.</p> <p>In a suit against three Louisville police officers involved in the shooting, lawyers for Taylor\u2019s family accuse the police of negligence, excessive force and wrongful death. Additionally, they said police were searching for a suspect who had already been apprehended and that police lacked probable cause. In firing their weapons \u201cblindly\u201d, lawyers wrote, police showed \u201ca total disregard for the value of human life\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cBreonna had posed no threat to the officers and did nothing to deserve to die at their hands.\u201d</p> <p>An affidavit for a search warrant obtained by the Guardian on Wednesday described how police had observed a car regularly operated by two suspected drug dealers make \u201cfrequent trips\u201d from a drug-dealing \u201ctrap house\u201d near the city center to Taylor\u2019s home, more than 10 miles away.</p> <p>According to the warrant, police believed one of the suspected dealers, Jamarcus Glover, was keeping either drugs or drug money in Taylor\u2019s home.</p> <p>In applying for the warrant for Taylor\u2019s apartment, police requested permission for a no-knock entry \u201cdue to the nature of how these drug traffickers operate\u201d.</p> <p>Lawyers for Walker and Taylor say neighbors in the building can attest that police did not knock or announce themselves.</p> <p>A Louisville police spokesperson did not respond to questions from the Guardian about how officers executed the search warrant.</p> <p>The police department often releases video captured by body-worn cameras after police-involved shootings. But the officers involved in serving the warrant on Taylor\u2019s home do not wear body cams.</p> <p>\u201cIf this was another community, another household in a more affluent community, lightning would strike and thunder would groan\u201d if such a warrant were issued, Crump said.</p> <p>Walker, Crump said, believed the police \u201cwere committing a home invasion.

  "<p>Key developments in the global <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">coronavirus outbreak</a> today include:</p> <h2>Italian doctors find link between Covid-19 and inflammatory disorder</h2> <p>Doctors in Italy have reported the first clear evidence of a link between Covid-19 and a rare but serious inflammatory disorder that has required some children to undergo life-saving treatment in intensive care units. The mysterious condition emerged last month when NHS bosses issued an alert to doctors after hospitals admitted a number of children with a mix of toxic shock and symptoms seen in an inflammatory disorder known as Kawasaki disease.</p> <h2>Deaths worldwide near 300,000</h2> <p>The number of lives lost worldwide in the pandemic is nearing 300,000, according to Johns Hopkins University figures, with 297,197 deaths reported. There are 4,347,015 confirmed infections. The true figures are likely to be significantly higher as a result of underreporting or differing definitions of what constitutes a death from coronavirus.</p> <h2>Japan lifts state of emergency for 39 of 47 prefectures</h2> <p>The Japanese prime minister, Shinzo Abe, has lifted the state of emergency for 39 of its 47 prefectures, but said it would remain in place in Tokyo, as well as the second-largest urban area of Osaka, until the coronavirus is contained. Abe also said he would begin work on a second extra budget as part of his government\u2019s economic stimulus measures. \u201cWhile controlling the spread of the virus as much as possible by acting on the premise that the virus is all around us, we will restore ordinary work and daily life,\u201d Abe told a news conference.</p> <h2>French firm\u2019s pledge to prioritise US with vaccine causes outrage</h2> <p>The British head of a French pharmaceutical company has caused an outcry by saying any vaccine discovered by his firm would initially be reserved for the United States. Paul Hudson, chief executive officer of Sanofi, told Bloomberg News that any vaccine invented by his firm would go to the US first since it had done the most to fund the company\u2019s research. France\u2019s higher education minister, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9rique Vidal, said Sanofi\u2019s plan to give the US priority access would be \u201cincomprehensible and disgraceful\u201d since a successful vaccine must be \u201ca public good for the world\u201d.</p> <h2>EU monitoring Hungary over emergency legislation</h2> <p>The European commission has said it is monitoring the Hungarian government over coronavirus laws that created a state of emergency with no end date. The commission, the body charged with upholding European Union law, said the absence of a clear time limit on the emergency decree raises \u201cpotential concerns as regards legal certainty\u201d, while a media law criminalising the spreading of misinformation about the pandemic \u201cmay have a chilling effect on freedom of expression in Hungary\u201d.</p> <h2>Burundi expels four-person WHO team ahead of elections</h2> <p>Burundi\u2019s foreign ministry, in a letter to the World Health Organization\u2019s Africa headquarters, said the UN agency\u2019s representative in Burundi and his three colleagues \u201care declared persona non grata and as such, must leave the territory of Burundi\u201d by Friday. The letter did not provide a reason for the decision. Diplomatic and administrative sources told AFP the foreign ministry aborted a similar attempt to expel the same four officials a month ago. The east African nation is scheduled to hold a presidential election on 20 May.</p> <h2>Afghanistan records biggest one-day rise in coronavirus cases</h2> <p>Afghanistan has recorded its biggest one-day rise of new cases as the health ministry warned of a second phase of transmission amid war raging with full intensity across the country. Wahid Majroh, the deputy health minister, has warned the nation that if it continued to break the lockdown there would be another phase of the virus. The health ministry recorded 413 new transmissions over the past day, the biggest one-day rise of new cases, and four deaths, raising the total number of infections to 5,639 and the death toll to 136.</p> <h2>Lloyd\u2019s of London expects to pay out up to \u00a33.5bn</h2> <p>Lloyd\u2019s of London, the world\u2019s biggest insurance market, expects to pay out between $3bn (\u00a32.4bn) and $4.3bn (\u00a33.5bn) to its customers due to the coronavirus pandemic, as it warned of a $203bn hit for the entire industry. The Lloyd\u2019s of London chief executive, John Neal, said the pandemic was an unparalleled event. \u201cWhat makes Covid-19 unique is the not just the devastating continuing human and social impact, but also the economic shock,\u201d he said. \u201cTaking all those factors together will challenge the industry as never before.\u201d</p> <h2>Burr\u2019s cellphone seized by federal agents</h2> <p>US federal agents have seized the cellphone of Republican senator Richard Burr as they investigate stock transactions made in the early days of the coronavirus crisis. Burr has denied any wrongdoing and said he relied solely on news reports to guide decisions on stock sales, amid reports that he and other senators sold off shares after being briefed on the risks of the crisis.</p> <h2>US-Mexico border factories pressed to stay open despite Covid-19 risk</h2> <p>Mexico\u2019s border states are home to more than 6,000 <em>maquiladoras</em> \u2013 largely foreign-owned factories that manufacture products for export \u2013 and the plants, which employ hundreds of thousands of people, have been the focus of several coronavirus outbreaks. But official <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/14/us-mexico-border-factories-coronavirus\">efforts to keep the factories shut</a> and contain the spread of Covid-19 have come under intense pressure from companies \u2013 and US government officials \u2013 who have urged the Mexican government to keep the <em>maquiladoras</em> running at any cost.</p> <h2>Spain says death toll rise highest in six days</h2> <p>Spain\u2019s daily coronavirus death toll report rose above 200 on Thursday for the first time since 8 May, the health ministry reported. The overall death toll from the disease rose to 27,321 on Thursday as 217 people reportedly died overnight, the ministry said, according to Reuters. The overall number of diagnosed cases rose to 229,540 on Thursday. The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in Germany rose 933 on Thursday, a similar number to Wednesday, to stand at 172,239, according to the Robert Koch Institute for infectious diseases. The reported death toll rose by 89 to 7,723.</p>",
  "<p>When a new decade dawned a few short months ago, many predicted that the dominant theme would be China\u2019s continued emergence and role in a world that was changing quickly. Few suspected that the rivalry and antagonism between China and the west would be framed by a global pandemic, and by the challenges \u2013 and opportunities \u2013 that it has offered to countries around the world, not least China itself.</p> <p>China was where Covid-19 struck first; and it is where life is getting back to normal, albeit slowly. Manufacturing and production are rising, with factories open and starting to get back to similar levels to the second half of last year. Although <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/may/09/coronavirus-live-news-global-cases-approach-4-million-trump-us-unemployment-covid-19-lockdown-uk-italy-russia?page=with:block-5eb669f58f08c0a2409ba964\">fewer than three cases a day</a> had been reported, alongside a handful of asymptomatic cases in the past two weeks, the emergence of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/11/now-it-starts-again-new-coronavirus-outbreaks-spark-unease-in-china\">cluster of infections in Shulan</a>, in north-east China, and the announcement that the entire population of Wuhan is to be tested in the coming days, show how nerves are still jangling about new waves of the disease. Still, data released by customs authorities last week shows that although there was a large decline in imports, exports rose year on year for the month of April \u2013 largely due to massive shipments of healthcare products.</p> <p>It is quite a turnaround. The catastrophic handling of the outbreak of coronavirus in Wuhan led to infections on a global scale. Many outside China wondered whether the failings of the authorities in Hubei province and beyond would lead to major political change in the country. Instead, we find Li Keqiang, the premier of the state council, telling us that \u201cthe virus is the common enemy of mankind\u201d and saying that Chinese people are \u201cwilling to join hands with the people around the world\u201d in an effort to defeat the disease.</p> <p>Not surprisingly, China is less keen to talk about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/feb/07/coronavirus-chinese-rage-death-whistleblower-doctor-li-wenliang\">what it got wrong</a> than about what it is doing right: face masks, surgical gowns and ventilators have been distributed around the world, as we keep being reminded. China alone can\u2019t supply a pandemic-gripped planet with ventilators, one industrial ministry official was quoted as saying in April. It wants to play the role of saviour, rather than villain.</p> <p>Control of that narrative is helped by the own goals provided by countries that have \u2013 or perhaps had \u2013 reputations for competence. In the UK, the prime minister missed crucial meetings, boasted about shaking hands before being infected and taken to intensive care. In the US, where infections are well past <a href=\"https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/us/\">the million mark</a> and the death toll is anticipated to double this month alone, the president has said \u201cwe have it under control\u201d, urged citizens to \u201cliberate\u201d states that have locked down and recommended highly unusual areas of medical research as possible cures for the coronavirus.</p> <p>The high infection rates across many developed, democratic countries have helped divert the narrative away from China and its supposed \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/05/prevent-coronavirus-chernobyl-international-disaster\">Chernobyl moment</a>\u201d to one of why democracies have performed so badly with the pandemic. It is a message that falls on fertile ground in many parts of the world. For example, the Saudi-owned Al Arabiya news station remarked that \u201cChina is the only country that has performed well in dealing with this crisis\u201d. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/13/coronavirus-diplomacy-how-russia-china-and-eu-vie-to-win-over-serbia\">Solidarity in Europe \u201cdoes not exist\u201d</a>, said Aleksandar Vu\u010di\u0107, the president of Serbia, in an angry statement about import restrictions imposed by the European Union. \u201cThe only country that can help us is China,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Such comments, made in the heat of the moment, can flatter to deceive \u2013 although China-watchers know how carefully Beijing has been cultivating its contacts in central and eastern Europe, including EU members, before the pandemic began. Likewise, the dispatch of medical equipment may well win short-term thanks, such as in Africa, where every country has <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2020/03/16/africa/jack-ma-donate-masks-coronavirus-africa/index.html\">received 100,000 masks (and more)</a> from Chinese entrepreneur Jack Ma, but also strengthens the narrative of Chinese global leadership that has been articulated by Beijing in multiple countries, regions and formats for many years.</p> <p>It can be easy to over-emphasise the dividends, as a report by a thinktank affiliated to the Ministry of State Security in Beijing reveals. Despite the efforts to win hearts and minds, for all the investment and focus on other parts of the world, global anti-China sentiment is at its highest point since 1989 and the Tiananmen Square protests, according to sources familiar with the report, which was presented to the country\u2019s leadership. This has been led and fanned by the US. As a result, it warned, in the worst-case scenario, China needed to be ready for armed confrontation \u2013 and for war.</p> <p>That too needs to be taken with a pinch of salt. Although the threat of military conflict is one that Chinese president Xi Jinping has repeatedly spoken about, this is best understood as being designed for domestic consumption and as a means of framing an economy that was slowing before Covid-19. In fact, successive defence white papers issued by the Chinese military have emphasised both the low risks of serious confrontation, and the awareness that tensions need to be understood and managed carefully.</p> <p>In that sense, the reference to the potential for military conflict (and the fact that this was leaked) is most usefully interpreted as a sign of deliberate messaging: China recognises that the situation is serious, febrile and dangerous. Donald Trump\u2019s threat to seek \u201chundreds of billions\u201d in compensation is less of a concern, especially in a presidential election year, than his comments that \u201cwe can do something much easier than that \u2026 we have ways of doing things a lot easier than that\u201d. Even though Trump says many things that have to be retracted, clarified or dismissed, those words sounded ominous.</p> <p>Gathering reliable information from China has always been difficult and has become more so with the<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/mar/18/us-media-accuse-china-of-cold-war-mentality-after-move-to-expel-journalists\"> expulsion of highly experienced journalists</a> in recent weeks. Decisions about how to understand, let alone respond to, China are being taken blind, the result of educated guesswork and wishful thinking. When Trump\u2019s top Asia adviser made an<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/04/china-communist-party-coronavirus-us-trump\"> eloquent speech in Mandarin</a> in favour of pluralism, to mark the anniversary of the 4 May 1919 protests, it was met by excitable commentaries in the US suggesting it might seed a democratic political movement in China. Such thinking shows how much easier it is to see the patterns that westerners might want to see, rather than deal with the more prosaic realities.</p> <p>Ideological, political and security tensions between the US and China have a long history. But, as the distinguished scholar Evan Feigenbaum stresses, in the past coordination has been possible, not least economically, because of overlapping interests. Now the problem is that, for all China\u2019s talk of global leadership, it is doing little to lead international collective action. Nor, for that matter, is the US, the EU or anyone else. And in our me-first world, where states put their interests first, and find collaboration either increasingly difficult or unpalatable, this indeterminacy could have very significant consequences for global affairs.</p> <ul> <li><p>Peter Frankopan is professor of global history at the University of Oxford</p><p><br></p></li> </ul>",

However, it is not yet clear whether they have a lower chance of catching Covid-19. Although fewer children have been picked up in national testing programs, this could be due to fewer being tested. During the early phase of the epidemic in Europe, adult travelers played a dominant role in seeding infections, which also meant, purely for circumstantial reasons, that children would have played a less significant role in spreading infections.</p> \n  <p>Studies on this question give a mixed picture. One analysis, in <a href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(20)30287-5/fulltext\">the Lancet Infectious Diseases</a>, of households with confirmed Covid-19 in Shenzhen, China, found that children younger than 10 were just as likely as adults to get infected. However, there is other evidence from South Korea, Italy and Iceland suggesting lower infection rates among children. Some of the difference could also be down to differences in social mixing.</p> \n  <p><strong>Why do children react differently to adults?</strong></p> \n  <p>For many infectious diseases, there is a U-shaped risk curve, with the youngest and oldest in society being most vulnerable. Covid-19 does not follow this pattern \u2013 even toddlers and newborn babies typically only experience mild symptoms. One theory is that children\u2019s lungs might contain fewer of the ACE2 receptors that the virus uses to enter cells. To confirm this, researchers would need to study tissue samples from children. Another possibility is that children\u2019s immune systems respond in a more optimal way to the virus \u2013 mounting a strong enough response to get rid of the infection, but without going into overdrive and flooding the body with inflammatory proteins, which are known to sometimes cause problems in adult patients.</p> \n  <p><strong>Are children invisible transmitters?</strong><br></p> \n  <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/mar/12/coronavirus-most-infections-spread-by-people-yet-to-show-symptoms-scientists\">Asymptomatic transmission</a> is known to play an important role in the spread of Covid-19 \u2013 studies have shown that in general people appear to be at their most infectious in the day or so before symptoms start. This raises the question of whether children are silent spreaders of the virus. A recent German study, which compared the viral load of nearly 4,000 people aged from one to 100 years old, added weight to this idea. It found that regardless of age, people appeared to shed a similar level of virus, suggesting they could be equally infectious. However, a caveat is that the study did not measure real-life transmission in children. As schools reopen and community transmission is tracked closely in some European countries, a clearer answer on this is likely to emerge in the coming months.</p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/13/are-children-less-susceptible-to-coronavirus\">Are children less susceptible to coronavirus?</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-13T22:43:59.956Z\">at 11.43pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ebc678c8f080c727453a747\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-13T21:37:16.561Z\">10.37pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Per White House press pool reporters, the president also called Dr Anthony Fauci\u2019s message yesterday cautioning against opening schools too soon \u201cunacceptable\u201d. </strong></p> \n  <p>\u201cI was surprised by his answer,\u201d Trump said. \u201cTo me it\u2019s not an acceptable answer especially when it comes to schools.\u201d<br></p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Yamiche/status/1260685470909988864\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Pres Trump: The \"only thing\" that would be acceptable is teachers staying home a bit longer bc the coronavirus \"attacks age.\"<br><br>Dr. Fauci yesterday: \"I think we better be careful if we are not cavalier in thinking that children are completely immune to the deleterious effects.\"</p>\u2014 Yamiche Alcindor (@Yamiche) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Yamiche/status/1260685470909988864?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 13, 2020</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n  <p>Yesterday, the top public health official contradicted Trump, who urged schools and businesses to reopen and said the White House has set a target of having 100m vaccine doses by the autumn.

The measure also established prioritized criteria for the demographer to follow, making partisan fairness and competitiveness one of the most important ones. The reform would likely weaken Republican control of the state legislature, <a href=\"https://apnews.com/c49a2cf375894f539ca4aad5aafc6a74\">an Associated Press analysis</a> found.</p> \n  <p>The next round of redistricting won\u2019t take place until 2021, and the demographer hasn\u2019t even been chosen yet. But if voters <a href=\"https://www.senate.mo.gov/20info/BTS_Web/Bill.aspx?SessionType=R&amp;BillID=26838179\">approve</a> the new Republican proposal, they would eliminate the position entirely and return redistricting power to committees picked by the state Democratic and Republican parties and the governor. It makes partisan fairness and competitiveness the least important criteria to follow when redistricting, instead prioritizing keeping districts compact and contiguous.</p> \n  <p>The U.S. constitution requires districts to have roughly the same number of people in each district and states have long used the all residents as the basis for drawing districts.

are achieved.</p> \n  <p>But Fauci\u2019s cool testimony drew praise from Republicans.</p> \n  <p>Bright\u2019s testimony tomorrow will be electric, for certain.

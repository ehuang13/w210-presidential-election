It can encourage states to reopen their economies precipitously and lure individuals to drop their guard and expose themselves to the virus.</p> <p>Wardle said: \u201cHistorians are going to look back on all of this and have a much clearer idea of how misinformation led to real-world harm \u2013 and death.\u201d</p>",

In the weeks that followed, Newsom expanded the modifications to allow counties that had not been as affected by the virus as others to apply for looser restrictions. As of Tuesday, 47 out of the state\u2019s 58 counties have self-attested, and will be allowed to reopen hair salons, offices, some schools, all with modifications. <br></p> \n  <p>\u201cThe pace at which the state has made these modifications is concerning to me,\u201d said Dr Sara Cody, health director in Santa Clara county, location of what is believed to be the<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/22/coronavirus-killing-americans-weeks-earlier-than-thought\"> first Covid-related death</a> in the country. </p> \n  <p>Cody voiced these concerns at a local board of supervisors meeting on Tuesday, where she called for the county to take a more cautious approach. Since the start of the stay-at-home order, local variance has taken precedence, meaning if a county health officer called for stricter measures than the state order, then the county would comply with the county order. <br></p> \n  <p>Cody continued: \u201cWe can\u2019t see the effect of any of these changes, the effect on Covid, for at least 14 days, an incubation period, and 21 days is even better,\u201d she said. \u201cSo the state modifications are being made without a real understanding of the consequences of what the last move has been and with the possibly serious effects for health and possibly serious risks of an exponential growth in cases and therefore a risk to social and economic well-being.\u201d<br></p> \n  <p>In particular, Cody had reservations about Newsom\u2019s decision to authorize county health officers to allow religious, cultural and political gatherings of 100 people, a move she said \u201cposes a very serious risk of the spread of Covid-19, based on probability alone\u201d.<br></p> \n  <p>Cody\u2019s concerns come as California crossed the threshold on Wednesday of more than 100,000 positive cases \u2013 101,229 to be exact.

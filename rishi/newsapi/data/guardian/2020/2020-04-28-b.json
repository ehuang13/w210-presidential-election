  "<p>As America hurtles towards the critical 2020 presidential election during the Covid-19 pandemic, less than half of Democrats are confident it will be fair and accurate, according to a <a href=\"https://www.people-press.org/2020/04/28/two-thirds-of-americans-expect-presidential-election-will-be-disrupted-by-covid-19/\">new national survey</a> from the Pew Research Center.</p> <p>Just 46% of Democrats are confident in the fairness and accuracy of the November election, the survey found. Even fewer are confident all citizens will be able to vote if they want to.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/23/coronavirus-fight-to-vote-us-voters\">'We can\u2019t afford to wait': coronavirus could shut out droves of new US voters</a> </p> </aside>  <p>That\u2019s a sharp break from Republicans: 75% of them believe the election will be fair and accurate, and 87% were confident all eligible citizens will be eligible to vote, the survey found.</p> <p>The findings underscore the partisan divide over the right to vote. Democrats across the US generally are pushing to ease restrictions on voting, saying the policies needlessly shut out eligible voters. Republicans largely have defended those restrictions, saying elections are vulnerable to fraud, though several studies have shown <a href=\"https://www.brennancenter.org/issues/ensure-every-american-can-vote/vote-suppression/myth-voter-fraud\">it is exceptionally rare</a>.</p> <p>Overall, 59% of Americans are confident the election will be fair and accurate, and 63% believe all eligible citizens will be able to vote.</p> <p>Though Donald Trump has criticized efforts to expand <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/08/trump-mail-in-voting-2020-election\">vote by mail during</a> the Covid-19 crisis, claiming it would boost voter fraud and Democratic turnout, the survey found less partisan divide on the topic. </p> <p>In states where vote by mail is already widely used, nearly 70% of Republicans support expanding vote by mail. Even in states where mail-in voting is not widely used, 40% of Republicans support expanding it.</p> <p>Overall, 70% of Americans support allowing any voter to vote with a mail-in ballot if they want to, the survey found, <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/meet-the-press/two-thirds-voters-back-vote-mail-november-2020-n1187976\">echoing</a> other national polls. Republicans were nearly evenly divided on whether anyone should be allowed to vote with a mail-in ballot.</p> <p>\u201cThose who interact with a vote-by-mail environment and regime understand that it has a lot of advantages,\u201d said Tammy Patrick, an elections expert at the Democracy Fund and a former Arizona election official. \u201cWhen you have misinformation at the highest levels being dispersed on what will happen \u2026 it\u2019s very difficult to remove the partisan implications even when they don\u2019t exist.\u201d</p>",

Instead the pro-gun populist ventured out of his presidential palace in the capital, Bras\u00edlia, on Tuesday to visit a shooting range.</p> <p>In a video later posted on his official Facebook page, a grinning Bolsonaro appeared examining a bullet-riddled target. \u201cPretty good, eh?\u201d he says.<strong><br></strong></p>",

  "<p>Whether or not he is re-elected, Donald Trump will be revered by conservatives for his judicial appointments. As of March, Trump has appointed 193 judges to the federal bench, with another 39 pending on the floor of the Senate or in the Senate judiciary committee. Those nominations will surely be acted on favorably by the Senate before 20 January 2021, when there may be a new president and a new Senate. There are another 38 district court vacancies awaiting nominations. In one presidential term, Trump may appoint up to 270 federal judges, or 31% of the entire federal judiciary. For perspective, Barack Obama appointed 329 in <em>eight</em> years.</p> <p>There is no doubt that the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, will confirm Trump\u2019s appointments until the very last day of his term. This is of course the same Senate gatekeeper who infamously blocked Obama\u2019s final supreme court nomination, Merrick Garland, <em>for an entire year \u2013 </em>on the ground that in the final year of a presidency, the Senate should await \u201cthe will of the people\u201d in the upcoming general election. But that was then. The rules have apparently changed. McConnell will pack the courts with \u201cright-thinking\u201d ideologues who will carry out Trump\u2019s agenda long after he has been subjected to the scorn of historical scrutiny.</p> <p>We now know a lot about Trump\u2019s judicial appointments. Eighty-five per cent are white and 76% are male. This is a significant step backward. Obama\u2019s judicial appointments were 64% white and 58% male. Today, after more than three years of Trump\u2019s appointments, the federal judiciary is 73% white and 66% male, but it will be even more male and pale by the end of his term. Even more troubling is the average age of the Trump judges. According to Brookings, the <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/blog/fixgov/2020/01/28/judicial-appointments-in-trumps-first-three-years-myths-and-realities/\">median age</a> of Trump\u2019s judicial appointments by the beginning of his fourth year in office is 48.2. By the same time in his presidency, the median age of Obama\u2019s appointees was 57.2. This means that Trump judges will serve, on average, for 10 years more than the Obama judges.</p> <p>Statistics only tell part of the story. More important is the impact of these statistics on the critical issues that face the courts now and in the future. Courts should reflect the people they serve. I served as a federal district judge for 22 years. The vast majority of criminal defendants (in non-white-collar cases) were either African American or Hispanic, as were their family members.

Many studies have shown that decision-makers reach better decisions when they bring a variety of experiences to their analysis. A 36-year-old lawyer who has never tried a case, has not represented individual clients, and has not spent years facing life\u2019s challenges is not well-positioned to decide on the length of a prison term, the need for access to healthcare, abortion, food stamps, Medicare or housing, or the impact of pollution or discrimination on working people\u2019s quality of life. It is for this reason the American Bar Association\u2019s standing committee on the federal judiciary insists that a candidate for judicial office have at least 12 years of experience <em>practicing</em> law \u2013 not talking about it as a speech writer, lobbyist or media star.</p> <p>When I was appointed to the bench I was 48. I had been a federal prosecutor, a defense lawyer, and had handled many civil cases in trial and appellate courts. That experience was invaluable. I knew both the substance and procedure of federal practice. The same cannot be said of many of Trump\u2019s nominees, whose only qualifications appear to be their consistently rightwing voting records.</p> <p>Consider the following four Trump judges, all of whom were appointed in their 30s. What they have in common is not their legal experience, but their outspoken support of Trump\u2019s political agenda. All were members of the Federalist Society or other rightwing organizations, clerked for conservative judges, and have written articles or advocated for legal positions that are vastly out of step with most Americans.</p> <p>Allison Rushing was 36 when she was confirmed to a seat on the fourth circuit court of appeals, 11 years after graduating from law school, and Trump\u2019s youngest nominee to a circuit court judgeship. She clerked for then-circuit judge Neil Gorsuch and for Justice Clarence Thomas. Her law practice during the remaining nine years was limited to representing big corporations at one of the nation\u2019s largest law firms.</p> <p>Andrew Brasher was 38 when he was confirmed to a seat on the 11th circuit court of appeals, after serving for only nine months on the district court for the middle district of Alabama. In the years just before his appointment he served as Alabama\u2019s solicitor general, often advocating for rightwing causes.</p> <p>Justin Walker, best known for his full-throated defense of Brett Kavanaugh (for whom he clerked), was appointed as a district judge in the western district of Kentucky, at 37, just 10 years after graduating law school. He is a protege of Mitch McConnell, who held up debate on a Covid-19 relief bill to attend Walker\u2019s induction ceremony. Less than six months after Walker took the bench, Trump announced that he intended to nominate him for an upcoming vacancy on the DC court of appeals.</p> <p>Patrick Wyrick was 38 when he was confirmed as a judge for the western district of Oklahoma. Four years after graduating law school he became the solicitor general of Oklahoma. He is a protege of Scott Pruitt, the disgraced former head of the Environmental Protection Agency.</p> <p>One of these judges could easily end up on the supreme court; two are known to be on the shortlist. All will probably still be on the bench 40 years from now. That alone should make voters think hard about the upcoming presidential election. As the saying goes: elections have consequences.</p> <ul> <li><p>Shira A Scheindlin served as a United States district judge for the southern district of New York for 22 years. She is the co-chair of the oard of the Lawyers Committee for Civil Rights Under Law and a board member of the American Constitution Society</p></li> </ul>",

The estimates vary depending on the number, speed, and severity of infections, of course, but even the availability of testing affects the number of ventilators needed.... current estimates of the number of ventilators in the United States range from 60,000 to 160,000, depending on whether those that have only partial functionality are included. The national strategic reserve of ventilators is small and far from sufficient for the projected gap.

One headline suggested that he was \u201cbrain-dead\u201d.</p> <p>The North Korean leader Kim Jong-un\u2019s whereabouts remain unknown. But after a lost weekend, Donald Trump bounced back into the spotlight on Monday determined to prove that he is not only healthy but working very, very hard.</p> <p>\u201cThe people that know me and know the history of our Country say that I am the hardest working President in history,\u201d Trump had tweeted on Sunday, apparently stung by a New York Times report that said he spent all morning watching TV and clocks into the Oval Office around noon. \u201cI don\u2019t know about that, but I am a hard worker and have probably gotten more done in the first 3 1/2 years than any President in history.

Some wondered if he had retreated to a hermit-like existence following bleach-gate, his bizarre riff last Thursday musing aloud <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/23/trump-coronavirus-treatment-disinfectant\">that disinfectant could be injected</a> into coronavirus patients.</p> <p>The sorry episode generated open-mouthed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/25/donald-trump-coronavirus-disinfectant-sarcastic-tipping-point\">disbelief and derision around the world</a>. Coronavirus taskforce members were said to be stunned. For White House aides and Republican allies, it was reportedly the straw that broke the camel\u2019s back: these daily briefings had become a political liability that could cost Trump the presidential election.</p> <p>So there was no briefing on Saturday, nor on Sunday. The official White House guidance said there would be one on Monday. At 9.41am, Trump, whose very self-conception is based on what he sees reflected back through the media, tweeted: \u201cThere has never been, in the history of our Country, a more vicious or hostile Lamestream Media than there is right now, even in the midst of a National Emergency, the Invisible Enemy!\u201d</p> <p>At 10.52am, the briefing was abruptly cancelled without explanation. But at 1.32pm, it was officially back on again, scheduled for the rose garden at 5pm. As a poet once wrote, \u201cWho is in charge of the clattering train?\u201d</p> <p>It turned out the rose garden was decked out with a red carpet and US national flags. Corporate chief executives gave remarks. Trump did not advise anyone to inject disinfectant into their veins, nor did he berate some hapless journalist as \u201ca third rate reporter\u201d, but it could hardly be described as the long-yearned-for \u201cpivot\u201d to a presidential mien.</p> <p>Stung, perhaps, by <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/13-hours-of-trump-the-president-fills-briefings-with-attacks-and-boasts-but-little-empathy/2020/04/25/7eec5ab0-8590-11ea-a3eb-e9fc93160703_story.html\">a Washington Post analysis</a> that found over the past three weeks of briefings Trump spent two hours on attacks, 45 minutes praising himself and his administration and just 4\u00bd minutes expressing condolences for coronavirus victim, he read scripted remarks as usual before adding: \u201cWe do grieve.\u201d</p> <p>He went on to script a political attack ad against himself: \u201cThere has been so much unnecessary death in this country. It could have been stopped and it could have been stopped short, but somebody a long time ago, it seems, decided not to do it that way. And the whole world is suffering because of it. 184 countries, at least.\u201d</p> <p>In his old self-promotional style, he boasted: \u201cI built the greatest economy in the history of the world. I built it.\u201d</p> <p>Dr Deborah Birx outlined the taskforce\u2019s new guidelines for state testing. Trump said the US has carried out 5.4m tests, more than double any other country. He did not mention how far it still lags behind per capita, nor how the prominent taskforce member Dr Anthony Fauci has warned that testing levels need to at least be doubled before lockdown restrictions can be relaxed.</p> <p>The president was told that at least one governor reports an increase in the improper use of disinfectants. He said: \u201cI can\u2019t imagine why. I can\u2019t imagine why.\u201d</p> <p>Asked if he accepts responsibility for the sharp rise, he answered bluntly: \u201cNo, I don\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>Someone else wondered if Trump might try to change the date of the November election. \u201cNo, I would never change the date of the election,\u201d he said. \u201cNovember 3rd. It\u2019s a good number.\u201d</p> <p>There was a memorably pointed question: \u201cDoes a president deserve another term after more Americans die in six weeks than the entire Vietnam war?\u201d</p> <p>Trump, who was reportedly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/28/trump-coronavirus-politics-us-health-disaster\">warned about the coronavirus</a> by US intelligence agencies more than a dozen times in January and February, replied: \u201cWe\u2019ve lost a lot of people. But if you look at what original projections were \u2026 we\u2019ve made a lot of good decisions.\u201d</p> <p>Another reporter inquired about Kim\u2019s condition. \u201cI do have a very good idea but I can\u2019t talk about it now,\u201d Trump teased, gameshow-style. \u201cI just wish him well \u2026 I hope he\u2019s fine. I do know how he\u2019s doing, relatively speaking. We will see, you\u2019ll probably be hearing in the not too distant future.\u201d</p> <p>If only the victims of the coronavirus were afforded such presidential compassion. But empathy, like lunch, is for wimps.</p>"

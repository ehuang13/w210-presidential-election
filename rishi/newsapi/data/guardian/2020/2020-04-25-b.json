They are responsible corporate citizens. Or so they wish us to believe.</p> <p>Early in the lockdown, YouTube and Facebook made a great fuss about removing a David Icke video in which he claimed the coronavirus wasn\u2019t a virus but a sinister sickness spread by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/apr/07/how-false-claims-about-5g-health-risks-spread-into-the-mainstream\">5G</a> networks. Asked about attacks on phone masts by his confederates in duncery, Icke didn\u2019t fall over himself to condemn them. \u201cIf 5G continues and reaches where they want to take it, human life as we know it is over... so people have to make a decision.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.itv.com/news/2020-04-09/facebook-removes-david-icke-coronavirus-5g-conspiracy-video/\">Facebook said</a> it was \u201ccommitted to removing misinformation which could contribute to physical harm\u201d as it took down the interview with Icke and the London Real conspiracist site. (There\u2019s little real about it, I should add.) YouTube said it had no truck with \u201cconspiracy theories\u201d and did the same.</p> <p>They weren\u2019t serious. If they had been, they would have banned Icke and his imitators. As it was, Facebook and YouTube did not say they could no longer tolerate Icke on their platforms. They gave him the aura of being a free speech martyr by removing one interview, which he gratefully <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gB4TZ8vMFuE\">exploited</a>, then allowed him to carry on as before. At the time of writing, close to 500,000 had watched a recent Icke video entitled \u201cIs There a Virus?\u201d that YouTube had not taken down. Icke\u2019s jowls bubble with suppressed fury. \u201cThey\u201d were \u201credesignating\u201d deaths from flu and from 5G waves as deaths from Covid-19, he explains. And why would \u201cthey\u201d go to the time and trouble of doing that?

The legacies of religious, fascist and communist antisemitism are invisible forces propelling them forward to the irresistible conclusion that only one people had the occult power to fool and impoverish the whole wide world without anyone except the wised-up Icke and his kind noticing. Who are his \u201cthey\u201d? Where can we find \u201cthem\u201d? They are the 1%, Icke explains. Specifically, an \u201cultra-Zionist billionaire\u201d.</p> <p>I spoke to Google, the owner of YouTube, and asked why, if it meant what it said, it had not closed Icke down. Apparently most Icke content was still within its guidelines and would not be censored, I was told, an answer that leads us into a swamp.</p> <p>I can\u2019t think of a subject more saturated with dishonesty than freedom of speech. Opponents say it does not matter if a social media platform or a university bans speakers. Private organisations deciding for themselves who they wish to be associated with cannot be compared to state censors. They refuse to acknowledge that if a feminist academic is deemed transphobic and cannot talk in universities, there are precious few other venues open to her. Nor that many public figures are heard on social media or not heard at all. In the past decade, to cite the case of an almost forgotten figure, <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/milo-yiannopoulos-nazi-salutes-video-karaoke-richard-spencer-white-nationalists-karaoke-bar-a7987486.html\">the far-right fop</a> Milo Yiannopoulos was a social media celebrity feted and hated in equal measure. Twitter <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jul/20/milo-yiannopoulos-nero-permanently-banned-twitter\">banned him</a> in for leading a pile-on against a black actress, and its censorship finished him off. If Facebook and YouTube were to ban the corona conspiracists, that would be censorship too, and it is deceitful to pretend otherwise.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/24/coronavirus-sparks-perfect-storm-of-state-led-disinformation\">Malicious forces creating 'perfect storm' of coronavirus disinformation</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Alongside the pretence that censorship is not censorship is a hyperinflation in the notion of what speech should be punished for causing harm. The liberal, as distinct from the libertarian, argument is that only speech that directly incites crime should be prohibited, a demagogue whipping up anti-Muslim sentiment outside a mosque, for instance. Since the 1970s supposed \u201cliberals\u201d have wanted offence to be included as a harm. No one should deny that words are weapons that can hurt more than a blow. Unfortunately, no one can measure the psychic wounds that an offended person feels with the accuracy of a doctor measuring physical wounds on a victim of crime. The woolliness of their \u201chate speech\u201d laws all but guarantees that they will punish the innocent.</p> <p>Yet, in the case of Icke, there is no need for debates about whether the harm is real or whether it is just hurt feelings. Knuckle-dragging fantasists have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/apr/06/at-least-20-uk-phone-masts-vandalised-over-false-5g-coronavirus-claims\">physically attacked phone masts</a>. Daniel Allington and his colleague Nayana Dhavan at King\u2019s College London have shown that Ickean conspiracy theories pose <a href=\"https://kclpure.kcl.ac.uk/portal/files/127048253/Allington_and_Dhavan_2020.pdf\">a physical risk to public health</a>. Conspiracists put their own lives and, crucially, the lives of those around them at risk. Because their gurus have persuaded them that health advice is a giant lie, they see no need to stay at home, wash their hands or observe social distancing. YouTube and the social media companies are complicit, because they want the audience and revenue that crank celebs bring.</p> <p>They can pocket it because of a legal absurdity. Television broadcasts are regulated. Last week, Ofcom <a href=\"https://www.ofcom.org.uk/about-ofcom/latest/features-and-news/david-icke-and-eamonn-holmes-decision\">sanctioned a tiny TV station</a> called London Live because it broadcast Icke \u201ccasting doubt on the motives behind official health advice to protect the public from the virus\u201d. Yet it has no power to regulate YouTube when it broadcasts Icke saying that health workers and governments were responsible for deception on a supernatural scale.</p> <p>Parliament should have intervened in 2016 when the extent of Russian manipulation of social media was made painfully clear. There is a stronger argument for forcing the tech companies to live by their pious words now that so many are suffering. Liberals should always defend freedom of speech.

We\u2019re seeing the dissemination of material claiming that immigrants spread coronavirus, and that authoritarian regimes outperform western liberal democracies in tackling the health crisis.\u201d</p> <p>Zinc Network said British far-right groups such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/28/britain-first-far-right-members-5000-have-joined-tories\">Britain First</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/feb/11/how-britains-extremist-bloggers-helped-the-alt-right-go-global\">Knights Templar International</a>, as well as the BNP\u2019s former leader, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/oct/01/nick-griffin-expelled-from-bnp\">Nick Griffin</a>, have used the crisis to promote themselves as supporters of the community during the lockdown. Griffin has posted images of himself on social media distributing food parcels.</p> <p>Zinc Network, which in the past has attracted scrutiny for its work promoting the Home Office\u2019s anti-radicalisation strategy, <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/97976/prevent-strategy-review.pdf\">Prevent</a>, studied social media posts, photos, videos, journals, official records and media reports to produce the analysis.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Their tactics are sophisticated and their activity is becoming more difficult to monitor</p> <footer> <cite>Louise Brooke, Zinc Network</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It said one key narrative being pushed by the far right is that the spread of coronavirus is the consequence of illegal immigration. Allied to this is the claim that nations with tightly-controlled borders are better prepared to deal with the pandemic. Another is the premise that modern liberal states are on the verge of collapse, and that their fall can be accelerated through armed action or by a major crisis.</p> <p>The promotion of survivalist material by far-right groups is also becoming a trend. Zinc says neo-Nazi publisher Arktos has been publishing updated and expanded editions of far-right survivalist texts.</p> <p>A favoured tactic among far-right groups is to put fake documents into circulation, designed to look like real medical or government communications. According to Zinc\u2019s monitoring, far-right Telegram channels have been instrumental in circulating a fake scan of a positive Covid-19 test for the former vice-president and Democratic presidential candidate <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/24/joe-biden-donald-trump-delay-election\">Joe Biden</a>.</p> <p>The same channels have also been distributing government pandemic response documents with a view to helping would-be attackers plan their actions.</p> <p>Some far-right organisations are using the crisis to impersonate other groups, Zinc claims. Fake Extinction Rebellion flyers have been found in several cities in the UK proclaiming \u201cCorona is the cure \u2013 humans are the disease\u201d.</p> <p>Most of the leaflets condemn immigration, with some calling for the public to \u201clearn about the JQ\u201d \u2013 the \u201cJewish question\u201d. Others promote conspiracy theories or deny the Russian <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/sep/26/salisbury-poisoning-suspect-is-russian-colonel-reports\">novichok attack in Salisbury</a>.</p> <p>Brooke said: \u201cThese extremist groups are using the coronavirus as an opportunity to further their ideological objectives by spreading fear and division and exacerbating social tensions.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Callout&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;callout-coronavirus&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>",
  "<p>Can a man who is both head of state and chief executive somehow not be the center of attention during a national crisis? All eyes remain on Trump. Yet the president has effectively abdicated responsibility, nationally and internationally. He is just keeping up a nightly theater of leadership \u2013 with an eye on the ratings, as opposed to the lived reality of millions of Americans for whom he cannot muster even a performance of empathy. It is time to focus elsewhere. And it is urgent for Democrats to provide actual guidance for a country in disarray.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/24/the-guardian-view-on-the-eu-and-covid-19-better-late-than-never\">The Guardian view on the EU and Covid-19: better late than never | Editorial</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Plenty of people (not least journalists) have for the longest time clung to the hope that somehow the reality TV star would become \u201cpresidential\u201d. By contrast, Trump\u2019s detractors have been waiting desperately for some <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svUyYzzv6VI\">\u201chave you no sense of decency?\u201d</a> moment \u2013 something akin to the dramatic live-TV confrontation between lawyer Joseph Welch and Senator Joe McCarthy, which precipitated the downfall of the latter. Others are debating whether the networks and cable channels should carry Trump\u2019s daily briefings at all.</p> <p>There is an important lesson to be learned here from a very different period in history. I mean the strategies adopted by the central European dissidents of the 1970s and 1980s (which is not to equate authoritarian state socialism with the US today). After the failure of many reform efforts, Adam Michnik and other intellectuals concluded that the oppressive regimes were never going to change. The dissidents stopped talking to state leaders and resolved instead to \u201ctalk past them\u201d (<a href=\"https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/292994/postwar-by-tony-judt/\">as the historian Tony Judt put it</a>), trying to reach as many citizens as possible in spite of restrictions on speech. They also started to create what V\u00e1clav Benda called a <a href=\"https://www.palgrave.com/gp/book/9781349111190\">\u201cparallel polis\u201d</a> \u2013 a world in which one tried to act as if one was already free. These civil society initiatives undermined the regimes without ever confronting them head-on.</p> <p>What is the lesson? There is no point talking to Trump, because he will not change; every seemingly sober presidential moment \u2013 cheered by centrist observers \u2013 is followed by 10 puerile performances of ranting and raving. There will never be a Gotcha moment, because Trump\u2019s \u201cbase\u201d is apparently committed to him no matter what; even his diehard fans\u2019 most basic interests \u2013 such as not dying (never mind their economic interests) \u2013 will apparently not detract from their identification with a figure who, if nothing else, looks like a trustworthy general in the culture war.</p> <p>It is possible, to pick up an idea from the media critic Jay Rosen, <a href=\"https://pressthink.org/2020/04/five-improvements-in-the-design-of-coronavirus-coverage/\">to \u201cdecenter\u201d Trump</a>. True, he is the president, but he has basically informed the country that he is abdicating responsibility for the Covid-19 crisis and turning to polit-entertainment. The governors are supposed to \u201ccall the shots\u201d. The rest of the world already got the message that the United States is no longer interested in cooperating to address global challenges.</p> <p>Concretely, this means the Democrats should start doing nightly briefings and propose plans (wasn\u2019t there once someone in the primaries who was particularly good at drawing up plans?); governors could turn the fact that Trump has \u201cauthorized\u201d them to do what they want into a mandate for building a parallel polis with better policies, some of which could eventually be scaled up nationally. The fact that some do not have the resources, because Mitch McConnell would rather <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2020/04/22/mitch-mcconnell-bankruptcy-route-201008\">have blue states go bankrupt than save lives</a>, should be exposed as further proof that the Republicans have comprehensively turned into the party of cruelty.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Democrats may worry that providing alternative leadership is seen as divisive. But we are already in the campaign</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>To provide alternative leadership \u2013 and real facts, as opposed to Trump\u2019s mostly \u201calternative facts\u201d \u2013 is not the same as disputing the legitimacy of the president. When Andr\u00e9s<em> </em>Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador contested the outcome of the 2006 election in Mexico (which he narrowly lost), he declared himself the \u201clegitimate president of Mexico\u201d and had his followers camp out to protest in the middle of Mexico City. And in the weeks after the shock of November 2016, plenty of Americans declared Trump \u201cnot my president\u201d. That is a dangerous move, and mirrors Republicans who already in the 1990s referred to Bill Clinton as \u201cyour president\u201d, denying the legitimacy of their political adversaries. Trump, alas, <em>is</em> our president \u2013 he\u2019s just not acting like it.</p> <p>Democrats may worry that assertively providing alternative leadership is seen as \u201cdivisive\u201d or as \u201cpoliticizing\u201d the crisis. But like it or not, we are already in the campaign; Trump is being as divisive as ever; and, most important, an opposition ready to provide comprehensive alternatives is the heart of representative democracy. This is more obvious in parliamentary systems; think of how the leader of the opposition in the House of Commons is supposed to rise immediately after the prime minister and start rebutting.</p> <p>Some commentators have suggested Joe Biden put together a <a href=\"https://saraacarter.com/msnbc-host-suggests-biden-form-a-shadow-government-to-counter-trumps-covid-response/\">\u201cshadow cabinet\u201d</a>, following the UK example. Others have argued that Democrats should not have one spokesperson going up parallel to Trump, but instead feature <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/heres-how-democrats-can-counter-program-trumps-coronavirus-propaganda?\">a revolving set of politicians both charismatic and competent</a> (Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez would be a natural choice). What is most important is creating a sense that the opposition, in a time of crisis, is both criticizing the administration <em>and</em> offering something constructive.</p> <p>It is true that elections are today often decided <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/01/opinion/negative-partisanship-democrats-republicans.html\">more by \u201cnegative identity\u201d than by positive visions</a>; citizens vote less for something, than against someone. Many Americans have made up their mind about Trump by now; those who haven\u2019t are more likely to be impressed by his Kabuki shows of leadership and get the feeling that nobody else has a plan. It is this fatal sense that must be countered.</p> <ul> <li><p>Jan-Werner M\u00fcller is the author of What is Populism? His book Democracy Rules will be out next spring</p></li> </ul>",

Capacity for performing wellness checks on vulnerable residents will also be expanded. </p> \n  <p>Local agencies will begin distributing criteria on who qualifies for the program, but of highest priority are seniors who live below the poverty line and those with compromised immune systems. </p> \n  <p>\u201cThese programs will provide older, vulnerable Californians with access to nutritious meals in the safety of their homes and the opportunity to connect with someone who can listen to their concerns and make sure their needs are met.

Six current and former Trump advisors, including Miller, have ties to the group. </p> \n  <p>In a private call this week, Miller appeared to try and maintain restrictionists\u2019 favor by saying the ban was part of a long-term vision. <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/immigration/stephen-miller-audio-immigration-coronavirus/2020/04/24/8eaf59ba-8631-11ea-9728-c74380d9d410_story.html\">According to the Washington Post</a>, Miller said of the executive order: \u201cIt is vital, it is necessary, it is patriotic and it deserves the full-throated support of everybody on this call.\u201d </p> \n  <p>The Trump administration has already made dramatic changes to immigration in the US, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jan/15/invisible-wall-trump-policies-have-curbed-immigration\">through policies big and small</a>. So, the vision is already in place. </p> \n  <p>This is why the ban, with its exceptions, was interpreted as a largely political move. To have it be criticized by the people it is meant to appease is a problem for Miller above all others. </p> \n  <p>In addition to the call, the far-right website <strong>Breitbart News</strong> had an exclusive story today saying the original ban was more expansive.

Now disinfectant or doing this maybe on the hands would work. I was asking the question of the gentleman who was there yesterday, Bill [Bill Bryan, the acting homeland security undersecretary for science and technology], because when they say that something will last three to four hours or six hours, but if sun is out, or if they use disinfectant, it goes away in less than a minute. Did you hear about this yesterday?</p> \n  <p> POTUS: When I was asking a sarcastic \u2014 a very sarcastic question to the reporters in the room about disinfectant on the inside, but it does kill it, and it would kill it on the hands and that would make things much better. That was done in the form of a sarcastic question to a reporter.</p> \n  <p> Reporter: But you were asking your medical experts to look into it.</p> \n  <p> POTUS: To look into whether or not sun \u2014 and disinfectant on the hands \u2014 but whether or not sun can help us. Because, I mean he came in yesterday and he said they\u2019ve done a big study. This is a study. This isn\u2019t where he hasn\u2019t done it. This is where they\u2019ve come in with a final report that sun has a massive impact negatively on this virus. In other words, it does not live well with humidity and it doesn\u2019t live well with sun, sunlight, heat. It doesn\u2019t live well with heat and sun and and disinfectant. And that\u2019s what I brought up, and I thought that was clear.</p> \n  <p> Jeff Mason [Reuters journalist]: Just to follow up on the comments from yesterday you said you were being sarcastic, but some people may have misunderstood you. Do you want to just clarify?</p> \n  <p>POTUS: I wish they [\u2026]</p> \n  <p>Jeff Mason: Do you want to clarify to Americans if you don\u2019t want people to think that?</p> \n  <p>POTUS. Yes. I do think that disinfectant on the hands could have a very good effect. Now, Bill is going back to check that in the laboratory. You know, it\u2019s an amazing laboratory, by the way. It\u2019s amazing the work they do. So, he\u2019s going to check because a hard surface. This is a hard surface I guess maybe depending on whose hand you\u2019re talking about, right? But this is a hard surface and disinfectant, disinfectant has an unbelievable \u2014 it wipes it out. You saw it? Sun and heat, and humidity and you wipe it out. And this is from tests \u2014 they\u2019ve been doing these tests for a number of months. And the result \u2014 so then I said, \u2018Well, how do we do it inside the body or even outside the body with the hands and disinfectant I think would work.\u2019 He thinks it would work. When you use it when you\u2019re doing your hands. I guess that\u2019s one of the reasons they say wash your hands, but whether it\u2019s washing hands or disinfectant on your hands, it\u2019s very good. So, they\u2019re going to start looking at that. And there is a way of, you know, if light \u2014 if sun, sun itself that sun has a tremendous impact on or kills it like in one \u2014 it goes from what was it? Hours to like one minute instead.</p> \n  <p>So, I said you got to go back and look, but I\u2019d like them now to look as it pertains to the human body. Not just sitting on a railing or sitting on a wall. I\u2019d like to look as it pertains because maybe there\u2019s something there. They have to work with \u2014 I\u2019m not a doctor. They have to work with their doctors. but maybe there is something to light, and the human body, and helping people that are dying.</p> \n  <p>Jeff Mason: Just to clarify: You\u2019re not encouraging Americans to inject disinfectant?</p> \n  <p> POTUS: No. Of course not\u2026It was said sarcastically.

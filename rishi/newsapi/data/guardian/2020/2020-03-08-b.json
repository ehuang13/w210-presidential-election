He said the number of confirmed Covid-19 cases in Australia had risen to 74, including two members of the Australian defence force.</p> \n  <p>He also commented on the death of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/mar/08/coronavirus-live-updates-third-death-in-australia-as-cases-reach-more-than-70?page=with:block-5e6426bc8f087df56e4c446e#block-5e6426bc8f087df56e4c446e\">an 82-year-old man in Sydney</a>, one of the residents of the BaptistCare Dorothy Henderson Lodge aged care home, and the third person to die after testing positive to Covid-19 in Australia.</p> \n  <p>\u201cThat\u2019s just a great loss to him, his family, to all of the community, which will feel this loss,\u201d he said.<br></p> \n  <p><strong>Hunt urged people to be \u201ctheir best selves\u201d</strong> in what seems to be an oblique reference to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/mar/07/it-isnt-mad-max-police-warning-after-shoppers-brawl-over-toilet-paper-in-sydney\">the toilet paper wars. </a></p> \n  <p>\u201cOnly two months ago, as a nation, we faced the great challenge of the bushfires,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we rose. We were our best selves, and this is the time to be our best selves and to let our better angels prevail.<br></p> \n  <p>\u201cAnd our job, working with the states and territory, but working with the community, is to make sure that we are not just prepared, but that we are unified.</p> \n  <p>\u201cAnd so there have been some things which have occurred in recent days which have not been our best selves. But it was only two months ago, as I say, that as a country, the spirit of the volunteer, the spirit of the CFA and the RFS and our emergency service.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Hunt returned to this point a lot, comparing the spirit required in response to the global coronavirus outbreak to that seen in response to the Australian bushfires. (You will recall the Australian government was heavily criticised for its management of that crisis.)</p> \n  <p>He also announced that the Australian government had secured an additional 54m face masks for its national reserve and said that no primary health network in Australia had exhausted its first round of masks.</p> \n  <p>So that means that, contrary to reports from GPs that they are struggling to get the appropriate personal protective equipment. Hunt said there may have been some miscommunications which meant that busy medical practices \u201cmay not have realised that they\u2019ve had that\u201d.</p> \n  <p>Hunt was asked to comment on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/08/doctor-who-had-coronavirus-demands-apology-from-victorian-health-minister-over-inaccuracies\">a spat unfolding in Victoria between the health minister, Jenny Mikakos, and GPs</a>, who were incensed at her comments that she was \u201cflabbergasted\u201d a GP who was later diagnosed with Covid-19 had gone to work with cold- and/or flu-like symptoms.</p> \n  <p>Hunt drew on the bushfire analogy again: \u201cOver summer our firefighters and our emergency service workers were our heroes. In the coming months it will be our health and medical service workers who will be our national heroes. So we need to support them equally.\u201d</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-03-08T01:44:35.737Z\">at 1.44am GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e64463d8f085f0b8d944370\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-08T01:18:27.216Z\">1.18am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Still in Australia, authorities are asking people who travelled on <strong>two flights between Canberra and Sydney on 28 February</strong> and sat in particular rows to self-isolate and call the public health line on 1300 066 055.</p> \n  <p><strong>Flight one: 6.45am QF1509 Sydney to Canberra, rows 2-6</strong></p> \n  <p><strong>Flight two: 2.35pm VA651 Canberra to Sydney, rows 3-7</strong></p> \n  <p>\u201cAnyone else travelling on these flights in other rows are not considered to be close contacts and should monitor their health until 13 March and to contact their GP for assessment and testing if they develop any symptoms.\u201d</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-03-08T01:45:44.897Z\">at 1.45am GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e6444718f085f0b8d944366\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-08T01:11:00.378Z\">1.11am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">44 new cases in China</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>On Sunday health authorities in mainland China reported 44 new confirmed cases of Covid-19 on Saturday, and 27 deaths (all in the Hubei province).

  "<p>You are dropped in the middle of Mexico City, ready to race 25,000km across Latin America. You are not allowed to use a plane and your phone \u2013 full of navigational apps \u2013 has been confiscated. With limited cash, you use the cheapest and most uncomfortable forms of transport imaginable. Not only are you unfamiliar with the race\u2019s destination \u2013 Ushuaia, at the bottom of Argentina \u2013 but also you are relying on directions from members of the public, who speak a language \u2013 or languages \u2013 you don\u2019t. This is the scenario in which the contestants find themselves at the start of the second series of Race Across the World.</p> <p>The first series of the BBC Two show \u2013 a sleeper hit buried in the weekend schedules \u2013 challenged teams to race between London and Singapore, mixing leisurely escapism with anxiety-inducing endurance. We can expect further emotional peaks and troughs in the second outing.</p> <p>If you think the contestants must have found the experience exhausting, consider the crew. Each team of two was accompanied for the entire race by two members of the production crew, who stayed at each hostel and travelled alongside them on every mode of transport. \u201cWe did a 28-hour bus, then had an hour in a bus station, then went straight on to a 21-hour bus,\u201d says Charlotte Jacobs, an assistant producer. \u201cThree weeks into it, a 12-hour bus journey seemed quite short.

The crew were not allowed to interfere with or influence the team\u2019s routes, either \u2013 even if they were making a mistake, which they often did. One team did not realise that they had also crossed a time zone and nearly missed a vital connection. In the first episode, two contestants took the wrong bus when leaving the Mayan ruins at Palenque in Chiapas state, southern Mexico, and almost ended up on a six-hour detour. </p> <p>The production team stresses that safety was a priority \u2013 a local fixer and a security adviser followed each team, but kept enough distance to make the trip felt authentic.</p> <p>However, filming in Latin America posed a unique set of challenges. Venezuela was out of bounds before the race even began, due to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/feb/20/one-million-children-left-behind-those-who-stay-venezuela-amid-exodus\">the </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/feb/20/one-million-children-left-behind-those-who-stay-venezuela-amid-exodus\">political and economic crisis in the country</a>. Guatemala, Chile and Ecuador all declared states of emergency whilst the race was in progress. Teams still visited the countries, but were rerouted to avoid certain parts of each. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/15/bolivia-crisis-what-happens-next-evo-morales\">Riots in Bolivia</a>, following a contentious presidential election, resulted in all the teams being forced to leave the country by a certain date.

Five out of the seven checkpoints had to be relocated \u2013 checkpoints that were long arranged and located at suitable hotels, to give everyone an opportunity to recharge. The contestants were already on their way to the first location when a change was forced upon them. \u201cThat was pretty hard, but I think it ended up being one of the most exciting checkpoints of the series. And certainly one of the more peaceful,\u201d says the series producer, Lucy Curtis. \u201cWe joke that whenever things are going smoothly we get a bit bored!\u201d</p> <p>To ensure that the race was feasible in the first place, two members of the production team completed the whole journey in advance of filming. The recce (which was also undertaken for the first series) was even more arduous than the race itself, as there were only two people \u2013 only one of whom knew where they were supposed to be going. \u201cThe other person has no idea and that person is in charge of making the decisions,\u201d explains Curtis.</p> <p>On the recces, the team had constant nightmares with money. Foreign exchanges were few and far between, because locals tended to use bank cards. \u201cWe want to test how long it would take if you were someone who goes into it blind. They are a bit stir crazy at times, stuck on boats and buses and trains for days on end, but it\u2019s an amazing job.\u201d</p> <p>Indeed, for all of the stresses, racing across the world always proves to be a joyful experience. It has transformative effects on the contestants, all of whom are at a crossroads in their lives or are trying to get closer to their teammate. It is life-affirming for those who travel with them, too. Jacobs has put herself forward to accompany another team for a further series, still high from the last experience. \u201cNow I\u2019m thinking about it, I\u2019m like: \u2018Oh no!\u2019\u201d she says, laughing. \u201cWhat have I let myself in for?\u201d</p> <p><em>Race Across The World returns tonight, 8pm, BBC Two</em></p>",
  "<p>\u2018People with knowledge should talk about it, not football managers.\u201d Such was the refreshingly honest response of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/jurgen-klopp\" title=\"\">J\u00fcrgen Klopp</a> when pressed for his views about coronavirus by journalists last week. \u201c<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkIZZCbxngQ\" title=\"\">My opinion about corona is not important</a>.\u201d The Liverpool manager\u2019s comments embody an important sentiment that seems to have emerged in this outbreak: a reappraisal of the importance of experts in the wake of their denigration by populist leaders around the world.</p> <p>This government is not a fan of experts. For months, it has repeatedly ignored warnings from scientists, trade experts and economists about the impact of a hard Brexit on the country\u2019s economic wellbeing and security. It has implicitly declared war on the civil service: aides and advisers liberally brief against \u201cthe blob\u201d and its perceived resistance to ripping up a supposedly pointless rulebook. But thankfully \u2013 perhaps with as much a view to protecting its own political fortunes as well as public health \u2013 ministers have temporarily put their hostility towards experts and civil servants aside. Last week, we criticised the government\u2019s slow response to the crisis: holding back ministers from news programmes that had caused it offence; taking days to call a meeting of Cobra chaired by the PM. But as the government has moved from the \u201ccontain\u201d to the \u201cdelay\u201d phase of its response, there has been a marked improvement.</p> <p>Boris Johnson gave a press conference flanked by the government\u2019s chief medical officer, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/03/uk-government-coronavirus-plans-strip-fire-and-police-to-essentials-covid-19\" title=\"\">Chris Whitty</a>, and its chief scientific adviser, Patrick Vallance. Decision-making is clearly being driven by medical and scientific expertise. The government quickly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/05/coronavirus-minister-hints-u-turn-decision-stop-daily-uk-updates\" title=\"\">corrected a major misstep</a> when it at first announced it would stop publishing daily information on the location and numbers of patients testing positive. As stressed by the World Health Organization, information and transparency about the extent of the outbreak and plans to deal with it are vital in building public trust; on the whole, the government has been very open about its strategy. There is a sense that the UK response is striking the right balance, issuing accurate and useful information that has avoided over-hyping the risk, and making proportionate responses to try to delay the spread of the virus that do not engender panic.</p> <p>That is not to say that the government\u2019s response has been beyond reproach. It was extremely worrying that the health secretary, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/06/uk-supermarkets-asked-to-deliver-food-to-people-in-coronavirus-self-isolation\" title=\"\">Matt Hancock</a>, said that he had been in touch with supermarkets to work on plans to ensure that people in self-isolation would be able to get the food and supplies they need, only for industry executives to accuse him of lying. It undermines the reassurances he offered that the government is confident there will be no problem with the food supply. It reinforces the importance of ministers being truthful rather than relying on bluster.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>What is unfolding in the US is exposing in real time the dangers of populism and its rejection of evidence and experts</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>While the government\u2019s short-term response has, on the whole, been good, a decade of austerity has put the public infrastructure required to manage a pandemic \u2013 the NHS, the social care system, the police service \u2013 under intolerable strain. It is no exaggeration to say that, as a result, under a worst-case scenario more people will die than necessary. Scientists have also raised fears about the UK\u2019s lack of capacity for <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-51454859\" title=\"\">vaccine manufacture</a> in preventing future waves of this virus from affecting the population, which is partly as a result of the government\u2019s failure to invest in this years ago.</p> <p>Casting an eye across the Atlantic, to the chaos of the US response, provides a salutary reminder of just how much further Donald Trump is prepared to go than Boris Johnson in his war on experts. Trump has repeatedly contradicted medical experts and consequently confused the public health messaging. \u201cWe closed it down, we stopped it,\u201d he said on Friday, arguing that this justified his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2020/mar/06/joe-biden-bernie-sanders-2020-presidential-election-trump-coronavirus-live-updates\" title=\"\">tightening of border controls</a>.

Almost one in 10 Americans <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/number-of-americans-without-insurance-shows-first-increase-since2008-11568128381\" title=\"\">have no health insurance</a> and will have to meet any costs of treatment \u2013 and perhaps even testing for the virus \u2013 out of pocket.

There is no legal entitlement to sick pay in the US, meaning millions of low-paid workers living in poverty will simply not be able to afford to self-isolate as a containment measure.</p> <p>What is unfolding in the US is exposing in real time the dangers of populism and its rejection of evidence and experts. And societies\u2019 responses to the crisis are casting a spotlight on their key vulnerabilities and fragilities. In America, it is the lack of a universal entitlement to healthcare and basic employment rights in one of the world\u2019s richest countries. In Britain, coronavirus has only brought to the fore concerns about the brittle system for caring for older people, who are most at risk of the virus, many of whom suffer from social isolation.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m very proud that UK experts\u2026 are on the frontline of global efforts,\u201d Johnson said on Friday, in an about-turn for a prime minister who has made ignoring experts a defining characteristic of his leadership. But will this newly found sense of pride last beyond the coronavirus crisis? That very much remains to be seen.</p>",
  "<p>In the wake of the 2018 \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/nov/16/the-democratic-blue-wave-was-real\" title=\"\">blue wave</a>\u201d, when the party secured impressive midterms, the Democrats were poised to field one of the most diverse pool of presidential candidates in US history: people of colour, women, an openly gay man, most of them under the age of 55.</p> <p>And now, in the wake of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/super-tuesday\" title=\"\">Super Tuesday</a>, there remain two contenders for the Democratic nomination, both of them white men over the age of 75; neither of them, in my opinion, the most qualified or best candidate for the position. That candidate, Senator Elizabeth Warren, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/05/elizabeth-warren-quitting-2020-democratic-presidential-race\" title=\"\">suspended her campaign</a> on Thursday.</p> <p>An ardent Warren supporter, I was devastated by this news. Her campaign inspired me and reawakened the hope that three years of a Trump administration had all but extinguished. Warren is an intellectual and an academic. She thinks deeply about issues and considers them from multiple perspectives.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/05/read-elizabeth-warren-full-statement-quitting-2020-race\">'We will persist': read Elizabeth Warren's full statement on quitting the 2020 race</a> </p> </aside>  <p>More importantly, she recognised her limitations and was receptive to other points of view. And, most essential, she knew when to dig in and when to reverse course. She embodied the balance of head and heart that is so elusive and so essential in a leader, especially the leader of a country as diverse as the United States.</p> <p>In 2016, I was shattered and yet somehow not surprised that the US failed to elect its first female president. I recognised the vitriol and misogyny spewed at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/mar/06/hillary-clinton-revealing-docuseries-hulu\" title=\"\">Hillary Clinton</a> as well as the more subtle institutional sexism directed at her. I heard the rationalisations insisting that it wasn\u2019t the idea of A Woman President, it was the idea of <em>this</em> woman with a lengthy record of national service, who was running against a reality-television star with little relevant experience and a lengthy history of bankruptcies, controversy and scandal.</p> <p>Yet, despite her qualifications, Clinton was a polarising figure. What would happen if we took those voters at their word and found another woman, one who was less controversial than Clinton and who had even more experience? Surely, that would work. Wouldn\u2019t it?</p> <p>Warren seemed to be the ideal candidate: she was not only smart, articulate and unafraid, she was highly qualified. In short, she was the candidate most likely to affect the change needed to reverse the incredible harm the past four years have witnessed.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>If 2016 taught us anything, isn\u2019t it that even if we think we know who is most likely to be elected, we have no idea?</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Yet, last week, Democrats in my home state of South Carolina, and those in Georgia, North Carolina, Texas, Oklahoma, California, Massachusetts and many, many other states answered the question of whether <em>this</em> woman would be worthy of their support with a resounding <em>no</em>.</p> <p>Instead of voting for a woman who was both accomplished and compassionate, a candidate who combined the progressive ideals of one of her rivals with an ability to foster connection and collaboration, they starkly split their ballots between two familiar faces \u2013 both themselves polarising and controversial, both white men. There are a lot of voters who will continue to insist that gender had nothing to do with their choice. But the rhetoric of the past few weeks tells a different story. Again and again, people have said that Warren was their preferred candidate but that they didn\u2019t vote for her because they didn\u2019t think she\u2019d win either the nomination or in the general election.</p> <p>Everyone agrees that defeating Donald Trump is the most important thing, that we all need to get together on the same side, whichever side that turns out to be, #BlueNoMatterWho, etc. However, instead of casting a ballot for the candidate they prefer, instead of voting for the candidate they want to see carry the nomination, they choose the candidate who they think is most electable. But if 2016 has taught us anything, hasn\u2019t it taught us that even if we think we know who is most likely to be elected, we really have no idea?</p> <p>I am proud to have voted for Elizabeth Warren, and I\u2019m disappointed, yet again, to see a smart, well-qualified woman cast aside to make way for yet more white men. My heart hurts to see that our country fails to recognise that there\u2019s a better alternative to the dogmatism and indignation of one candidate or the comfortable status quo of the other. I\u2019m profoundly saddened that we have rejected a candidate who is willing to admit mistakes and be accountable for them in favour of more finger-pointing and redirection.</p> <p>Despite my sadness, I\u2019m also left with a powerful sense of gratitude. Thank you, Senator Warren, for being such a positive example of grit, integrity and grace. Thank you for standing up for your principles and not backing down from a fight. Thank you for standing for the dignity of all Americans, for working towards inclusivity and opportunity. Thank you, most of all, for your persistence.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Erin Templeton is Dean of Humanities, Sciences, &amp; Business at Converse College, South Carolina</em></p>"

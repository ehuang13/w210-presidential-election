  "<p>After most national polls had been showing a considerable lead for Bernie Sanders in the Democratic primary, former vice-president Joe Biden\u2019s strong showing on Super Tuesday caught most of the country by surprise. Notably, his largest margins came in states with substantial black populations: Virginia, Alabama, North Carolina and Arkansas.</p> <p>The surge of momentum that led to him winning 10 of 14 states began last Saturday in the South Carolina primary, where Biden\u2019s 30-point win was the result of his taking almost two-thirds of black votes there.</p> <p>In fact, to date, Biden has done what every successful Democratic nominee has done over the past 30 years: win the most black votes in every state. Every nominee, that is, with the exception, in 2004, of John Kerry, who finished three points behind his eventual running mate, John Edwards, in just one state.</p> <p>What does this all mean? Black voters, particularly in the South, changed the course of the Democratic primary. And it\u2019s safe to say they will play an outsize role in deciding who wins the White House.</p> <p>For more than five decades, an average of about 90% of black voters have supported the Democratic candidate. Those voters are concentrated in the South, where most of the states vote Republican. However, in a few battleground states, \u2013 Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, and Florida in particular \u2013 the number of black voters is sizable enough to be the deciding bloc. So a Democratic candidate who demonstrates the strongest black support in the primary can make the case that he or she is better positioned to win the presidential election. What the Super Tuesday results suggest is that Biden can gain black support in ways that Sanders cannot, and the recently exited Michael Bloomberg and Senator Elizabeth Warren could not.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b2daa4d62228eac2400a7475796eb9dafde86415\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b2daa4d62228eac2400a7475796eb9dafde86415/0_117_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bernie Sanders finds it hard to connect with black voters.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bernie Sanders finds it hard to connect with black voters.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lucas Jackson/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Donald Trump and his campaign strategists are clearly aware of the pivotal role black voters will play in the election. It is no coincidence that in the past few months alone, the president has kicked off a Black Voices for Trump initiative in Atlanta, dedicated a considerable portion of his State of the Union address to the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/04/us/politics/trump-state-of-the-union-black-voters.html\" title=\"\">\u201cbootstrapping black American\u201d</a>, and announced plans to open \u201ccommunity centers\u201d in strategically targeted black communities in seven battleground states.</p> <p>The president also reminds the nation at every opportunity about the low black unemployment rate and the federal prison reform bill he has signed into law. In doing this, Trump\u2019s goal is not to win over the majority of black voters \u2013 depriving the Democratic Party of its core electoral constituency in the process. Rather, it is an attempt to accomplish two basic aims. First, he wants to get the Republican Party\u2019s black support back to its historical average. Between 1968 and 2004, Republican presidential nominees polled an average of just over 11% of the black vote \u2013 Trump only managed 8% in 2016. If he can convince black Republicans to \u201ccome home\u201d, he increases his chances of winning a close election.</p> <p>Second, he is hoping to dampen black voters\u2019 enthusiasm for the Democratic nominee and for the election overall. Based on recent voting patterns, for every 10 black voters who stay at home on election day, the Democratic nominee loses nine votes and Trump only loses one.</p> <p>This reality is what makes Biden\u2019s commanding performance last week even more meaningful. Trump\u2019s disapproval rating among black voters is exceedingly high \u2013 just one in 10 has a favorable view of him, and only a dismal 4% support his policies all or some of the time. But dissatisfaction with Trump is not enough to improve the most important metric when it comes to black voters in the general election: turnout. Biden\u2019s Super Tuesday wins suggest he is best-positioned to accomplish it.</p> <p>In 2016, the black voter participation rate fell by seven points from 67% in 2012 to 60%, its lowest level in two decades. That reduced the black share of the electorate from nearly 13% in 2012 to less than 12% in 2016. And for an election that was essentially decided by 77,000 votes over three battleground states, higher black turnout might have resulted in a different electoral outcome where Hillary Clinton became the first female president. Trump won the 2016 election for a number of reasons \u2013 lower black turnout was not the sole cause, but higher black turnout is critical to the Democratic nominee\u2019s chances of beating Trump.</p> <p>Based on the results from Super Tuesday, the indication seems to be that black voters think Biden is the pragmatic choice and the safest bet. And the accompanying increased black turnout across the primary states bodes well for Democrats\u2019 chances of winning the election this Fall.</p> <p>A month ago, Biden\u2019s bid for the presidency seemed to be running on fumes. Then, in the span of just a few days, black voters helped his campaign go from also-ran to frontrunner. It remains to be seen which candidate emerges from the primary and goes on to face Trump in the election, but whoever the nominee is, he or she will necessarily rely on black voters to help deliver victory just as they did for Biden last week. If black turnout increases, especially in battleground states, and the Democratic nominee can hang onto a 90% share of their votes, 2020 will undeniably be the year of the black voter.</p> <p><em>Theodore R Johnson is a senior fellow at the Brennan Center for Justice</em></p>",
  "<p>What\u2019s the difference between playing a president on screen and being one in real life? Not much, according to Ukraine\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/volodymyr-zelenskiy\" title=\"\">Volodymyr Zelenskiy</a>, the man who\u2019s done both.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s very similar,\u201d he says, his compact frame engulfed by a green leather armchair in his opulent presidential office. Then he changes his mind: in fact, the real job lasts a whole five years, and comes with far greater challenges than can fit into one season of a television show. \u201cIt\u2019s true there are more problems. They are catastrophic. They appear, I\u2019m sorry to say, like pimples on an 18-year-old kid. You don\u2019t know where they will pop up, or when.\u201d The 42-year-old speaks in his native Russian, his expressive face switching from boyish amusement to tortured concern in a flash.</p> <p>The latest problem is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\" title=\"\">coronavirus</a>. Angry villagers, scared their hospital is hosting returnees from China, have attacked the buses transporting them. The day before we meet, Zelenskiy dispatched his health minister to join the evacuees in quarantine, as proof they pose no danger. \u201cIt was her choice, but I suggested it,\u201d he says, chuckling in a way that implies he gave her little alternative.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I\u2019ll happily talk to you when my five years are up and tell you lots of things that I can\u2019t now. State secrets</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It is exactly the kind of impetuous decision his television alter ego might have taken. In the Ukrainian series <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6235122/\" title=\"\">Servant Of The People</a>, Zelenskiy plays an everyman with no political experience who is elevated to the country\u2019s presidency. Last April, a couple of weeks after the season three finale aired, he took 73% of the vote in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/apr/21/zelenskiy-wins-second-round-of-ukraines-presidential-election-exit-poll\" title=\"\">the country\u2019s actual presidential election</a>. In May, he started the job for real. In an era of outsider electoral successes, Zelenskiy\u2019s has been perhaps the most unlikely of them all.</p> <p>Running a country of 42 million people that in the past few years has seen <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/05/ukraine-russia-explainer\" title=\"\">a revolution, a land-grab by Vladimir Putin</a> and an ongoing war in its eastern regions was not going to be an easy task, especially for a political novice. But Zelenskiy\u2019s first real-life presidential season has thrown up one plotline that even his show\u2019s scriptwriters might have discarded as implausible, involving another unlikely president, from across the Atlantic.</p> <p>After decades in which US politicians have chided Ukraine for its venal politics, it\u2019s ironic that an American president should try to corrupt his Ukrainian counterpart. Donald Trump wanted one thing from Zelenskiy: an investigation into the Ukrainian business dealings of Hunter Biden, son of Joe \u2013 his potential 2020 presidential opponent. Until he complied, Trump made it clear through aides that he would withhold $391m (\u00a3303m) in military aid, along with Zelenskiy\u2019s chance of a coveted White House visit. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/nov/30/trump-ukraine-alleged-bribery-impeachment-inquiry\" title=\"\">Trump\u2019s interactions with Zelenskiy</a> were at the crux of his impeachment trial in January, with the most damning evidence released by Trump himself: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/sep/25/trumps-phone-call-with-ukraines-president-read-the-full-transcript\" title=\"\">a memorandum of a 25 July call</a> between the leaders. In it, Zelenskiy flatters Trump, while delicately trying not to enter into a criminal conspiracy with him: \u201cYou are a great teacher for us,\u201d he says, in one of several passages it is hard to read without cringing. Trump, meanwhile, underlines how much the US will do for Ukraine, if only Zelenskiy will order a probe into Hunter Biden.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"df44e8986477a56972615095e31b9bf907ba1302\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/df44e8986477a56972615095e31b9bf907ba1302/0_58_4604_2877/1000.jpg\" alt=\"US President Donald Trump (on right) and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy during a meeting in New York on September 25, 2019, on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly\" width=\"1000\" height=\"625\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">At the UN summit last September, hours after Trump released the transcript of the call that led to his impeachment.

Not only 100%, but actually 1,000%,\u201d he says when Trump claims <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/angela-merkel\" title=\"\">Angela Merkel</a> \u201cdoesn\u2019t do anything\u201d for Ukraine (in fact, the EU is its largest financial donor). But the scandal resonated more loudly in the US; with Russia-backed troops still in the east of the country, most Ukrainians are sympathetic to maintaining US support at almost any cost.</p> <p>Zelenskiy appeared rattled when Trump released the memo just hours before <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/sep/25/trump-zelenskiy-ukraine-meeting-un\" title=\"\">the two </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/sep/25/trump-zelenskiy-ukraine-meeting-un\" title=\"\">held an awkward press conference</a> at the UN last September. Today, he looks more comfortable discussing the exchange, though he says he is tired of the impeachment saga dominating every conversation about Ukraine. \u201cI think Ukraine has passed through this story proudly, with its head raised high,\u201d he says. But he has still not received the promised White House invitation, and it\u2019s clear this is an irritation. \u201cI was told it\u2019s being prepared. It\u2019s hard for me to hear that. I am a person who works to deadlines. Our diplomats are discussing it with American diplomats. I would like us to have a fruitful meeting.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Zelenskiy thinks the era of the political outsider is just beginning. \u2018People are tired and want a breath of fresh air'</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But the humiliations have kept coming. In late January, two days before secretary of state Mike Pompeo was due to travel to Kyiv in a show of US support, he somewhat undermined the message by snapping at a reporter: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jan/24/mike-pompeo-ukraine-npr-rant\" title=\"\">\u201cDo you think Americans care about Ukraine?\u201d</a> and asking her to point to it on a map, as if it were an obscure principality rather than the biggest country in Europe. When they met, Zelenskiy says, Pompeo insisted he had been misquoted. He says he is \u201cgrateful to the US, because actually both political parties support us\u201d. But what about the president?</p> <p>Zelenskiy pauses and laughs. He draws another breath before giving a long, convoluted and largely meaningless answer about the overwhelming US support he feels, from the president down. There\u2019s not much else he can say. Trump is known to be vindictive, and could win another four years <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-elections-2020\" title=\"\">in </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-elections-2020\" title=\"\">November</a>. On the other hand, if Zelenskiy comes out in full-blooded support, he will look a fool if a Democrat wins the White House. The best option, it seems, is to say nothing.</p> <p>\u201cWith some issues, I don\u2019t really understand how to help journalists. When it comes to matters of state, I\u2019ll happily talk to you when my five years are up and tell you lots of things I can\u2019t now. But these are state secrets.\u201d</p> <p>After 10 months in office, Zelenskiy is desperate to move the conversation on from the impeachment saga. He has agreed to a rare interview in the hope that he can \u201cchange the context\u201d \u2013 to his focus on making a deal with Putin to end the war, and on further integration with Europe. He speaks passionately and with much gesturing, deploying the easy charm that helped him win the presidency. His future success will depend on whether he can use it to good effect on the European leaders who are his best hope of escaping his unenviable position, stuck between Trump and Putin.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"1af41c13fc1c29390a20085d6c6e35eb3e6bf2af\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1af41c13fc1c29390a20085d6c6e35eb3e6bf2af/163_2314_3471_3144/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Portrait of Volodymyr Zelenskiy (president of Ukraine) in Kyiv, Ukraine, February 2020\" width=\"1000\" height=\"906\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Previous inhabitants felt very at home in these surroundings.

He claims to have succeeded so far, but our surroundings tell a different story. His cavernous office is done out with gilded stucco ceilings, chandeliers and ruched curtains that cascade down long windows. So far, so very presidential. But the handshakes are hardly over before Zelenskiy tells us how ill at ease he is. \u201cI can\u2019t even sit there, it\u2019s awful,\u201d he says, pointing to the wooden desk laden with malachite ornaments and a bank of secure telephones. \u201cPrevious inhabitants felt very at home in these surroundings, I guess,\u201d he says; they make him feel \u201chorribly uncomfortable\u201d.</p> <p>The most recent renovations were done by president <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/viktor-yanukovych\" title=\"\">Viktor Yanukovych</a>, whose obscene corruption and cosying up to Russia prompted the 2014 Maidan revolution. We meet six years to the day since <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/feb/22/ukraine-tymoshenko-president-protests\" title=\"\">Yanukovych fled the building</a> during bloody clashes between riot police and protesters in central Kyiv, setting in train the Russian annexation of Crimea and military incursion into eastern Ukraine.</p> <p>Initially, Zelenskiy promised he would move the presidential office, but he has now decided the cost to the taxpayer would be prohibitive: \u201cAnd I can\u2019t do a renovation, because it\u2019s a historic building, so it would be illegal.\u201d But it is noticeable he has not made even small changes, such as replacing the furniture or removing the kitsch bronze figurines. Maybe he needs something to complain about. Or maybe the trappings of power are proving seductive.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s true, you do start getting used to it.\u201d He laughs.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Volodymyr Zelenskiy was born in 1978, into a Jewish Ukrainian family in Kryvyi Rih, an industrial city in the south-east of Soviet Ukraine, dotted with mines and blast furnaces. It was a tough place to grow up, notorious for gangs of youths fighting to control different neighbourhoods in the years after the Soviet collapse.</p> <p>Zelenskiy\u2019s way out came through comedy. A natural performer, he organised a tight-knit group of friends from high school and law school into a comedy troupe named Kvartal 95, after the neighbourhood in which they grew up. By the mid-2000s, the troupe had moved to Kyiv and were appearing regularly on Ukrainian television. Recently, Zelenskiy has brought in some of them as key advisers. \u201cI have a few people who work with me who have been my friends for a long time\u2026 They have no relation to business, or to the budget,\u201d he says, insisting the appointments are about personal trust, not financial cronyism.</p> <p>Zelenskiy\u2019s humour tended toward the slapstick: his audiences preferred <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2002/apr/21/biography.features\" title=\"\">Benny Hill</a> to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/monty-python\" title=\"\">Monty Python</a>, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-47769118\" title=\"\">he has said</a>. In one skit, he and a fellow actor appear to play Chopsticks on the piano using only their penises. But there were also more pointed, political sketches, mocking Ukraine\u2019s corrupt officials and oligarchs. He came to know some of his targets personally, as he took on more work as a television and film producer, bringing him wealth and connections among the elites. Sometimes this got him into trouble, if a sketch cut too deeply. Occasionally, the group poked fun at the authoritarianism of Ukraine\u2019s big neighbour. In a skit to coincide with a Russian presidential election, Zelenskiy and his friends played the returning officers at a local polling station, suicidal because they have accidentally failed to secure a Putin victory in their district.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"77fc2e3aed99c9db5c70a70f77a54e548f6a8f07\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/77fc2e3aed99c9db5c70a70f77a54e548f6a8f07/0_0_6016_4016/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Stills from Ukranian tv show: Servant of the People featuring Volodymyr Zelenskiy\" width=\"1000\" height=\"668\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">In Servant Of The People: think Yes Minister crossed with House Of Cards</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kvartal 95 PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Servant Of The People, a sharp-edged comedy, first aired in 2015.

The popularity of the show prompted a question, backed up by favourable polling numbers: what if Zelenskiy ran for office in real life? In the final moments of 2018, on his new year television show, he announced that he would.</p> <p>He ran a ludicrous, postmodern campaign, the centrepiece of which was a nationwide comedy tour that included video clips of his on-screen president. Mainly, he just wanted to make the audience laugh. One Ukrainians-on-holiday sketch poked fun at a tourist who spends his vacation watching movies on a bus. \u201cBut where did you stop?\u201d he is asked. \u201cSomewhere around Terminator 2,\u201d comes the response.</p> <p>Zelenskiy was up against the incumbent, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/petro-poroshenko\" title=\"\">Petro Poroshenko</a>, a billionaire chocolate magnate who had won the presidency a few months after the Maidan revolution. While Poroshenko had brought some reform, he had failed to deliver on his key promise to end corruption. Lagging in the polls, he was flummoxed by Zelenskiy\u2019s insurgent campaign, and tried to paint his opponent as a man who would appease Putin over the war. Meanwhile Zelenskiy largely avoided debate, running a populist campaign \u2013 the people against the old elites \u2013 but without the usual populist tactic of sowing anger and division. Instead, he made vague talk of unification, fighting corruption and ending the war, with few specifics.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"0e4646699dfd10d9f2eb99618032b1cfa9ee6c8a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0e4646699dfd10d9f2eb99618032b1cfa9ee6c8a/0_0_6720_4480/1000.jpg\" alt=\"(FromL) Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, French President Emmanuel Macron and Russian President Vladimir Putin give a press conference after a summit on Ukraine at the Elysee Palace, in Paris, on December 9, 2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">With Angela Merkel, Emmanuel Macron and Vladimir Putin in Paris in December.

It wasn\u2019t intended as a serious offer, but with nothing to lose, Poroshenko said yes, gamely showing up for blood and urine tests the day before. The debate was loud, confusing and largely senseless \u2013 which was how Zelenskiy wanted it. In the stadium, both candidates came across badly, bellowing into microphones; but on television, where it really mattered, Zelenskiy was the clear winner.</p> <p>The election was an easy win, too. He came first in almost every region \u2013 something new for a country that has long been divided on regional and linguistic lines. In the minutes after his crushing victory was announced, Zelenskiy strode on to the stage at his campaign headquarters accompanied by the lilting theme tune of Servant Of The People. Nobody quite knew what a Zelenskiy presidency would look like, including the people who had voted for him. But after a two-decade cycle of revolution and disappointment, he had won, not despite his lack of experience but because of it. He called parliamentary elections soon after, announcing that his newly formed party (named the Servant Of The People Party, naturally) would nominate a varied field of candidates, most without political experience.

They are the bureaucrats who know where to scurry to, what to do, whom to bring the papers to.\u201d </p> <p>To manage these bureaucrats, Zelenskiy has enlisted some old friends. <a href=\"https://www.kyivpost.com/ukraine-politics/who-is-zelenskys-chief-negotiator-andriy-yermak.html?cn-reloaded=1\" title=\"\">Andriy Yermak</a>, the man he entrusted with US negotiations last summer and recently made his chief of staff, is a former copyright lawyer. Serhiy Shefir, another presidential aide, is a co-founder of Zelenskiy\u2019s production studio. A childhood friend, Ivan Bakanov, has been made head of the secret services. While Zelenskiy\u2019s inner circle do not seem to be seeking personal enrichment, there are legitimate concerns about whether his friends are the best qualified people to run the country.</p> <p>Alongside these old friends, Zelenskiy put together a cabinet composed largely of well-regarded reformers, and the general feeling in the international community was that his team was doing surprisingly well, against the odds. However, earlier this week, a few days after our interview, he fired most of the government, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/04/ukrainian-president-removes-pm-government-reshuffle-volodymyr-zelenskiy\">including the 35-year-old prime minister (and also the still-quarantined health minister)</a>. The chief prosecutor, seen as a reformer, was also dismissed by parliament. The move, which Zelenskiy gave no hint was coming during the interview, has been interpreted as a blow for genuine reform efforts.</p> <p>Zelenskiy claimed to us that because he and his circle are demonstrably not on the take, it has become more difficult for anyone else to take a bribe. \u201cThe president can\u2019t change the country on his own. But what can he do? He can give an example.\u201d</p> <p>While Zelenskiy appears to be enjoying himself, he admits the political spotlight has been unwelcome for his family. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult,\u201d he says. \u201cThey don\u2019t like my work.\u201d Going out for a meal has to be cleared with security; taking a nice holiday looks insensitive when his country is at war.</p> <p>His wife, Olena, is a former writer for Kvartal 95 who, like Zelenskiy, grew up in Kryvyi Rih. He says that while he is used to being in the public eye, she prefers to stay out of the limelight. His 16-year-old daughter is the most irritated by his new job, bristling against the security detail that now follows her everywhere. They try to hide, but she always spots them, her father says. \u201cShe\u2019s at that age when a person is usually most free,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s unpleasant for her on a human level.\u201d On the other hand, his seven-year-old son is loving it, proudly announcing to anyone who will listen that his father is the president. \u201cI came home the other day and I said, \u2018Why is nobody saying hello to me?\u2019 And I can hear my own voice on the television. It was my speech. And my son says, \u2018Don\u2019t disturb us, we\u2019re watching the president!\u2019\u201d</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Before Trump hijacked the script, the main villain to Zelenskiy\u2019s hero was meant to be Putin, who annexed Crimea in 2014 and sent money, men and weapons to fuel a war that has killed 14,000 people so far, many of them civilians. Large-scale fighting was halted in 2015, but regular shelling and fatalities on the frontline have been a way of life ever since. Peace could be achieved, Zelenskiy told voters, only if Kyiv began direct negotiations with the Kremlin. This was a radical departure from Poroshenko\u2019s approach and proved popular with a nation suffering from war fatigue \u2013 though a loud minority accused Zelenskiy of capitulating to Russia by even proposing talks. But he says he values saving lives over counting territorial gains. \u201cWho is this all being done for? For people. What\u2019s the point of returning our territory if a million people die?\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I do not try to play a role. I feel good being myself and saying what I think. And in this, Trump really was an example</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Putin and Zelenskiy met face to face for the first time in December, at a summit in Paris, alongside <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/emmanuel-macron\" title=\"\">Emmanuel Macron</a> and Angela Merkel. They mainly stuck to the technical details of a long-ignored peace treaty, but \u201cthere were a few emotional parts\u201d, Zelenskiy recalls: when Putin complained about radical Ukrainian nationalists, he fired back that Russia has radicals, too. Was he able to get through to Putin? \u201cI think he listened to me. I had that feeling. I hope it\u2019s not a false feeling.\u201d The talks produced modest results: prisoner exchanges, an agreement to disengage military forces, and a ceasefire that has not held, with one soldier killed and several injured in a deadly flare-up in recent weeks.</p> <p>It seems unlikely that Putin will agree to any peace deal remotely acceptable to Ukrainian public opinion, but Zelenskiy says he wants to move fast. \u201cTime is ticking,\u201d he says, pointing at his watch and announcing a timeframe of a year in which to solve the conflict, so he can focus on other domestic issues. \u201cThe government can spend one year on the entire agreement. Then it should be implemented. Any longer is prohibited. If it lasts longer, we need to change the format and choose another strategy,\u201d he says. It\u2019s a dramatic new deadline, but his urgency is undercut by a lack of detail. (At times like this, Zelenskiy sounds rather Trumpian.) He declines to say what the fallback strategy might be, and when his press secretary jumps in to clarify that the one-year deadline dates from the December summit, rather than the start of his presidency in May, he replies with a laugh: \u201cI don\u2019t know any more.\u201d Thinking on the fly, as he often appears to, he buys himself the extra months: yes, it starts from the summit.</p> <p>Zelenskiy\u2019s aides present this kind of improvisation as part of his charm. In meetings with foreign dignitaries, they say, he will read the room and, if he feels he can succeed with a more emotional pitch, discard official briefing notes. And perhaps this might work with Merkel, for one, who reportedly watched clips from Servant Of The People before meeting Zelenskiy.</p> <p>Convincing Merkel and others of Ukraine\u2019s desire for closer integration into Europe is vital, he says. \u201cWe need to give people confidence that the European Union is waiting for Ukraine,\u201d he says. If it takes 20 years, his electorate will lose hope. \u201cPeople don\u2019t really believe in words. Or rather, people believe in words only for a stretch of time. Then they start to look for action.\u201d Merkel gets it, he thinks; he also claims to have developed a warm personal relationship with Macron, though he is wary of the French president\u2019s recent references to the need for warmer relations with Moscow.</p> <p>Watching Brexit unfold from Kyiv has been a strange experience, he says \u2013 seeing a country rush to exit the EU when Ukraine is so keen to join. \u201cIt\u2019s like having a group of people around a table spending a nice evening together. If someone doesn\u2019t want to sit at the table, he\u2019ll definitely ruin the party,\u201d he says, warming to his metaphor. \u201cAnd then there are people standing outside the door, ringing the doorbell, knocking, and they\u2019re told through the peephole: \u2018Yes, you\u2019re welcome to join but come back next time!\u2019 And they\u2019re still outside knocking when the party is over.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f1cc730dc2ae9d0698804ee6d8d584405b088368\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f1cc730dc2ae9d0698804ee6d8d584405b088368/388_203_2602_2214/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky casts his ballot next to his wife Olena (L) at a polling station in Kiev, Ukraine, on July 21, 2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"851\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">With his wife Olena, voting in last July\u2019s parliamentary elections.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Xinhua News Agency/Eyevine</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He revels in these colourful comparisons, which sometimes take him in the wrong direction. He likens his presidency to being on a boat: \u201cThere are holes everywhere, and with your arms and legs, you are trying to close them up. This is how we\u2019re living. We are closing the holes.\u201d When told it sounds like a sinking ship, Zelenskiy looks alarmed, and adds: \u201cBut we\u2019re not sinking!\u201d</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>When he came to power, western diplomats worried Zelenskiy might be a proxy for Ihor Kolomoisky, a controversial billionaire whose television channel aired his show. Kolomoisky is one of a group of oligarchs who made vast fortunes in the transition from communism, while most Ukrainians remained poor. In recent years, they have rebranded themselves as generous philanthropists, while retaining an outsized influence on the political scene, and are far more deserving of the \u201coligarch\u201d title than their counterparts in Russia, long since neutered by Putin.</p> <p>\u201cI want them to have walk-on parts, not leading roles,\u201d Zelenskiy says. Kolomoisky receives no special treatment, he insists, despite their long acquaintance. He dismisses as \u201cinappropriate\u201d <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0af836dc-4108-11ea-bdb5-169ba7be433d\" title=\"\">the recent purchase</a> of a 14-bedroom mansion on the French Riviera for \u20ac200m (\u00a3170m) by Rinat Akhmetov, a businessman whose apartment at One Hyde Park was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/apr/19/rinat-akhmetov-one-hyde-park\" title=\"\">the most expensive property ever purchased</a> in the UK when he bought it in 2011, at \u00a3136m.</p> <p>Many in Kyiv see Zelenskiy\u2019s government reshuffle this week as a sign that the old oligarchic players are reasserting their influence, despite his public claims that it was about speeding up reform. It\u2019s certainly true that Ukraine\u2019s oligarchs continue to wield tremendous power, and Zelenskiy won\u2019t be rid of their machinations simply by asking nicely. His TV president might have ordered them hanged or shot for such lavish expenditure abroad during a time of war, but the real Zelenskiy will have to work with them, asking them to invest at home and fund state projects when asked.</p> <p>\u201cIf we\u2019ve chosen democracy, of course we can\u2019t hang people,\u201d he says, but a twinkle appears in his eyes. \u201cAlthough! Sometimes you really want to. And do you know why? Because it would be quicker. Much quicker,\u201d he says, delivering the line with a comic\u2019s timing.</p> <p>\u201cWe are joking,\u201d says his press secretary, looking somewhat concerned, from the other side of the table.</p> <p>\u201cOf course we\u2019re joking,\u201d Zelenskiy says.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>In their ill-fated phone call, Zelenskiy thanked Trump for providing him with a model of electoral success. \u201cWe used quite a few of your skills\u2026 we wanted to drain the swamp here in my country,\u201d he says. Is that true, or was he simply following advice that the US president responds well to flattery? He sighs and answers carefully. What Trump showed him, he says, was how an outsider can win without having to adapt to the supposed rules of the game. \u201cI do not try to play a role. I feel good being myself and saying what I think. And in this, he really was an example \u2013 of how you can win without using the standard format.\u201d</p> <p>Zelenskiy thinks the era of the political outsider is just starting and his own campaign model could succeed elsewhere. \u201cI am certain it could, especially where people are tired, where they are running like squirrels<strong> </strong>on a wheel, and there are these long-standing politicians with big financial resources. In these places, where people are searching for a breath of fresh air, it should work.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/10/ukraine-president-volodymyr-zelenskiy-press-conference-donald-trump\">Ask me anything: Ukraine's president holds 14-hour press conference</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It sounds like a clear allusion to Ukraine\u2019s neighbour to the east, and its indefatigable leader. Indeed, on the night of his election, Zelenskiy said he wanted his victory to be an example to the entire post-Soviet region, dominated by autocrats. His success has not gone unnoticed inside Russia, and many have made favourable comparisons with the man in the Kremlin: Zelenskiy walking to his inauguration, high-fiving members of the crowd, versus a lonely Putin in his limousine, gliding through the emptied streets of Moscow to his own ceremony. Zelenskiy\u2019s chummy, upbeat new year message to the nation, versus Putin\u2019s staid television address. A Russian channel recently started to broadcast Servant Of The People, but quickly reversed the decision, presumably fearing its message was too subversive.</p> <p>Zelenskiy did not, in the end, bring down Trump, and he may well not succeed in his plans to remodel Ukraine. Could Zelenskiy\u2019s legacy turn out to be piercing Putin\u2019s aura of infallibility? \u201cOf course a new president will appear there. Of course it will happen.

At a <a href=\"https://commongroundcommittee.org/event/facts-fake-news-the-media/\">Common Ground Committee forum</a> at Columbia Journalism School in New York recently, Wallace was repeatedly challenged about sharing a channel with prime-time opinion hosts such as Sean Hannity.

He hopes that his focus on policies appealing to working-class Americans, such as a federal $15 minimum wage, will play well not only in that state but across the rust belt in Illinois and Ohio, which hold their primaries on 17 March.</p> <p>\u201cMichigan is an enormously important state,\u201d Sanders said in a post-Super Tuesday press briefing in his home town of Burlington, Vermont. \u201cThe people of Michigan were devastated by trade agreements which I vigorously opposed and Joe Biden supported.\u201d</p> <p>No matter how much of a bounce he enjoys in Michigan, Sanders faces threats as the race enters its next punishing phase. In particular, the Super Tuesday results exposed a fundamental failure to expand the Democratic base by bringing in millions of new voters.</p> <p>Sanders was in a reflective mood after the Super Tuesday result. \u201cIt is not easy trying to bring in people who have not been involved in the political process,\u201d he said. \u201cHave we been as successful as I would hope in bringing young people in? The answer is no.\u201d</p> <p>John Della Volpe, the director of polling at the Harvard Kennedy School\u2019s institute of politics, whose researchers has been studying the youth vote since 2000, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dellavolpe/status/1235320286314102784\">reviewed exit polls</a> from 12 of the most competitive elections. While turnout overall was up in all of the 12 states compared with 2016, the pattern for young people aged 18 to 29 \u2013 the very core of the Sanders revolutionary army \u2013 told a different story.</p> <p>In four of the states youth turnout increased, handsomely in the cases of Iowa (36%) and Virginia (38%). But in two states youth turnout was flat, and in six states it actually declined, as much as 18% in New Hampshire and 20% in Texas.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"d788fd42a1a80966570d02b911d261de09267104\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d788fd42a1a80966570d02b911d261de09267104/0_0_4048_2716/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sanders rallygoers in Phoenix on Thursday night.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"671\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sanders rallygoers in Phoenix on Thursday night.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Laura Segall/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>By contrast, voter turnout for older voters who tend to favor Biden increased in all but one of the 12 states. In South Carolina, where Biden\u2019s campaign was rocket-launched with a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/feb/29/south-carolina-primary-voters-joe-biden-bernie-sanders\">landslide</a> victory last Saturday, the projected turnout of voters aged 65 and older increased 124% \u2013 the very surge that Sanders had dreamt about for younger voters yet failed to deliver.</p> <p>\u201cFor any candidate to be the nominee of the Democratic party they have to build a broad and diverse coalition across gender, race, age and educational levels,\u201d Della Volpe told the Guardian. \u201cIt\u2019s terrific that Bernie Sanders is building such a great relationship with young voters, but he needs to maximise that support and then expand beyond it, and that\u2019s not what we are seeing.\u201d</p> <p>Sanders partially blamed his difficulties in mobilising a wider coalition of support on his enemies in the \u201ccorporate media\u201d and \u201cestablishment politics\u201d. As he told <a href=\"https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow/watch/sanders-insists-emphasis-on-progressive-issues-will-grow-democratic-base-80037957812\">Rachel Maddow on MSNBC</a>: \u201cOne of the problems we have is that people say, \u2018Bernie is an extremist\u2019. There is nothing we are fighting for which is extreme. It is what the American people want.\u201d</p> <p>But there is danger for Sanders here too. By doubling down on his attacks on the media and the \u201cDemocratic establishment\u201d he risks reinforcing the stereotype of himself as a grievance-ridden politician promoted by that same media and Democratic establishment.</p> <p>\u201cThat rhetoric, in my view, signals to voters that he\u2019s a factional candidate,\u201d said Mark Longabaugh, a Democratic strategist who advised Sanders in 2016 but is unaligned in 2020. He said such critiques distract from his core economic message, which remains popular with Democrats and independent voters alike.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s Bernie Sanders on message and Bernie Sanders off message,\u201d Longabaugh said. \u201cOne can win and the other is going to stay at 25%.\u201d</p> <p>Behind the scenes, there are indications that the Sanders camp are attempting to address the candidate\u2019s weakness in the two demographic groups that have flocked to Biden \u2013 older voters and African Americans. Sanders\u2019 campaign co-chair, Ro Khanna, told <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/04/bernie-sanders-joe-biden-2020-election-121582\">Politico</a> it would be emphasising healthcare issues for seniors as one way to focus in on the high-voting over 65s.</p> <p>With black voters, the latest Sanders advert to be broadcast in Florida raised eyebrows as it consists of a series of clips of Barack Obama praising him as a politician of \u201cgreat authenticity, great passion\u201d. For Sanders to look to Obama to rescue his fortunes has an air of desperation, given that Biden\u2019s overwhelming popularity among African Americans is largely due to his role as Obama\u2019s vice-president.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Sometimes the safest choice is also the riskiest choice. John Kerry, Hillary Clinton and Al Gore were all safe choices</p> <footer> <cite>Rebecca Katz</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But then, the figures do look desperate. Exit polls from Super Tuesday showed Biden trouncing Sanders with black voters by <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/politics/exit-polls-2020-super-tuesday-primary/#RACE\">41 percentage points</a>. In Alabama that disparity rose to 63 points.</p> <p>Biden built his firewall with black voters in South Carolina based on the <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/02/26/politics/jim-clyburn-endorses-joe-biden/index.html\">endorsement</a> of the influential congressman Jim Clyburn. Sanders\u2019 defeat there was compounded with the <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/majority-whip-jim-clyburn-sanders-never-courted-my-endorsement\">embarrassing disclosure</a> that he hadn\u2019t even asked Clyburn to back him.</p> <p>There is hope in inroads made with Latino voters, which helped Sanders clinch California, the biggest delegate prize of any state.

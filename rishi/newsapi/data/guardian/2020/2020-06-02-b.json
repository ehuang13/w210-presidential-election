  "<p>Civil rights leaders have criticised Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s decision to take no action against a Facebook post from Donald Trump appearing to threaten to start shooting \u201clooters\u201d, after a Monday night meeting with the company\u2019s executives ended in acrimony.</p> <p>\u201cWe are disappointed and stunned by Mark\u2019s incomprehensible explanations for allowing the Trump posts to remain up,\u201d Vanita Gupta, Sherrilyn Ifill and Rashad Robison said in a statement.</p> <p>\u201cHe did not demonstrate understanding of historic or modern-day voter suppression and he refuses to acknowledge how Facebook is facilitating Trump\u2019s call for violence against protesters.</p> <p>\u201cMark is setting a very dangerous precedent for other voices who would say similar harmful things on Facebook.\u201d</p> <p>The three activist leaders \u2013 the heads of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, and Color of Change \u2013 met Zuckerberg, the CEO of Facebook, and its chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, on Monday night. They discussed Trump\u2019s Thursday night post, which urged the military to intervene in Minneapolis with the words \u201cwhen the looting starts, the shooting starts\u201d.</p> <p>The message, originally sent by Trump as a tweet before being cross-posted to Facebook, was restricted on Twitter after the platform decided it broke rules about glorifying violence. On Facebook, Zuckerberg&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/may/29/facebook-trump-twitter-social-media-us?CMP=Share_iOSApp_Other\">personally intervened to leave the message up</a>, arguing that the company has a policy to allow warnings of the use of force by state actors.</p> <p>Zuckerberg\u2019s decision led to a \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/jun/01/facebook-workers-rebel-mark-zuckerberg-donald-trump\">virtual walkout</a>\u201c of Facebook staff on Monday, with hundreds of employees downing tools in protest. A number of Facebook employees publicly expressed their dissent on rival social networks such as Twitter, and were quickly supported by senior managers at the company.</p> <p>At least one employee has quit over the decision. Timothy J Aveni, a software engineer who worked on misinformation, said on <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/timothy.j.aveni/posts/3006224359465567\">Facebook</a> that he had resigned on Monday. \u201cMark told us that he would draw the line at speech that calls for violence,\u201d Aveni wrote. \u201cHe showed us on Friday that was a lie ... Facebook, complicit in the propagation of weaponized hatred, is on the wrong side of history.\u201d</p> <p>A Facebook spokesperson told the Guardian: \u201cWe recognise the pain many of our people are feeling right now, especially our black community. We encourage employees to speak openly when they disagree with leadership.\u201d </p> <p>The company would not require walkout participants to take paid time off, Facebook said.&nbsp;</p> <p>On Monday night, fresh detail about those internal discussions emerged, after&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/interface/2020/6/1/21276969/facebook-walkout-mark-zuckerberg-audio-trump-disgust-twitter\">the Verge obtained recordings</a>&nbsp;of Zuckerberg speaking at an internal meeting on Friday night.</p> <p>\u201cHow to handle this post from the president has been very tough,\u201d said Zuckerberg. \u201cIt\u2019s been something that I\u2019ve been struggling with basically all day, ever since I woke up \u2026 This has been personally pretty wrenching for me.</p> <p>\u201cMy first reaction [to Trump\u2019s post] was just disgust,\u201d he added. \u201cThis is not how I think we want our leaders to show up during this time. This is a moment that calls for unity and calmness and empathy for people who are struggling.\u201d</p> <p>Zuckerberg also told employees Facebook would review the policies that allowed Trump\u2019s post to stay up. \u201cThere is a real question coming out of this, which is whether we want to evolve our policy around the discussion of state use of force. Over the coming days, as the National Guard is now deployed, probably the largest one that I would worry about would be excessive use of police or military force. I think there\u2019s a good argument that there should be more bounds around the discussion around that.\u201d</p> <p>The Facebook walkout was followed by sanctioned events at other technology companies. A number of YouTube executives, including the company\u2019s chief business officer and its global head of music, told their teams they could take Tuesday off to participate in the protests,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theinformation.com/articles/youtube-execs-encourage-staff-to-take-tuesday-off-for-nationwide-protests\">according to </a><a href=\"https://www.theinformation.com/articles/youtube-execs-encourage-staff-to-take-tuesday-off-for-nationwide-protests\">the Information</a>.</p> <p>On Tuesday morning,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://newsroom.spotify.com/2020-06-01/spotify-stands-with-the-black-community-in-the-fight-against-racism-and-injustice/\">Spotify followed suit</a>, encouraging employees to join the day of action \u201cby taking time to reflect and educate themselves\u201d.</p> <p>The decision on whether to allow Trump\u2019s posts to remain on Facebook could be one of the final major calls made solely by Zuckerberg. The company recently confirmed the creation of an independent Oversight Board of academics, politicians and former journalists from around the world who will act as as a \u201csupreme court\u201d deciding what content should be allowed on Facebook, while providing guidance on policy.</p> <p>Members of the Oversight Board met on Tuesday afternoon and discussed the issue but the organisation is reluctant to start wading in to debates before it is up-and-running. It is due to be fully functional by the autumn - towards the end of the current US presidential election campaign.</p> <p>Members declined to give any detail what was discussed on&nbsp;Tuesday, although a spokesperson for the Oversight Board suggested Trump\u2019s posts are the sort of issue they will rule on in the future: \u201cThere are many significant issues relating to online content that we recognise people want the board to consider. We\u2019re working hard to set the board up to begin operating later this year so it can start considering cases referred by users and Facebook. We will make decisions without regard to Facebook\u2019s economic, political or reputational interests, in a fair, transparent and politically neutral manner.\u201d</p> <p>Twitter\u2019s decision to restrict the Trump tweet \u2013 which was followed by a Trump executive order aimed at reducing the platform\u2019s protections against civil claims \u2013 won the backing of the European commission.</p> <p>The EU executive branch\u2019s vice-president, V\u011bra Jourov\u00e1, said in her response to the dispute that politicians should answer \u201ccriticism with facts, not with threats and attacks\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cI support Twitter in their efforts to develop and implement a transparent, clear and consistent moderation policy,\u201d Jourov\u00e1 said. \u201cThis is not about censorship. This is about flagging verifiably false or misleading information that may cause public harm, linking to reliable information, or flagging content violating their policies.\u201d</p> <p><em>Additional reporting by Daniel Boffey in Brussels</em></p>",
  "<p>This might actually be the year the Iowa Republican congressman Steve King loses re-election.</p> <p>King, the conservative congressman who has been repeatedly reprimanded by leaders in his own party for racist rhetoric and interactions with white nationalists, finds himself in a nightmare situation for an incumbent congressman.</p> <p>King has been stripped of his committee assignments, including his seat on the coveted House agriculture committee. He has been abandoned by more mainstream Republicans and chastised by party leadership. His war chest for his re-election fight is meager.</p> <p>Most ominous for King, even prominent conservatives in Iowa have abandoned him.</p> <p>But the picture is complex. David Kochel, a veteran Republican strategist, said King\u2019s long history of outrageous rhetoric is not what has driven some Republicans away from him, it\u2019s that he is essentially ineffective without committee assignments.</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s rendered himself useless to the voters and the constituents and I think that\u2019s why he\u2019s at risk of losing his seat tomorrow,\u201d Kochel said.</p> <p>For years King was a major source of headaches for party leadership. He has tied immigrant children to being drug mules, questioned if minorities had contributed anything valuable to western civilization and displayed a Confederate flag on his desk. He has questioned why it\u2019s offensive to be called a white nationalist. He has also associated with far-right figures like the Dutch politician Geert Wilders. King also once argued to a far-right Austrian publication about a conspiracy theory that elites are trying to reduce the white population and increase minorities.</p> <p>Even the Republican Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, has suggested that King seek other careers.</p> <p>That would be enough for most politicians to leave Congress or be kicked out but in most of his re-election fights King has won by double-digit margins. Though that margin sank in 2018 when King beat Democrat JD Scholten by a slim five-percentage-point margin.</p> <p>This time he is facing four other Republicans for the nomination and then a rematch against Scholten in the general election. The influential US Chamber of Commerce is actively working to oust King as well although its officials concede the race is more of an uphill battle than other races it is prioritizing.</p> <p>Chamber officials see King\u2019s nomination as potentially dangerous to the Iowa senator Joni Ernst\u2019s re-election chances.</p> <p>\u201cThe main reason we got into the race was our concern of how a King candidacy could negatively impact Joni Ernst\u2019s re-election,\u201d said Scott Reed, the Chamber\u2019s chief strategist. </p> <p>King has a meager war chest while his opponents have proven to be deft fundraisers. Scholten has raised over $1m and spent about half of his total haul while Randy Feenstra, the preferred Republican candidate of the Chamber and establishment Republicans, has raised about $1m. King has raised about $300,000.</p> <p>King has not spent any money on advertising while Feenstra has spent about a quarter of a million dollars and the Chamber has spent $200,000, according to figures obtained by the Guardian. </p> <p>In the past, King has counted on the conservative leaning of his district and prominent figures in the state\u2019s social conservative circles, like Bob Vander Plaats, the social conservative activist and leader of the FAMiLY Leader group. Like the Chamber, Vander Plaats has cut advertising to boost Feenstra. Donald Trump has also been silent on the race, meaning Trump supporters who lean to candidates with anti-immigrant messaging are not as inclined to support King.</p> <p>Kochel said Trump\u2019s refusal to endorse King even though he endorsed other Republicans in Iowa is \u201cpretty telling\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cI think it says a lot that he\u2019s become a pariah inside the party,\u201d Kochel said.</p> <p>A recent Feenstra ad said that King \u201clost his committee assignments in Congress and embarrassed Iowa\u201d. The narrator in that ad went on to say Trump didn\u2019t trust King or let him fly on Air Force One.</p> <p>\u201cHe almost got beat last time. So far hardcore Republicans, you run the risk of losing that seat, far and away the most Republican seat in the state, obviously there\u2019s something wrong with you. So that really triggered a re-evaluation among base voters,\u201d said Doug Gross, a former chief of staff to Iowa\u2019s governor, Terry Branstad.</p> <p>The district is hardly a shoo-in for Democrats. In the last five presidential elections, Iowa\u2019s 4th congressional district went for the Democratic nominee only once \u2013 in 2008 for Barack Obama. Political strategists see Democrats\u2019 best chances of winning the seat if King wins the nomination. If he loses and a candidate like Feenstra wins it\u2019s much harder.</p> <p>King could still eke out a win through the divided primary.</p> <p>\u201cI think it could go either way on Tuesday,\u201d said the Iowa-based Democratic strategist Jesse Harris. \u201cIf he ends up pulling this out I\u2019m not going to be entirely surprised. This is not only one of the more conservative districts in Iowa but also one of the more conservative districts in the country.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>When Mexican news anchor Carmen Aristegui was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/mar/20/mexican-journalist-carmen-aristegui-mvs-radio-president-enrique-pena-nieto\">fired from a popular radio show </a>after revealing a presidential scandal on air, it sparked an outpouring of anger and protests.</p> <p>For millions of listeners Aristegui is a trusted voice cutting through government spin and corruption, and her absence left a void.</p> <p>Now a <a href=\"https://ff.hrw.org/film/radio-silence?city=London\">new documentary</a> charts the journey she made to overcome censorship and form a <a href=\"https://aristeguinoticias.com/\">new independent news platform</a> with a group of colleagues.</p> <p>In Radio Silence, filmmaker Juliana Fanjul follows Aristegui over the 22 months it took her to get back on air while continuing her investigative work amid a slew of lawsuits, death threats and the murder of another <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/may/16/crusading-mexican-journalist-javier-valdez-shot-dead-in-sinaloa\">prominent journalist</a>.</p> <p>Aristegui\u2019s sacking in 2015 occurred against a backdrop of violence gripping Mexico and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/20/mexico-43-killed-students-\">disappearance of 43 students from the state of Guerrero</a>, explains Fanjul.</p> <p>\u201cWe were really concerned as a society to try and understand what was going on and her voice was very important. She was the first one to bring the families of those students on to the air and give them a voice.\u201d</p> <p>Aristegui was fired by her employer, the privately owned MVS Radio, over her demands that the company reinstate two colleagues who had been independently reporting on a scandal involving the then president, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/enrique-pena-nieto\">Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto</a>, and his wife, and an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/nov/10/mexico-president-enrique-pena-nieto-mansion-explain\">opulent villa to be built by a Mexican consortium</a> in exchange for a railway contract.</p> <p>The project involved Chinese capital and, in the face of what was called the Casa Blanca or White House scandal, Pe\u00f1a Nieto was forced to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/18/mexico-president-apologizes-luxury-home-contractor\">cancel the contract and apologise to the Chinese government</a>. When Aristegui was sacked, thousands of people gathered outside the radio station to protest.</p> <p>Fanjul used to listen to Aristegui\u2019s programme to keep abreast of developments in her native Mexico from her home in Switzerland. \u201cWhen the mic was cut I was filled with rage,\u201d she says. \u201cJournalists were being killed and I thought if they are doing this to Carmen who is so well-known, things are really bad.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI thought instead of being anguished I should make a film and I went to Mexico to find her.\u201d</p> <p>Fanjul spent four years filming Aristegui, providing a rare insight into the woman whose name has become synonymous with press freedom in Mexico.</p> <p>Her news programme had been a ratings hit. Yet no radio station offered her a job following her dismissal, such was the extent of government censorship. Instead, she set up on her own, and with the help of social media, continued to expose corruption.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f8fba32fb56d0f1a77ed5c48457fce3a000b74db\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f8fba32fb56d0f1a77ed5c48457fce3a000b74db/60_0_1800_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Carmen Aristegui is shown in a still from Radio Silence, which is airing at the Human Rights Film Festival.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Carmen Aristegui is shown in a still from Radio Silence, which is airing at the Human Rights Film Festival.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Philippe Coeytaux/Handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Her investigations continued to make headlines around the world including her report headlined \u201cFrom Plagiarist to President\u201d, which alleged that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/22/mexico-president-enrique-pena-nieto-plagiarized-thesis-law-degree\">Pe\u00f1a Nieto had plagiarised almost a third of his law degree thesis</a>. Only one Mexican newspaper ran the story.</p> <p>It led to an increasingly hostile climate for Aristegui and her colleagues. One explains: \u201cWorking with Carmen Aristegui entails being constantly under surveillance \u2026 under fire \u2026 by journalists who are pro-government or close to power.\u201d Another reveals: \u201cI imagined they were going to make me disappear.\u201d</p> <p>Through behind-the-scenes footage at her office, Aristegui is portrayed as a passionate workaholic, fiercely determined, but with a warmth and generosity towards her colleagues. She has an impressive 8.6 million Twitter followers but Fanjul says her private life is strictly guarded.</p> <p>\u201cBecause of who she is, it is hard for her to trust people,\u201d explains Fanjul. \u201cIt took a long time for her to let me in.\u201d</p> <p>When the filmmaker got rare access to her home, Aristegui described how her teenage son had become a target of government surveillance.</p> <p>\u201cThe repression and scheming that took place to kick us off air, and later the constant legal attacks, led me to believe that it was much better for Emilio to leave Mexico, in a context in which his mum was publicly exposed to a scandal, where you never really know how it\u2019s going to end.\u201d</p> <p>She says they were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jun/19/mexico-cellphone-software-spying-journalists-activists\">targeted by Pegasus spyware</a>. \u201cWhoever was behind the Pegasus attacks on a young teen\u2019s iPhone, who was studying in the United States, displays a great degree of perversity,\u201d she says. \u201cBecause it was clearly his mum they wanted to hurt.\u201d</p> <p>After a break-in at her office, chilling CCTV footage shows men opening drawers and stealing a computer. It contained sensitive information about a powerful politician that Aristegui had previously implicated in a prostitution ring.</p> <p>\u201cAfter the office was broken into, more than one journalist resigned. Paradoxically, each obstacle that appeared in Carmen\u2019s way only strengthened her determination,\u201d says Fanjul.</p> <p>By 16 January 2017, Aristegui was back on air \u2013 on the internet from a sound-proofed booth in her small office.</p> <p>The 2018 election saw the formation of a new government, and Aristegui received an offer from media company Grupo Radio Centro.</p> <p>\u201cIt confirms the pressure was coming from the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/22/mexico-president-enrique-pena-nieto-plagiarized-thesis-law-degree\">Pe\u00f1a </a>administration to keep her off air,\u201d says Fanjul.</p> <p>Her newscast is now broadcast across several radio stations but she retains editorial autonomy. Her investigations continue to make waves, including allegations of corruption in the government\u2019s national news agency.</p> <p>\u201cWe wished things would change with the new government but now it is attacking her and there are smear campaigns,\u201d Fanjul tells the Guardian. \u201cOnce more she has become the enemy.\u201d</p> <p><em>Radio Silence is streaming as part of the digital edition of the <a href=\"https://ff.hrw.org/london-digital-edition\">Human Rights Watch Film Festival</a>, and is <a href=\"https://ff.hrw.org/film/radio-silence?city=London%20Digital%20Edition\">available to watch</a> in the UK and Ireland until 5 June.</em></p>",

  "<p>Donald Trump has sown fresh confusion about the US government\u2019s response to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">coronavirus</a> pandemic by claiming that a therapeutic drug will be available \u201calmost immediately\u201d \u2013 only to be contradicted by officials.</p> \n<p>In the latest measure to combat the spread of the virus, the State Department on Thursday issued a new alert urging Americans not to travel abroad under any circumstances and to return home if they are already abroad unless they plan to remain overseas</p> \n<p>The global level four warning was unprecedented as such alerts are generally reserved for specific countries embroiled in conflict, natural disasters or where Americans face specific risks.</p> \n<p>But the significant move came shortly after a worryingly rambling performance at Thursday\u2019s White House press conference, the president asserted that chloroquine, used to combat malaria, had been approved and would be made available by prescription.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/19/medical-workers-self-isolate-home-fears-coronavirus\">Medical workers self-isolate amid fears of bringing coronavirus home</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>\u201cThey\u2019re doing great with the vaccines but there\u2019s still a long process, but the therapies are something we can move on much faster potentially,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cAnd the treatments that will be able to reduce the severity or duration of the symptoms \u2013 make people better.</p> \n<p>\u201cChloroquine, or hydroxychloroquine, this is a common malaria drug. It\u2019s also a drug used for strong arthritis \u2026 It\u2019s been around for a long time, so we know if things don\u2019t go as planned it\u2019s not going to kill anybody \u2026 It\u2019s shown very, very encouraging early results, and we\u2019re going to be able to make that drug available almost immediately.\u201d</p> \n<p>But minutes later, Stephen Hahn, the commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, cautioned that in fact chloroquine has not been approved for use against the coronavirus and must still be tested for its effectiveness and safety.</p> \n<p>Chloroquine \u201cis already approved, as the president said, for the treatment of malaria as well as arthritis condition\u201d, Hahn pointed out. \u201cThat\u2019s a drug that the president has directed us to take a closer look at as to whether an expanded use approach to that could be done to actually see if that benefits patients.</p> \n<p>\u201cAnd again, we want to do that in a setting of a clinical trial, a large pragmatic clinical trial to actually gather that information and answer that question that needs to be asked and answered.\u201d</p> \n<p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported on Thursday 10,491 cases of coronavirus, an increase of 3,404 from its previous count. The death toll rose by 53 to 150, it said, the biggest one-day jump so far.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/interactive-coronavirus-live/totals\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The Trump administration has been widely condemned for its sluggish response, particularly to testing kits and medical equipment. Mike Pence told the briefing, without providing data: \u201cTens of thousands of tests are being performed every day.\u201d Earlier this month, the CDC <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/18/coronavirus-testing-us-q-and-a-availability-shortage\">said around 2,500 tests were being performed daily</a>.</p> \n<p>The vice-president also claimed that companies have hugely increased their production of protective industrial masks and many construction companies are donating their stocks to hospitals. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/19/medical-workers-self-isolate-home-fears-coronavirus\">Medical workers have decried the widespread lack of protective equipment.</a></p> \n<p>Trump, who built his political career on his ability to steward the economy, is now fighting to rescue it from a once in a generation catastrophe. Last week the number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits rose by 70,000.</p> \n<p>Trump <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/18/trump-signs-coronavirus-bill-free-testing-paid-leave\">signed an aid package</a>, which the Senate approved earlier on Wednesday, that will guarantee free testing, paid sick leave to workers who fall ill, family leave for caregivers and food assistance for those in need.</p> \n<p>Asked if he would support the federal government moving to take an equity stake in companies that need bailouts, Trump replied: \u201cI do. I really do.\u201d</p> \n<p>He added: \u201cWe will be helping the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/16/us-airline-industry-seeks-50-billion-bailout-amid-coronavirus-pandemic\">airline industry</a>. We will be helping the cruise ship industry. We probably will be helping the hotel industry \u2026 There\u2019s a lot of executive power. If we don\u2019t have to use it, that would be a good thing, not a bad thing.\u201d</p> \n<p>Trump also took a swipe at China, where the virus was first reported, musing: \u201cIf people would have known about it, could have been stopped in place, it could have been stopped where it came from, China.\u201d</p> \n<p>This prompted criticism from his presumptive rival in the presidential election, Democrat Joe Biden. His campaign said in statement: \u201cThe reality is, he did know about it and experts spent months trying to prompt Trump into action as he downplayed the growing threat of the virus and praised the Chinese government\u2019s bungled early response \u2013 at a time when Vice-President Biden warned him not to take their word about the disease.</p> \n<p>\u201cNow, as this crisis explodes on his watch, Trump is desperately lashing out to try to cover up his incompetence and mismanagement.\u201d</p> \n<p>In a series of bizarre riffs, Trump described social distancing as a \u201chot term\u201d now and chastised reporters for sitting too close together. He railed against the media for failing to give him credit for banning travel from China. \u201cI got a [coronavirus] test because you people were driving everybody crazy,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>Trump has been condemned for using the <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&amp;cx=007466294097402385199:m2ealvuxh1i&amp;q=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/10/republicans-face-backlash-racist-labeling-coronavirus-china-wuhan&amp;sa=U&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjGgcLfl6foAhULlXIEHRDZB-8QFjAAegQIAhAC&amp;usg=AOvVaw1T36USnyIsJFTePQNIMhkF\">xenophobic term</a> \u201cChinese virus\u201d. In a profoundly weird finale, a reporter from the pro-Trump One America News Network asked: \u201cMr President, do you consider the term \u2018Chinese food\u2019 to be racist because it is food that originated from China?\u201d</p> \n<p>He answered: \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s racist at all.\u201d</p> \n<p>Unusually, Trump is not thought to have made contact with the House speaker, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/nancy-pelosi\">Nancy Pelosi</a>, the architect of his impeachment last year. Instead he has delegated negotiations to the treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, who is said to have established a working relationship with Pelosi.</p> \n<p>On Thursday the Senate began work on a $1tn-plus package to stem the economic fallout of the pandemic. The majority leader, Mitch McConnell, said the bill would include direct financial assistance to Americans, lending to key industries including airlines and money for more medical equipment.</p> \n<p>\u201cThese are not ordinary policies. This is no ordinary time,\u201d McConnell said on the Senate floor. \u201cWe have to beat back this virus.\u201d</p>",

But in his latest update he pointed out that Greenland is still waiting for the test results from nine other patients to be analysed in Denmark which controls the island. Meanwhile, all schools in Greenland have been closed in line with Danish policy, he said. </p> \n  <p>Madsen added: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>All flights internally and to and from Greenland will be grounded for 14 days starting at midnight on Friday. The fact that local flights within Greenland will be grounded is rather significant because no two towns in Greenland are connected by road.

We have been told test results will take five to ten days. People have contacted the hospital, but for the most part they are still advising that testing is not necessary unless you have travelled. We do not know if the virus is here. I believe we have one person in self isolation who felt unwell after travelling from the UK, but again that has not officially been confirmed.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>The reader said there was also alarm on the Falklands about the limited hospital capacity if coronavirus does hit. They said: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>A key concern is the ability of the hospital to cope. In total the island\u2019s hospital has 29 beds, seven of which are used for long term care for the elderly already. There are two intensive care beds. Usually if anyone needs critical or specialist care they are flown out to South America or the UK, which is clearly not going to be an option with coronavirus cases. The government raised the possibility that even regular emergency cases might not be accepted by our partners countries if their health systems are already overwhelmed.</p> \n   <p>Many of our medical staff are here on short term contracts, recruited from the UK (or occasionally other countries, we have had several doctors from Canada lately) to work for for 3 to 6 months at a time. Falkland Islanders are concerned what will happen when contracts end and if we will be able to replace those who leave.</p> \n   <p>The other key concern has been tourists coming in. Cruise ship tourists regularly outnumbering the population during the peak season. The season is coming to an end, which should help reduce exposure, but as of today there are still several ships heading here that were reportedly turned away from Punta Arenas.</p> \n   <p>Falkland Islanders are strong, resilient people, but it does feel like the Falkland Island government has been caught unaware by the current outbreak. Updates are few and far between and the current policy to follow the UK\u2019s lead feels problematic given our geographic location and resources.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p><strong>Update</strong>: Madsen writes:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>A second person with Covid-19 in Nuuk has been confirmed. As of 16:00 this afternoon local time the shopping center \u201cNuuk Center\u201d will close, along with will bars, caf\u00e9s, restaurants and gyms. Establishments are allowed to offer take-away food. Grocery stores are allowed to remain open.</p> \n   <p>No one is allowed to leave Nuuk by any mode of transport (snow mobile, boat, plane, etc).

The tone was always going to serious and sombre given the nature of the crisis facing the country. (Every single question was about coronavirus, by my count.) But the effect of holding it in a near-empty chamber also made a difference because there was no cheering or barracking. Boris Johnson had no noise cushion to help him through. It meant that what he said mattered more.</p> \n  <p>Johnson was pressed repeatedly, especially by Jeremy Corbyn, by Ian Blackford and most effectively of all by Chris Byrant, on what he was doing to help workers who will lose out from coronavirus and he was on slightly shaky ground. Ministers insist they will announce a package of employment support measures very soon, and Johnson repeatedly insisted that people should not lose out for doing the right thing (ie, for staying at home, even if they feel well) and he repeatedly said that he was willing to do whatever it took. To some extent, that still sounded more like a slogan than a strategy.</p> \n  <p>But PMQs should also been an opportunity for the prime minister to listen, as well as to communicate, and one would imagine than Johnson would have left the chamber more persuaded than ever about the need for some mass government intervention to protect workers. If Felicity Buchan, a Kensington Tory with a background in banking, is saying that the government does not need to worry about borrowing any more (see <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/mar/18/uk-coronavirus-live-boris-johnson-pmqs-cbi-urges-government-pay-businesses-directly-saying-350bn-loangrant-package-not-enough?page=with:block-5e7213bc8f085e564ad865ee#block-5e7213bc8f085e564ad865ee\">12.29pm</a>), then it is hard to see what is restraining No 10.</p> \n  <p>Johnson has a proper announcement to make during the session. In response to a question from Corbyn, he confirmed that the government would legislate to protect renters from eviction during the coronavirus crisis. He told MPs:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I can indeed confirm that we will be bringing forward legislation to protect private renters from eviction, that is one thing we will do, but it is also important as we legislate that we do not simply pass on the problem, so we\u2019ll also be taking steps to protect other actors in the economy.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Johnson also announced that coronavirus testing was being ramped up to 25,000 tests a day. And, although he did not reveal what the government\u2019s employment support measures would involve, his answers on this were intriguing. He did not dismiss out of hand the temporary universal basis income idea floated by Blackford, or Bryant\u2019s call for a handout in the form of a summer version of the winter fuel payment.</p> \n  <p>Johnson was also interesting on the subject of schools. He told MPs:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The house should expect further decisions to be taken imminently on schools and how to make sure we square the circle both of making sure we stop the spread of the disease but also making sure we relieve, as much as we can, pressure on our NHS.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>That sounded very much like a hint that the government will announce a partial closure of schools, with some provision being kept open - perhaps for children of key workers, or perhaps with schools in childminding rather than education mode? - to minimise the impact on the NHS.</p> \n  <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/mar/18/uk-coronavirus-live-boris-johnson-pmqs-cbi-urges-government-pay-businesses-directly-saying-350bn-loangrant-package-not-enough\">Keep with more detailed live news from the UK here</a>.</p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/mar/18/uk-coronavirus-live-boris-johnson-pmqs-cbi-urges-government-pay-businesses-directly-saying-350bn-loangrant-package-not-enough\">UK coronavirus live: schools in Scotland and Wales to close from Friday</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e7224508f085c6327bc2477\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/ashifa-kassam\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-18T13:41:47.338Z\">1.41pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Spanish hotels set to close as British tourists told to return home</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>British tourists in Spain who are looking to return to the UK should make travel arrangements as soon as possible, the British ambassador to Spain has said, as all hotels in the country have been ordered to close down within a week, writes my colleague Ashifa Kassam in Madrid. </p> \n  <p>\u201cOur advice is now that British tourists in Spain who wish to return home should make travel plans to do so as soon as possible,\u201d Hugh Elliott <a href=\"https://twitter.com/HughElliottUK/status/1240044921207304193\">said in a video posted online on Tuesday evening.</a> </p> \n  <p>He continued: \u201cThe government has ordered the closure of hotels over the next seven days in order to reduce risks to health.\u201d As hotels begin shuttering, some tourists will be asked to move hotels, he noted.</p> \n  <p>The embassy is in close contact with Spanish authorities, who have made it clear that \u201cno one will be left without accommodation,\u201d said Elliott.

Just like in the old days with measles. The larger the group that is immune, the less chance that the virus will jump to vulnerable elderly people and people with poor health. With group immunity you build, as it were, a protective wall around them,\u201d said Rutte.</p> \n  <p>The debate by members of the Dutch House of Representatives can be <a href=\"https://nos.nl/livestream/2327490-kijk-mee-kamerdebat-over-ontwikkelingen-coronavirus.html\">viewed live here</a> on the Netherlands public broadcaster, NOS.</p> \n  <p>But while Rutte insisted on Tuesday that the strategy of his country - which has banned public gatherings and taken other measures - differed little from that of other states some Dutch people have been left to wonder if had become \u201c<a href=\"https://twitter.com/TheDutchmen4/status/1239674291798585360?s=20\">the guineapigs of Europe</a>.\u201d</p> \n  <p>The British government <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/13/uk-to-ban-mass-gatherings-in-coronavirus-u-turn\">announced last week</a> that it would be banning mass gatherings after prime minister Boris Johnson\u2019s cautious approach to the coronavirus outbreak was overtaken by care homes, sporting bodies and others. That came after the UK government\u2019s chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, had last week defended its initial approach to coronavirus, saying it was aimed at creating a \u201cherd immunity.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Amid a continued debate in the Netherlands, some insisted that the strategy of \u2018herd immunity\u2019 was a side effect rather than the main goal, which was to mirror that of other states in attempting to use social distancing and other measures to \u2018flatten the curve\u2019 of the likely peak of the outbreak.</p> \n  <p>A Dutch microbiologist, Marc Bonten of UMC Utrecht,<a href=\"https://www.telegraaf.nl/nieuws/601067410/virologen-vertrouwen-in-nederlandse-aanpak-maar-nog-veel-onzeker\"> told De Telegraaf newspaper </a>that even countries opting for a total lockdown would have to work on building group immunity.</p> \n  <p>But critics including the London-based economist Jerome Roos pointed to what they estimated the resulting death rate would be, as well as arguing that countries going for \u2018herd immunity\u2019 would <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JeromeRoos/status/1239628249367445506?s=20\">make it impossible for the countries</a> trying to completely stamp out the virus through collective quarantines</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/JeromeRoos/status/1239647484105961480\"> \n

The decision stalls years of careful planning to get people to respond to the survey.</p> \n  <p>The Bureau still has plans to send out field workers in May to follow up with people who fail to self-respond, a critical effort that aims to ensure hard-to-count groups get counted. The Bureau said Wednesday it would adjust that operation as necessary to follow the guidance of public health authorities.</p> \n  <p>The decision, made to mitigate the spread of coronavirus, came about a week after Americans began filling out the survey. The results of the census have profound political consequences -- the data is used to allocate $1.5 trillion in federal funding and to draw electoral districts in place for the next decade. The decennial census is mandated by the constitution.</p> \n  <p>Coronavirus concerns add to a pile of challenges facing the bureau. There is considerable concern that minorities and immigrant groups will be fearful of responding to the survey because of the <strong>Trump administration</strong>\u2019s anti-immigrant rhetoric and policies. Individual census responses must be kept confidential by law. </p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-03-18T17:58:48.168Z\">at 5.58pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e725d988f088d7575595e9c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-18T17:52:12.774Z\">5.52pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>The Detroit Three -- Ford, GM and Fiat Chrysler -- have agreed to temporarily close all US plants</strong> to protect workers against coronavirus.</p> \n  <p>The Detroit Free Press <a href=\"https://www.freep.com/story/news/2020/03/18/ford-gm-fca-plant-closures-coronavirus/2865289001/\">reports</a>:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p> Ford Motor Co. said after Thursday evening shifts, Ford is temporarily suspending production at its North America plants through March 30 to thoroughly clean its facilities to protect its workforce and boost containment efforts for the COVID-19 coronavirus.<br></p> \n   <p>Ford said it will continue to work closely with union leaders to find ways to help keep workers healthy and safe, \u2018even as we look at solutions for continuing to provide the vehicles customers really want and need,\u2019 said Kumar Galhotra, Ford\u2019s president of North America. \u2018In these unprecedented times, we\u2019re exploring unique and creative solutions to support our workforce, customers, dealers, suppliers and communities.\u2019</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Union leaders had pushed for the shutdown for the sake of workers\u2019 health, but the move does make it more likely that auto giants will later seek financial assistance to recover from the coronavirus crisis.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e725b9f8f085e564ad869df\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-18T17:36:23.279Z\">5.36pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The Dow has now dropped below where it was on the day of <strong>Trump</strong>\u2019s inauguration in 2017.</p> \n  <p>Therefore, all of the stock market gains that Trump has repeatedly boasted about have now been wiped out.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/TheStalwart/status/1240315639853703170\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">*DOW INDUSTRIAL AVERAGE WIPES OUT GAINS SINCE TRUMP INAUGURATION<a href=\"https://t.co/ryuOmteNca\">https://t.co/ryuOmteNca</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/DtiBIaGX4y\">pic.twitter.com/DtiBIaGX4y</a></p>\u2014 Joe Weisenthal (@TheStalwart) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TheStalwart/status/1240315639853703170?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 18, 2020</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e7256a28f088d7575595e31\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-18T17:30:30.895Z\">5.30pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Trading halted again amid steep losses</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>This is Joan Greve in Washington, taking over for Adam Gabbatt.</p> \n  <p>Trading was temporarily halted at the New York Stock Exchange, with the Dow currently down more than 1,800 points.</p> \n  <p>This marks the fourth time in two weeks that trading has been halted because of steep losses linked to investors\u2019 fears about the coronavirus crisis.</p> \n  <p>For the latest updates on the market drop, follow the Guardian\u2019s business live blog:</p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2020/mar/18/markets-government-stimulus-pledges-ftse-dow-recession-business-live\">Markets slide and pound hits 1985 lows as Covid-19 crisis deepens - business live</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e7252558f085c6327bc2705\" class=\"block is-summary\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-18T17:10:46.441Z\">5.10pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Summary</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>\u2022The government has closed the US-Canada border to \u201cnon-essential traffic\u201d, Donald Trump announced</strong>, as the number of coronavirus cases continued to rise.

Matthew Lee, diplomatic writer at Associated Press, has been looking at how coronavirus became the latest flashpoint between the two nations:</p> \n  <p>Since the virus has spread, he reports, Trump and his top aides have stepped up their criticism of China, noting consistently that the outbreak was first reported in the Chinese city of Wuhan. They have referred to Covid-19 as the \u201cWuhan virus\u201d or the \u201cChinese virus\u201d on multiple occasions, disregarding World Health Organization terminology that avoids identifying the virus by geography.</p> \n  <p>On Tuesday alone, Trump discussed the Chinese source of virus outbreak during at least two events. At a State Department news conference, Mike Pompeo referred six times to Covid-19 as the \u201cWuhan virus\u201d, and suggested the Chinese are attempting to distract the world from the shortcomings of its initial response.<br></p> \n  <p>In a meeting with hotel executives at the White House, Trump took pains to make clear that the virus originated in China, asking pointed questions of Marriott CEO Arne Sorenson about where the impact was first felt.</p> \n  <p>\u201cAnd this all started in China? That\u2019s where you first saw the problem and where you first got hit?\u201d Trump asked.<br></p> \n  <p>\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d Sorenson replied.<br></p> \n  <p>\u201cHopefully, you all heard that,\u201d Trump told reporters.</p> \n  <p>Having already been targeted by Trump in a trade war and by Pompeo and others for repression of Muslim and other religious and ethnic minorities in western Xinjiang Province, the Chinese have taken particular offence to the constant repetition, complaining vociferously and suggesting that the US military may have actually introduced the virus to Wuhan.<br></p> \n  <p>\u201cRecently, some American politicians have linked the new coronavirus with China to stigmatize China. We express strong indignation and opposition to it,\u201d foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said Tuesday. \u201cWe urge the US to immediately correct its mistakes and stop unwarranted accusations against China.\u201d</p> \n  <p>That, in turn, has prompted angry US protests with the State Department hauling in China\u2019s ambassador to the United States to complain and Pompeo calling the top Chinese diplomat to re-register the anger.</p> \n  <p>\u201cThe disinformation campaign that they are waging is designed to shift responsibility,\u201d Pompeo said, before quickly adding that \u201cnow is not the time for recriminations.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Yet recriminations seem to be the order of the day.<br></p> \n  <p>\u201cChina was putting out information which was false that our military gave this to them,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThat was false. And rather than having an argument I said I have to call it where it came from. It did come from China. So I think it\u2019s a very accurate term. But no, I didn\u2019t appreciate the fact that China was saying that our military gave it to them.\u201d<br></p> \n  <p>Shortly after Trump\u2019s comments, the Chinese foreign ministry announced the expulsion of American reporters from the New York Times, Wall Street Journal and Washington Post. </p> \n  <p>Pompeo responded to that news: \u201cI regret China\u2019s decision today to further foreclose the world\u2019s ability to conduct free press operations that frankly, would be really good, really good for the Chinese people in these incredibly challenging global times. Where more information, more transparency are what will save lives. This is unfortunate,\u201d he said. \u201cI hope they will reconsider.\u201d</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e71fec88f085c6327bc227b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-18T11:00:39.616Z\">11.00am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Another thing we can expect today is further fall-out from the Chinese decision yesterday to expel American journalists. </p> \n  <p>Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said Beijing had been \u201ccompelled\u201d to take countermeasures after Washington imposed restrictions on staff at Chinese state media outlets in the US.</p> \n  <p>\u201cWe urge the US to take off its ideological prejudice, abandon cold war mentality,\u201d Geng said. \u201cChina is not one to start trouble, but it will not blink if trouble comes. We urge the US side to immediately stop suppressing Chinese media, otherwise the US side will lose even more.\u201d</p> \n  <p>At least 13 journalists will be expelled in what is an unprecedented retaliation against foreign media working in the country. An announcement made just after midnight said all US journalists working for the New York Times, Washington Post and the Wall Street Journal whose credentials were up for renewal this year would have 10 days to turn in their press cards, a measure that effectively bans them from reporting in the country.</p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/mar/18/us-media-accuse-china-of-cold-war-mentality-after-move-to-expel-journalists\">China: expulsion of US journalists was response to 'unreasonable oppression'</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e71f4678f085c6327bc2200\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-18T10:49:11.058Z\">10.49am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Good morning. Last night <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/17/2020-four-states-primaries-coronavirus-election\">Joe Biden swept to victory in three primaries</a> held in unprecedented circumstances. Biden <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2020/mar/18/democratic-primary-delegate-count-latest\">has now racked up 1,147 pledged delegates to Bernie Sanders\u2019 861</a> - a lead of 286 that surely looks to be insurmountable. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/17/joe-biden-bernie-sanders-us-elections-2020-panel\">Is it time for Bernie to quit the race</a> in the interest of unifying the party during a national emergency?</p> \n  <p>Ohio cancelled its primary planned for yesterday due to the coronavirus. But with Florida, Illinois and Arizona running their primaries yesterday, predictably <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/17/us-elections-voters-coronavirus\">voters faced confusion, a shortage of poll workers, and shifting or closed polling stations</a>. It\u2019s clear that the way the rest of the campaign is going to be deeply affected by the coronavirus outbreak. The DNC is already urging a shift to vote-by-mail.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/TheDemocrats/status/1240060828243632128\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">In order to ensure voters can safely make their voices heard, we at the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DNC?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@DNC</a> are urging the remaining primary states to make voting easier and safer for both voters and election officials. The simplest way to ensure this is to make vote by mail available to all registered voters.</p>\u2014 The Democrats (@TheDemocrats) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TheDemocrats/status/1240060828243632128?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 17, 2020</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n  <p>With bars, shops, and restaurants ordered shut across parts of the nation, it is impossible to see politics being business-as-usual for some time to come.</p> \n  <p>Yesterday Donald Trump was proclaiming that he knew it was a pandemic all along - just weeks after the president promised that the 15 cases of coronavirus in the US would soon go down to zero. There\u2019s currently - as recorded by the <a href=\"https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6\">Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering</a> -<strong> 6,496 confirmed coronavirus cases in the US, and the death toll has now exceeded 100. </strong></p> \n  <p>It is understandably dominating today\u2019s White House agenda. Trump has calls and meetings with the aerospace industry, physicians, nurses, and a quarterly business roundtable. The Coronavirus Task Force will be doing a morning briefing.</p> \n  <p>We\u2019ll be tracking the responses to Biden\u2019s win last night and political developments around the country here.

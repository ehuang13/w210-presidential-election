Globally, 4,091,297 cases have been confirmed.</p> <h2>\u2018This is not the time to end the lockdown,\u2019 says Boris Johnson</h2> <p>In a speech criticised by some as confusing, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/10/boris-johnson-coronavirus-lockdown-shops-schools-june-reopening\">UK prime minister said</a> some schools in England and some shops might be able to open next month, and the government was \u201cactively encouraging\u201d people to return to work if they cannot do so from home. Johnson <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/10/uk-coronavirus-lockdown-what-has-boris-johnson-announced\">urged workers to avoid public transport</a>, and said restaurants and cafes should not expect to open until at least July.</p> <h2><strong>South Africa passes 10,000 confirmed cases</strong></h2> <p>The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in South Africa stands at 10,015, including 194 fatalities, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/may/10/coronavirus-live-news-obama-trumps-covid-19--chaotic-as-global-cases-pass-4-million-mexico-russia-germany-south-korea-deaths-?page=with:block-5eb86f458f08464cd4297ad8#block-5eb86f458f08464cd4297ad8\">health minister Zwelini Mkhize has announced</a>. 84% of new cases were in Western Cape and Eastern Cape, and eight new deaths had been recorded.</p> <h2><strong>Leading Latin American airline files for bankruptcy</strong></h2> <p>Avianca Holdings, Latin America\u2019s second biggest airline and one of the oldest in the world, has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/may/10/coronavirus-live-news-obama-trumps-covid-19--chaotic-as-global-cases-pass-4-million-mexico-russia-germany-south-korea-deaths-?page=with:block-5eb85bc68f0858b1a8107873#block-5eb85bc68f0858b1a8107873\">filed for bankruptcy</a>, after failing to secure aid from Colombia\u2019s government and with a bond payment deadline looming. If it fails to come out of bankruptcy, Avianca would be one of the first major carriers worldwide to go under as a result of the pandemic, which has caused a 90% decline in global air travel.</p> <h2>Poland must declare new election date within 14 days</h2> <p>The head of Poland\u2019s electoral commission has said the speaker of parliament has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/may/10/coronavirus-live-news-obama-trumps-covid-19--chaotic-as-global-cases-pass-4-million-mexico-russia-germany-south-korea-deaths-?page=with:block-5eb854a48f08c0a2409bb32e#block-5eb854a48f08c0a2409bb32e\">14 days to declare the date of a new presidential election</a>. The country had been due to hold a presidential election on Sunday and, while the vote was not officially cancelled or postponed, the electoral commission had said on Thursday it could not be held due to the coronavirus crisis.</p> <h2><strong>France exempt from UK\u2019s quarantine restrictions</strong></h2> <p>The British and French governments have released a joint statement saying that the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/may/10/coronavirus-live-news-obama-trumps-covid-19--chaotic-as-global-cases-pass-4-million-mexico-russia-germany-south-korea-deaths-?page=with:block-5eb84c018f08c0a2409bb2f9#block-5eb84c018f08c0a2409bb2f9\">French will be exempt from the UK\u2019s proposed quarantine restrictions</a> following a call between <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/boris-johnson\">Boris Johnson</a> and the French president, Emmanuel Macron. The statement stresses \u201cthe need for close bilateral, European and international cooperation in the fight against Covid-19\u201d.</p> <h2><strong>France reports lowest daily death toll since lockdown</strong></h2> <p>France reported 70 more coronavirus deaths on Sunday, its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/may/10/coronavirus-live-news-obama-trumps-covid-19--chaotic-as-global-cases-pass-4-million-mexico-russia-germany-south-korea-deaths-?page=with:block-5eb8441c8f08464cd42979d7#block-5eb8441c8f08464cd42979d7\">lowest daily toll since the lockdown began on 17 March</a>, as it prepared to ease restrictions. The new deaths brought the total toll in hospitals and nursing homes from the pandemic in France to 26,380, the health ministry said.</p> <h2><strong>WHO suspends activity in Yemen\u2019s Houthi-held areas</strong></h2> <p>The World Health Organization has suspended staff activity at its hubs in Houthi-held areas of Yemen in a move sources said was aimed to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/may/10/coronavirus-live-news-obama-trumps-covid-19--chaotic-as-global-cases-pass-4-million-mexico-russia-germany-south-korea-deaths-?page=with:block-5eb839e58f08c0a2409bb286#block-5eb839e58f08c0a2409bb286\">pressure the group into being more transparent about suspected coronavirus cases</a>. The Houthis have reported just two cases, compared with the government\u2019s figure of 34. The war-torn country is split between a Saudi-backed government temporarily based in the south and the Houthi movement that ousted it from power in the capital, Sanaa, in the north in late 2014.</p>",

Democrats who control the House want one of those but the White House doesn\u2019t \u2013 that\u2019s the short version.</p> <p>The White House is \u201cabsolutely pushing for a payroll tax cut\u201d, Mnuchin says. Most observers think that is a non-starter, because Democrats won\u2019t let it. Payroll taxes, meaning deductions from regular paychecks, include funds for Social Security and Medicare, vital social benefits.</p> <p>Here\u2019s a taste of how <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/coronavirus-what-is-payroll-tax-cut-explained-2020-3#what-are-the-alternatives-5\">BusinessInsider.com</a> explains things:</p> <ul> <li>A payroll tax cut <strong>could free up more cash for employees and employers</strong>. If Social Security and Medicare taxes aren\u2019t taken out of paychecks, workers and businesses would take home a little more money with each paycheck. The idea is that workers benefiting from the cut would spend more money, which could help curb a recession. It could give employers more money, which could reduce the need to lay off employees. </li> </ul> <p>But here\u2019s what it says would happen:</p> <ul> <li>The tax cut would <strong>disproportionately give more money to people with higher incomes</strong>, who typically have more savings to fall back on during a crisis like the coronavirus pandemic. A payroll tax cut would also <strong>do nothing to help those who lost their jobs because of the crisis,</strong> especially lower-income people in industries like tourism, hospitality, and dining that have been especially hit hard by the pandemic and decline in demand from consumers. </li> </ul> <p>Here\u2019s our business editor, Dominic Rushe, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/09/coronavirus-jobs-unemployment-kurzarbeit-us-europe\">on the economic crisis</a>:</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/09/coronavirus-jobs-unemployment-kurzarbeit-us-europe\">US job losses have reached Great Depression levels.

  "<p>Turkey\u2019s president, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/recep-tayyip-erdogan\">Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan</a>, is a populist juggernaut, fond of suggesting that his leadership is the only way to protect the country from enemies both real and imagined.

The International Monetary Fund (IMF) forecasts that the country\u2019s economy will shrink by 5% for 2020, driving up inflation to 12% and unemployment to 17.2%.

  "<p>The allegations of sexual misconduct by Tara Reade against the former vice-president Joe Biden have caused new fault lines within the Democratic party, especially between its left wing and the establishment.</p> <p>Reade is a former Biden Senate staffer who has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/07/tara-reade-megyn-kelly-interview-joe-biden-drop-out\">accused </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/07/tara-reade-megyn-kelly-interview-joe-biden-drop-out\">the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee of sexually assaulting her</a> while she worked in his office in the 1990s. Biden and his campaign have flatly denied the allegations and major news outlets have continued to investigate.</p> <p>Meanwhile, liberal grassroots activists have clashed with centrist Democrats and senior party figures over how to respond to the allegations. The arguments often point to how Democrats approached previous high-profile sexual assault allegations, such as the accusations by Christine Blasey Ford against Brett Kavanaugh during the now supreme court justice\u2019s contentious confirmation hearings.</p> <p>Peter Daou, a Democratic strategist who has argued that the \u201cDemocratic establishment\u201d has moved to undercut Reade\u2019s allegations, said three basic factions had emerged.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/02/tara-reade-joe-biden-sexual-assault-allegations-democrats-response\">Who is Tara Reade and what are her allegations against Joe Biden?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cYou have Biden\u2019s opponents on the Republican side and they\u2019re going to seize on this,\u201d Daou said, adding that there was also \u201cthe left \u2013 progressives and leftists\u201d who want to see Reade\u2019s allegations taken more seriously, and then the Democratic party establishment figures who are trying to undermine Reade.

In response to those accusations, Biden has said he would work to better respect other people\u2019s personal spaces.</p> <p>Republicans have been eager to confront as many rank-and-file Democratic politicians as possible with the allegations.

David Sirota, a former speechwriter and senior strategist for Bernie Sanders, has argued that Democrats have been too eager to discount Reade\u2019s allegations.</p> <p>A small group of insurgent Democratic congressional candidates have begun to raise concerns that Reade\u2019s allegations are not being taken seriously enough. Rebecca Parson, a liberal Democrat challenging the Washington state congressman Derek Kilmer, said in an interview on Friday that Biden should step down over Reade\u2019s allegations. Parson said she believes Reade and thinks the charges create too much of a vulnerability for Biden in the 2020 presidential election.</p> <p>\u201cI want to defeat Donald Trump in November and yes, I\u2019m a progressive and I\u2019m in the left-wing of the party, but something that really unites the people in the centrist wing and the progressive wing is we all want to defeat Trump,\u201d Parson said. \u201cI don\u2019t think we do that with somebody who has all these allegations against him, especially because Donald Trump has assault allegations against him and unfortunately with Donald Trump, Trump doesn\u2019t care about being a hypocrite.\u201d</p> <p>Parson added: \u201cI think that Biden should withdraw and any one or more of the candidates who aren\u2019t running should restart their campaign because the Democratic primary isn\u2019t over yet.\u201d</p> <p>Those arguments aren\u2019t shared by many of the most high-profile figures in the Democratic party. The New York senator Kirsten Gillibrand, a leading advocate against sexual harassment and sexual assault, told reporters on Tuesday that she supported Biden amid the allegations.</p> <p>\u201cSo when we say believe women, it\u2019s for this explicit intention of making sure there\u2019s space for all women to come forward to speak their truth, to be heard. And in this allegation, that is what Tara Reade has done,\u201d Gillibrand said, according to CNN. \u201cShe has come forward, she has spoken, and they have done an investigation in several outlets. Those investigations Vice-President Biden has called for himself. Vice-President Biden has vehemently denied these allegations and I support Vice-President Biden.\u201d</p> <p>The former Georgia state house minority leader Democrat Stacey Abrams also said she believed Biden.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/01/joe-biden-denies-sexual-assault-allegation-tara-reade-statement\">Joe Biden denies sexual assault allegation from former staffer Tara Reade</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThe New York Times did a deep investigation and they found that the accusation was not credible.

A Politico/Morning Consult poll found that over a third of Democratic voters surveyed say the party should switch out Biden as their presumptive nominee because of the allegations.</p> <p>Other Democrats argued that Biden can both adequately address Reade\u2019s allegations and still be a viable opponent against Trump. The Massachusetts congresswoman Ayanna Pressley, a progressive favorite, wrote a <a href=\"https://medium.com/@AyannaPressley/its-2020-and-we-still-don-t-know-what-survivor-justice-looks-like-983d7a94173c\">Medium post</a> arguing that the allegations can be examined without undercutting Biden\u2019s chances of beating Trump.</p> <p>\u201cI reject the false choice that my party and our nominee can\u2019t address the allegations at hand and defeat the occupant of the White House,\u201d Pressley wrote.</p>",

They have all emerged on the national stage in the last 10 years \u2013 as opposed to Biden who has been on the scene for decades.</p> <p>Publicly or privately they have all expressed openness to accepting an offer to be vice-president. Allies of those Democrats as well as potential Biden running mates have tried to tip the scales in their favor publicly and privately. But those efforts have varied.</p> <p>\u201cObviously Abrams is doing a sort of a different strategy \u2013 much more aggressively vying for it whereas Warren\u2019s people have been much more low-key about vying for it,\u201d said Sean McElwee, a liberal activist and co-founder of the Data for Progress thinktank.</p> <p>Biden himself has openly described some of the criteria he is looking for. He has vowed to pick a woman. The former vice-president and presumptive Democratic nominee on multiple occasions has said he\u2019s looking for someone who is naturally \u201csimpatico with me\u201d adding \u201cwho is a real partner in progress and is ready to be president on a moment\u2019s notice\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThere are a lot of women out there with the experience to do that job,\u201d Biden said during a fundraiser in late April.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"636ab43c56b0507182d0111d08a6bb7dfd7ea6c2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/636ab43c56b0507182d0111d08a6bb7dfd7ea6c2/0_91_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Stacey Abrams has been the most upfront about her willingness to serve as Joe Biden\u2019s running mate.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Stacey Abrams has been the most upfront about her willingness to serve as Joe Biden\u2019s running mate.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michael McCoy/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As many as a dozen candidates have been mentioned as serious candidates. His selection is especially important as he has begun framing himself as a \u201ctransition candidate\u201d who would bridge high office to the next generation of Democratic and liberal lawmakers. That suggests that Biden\u2019s running mate could be a strong contender to run for president as soon as 2024 if Biden won the 2020 presidential election and opted to serve only one term.</p> <p>Harris, Whitmer and Klobuchar have all done fundraisers for Biden or been guests on his podcast, where the former vice-president interviews them. Influential Democratic party figures have pushed Biden to consider other rising stars, such as the Nevada senator Catherine Cortez-Masto or Florida congresswoman Val Demmings.</p> <p>Abrams has been the most overt in her eagerness to be considered. In interviews she has repeatedly said Biden would benefit from having her as a running mate and that she would accept an offer. . Lauren Groh-Wargo, a top aide for Abrams and her former campaign manager, penned a New York Times op-ed titled Stacey Abrams Knows the Secret to Winning the White House. </p> <p>Abrams herself wrote an article for Foreign Affairs critiquing Donald Trump\u2019s response to the coronavirus pandemic. There is a long history in American politics of politicians trying to demonstrate foreign policy knowledge to show well-rounded qualifications for the White House.</p> <p>Donors and allies of Abrams have also been encouraging Biden and his team to strongly consider choosing her.</p> <p>Among liberal outside groups and grassroots, Abrams and Warren are the favored candidates. A <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/study-finds-stacey-abrams-biden-s-best-choice-here-s-n1164361\">poll</a> commissioned by Way to Win, a women-run group of Democratic donors, suggested that Abrams would be the best running mate for Biden.</p> <p>A recent tracking poll commissioned by MoveOn found Warren with the clear lead among a list of about a dozen potential picks. Our Revolution, the outside group aligned with the Vermont senator Bernie Sanders, conducted a poll of its members and found members \u201coverwhelmingly\u201d preferred Warren.</p> <p>\u201cFor progressives there\u2019s really two options it\u2019s either Warren or Abrams as the top pick,\u201d McElwee said.</p> <p>Sara Nelson, the international president of the Association of Flight Attendants, has been an outspoken proponent of Biden picking Warren as his running mate. She argued that a progressive favorite is the way to boost turnout Democrats need.</p> <p>\u201cWe need to turn out an inspired and engaged electorate and the way to do that is to bring together a coalition of voters that we\u2019ve never seen before,\u201d Nelson said.</p> <p>Nelson warned that without support from liberal activists and grassroots progressives who back Warren or other members of that wing, Democrats could lose to Trump in November.</p> <p>\u201cI think it\u2019s a problem because we need that energy,\u201d Nelson said. Nelson said she thinks the Biden campaign seems \u201cpretty pragmatic\u201d about that.</p> <p>But other Democrats have argued that picking a liberal darling like Warren would undercut Biden\u2019s chances of winning over conservative voters open to voting for someone other than Trump.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"4554515448491b47ed8f16762df1a3c58dcabec5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4554515448491b47ed8f16762df1a3c58dcabec5/1023_0_2559_3198/800.jpg\" alt=\"Gretchen Whitmer.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gretchen Whitmer has gained publicity during the Covid-19 pandemic.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Al Goldis/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Less a favorite of progressive activists, Whitmer has been catapulted into the national spotlight partially because of her handling of the coronavirus pandemic. She has publicly said she would accept and has kept in contact with the former vice-president. The ties between Biden and Whitmer go back before the 2020 presidential race. He endorsed her during the 2018 Michigan Democratic primary for governor. When the two were discussing Whitmer endorsing Biden in the presidential race, part of the discussion veered to how Biden would approach picking a running mate if he won the nomination, according to a Democrat with knowledge of those conversations.</p> <p>Other major Democratic party figures have been pushing Biden to consider other candidates. The former Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid has strongly encouraged Biden to consider Senator Cortez-Masto, a favorite for some Hispanic Democrats, according to two Democrats with knowledge of those conversations.</p> <p>Congressman Jim Clyburn has encouraged Biden to pick an African American woman like Harris or a lesser-known figure like the former Obama administration national security adviser Susan Rice. Influential Democratic donors have voiced support for Harris or Demmings. Harris allies have also been pushing Biden aides and allies to consider Harris.</p> <p>Rumblings about Harris\u2019s prospects as a potential vice-presidential pick for Biden began immediately after she <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-12-03/harris-exit-preserves-viability-as-a-potential-vice-president\">dropped</a> <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2019/12/kamala-harris-campaign-meltdown/603358/\">out</a> of the Democratic primary, with some Democrats saying she ended her campaign partially to preserve her chances of being selected for the eventual ticket. </p> <p>Of all the interest groups, operatives and lawmakers pushing various candidates or types of candidates, arguably the strongest has been the push for Biden to pick an African American woman as a running mate. A group of 200 women recently <a href=\"https://actionnetwork.org/petitions/black-women-leaders-letter-to-support-black-women-for-vp/\">signed a letter</a> urging Biden to pick a black women as his running mate.</p> <p>\u201cChoosing a white running mate right now is not a safe choice. It doesn\u2019t broaden the coalition,\u201d Allison, who signed the letter, said. \u201cThe safe choice is to choose a running mate who can attract vital parts of the electorate, who pulls together a multiracial coalition and gets people to the polls.\u201d</p>"

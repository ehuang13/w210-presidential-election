  "<p>Video conferences from a basement, glitchy internet and bouts of restlessness. Joe Biden, like the rest of America, is working from home.</p> <p>The former vice-president\u2019s confinement began abruptly on 10 March, when he touched down in Cleveland for a primary-night campaign event only to learn that the state\u2019s governor had called for all major indoor events to be canceled as the nation slowly grasped the seriousness of the coronavirus pandemic.</p> <p>That night, one of the most consequential of the Democratic primary, he delivered a victory speech from a nearly empty room in Philadelphia, near where his campaign is headquartered. It was his last traditional event on a campaign trail that has now changed beyond recognition. </p> <p>Since then Biden, a retail politician who enjoys rope lines and now-forbidden handshakes, has become an unwilling pioneer in presidential campaigning in the age of the coronavirus as the pandemic has thrown the Democratic race \u2013 and all US politics \u2013 into confusion.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s no playbook for what a former vice-president should be doing or saying in the middle of a global pandemic,\u201d said the Democratic strategist Lis Smith, who helped catapult the former South Bend mayor Pete Buttigieg from obscurity to contention in the Democratic primary. \u201cWe are in uncharted waters here.\u201d</p> <p>Biden\u2019s campaign has converted fundraising events to virtual ones and his podium is a room in his basement in his Wilmington, Delaware, home. His public appearances are usually once-a-day televised critiques of whatever Donald Trump\u2019s administration is doing to combat the virus. His campaign has cautiously been exploring new ways to keep supporters active.</p> <p>But the Democratic frontrunner is still grappling with how to adapt to the new challenges. His first live-streamed town hall, on 13 March, was hampered by audio and technical difficulties. \u201cI\u2019m sorry this has been such a disjointed effort here because of the connections,\u201d Biden said, his irritation evident.</p> <p>He then seemed to fade from the national stage, eclipsed by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/24/donald-trump-coronavirus-briefings-2020-campaign-rallies\">Trump\u2019s daily White House coronavirus briefings</a> and by governors including Andrew Cuomo, whose daily updates on the toll of the crisis in New York have become must-watch TV for many Americans.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/25/democrats-woman-vice-president-joe-biden-running-mate\">\u2018Opening a door that was closed too long\u2019: the hunt for a female vice-president</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Biden\u2019s absence inspired the Twitter hashtag #whereisJoe, which was promoted and shared by supporters of his Democratic rival, Senator Bernie Sanders, before being picked up by the Trump campaign.</p> <p>On a fundraising call last weekend, a Biden donor noted that Americans watch Trump every day at his briefings, events that his critics say increasingly resemble \u2013 in tone and length \u2013 the campaign rallies he has been forced to abandon.</p> <p>\u201cI would just love to see you more,\u201d the donor said of the Democrat. \u201cLike how do we get more of you and less of him on our airwaves?\u201d</p> <p>Biden assured the donor that he was raring for a comeback: his team had installed high-speed internet and built a TV studio in his basement. Soon Biden was pushing out his message. In a matter of days the question would be: where isn\u2019t Biden?</p> <p>He began the week with an address from the newly outfitted recreation room, books, a lamp and memorabilia from his decades in public life behind him. The speech was followed by back-to-back TV appearances, roundtables, a virtual happy hour with young voters, the launch of a newsletter, a podcast in the works and a CNN town hall.</p> <p>The former vice-president has also enlisted an advisory board to counsel the campaign on the coronavirus that includes Ron Klain, who coordinated the Obama White House\u2019s Ebola response. An <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JoeBiden/status/1241416531684331526\">explainer video featuring </a>Klain and a white board has already racked up millions of views.</p> <p>\u201cThe new technologies are quite effective,\u201d Biden mused to reporters on Wednesday, noting that a recent address was not carried by the national TV networks but received 3.8m views online.</p> <p>Yet even with the ramped-up online schedule, it can still be difficult for Biden to break through as he is overshadowed by other figures actually fighting on the frontlines. On Monday, he delivered his speech an hour earlier than advertised; it would otherwise have conflicted with a Cuomo press briefing. His interview with The View on Wednesday was pre-empted by another Cuomo briefing and a press conference with the Washington DC mayor, Muriel Bowser.</p> <p>After serving more than 30 years in the Senate and eight years as vice-president, Biden acknowledged the difficulty of watching his former colleagues \u2013 and presidential rivals \u2013 confront the pandemic while he watched from the sidelines as a private citizen with nothing but a bully pulpit at his disposal.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m chomping at the bit. I wish I were still in the Senate, you know, being able to impact on some things,\u201d Biden told reporters on video conference press call hosted by Zoom. \u201cBut I am where I am.\u201d</p> <p>But critics still aren\u2019t convinced that Biden is doing enough to prove that he is ready to take on Trump in November.</p> <p>\u201cI think that he needs to lead,\u201d Larry Cohen, the chairman of the pro-Sanders Our Revolution organization, said. \u201cHe could collaborate with Bernie, who\u2019s doing plenty, and they could lead together on an issue that unites all Democrats. It\u2019s unimaginable to me what\u2019s going on with him, period.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"ba1260fcf187c98104549e39faa1e332c8a2a750\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ba1260fcf187c98104549e39faa1e332c8a2a750/0_158_5264_3160/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Chicago residents watch Joe Biden during his Illinois virtual town hall on 13 March.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Chicago residents watch Joe Biden during his Illinois virtual town hall on 13 March.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Charles Rex Arbogast/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For much of the 2020 campaign, Biden\u2019s signature approach was to avoid unnecessary fights and press. His campaign allowed the nearly two dozen other candidates in the primary to have their moments in the sun before imploding. But now that low-key approach might work against him.</p> <p>Even before the pandemic hit, Democrats worried about being able to match the Trump re-election campaign\u2019s financial war chest. Biden, throughout the primary campaign, has been out-raised by his rivals. Campaigning from afar during a pandemic isn\u2019t going to make raising cash any easier \u2013 especially with a team not noted for its digital prowess.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/26/trump-facebook-ads-immigrants-coronavirus\">Trump's deluge of Facebook ads have a curious absence: coronavirus</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cFundraising has been a challenge for Joe Biden since he started running for president 500 years ago,\u201d quipped Connor Farrell, a veteran Democratic fundraiser. \u201cThis cycle in particular has been no exception. He\u2019s been trailing his competitors throughout the primary but it\u2019s obviously shown money isn\u2019t everything. That being said, he does need lots and lots of money to take on Donald Trump. In particular, his online fundraising hasn\u2019t been as good as other candidates and that\u2019s going to become much more important now that you can\u2019t do in-person fundraisers, where he shakes down executive and wealthy donors for checks in person.\u201d</p> <p>Farrell added that Biden \u201cis going to have to rely on telephone calls and digital fundraising. There\u2019s no other way around it.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a great sign that their first fundraiser via Zoom was rescheduled due to technical difficulties,\u201d Farrell added. \u201cThis is a skill that the campaign needs to learn yesterday for the future of the country.\u201d</p> <p>The Trump campaign has pivoted from taunting Biden over his absence on the national stage to mocking his re-emergence. An email blast from the Republican National Committee accused the former vice-president of attempting a \u201csorry interpretation of a president\u201d.</p> <p>Biden has been critical of Trump\u2019s response, but he has also insisted he doesn\u2019t want to engage Trump in a \u201cpolitical fight\u201d with so much at stake for the American people.</p> <p>\u201cThe coronavirus is not his fault, but the lack of speed with which to respond to it has to move much faster,\u201d he said on The View. \u201cThis is not about Democrat or Republican. This is not about what your party is. It\u2019s about getting through this.\u201d</p> <p>At the moment, however, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/26/coronavirus-donald-trump-triumph-or-disaster\">Trump is enjoying</a> the highest approval rating of his presidency, with 60% supportive of his handling of the coronavirus pandemic, according to the <a href=\"https://news.gallup.com/poll/298313/president-trump-job-approval-rating.aspx\">latest Gallup poll</a>.</p> <p>Gallup noted a \u201cpresidential rally effect\u201d in moments of national crisis as a possible explanation.</p> <p>Biden\u2019s predicament is also complicated by the fact that he is not yet the party\u2019s nominee. Despite consecutive weeks of victories, and an all-but insurmountable delegate lead, Sanders has shown no signs of leaving the race any time soon.</p> <p>Instead, the Vermont senator has turned his campaign into a pandemic response operation, hosting expert roundtables and leveraging his vast network of donors to raise money for organizations helping to alleviate the economic impact of the crisis. And this week his campaign called for yet another Democratic primary debate.</p> <p>But, with a long time to go until November, and the whole world in flux, Biden and his time still have ample time to make a difference.</p> <p>Mo Eilethee, a former Democratic communications strategist and the executive director of Georgetown University\u2019s Institute of Politics and Public Service, said offering a radically different vision of leadership during moments of national crisis was a \u201cliving, breathing example of why Biden got into the race in the first place\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cHe can use these opportunities to speak to Americans\u2019 fears, spell out a different approach or set the record straight,\u201d Eilethee said. \u201cNow the real question is: how much does he seek these opportunities?\u201d</p>",

These cutting-edge vaccines don\u2019t use weakened forms of the germ to build our immunity, as all vaccines once did; rather, they contain short copies of parts of the germ\u2019s genetic code \u2013 its DNA or RNA \u2013 which can produce fragments of the germ within our bodies.</p> \n  <p>Thus, for the first time ever, scientists have been able to muster up vaccine prospects mere weeks into a new, fast-spreading disease. Right now, there are at least 43 Covid-19 vaccines <a href=\"https://milkeninstitute.org/sites/default/files/2020-03/Covid19%20Tracker%20032020v3-posting.pdf\">in development</a> around the world \u2013 in Brisbane and Hong Kong, in the US and the UK, in the labs of universities and companies. Most of these are DNA or RNA vaccines. One vaccine, made in 63 days by an American biotech firm named Moderna, <a href=\"https://www.niaid.nih.gov/news-events/nih-clinical-trial-investigational-vaccine-covid-19-begins\">moved into</a> human trials on 16 March, entering the bloodstream of the first of 45 healthy adult volunteers in Seattle. It was a \u201cworld indoor record\u201d, said Anthony Fauci, the doctor who heads the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. \u201cNothing has ever gone that fast.\u201d</p> \n

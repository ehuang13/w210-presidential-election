More than half of the country\u2019s 177,160 cases are in Moscow and the capital\u2019s mayor, Sergei Sobyanin, said research suggested the actual number was nearer 300,000, more than triple the official figure.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/07/covid-19-puts-putins-power-plans-on-hold-and-economy-in-peril\">Covid-19 puts Putin's power plans on hold and economy in peril</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Sobyanin, a leading ally of the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, said the tally was rising so steeply because of increased testing. \u201cThe fact that we have identified so many sick people is a huge plus, not a minus,\u201d he said, because it meant those infected could be quarantined and the spread of the virus slowed.</p> \n<p>Critics say Russia\u2019s official death toll of 1,625 is relatively low because not all deaths of people who have contracted the virus are being counted as Covid-19 deaths.

Shops will reopen but cafes and restaurants will stay shut, and people will be able to leave home without a form stating the reason.</p> \n<p>Some restrictions, however, will remain in place in four regions including the greater Paris area, where the virus is still circulating. Philippe said the country was \u201ccut in two, with the virus circulating more quickly in some regions, notably in the Ile de France region\u201d around the capital.</p> \n<p>Maximum vigilance will be required there, the health minister, Olivier V\u00e9ran, said.

The public health agency was halting its twice-weekly briefings, he added.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s clear this virus cannot be eradicated in Germany,\u201d Schaade said. \u201cThere\u2019s consensus on that, at least until there\u2019s a vaccine or a treatment. We will have to try to build this virus into our everyday lives, changing our behaviour to reduce its transmission. We find ourselves in a new normality.\u201d</p> \n<p>In <strong>Spain</strong>, the director of public health for the Madrid region resigned, apparently in protest at the regional government\u2019s decision to seek to loosen lockdown restrictions in the area of<strong> </strong>the country hardest hit by the coronavirus. Yolanda Fuentes was understood to have had grave reservations about moving to \u201cphase 1\u201d, which includes the reopening of small businesses, and restaurant and bar terraces at 30% capacity.</p> \n<p>The <strong>World Health Organization</strong> said alcohol and drug abuse had combined with close confinement during weeks of lockdown to fuel alarming levels of domestic violence in many countries. Its regional director for Europe, Hans Kluge, cited reports from many countries including <strong>Belgium</strong>, <strong>Bulgaria</strong>, <strong>France</strong>, <strong>Ireland</strong>, <strong>Russia</strong>, <strong>Spain</strong> and the<strong> UK</strong> of increases in violence against women, men and children.</p> \n<p>\u201cAlthough data is scarce, member states are reporting up to a 60% increase in emergency calls by women subjected to violence by their intimate partners in April this year compared to last\u201d and online inquiries had increased fivefold, Kluge said on Thursday. \u201cThe legacy of this pandemic could haunt us for years,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>The <strong>World Tourism Organization,</strong> another UN agency, said international tourist arrivals could slump by between 60 and 80% in 2020. Widespread travel restrictions and the closure of airports and national borders to curb the spread of the virus have plunged the sector into its worst crisis since records began in 1950.</p> \n<p>Reinforcing the point, France\u2019s tourism minister, Jean-Baptiste Lemoyne, said the country\u2019s borders would stay closed for the foreseeable future and that no one would be driving \u201cthousands of kilometres\u201d for their holidays this summer.</p> \n<p>\u201cTourism will resume by concentric circles, the driving force behind the return of tourists will be national tourism,\u201d he said. \u201cThe French will go and rediscover our land, our country, our heritage.

  "<p>Before college campuses emptied out for the pandemic, students and faculty alike were demanding they be empty on one specific day: election day.</p> <p>At Loyola Marymount University in California, for example, months-long organizing by students and faculty resulted in the campus being shut down during the midterm elections in 2018 \u2013 expanding the number of student voters. Several law professors also arranged a program for<a href=\"https://www.nbclosangeles.com/local/law-students-set-to-hit-polls-on-election-day-to-answer-big-questions-and-small/49003/\"> law students to volunteer at the polls</a> and answer voters\u2019 questions.</p> <p>\u201cIt was a 16-hour day of helping people find their way at the polling location and the volunteers were definitely exhausted afterwards,\u201d said Christopher Kissel, a third-year law student at Loyola. \u201cWe really saw how the democratic sausage is made, and it isn\u2019t always pretty, and it definitely isn\u2019t easy.\u201d</p> <p>While some campuses in the US do shut down during elections, most do not. Students and faculty at many schools, including <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2018/11/1/shroff-close-harvard-on-election-day/\">Harvard</a> and New Jersey\u2019s<a href=\"https://www.dailytargum.com/article/2017/02/student-pushes-administrators-to-acknowledge-election-day-as-university-holiday\"> </a><a href=\"https://www.dailytargum.com/article/2017/02/student-pushes-administrators-to-acknowledge-election-day-as-university-holiday\">Rutgers University</a>, argue that being in class or having schoolwork on the day of an election makes it much more difficult to get to the polls.</p> <p>Having election day off might seem like a luxury, but students are among the most disenfranchised populations in the country. As the number of young, liberal voters continues to rise, some have raised suspicions that keeping students in class on election day is<a href=\"https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2019/11/12/students-across-country-faced-voting-barriers-election-day\"> a form of voter suppression</a>.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/evangerstmann/2020/03/15/the-votes-of-college-students-are-being-suppressed/#1f0823b949ca\">Republican politicians</a> have been trying to limit student votes for years. In Texas, a 2019 law that prohibits temporary voting locations <a href=\"https://www.texastribune.org/2019/10/10/texas-temporary-voting-access-young-rural-voters/\">denied many college voters proper voting access</a>. In Florida, the state legislature added a parking restriction clause to a new elections law, which <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/24/us/voting-college-suppression.html\">in effect disqualified many college campuses</a> from being considered valid early polling sites. A New Hampshire law <a href=\"https://www.citizenscount.org/issues/student-vote\">requires college students</a> to obtain in-state driver\u2019s licenses to be able to vote, though the American Civil Liberties Union <a href=\"https://www.necn.com/news/local/aclu-lawsuit-challenges-voter-residency-law-in-new-hampshire/5236/\">has brought a federal suit challenging this law.</a></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8d49b1c4a2be1f6c20fb3265062ce82821f486a9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8d49b1c4a2be1f6c20fb3265062ce82821f486a9/0_0_6016_4016/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Student volunteers at Loyola University.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"668\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Student volunteers at Loyola Marymount University.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy Loyola Marymount University</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The issue also intersects with other communities vulnerable to voter suppression. Students at Prairie View A&amp;M University, a historically black college in Waller county, Texas, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/feb/13/how-our-historically-black-university-denied-access-voting-texas\">reported</a> a lack of early voting opportunities as compared with other residents of the county and noted that polling stations were pushed off campus in 2016. In 2018, students at the school<a href=\"https://defendernetwork.com/news/local-state/prairie-view-am-students-sue-waller-county-over-early-voting-sites/\"> sued the county</a>, alleging racial discrimination, but <a href=\"https://www.naacpldf.org/press-release/black-student-voters-seek-keep-voting-rights-lawsuit-alive\">the case was dismissed</a>.</p> <p>The groups vying to shut down classes on election day are hoping the effort chips away at some of these barriers.</p> <p>In 2017, students at Rutgers pressured the administration to make election day a university holiday. According to Rutgers student Christopher Markosian, several student activists sent out a university-wide poll on the matter and found that<a href=\"https://www.dailytargum.com/article/2017/02/student-pushes-administrators-to-acknowledge-election-day-as-university-holiday\"> 95% of student respondents</a> stated that they would be more likely to vote if no classes were in session on the day of the presidential election. The university has yet to give students the day off.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/30/america-voting-rights-vote-by-mail-republicans\">Vote safely by mail in November?

According to Akhurapa Ambak, a third-year law student, the movement began when students successfully pressured several faculty members to cancel class. In 2018, this led to the school not only cancelling classes on election day but putting institutional weight behind a voter registration drive on campus.</p> <p>\u201cAny issue that one cares about, whether it\u2019s the economy, human rights, climate, education, healthcare, anything, can ultimately be traced back to the issue of voting,\u201d Ambak said. \u201cFurther, it is the youth that will, in all likelihood, be living the longest with the outcomes of elections and the ramifications of the policies enacted.\u201d</p> <p>This year, some of the initiatives have been thrown off by coronavirus since many college students have been evacuated from campus. <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2020/03/16/816092179/as-coronavirus-spreads-states-scramble-to-reassure-public-that-voting-is-safe\">Some election officials</a> initially directed students to return to campus to vote, although these recommendations became fewer as the Covid-19 threat became clearer.

  "<p>Donald Trump\u2019s Oval Office address on coronavirus was terrifying because it revealed a man completely unmatched to the moment. Even though he was reading from a teleprompter, the president got the details of his major policy announcements wrong. He attempted no emotional connection with or comfort of the tens of millions of Americans whose lives are being upended by the threat of the disease. He didn\u2019t even have anything useful to say about what his own top scientist has described as America\u2019s \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/12/coronavirus-us-testing-failures-trump-administration\">failing</a>\u201d testing regime, which has screened about as many people all year as South Korea does in a day. In a presidency accustomed to lows, this one was quite literally sickening.</p> \n<p>Trump had an unusual deer-in-the-headlights quality during his address, seeming to reveal that even he realizes his lie-and-deny operation cannot last for much longer. His allies in the media are busy trying to downplay the virus, but anyone who switches over to a real news channel can see what is happening in Italy, where doctors feel forced to leave the elderly to die and hospitals are struggling to bury the dead. With estimates of the number of Americans who might require intensive care <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.nl/presentation-us-hospitals-preparing-for-millions-of-hospitalizations-2020-3?international=true&amp;r=US\">running into the millions</a> and only about 45,000 ICU beds <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/12/upshot/coronavirus-biggest-worry-hospital-capacity.html\">available</a> in the US, similar scenes might soon be playing out at home.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/13/coronavirus-donald-trump-presidency-sick-joke\">The sick joke of Donald Trump's presidency isn't funny any more | Richard Wolffe</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>When Trump and his allies can no longer lie or deny, we can expect them to move on to the next phase of their crisis management playbook: attacking their enemies. It is already clear that they intend to interpret the virus not primarily as an existential threat to millions of Americans, but as an existential threat to their own political power. With the markets tumbling and Trump\u2019s re-election suddenly in doubt, it is only a matter of time before the right goes on the offensive. When they do, it won\u2019t be the virus in their sights, but the familiar foes: journalists, experts, blue states, immigrants and people of color.</p> \n<p>At this point, the coronavirus pandemic will intersect with Trump\u2019s authoritarian impulses in truly frightening ways. With parts of the country experiencing levels of privation and death rarely seen in peacetime, Trump will feel justified in invoking emergency powers. In a declared state of emergency, the president has <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2019/01/presidential-emergency-powers/576418/\">extraordinary powers</a>, including the ability to freeze an American\u2019s finances and deprive them of the ability to legally work, to control digital communications, and to deploy the military domestically. Aside from these enumerated items, Trump has repeatedly shown that he anyway believes that there are no legal or constitutional limits on presidential authority.</p> \n<p>Most worrying of all are the implications for immigrant communities and people of color. Trump has repeatedly demonstrated that he has a racialized view of who is a \u201ctrue\u201d American, from denying Barack Obama\u2019s citizenship to telling congresswomen of color born in the US to \u201cgo back\u201d to where \u201cthey came\u201d from. It would be extraordinary if this doesn\u2019t at the very least color his decisions on where to send federal aid and how to deploy his emergency powers. There is also a disturbing likelihood that Trump will attempt to stoke racism in order to rally his base and present the coronavirus as an alien plot against (white) America.</p> \n<p>Already the right has shown a tendency to lash out at foreigners in its response to the virus, from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/10/republicans-face-backlash-racist-labeling-coronavirus-china-wuhan\">insisting on labeling it</a> \u201cWuhan coronavirus\u201d to carrying out border closures while doing little to stop transmission within the United States. In a bizarre statement, Senator Tom Cotton even <a href=\"https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/hold-accountable-those-who-inflicted-it-on-the-world-tom-cotton-demands-punishment-for-coronavirus-outbreak\">threatened</a> to \u201chold accountable those who inflicted it on the world\u201d. Once the virus is undeniably established in America, it is all too likely that this animus and psychological need for scapegoats will be directed at those the right considers alien interlopers at home. The results \u2013 both from the misuse of state power, and from privately \u2013 inflicted terrorism and violence \u2013 could be profound.</p> \n<p>It is also time to start worrying about the 2020 election. If the economy has crashed, there are countless dead, and Trump is badly trailing in the polls, it is almost inevitable that he will attempt to cast doubt on the wisdom and legitimacy of holding a November election. He would not have to do anything so drastic as to attempt to call off the election \u2013 instead, he could call for his supporters to boycott it, then simply refuse to acknowledge the result. If the Republican party faces an electoral wipeout, its craven behavior over the last few years can give us no confidence that the party would defend the democratic process and eject Trump from the White House.</p> \n<p>In short, nothing in Trump\u2019s record \u2013 or that of his ardent base, whose political support is all he cares about \u2013 can lead us to believe that he will use his power to protect and serve all Americans equally in a time of unprecedented crisis. He might look like a deer in the headlights right now, but soon enough he will snap back to the unreality he lives in and deploy the only political trick he knows: rallying his base, abusing his power, trashing his foes. Many Americans will have to deal with the reality of a president who is not only incompetent to defend them but doesn\u2019t even regard them as legitimate Americans worthy of protection. This epidemiological crisis is also a political one. We should prepare to defend against both.</p> \n<ul> \n <li><p>Andrew Gawthorpe is a historian of the United States at Leiden University</p></li> \n</ul>",
  "<p>When Brexit and Trump sent transatlantic politics into a spin in 2016, many searched frantically for a handrail in the darkness. The times demanded fresh perspectives \u2013 and they appeared in the shape of political podcasting. As a medium, the podcast was poised for adaptation, offering a range of furious, original, funny, marginalised and independent voices when the political going got weird.</p> <p>Suddenly, everything was up for grabs: if Donald Trump could enter the Oval Office, surely nothing was off the table? Could a socialist become US president? The Bernie Sanders ultras on the self-proclaimed \u201cdirtbag left\u201d certainly thought so. Pods such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/jun/03/chapo-trap-house-podcast-interview-trump-socialist-us-comics\">Chapo Trap House</a> and <a href=\"https://redscarepodcast.libsyn.com/\">Red Scare</a> \u2013 a mix of radical politics and irony \u2013 found sizeable niches, using abrasive humour to tap into a disaffection not represented by mainstream broadcasters. In the centre, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/jan/26/pod-save-america-the-podcast-that-won-obamas-last-interview\">Pod Save America</a> \u2013 former insiders from Obama\u2019s White House horrified at Trump\u2019s rise \u2013 was soon averaging 1.5 million listeners per episode. On the Republican side, Steve Bannon and Raheem Kassam\u2019s <a href=\"https://warroom.org/podcast/\">War Room</a> feels disconcertingly like being in Donald Trump\u2019s head, while John Ziegler\u2019s Individual 1 vocalises anti-Trump conservatism.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"95a15ca06a05b1c5c64183389e0eac6222feab66\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/95a15ca06a05b1c5c64183389e0eac6222feab66/393_63_1532_1531/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Chapo Trap House\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Chapo Trap House.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chapo Trap House</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In 2020, political podcasts have become increasingly important, and in the run-up to the US presidential election they are sure to be a significant battleground, with aspiring candidates lining up to be grilled on them. They are big business too: tours and book tie-ins underpin the business model of the likes of Chapo. Crowdfunding platforms such as Patreon, which enable fans to support their favourite pods and unlock extra tiers of content as a reward, have made independent profitability possible. Crooked Media, which hosts multiple shows alongside <a href=\"https://crooked.com/podcast-series/pod-save-america/\">Pod Save America</a>, is arguably becoming a new media empire.</p> <p>The UK has followed suit. Pods ranging from <a href=\"https://trashfuturepodcast.podbean.com/\">Trashfuture</a> (a response to the \u201ccontinuing psychic trauma of capitalism\u201d) to Novara Media\u2019s <a href=\"https://novaramedia.com/category/audio/tyskysour/\">Tysky</a><a href=\"https://novaramedia.com/category/audio/tyskysour/\">Sour</a> have extolled the virtues of Corbynism. <a href=\"https://audioboom.com/channel/remainiacs-podcast\">The Remainiacs</a> podcast (centrists who suddenly found themselves on the outside looking in) and their second, less Brexit-focused spin-off The Bunker, have become the voice of despairing liberalism. On the right, there is the podcast arm of online magazine Spiked (which recently interviewed privilege-denying thesp Laurence Fox) and The Delingpod, in which journalist James Delingpole does his tendentious, climate crisis-sceptic thing in surround sound.</p> <p>The much-mocked \u201cmainstream media\u201d has responded with pods of its own, in the process often making it clear why their competitors had to happen in the first place. The BBC\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p04z203l/episodes/downloads\">Political Thinking </a><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p04z203l/episodes/downloads\">With Nick Robinson</a> boasts titles suggesting the least appetising Friends episodes ever (The Nicky Morgan One; The What Does Boris Johnson Really Think One) and actually uses its extended duration as an excuse to get even cosier still with prominent politicians. These pods don\u2019t exactly go out of their way to dispel the notion that conventional political journalism is frequently a self-perpetuating Human Centipede of quid pro quo banality.</p> <p>Conversely, the success of independent political podcasting is in large part due to the energy generated by outsiders grabbing a platform without permission. Political podcasts thrive on insurgency, on opposition to jaded official voices. \u201cUnmediated, unscripted, direct and authentic content is hugely appealing,\u201d says Dr Lance Dann, who co-wrote <a href=\"https://www.bloomsbury.com/uk/podcasting-9781501328688/\">Podcasting: The Audio Media Revolution</a> with fellow academic Dr Martin Spinelli. \u201cIt\u2019s a raw energy and anger that people can express in the moment.\u201d The traditional media has struggled with balance, so in the face of the absurdity of Trump, Johnson and Brexit, these unguarded and incredulous voices have felt not just refreshing but necessary.</p> <p>In fact, the unashamed lack of balance is part of the fun. In an era of correspondents parroting the briefings of anonymous government sources, they feel honest: vigorously and proudly partial. If you are starting to doubt official versions of the truth, it is thrilling to find you\u2019re not alone. \u201cThe form itself is incredibly free,\u201d says Spinelli. \u201cThere are no gatekeepers, there are no rules, the fear of defamation is virtually nonexistent, and podcasters have been experimenting in developing relationships with their audiences based on these attributes. That\u2019s a key point: podcasting is really about a relationship rather than the spoken word.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9ff4d437fbe667d0e7469af612b6a8f14fee0094\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9ff4d437fbe667d0e7469af612b6a8f14fee0094/0_6_1654_992/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Podcast\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>But relationships can become too cosy, and insurgency can curdle into isolationism. Jessa Crispin, whose <a href=\"https://www.stitcher.com/podcast/forever-dog-podcast-network/public-intellectual\">Public Intellectual podcast</a> in the US explores a variety of outlooks, recently hosted an episode whose title suggested that <a href=\"https://player.fm/series/public-intellectual-2379837/you-can-talk-to-a-conservative-like-a-normal-human-being-with-gerald-russello\">You Can Talk to a Conservative Like a Normal Human Being</a>. It was a reaction to a consensus in which, she says, \u201caudiences are mostly looking for a podcast that agrees with what they already believe\u201d. These podcasts\u2019 hosts, she adds, try \u201cto turn everything into a punchline. Everyone is trying to follow the Chapo model; guys shouting over one another, eager to make the best joke. If I wanted to listen to men from privileged backgrounds who think they know best about everything, I\u2019d turn on the cable news.\u201d</p> <p>In fact, one of the most notable problems with some of the \u201cdirtbag left\u201d pods is how light on policy discussion they have become. Rather than being a meaningful part of a battle of ideas, they can sometimes feel like hipsterism manifesting as political punditry, what Sigmund Freud called \u201cthe narcissism of small differences\u201d rendered streamable. Some of the hard-left podcasts often seem more animated by their loathing of \u201ccentrists\u201d than by adversaries on the right. Similarly, few liberal podcasts manage to hide their scorn for the Corbyn project. As Crispin puts it: \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of territorial behaviour. \u2018This is what I believe; if you don\u2019t believe it too, get the hell out.\u2019 There\u2019s very little bridge building. The thing I get from most of them is not just a lack of humility but a lack of curiosity. There\u2019s the assumption that they have the right opinions.\u201d</p> <p>With that in mind, it would be fascinating to see how the likes of <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/chapo-trap-house\">Chapo</a> might react to actually getting what they want. The show\u2019s host, Will Menaker, recently sparked controversy by pledging to refuse to vote for anyone but Sanders in November. But if Sanders were to win the Democratic nomination, Chapo would be forced to move on from thinking up insults for Pete Buttigieg (\u201cRatfuck CIA operative,\u201d being a recent highlight) and on to discussing policy detail. They would move from the outer edges to the inside track.</p> <p>For a glimpse of how tricky this mainstreaming process can be, it is worth considering the opposition. Take the pugnacious provocateurs over at The Spiked Podcast. A recent episode titled The Woke Stasi spoke volumes about their determination to continue obscuring dry policy issues with emotive cultural ones. But its shtick is now predictable to the point of tedium; straw men constructed for the sole purpose of presenting themselves as the contrarian opposition to what they term \u201ccultural Marxism\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"4e96393cec3c5758c67411eb09fddb7d163294d5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4e96393cec3c5758c67411eb09fddb7d163294d5/0_0_1400_1400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Joe Rogan Experience\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Joe Rogan Experience.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: HANDOUT</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>However, the problem with evoking the Stasi is that the Stasi were the government. Their power was tangible and frightening. Whereas \u201cwokeness\u201d, \u201cpolitical correctness\u201d or whatever other lazy identifier you might employ to avoid discussing systemic inequality, is currently under siege like never before. If Spiked ever offered an outsider perspective, those days are long gone; its viewpoint is now represented at the heart of the establishment. How much more culturally dominant would the performatively populist right have to be before its outriders accepted that they were policing the status quo? </p> <p>And yet the medium retains vast potential. The best political podcasts boast wit and irreverence while allowing space for the informed deep dive too. With its generous tone, Ed Miliband\u2019s <a href=\"https://play.acast.com/s/reasonstobecheerful\">Reasons to Be Cheerful</a> pod is the sound of a man bringing a plastic picnic knife to a gunfight \u2013 but it has established a niche, and it is set apart by its open-mindedness and emphasis on policy and ideas. Likewise, for his <a href=\"https://www.earwolf.com/show/getting-curious-with-jonathan-van-ness/\">Getting Curious podcast</a>, Queer Eye\u2019s Jonathan Van Ness conducted an impressive, humanising interview with Elizabeth Warren.</p> <p>Fascinating material can emerge in unlikely places. Podcasting behemoth <a href=\"http://podcasts.joerogan.net/\">Joe Rogan</a> (whose audience runs into millions per episode) is best known as a politically unaffiliated libertarian comedian; a weed-smoking, bench-pressing, deer-hunting avatar of red-blooded male America. And yet his conversation with Bernie Sanders was as thorough an interrogation of Sanders\u2019s actual policy as any of the radical left pods have managed, and will have reached parts of the electorate that previous Democratic candidates can only have dreamed about.</p> <p>November\u2019s US presidential election may mark a turning point for political podcasts. Can they use their energy and large audiences to make a difference, and convince those outside of their echo chambers?</p> <p>\u201cPeople listen to podcasts for a sense of community, for companionship and, in terms of politics, to have their views confirmed,\u201d says Dann. \u201cAs such, podcasting has become the perfect embodiment of the dangers of social and web media bubbles. Audiences are listening in. They need to force themselves to listen out.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>It was just before 9am and the sky was overcast when a small group of reporters were suddenly ushered through the White House\u2019s south portico. They gathered in <a href=\"http://www.whitehousemuseum.org/floor0/diplomatic-room.htm\">the diplomatic reception room,</a> once home to Franklin Roosevelt\u2019s \u201cfireside chats\u201d, and stared at a desk with pen, documents and the presidential seal.</p> \n<p>Donald Trump strode in, wearing a black bomber jacket and white shirt unbuttoned at the top, and settled down beneath a portrait of George Washington. He signed a congressional emergency spending bill to combat the coronavirus for $8.3bn \u2013 more than three times what the president himself had requested \u2013 and held it up to a chorus of clicking cameras.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re doing very well,\u201d he insisted. \u201cBut it\u2019s an unforeseen problem. What a problem. Came out of nowhere, but we\u2019re taking care of it.\u201d He gazed around the oval-shaped room, wallpapered romantic American landscapes, and took questions. Someone asked: \u201cHow do you keep people from panicking?\u201d Trump\u2019s response in part: \u201cCalm. You have to be calm. It\u2019ll go away.\u201d</p> \n<p>It has not gone away.</p> \n<p>A week later, coronavirus cases in the US have soared past 1,300, with at least 38 deaths.

In remarks that many found confounding and frightening, he described the governor of Washington state as a \u201csnake\u201d, praised his own expertise and falsely claimed that anyone who wants a coronavirus test can get one. Pence was later forced to correct this.</p> \n<p>But on Monday the full horror of the economic implications dawned on Trump as he flew from Florida to Washington on Air Force One. In his on-board office, Fox News showed graphics illustrating the single worst day for markets since the financial crisis of 2008. Fellow passenger Matt Gaetz, a Republican congressman, had isolated himself in part of the plane after learning he had come into contact with an infected person.</p> \n<p>Trump travelled to Capitol Hill for lunch with Senate Republicans on Tuesday. He promised: \u201cWe\u2019re doing a great job with it. And it will go away. Just stay calm. It will go away.\u201d A day later, Dr Anthony Fauci, one of the government\u2019s top public health experts, testified: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RapD4-7uAbg\">\u201cBottom line, it\u2019s going to get worse.\u201d</a></p> \n<p>The president tried to provide further reassurance in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/11/donald-trump-us-coronavirus-address\">only his second Oval Office address</a> on Wednesday night. But it had the exact opposite effect. He blindsided European governments by announcing a 30-day travel ban to keep out the \u201cforeign virus\u201d. He also failed to explain how tests will become available and committed factual errors the White House was forced to hastily correct.</p> \n<p>Susan Rice, former national security adviser, tweeted simply: \u201cOMG.\u201d</p> \n<p>Eight months <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/12/trump-coronavirus-election-impact-bernie-sanders-joe-biden\">from a presidential election,</a> the virus has jeopardised Trump\u2019s central reelection argument \u2013 a strong economy \u2013 just as Joe Biden, the candidate emerging from the Democratic field, seems poised to take advantage by offering stability and a safe pair of hands.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/MichaelSteele?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">Michael Steele,</a> former chairman of the Republican National Committee, said: \u201cThe most calming and reassuring presidential voice of the past 24 hours has been Joe Biden.

He may be regarded as a Nero, fiddling while Rome burned.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/moevela?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">Moe Vela,</a> a former senior adviser to Biden, said: \u201cHe is unable to express compassion and empathy; I don\u2019t believe he possesses those two values. This was his chance to show that he could lead, to show that he was as tough as he said he was for three years. And then what does he do? He falls on his face.\u201d</p> \n<p>Vela, an LGBTQ and Latino activist and board director at TransparentBusiness, added: \u201cWe\u2019re walking around in ghost towns. Kids aren\u2019t going to school. Not enough people are getting tested. We have no clue what the reality of this pandemic is because information is being withheld and reaction from this administration was slow at best. It\u2019s disgusting. It\u2019s disconcerting.

We need to anticipate significant increases in hospital admissions, which means that we will need more ICU units and ventilators, we will need more doctors, nurses, and medical personnel of all kinds - and we must make sure that these frontline personnel are well protected from the diseases they are treating. I have talked to nurses recently who worry very much about whether they are getting the kind of knowledge and equipment they need so that they do not get sick.</em></p> \n   <p><em>We need to significantly improve our communications and collaboration with other countries to ensure that we are learning everything that we can about the successes and failures of other countries as they deal with this crisis. And furthermore, we must be honest with the American people and communicate as effectively and directly as we can with all of the scientific information that we can provide.</em><em>Further, and most importantly, our response to this entire crisis must be guided by the decisions of doctors, scientists, and researchers, not politicians. </em></p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>And then Sanders pivoted to his signature issue, healthcare. He argued that the crisis is a reason the country needs to adopt Medicare for All. </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p><em>But as we struggle with this crisis, it is also important that we learn the lessons of how we got to where we are today, and what we must do in the future so that we are better prepared for similar crises that may come. </em><em>Poll after poll already shows us that the American people understand that we must do what every other major country on earth does, and that is to guarantee healthcare to all of our people as a human right, not a privilege. As we begin to see the failures and vulnerabilities of the current healthcare system, my guess is that those numbers and the demand for universal healthcare will only go up.</em> </p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e6bf1d88f088d75755931cd\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/max-benwell\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-13T20:54:45.674Z\">8.54pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Here is the <strong>unsettling moment Trump hit out at PBS\u2019 Yamiche Alcindor</strong>, after she asked him about his <a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/trump-fire-pandemic-team/\">closure of the White House\u2019s pandemic response team in 2018</a>:</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/MarcACaputo/status/1238569990481162240\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Q: What responsibility do you take for disbanding the White House pandemic office<br><br>Trump: \u201cit's a nasty question ... we saved thousands of lives because of the quick closing.

Booker and Harris have since dropped out and endorsed Biden.<br></p> \n  <p>The CBC as a whole is not officially endorsing a candidate, Bass said, but the majority of members have already announced support for Biden.</p> \n  <p>Although Biden has strong support within the African American community, especially among older voters, concerns have been raised about his ability to energize young and progressive voters.</p> \n  <p>\u201cAs this race settles down, it is my job personally and the job of members of the Congressional Black Caucus to be extremely clear with people in our districts what is at stake here, and what is at stake is their future,\u201d Bass said. \u201cIt\u2019s a job that we\u2019ve all been doing over the last 3 1/2 years, but we have to step it up.\u201d<br></p> \n  <p>Asked whether Sanders and Tulsi Gabbard should drop out of the race to unite the party before the Democratic National Convention, Bass said she believes the primary process needs to run its course and allow every voter the chance to weigh in.<br></p> \n  <p>\u201cI would never be in a position to say, \u2018You need to drop out,\u2019\u201d Bass said. \u201cI do think, though, that math is math.\u201d<br></p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e6b73788f085c6327bbf37e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-13T11:51:22.103Z\">11.51am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Dr. Anthony Fauci, head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, was on CBS This Morning talking about the coronavirus, and particularly about the availability - or lack of - testing kits in the US.

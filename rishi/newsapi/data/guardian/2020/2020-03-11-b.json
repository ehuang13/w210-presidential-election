  "<p>A defiant <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/bernie-sanders\">Bernie Sanders</a> has vowed to stay in the Democratic <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-elections-2020\">2020</a> presidential race, breaking his silence after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/joebiden\">Joe Biden</a> secured a commanding lead on Tuesday night.</p> \n<p>The Vermont senator faces increasingly long odds after the former vice-president notched a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/10/democratic-primaries-joe-biden-bernie-sanders\">string of victories</a> in Missouri, Mississippi, Idaho and Michigan, a state that four years ago helped revive his insurgent challenge to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton\">Hillary Clinton</a>.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/11/bernie-sanders-stay-in-drag-biden-left-movement-lives-2020-democratic-election\">Sanders stays, so his movement can live on by dragging Biden leftward</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Conceding that Tuesday was \u201cnot a good night\u201d for his candidacy, the second major setback in as many weeks, Sanders said his campaign was \u201cstrongly winning\u201d the contest of ideas taking place within the Democratic party.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt is not just the ideological debate that our progressive movement is winning,\u201d he said on Wednesday during a press conference in Burlington, billed as a \u201ccampaign update\u201d. \u201cWe are winning the generational debate.\u201d</p> \n<p>Rejecting mounting pressure from within the Democratic party to end his presidential bid, Sanders signaled that he had more to say in this weekend\u2019s one-on-one debate with Biden.</p> \n<p>\u201cOn Sunday, I very much look forward to the debate in Arizona with my friend Joe Biden,\u201d Sanders said.</p> \n<p>In his brief remarks, Sanders offered a frank assessment of the state of his campaign. He acknowledged that he is \u201closing the debate over electability\u201d to a candidate many Democrats believe is better suited to defeating Donald Trump in November. But he is not without leverage, a point he made clearly on Wednesday.</p> \n<p>In the upcoming debate, Sanders said he intended to confront the former vice-president on a number of issues from economic inequality to Medicare for All to the climate crisis that are priorities for his supporters.</p> \n<p>\u201cJoe, what are you gonna do?\u201d Sanders repeated, previewing the series of questions he would ask Biden at the debate. \u201cAre you really going to veto a Medicare for All bill if it is passed in Congress?\u201d Sanders asked, referring to Biden\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/10/biden-says-he-wouldd-veto-medicare-for-all-as-coronavirus-focuses-attention-on-health.html\">comments on MSNBC</a> earlier this week in which he cited costs as a reason he would not sign the legislation into law in the highly unlikely scenario such a proposal reached the president\u2019s desk.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"be6a792d-6ae8-4a41-a528-61f0c78a12d3\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/nLM9bm11sVI?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Sanders did not soften his critique of the \u201cDemocratic establishment\u201d, a foil in both of his presidential campaigns. Touting a number of polls that show Sanders\u2019 ideas on health care and minimum wage are popular even among Americans who did not vote for him, Sanders implored the party to adopt these proposals and widen its appeal to the legions of young people who have flocked to his campaign.</p> \n<p>\u201cToday I say to the Democratic establishment: in order to win in the future you need to win the voters who represent the future of our country and you must speak to the issues of concern to them,\u201d he said. \u201cYou cannot simply be satisfied by winning the votes of people who are older.\u201d</p> \n<p>The next few days will be critical for Sanders campaign, with Biden poised to build what could be an insurmountable lead in the coming contests, which are less favorable to the senator. A strong debate performance could boost Sanders\u2019 standing ahead of consequential contests in Arizona, Illinois, Ohio and Florida, all states that he lost in 2016. But what he does next will also have implications for the progressive movement he has led since his unexpectedly vigorous challenge in 2016.</p> \n<p>On Tuesday, Sanders returned to his home in Vermont after being forced to cancel an election night rally in Cleveland due to concern over the coronavirus. From Burlington, where he began his political career as mayor, he deliberated with his wife, Jane, and senior advisers and aides about the next steps for the campaign. He made no public comments on Tuesday, ceding the stage to his rival. Biden used the opportunity to extend an olive branch to Sanders and his supporters: \u201cThere\u2019s a place in our campaign for each of you.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Across the country, millions of voters turned in early ballots for the US presidential primary elections, often voting for candidates no longer in the race on election day.</p> <p>In Colorado and Texas, <a href=\"https://www.texastribune.org/2020/03/02/buttigieg-klobuchar-early-vote-drop-out/\">early voters</a> for candidates other than Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders might have made a statement, but they didn\u2019t have the chance to influence the primary election. Some of the estimated 20% of Californians who voted early <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2020-03-01/pete-buttigieg-tom-steyer-drop-out-california-primary-early-voting\">asked for</a> a do-over. In Minnesota, 40,000 people had reportedly <a href=\"https://www.mprnews.org/story/2020/02/21/2020-primary-early-voting-in-minnesota\">cast their ballots</a> a week before Super Tuesday \u2013 and days before Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar dropped out.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/feb/28/alabama-pleasant-grove-fight-to-vote\">The majority-black city blocked from electing black officials</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Just yesterday, more than a million Washington voters finally had the chance to weigh in. Unlike other states, which saw long lines and voting machine errors, the state votes by mail and has a highly engaged electorate. As a result, a <a href=\"https://www.sos.wa.gov/elections/research/ballot-return-statistics.aspx\">significant proportion of ballots were returned early</a>, essentially throwing away their vote.</p> <p>Early voting is generally viewed as a good thing by civil rights advocates \u2013 it helps avoid errors on election day, and curbs long lines at the precinct. But voting for soon-to-be unviable candidates is not only a frustrating reality for proactive voters, but intrinsically harmful to the democratic process.</p> <p>Fortunately, there is a simple solution: ranked-choice voting (RCV). And it\u2019s one that has the potential to address a host of other problems that plague our electoral system, including negative campaigning and lack of minority representation.</p> <p>Four states \u2013 Alaska, Kansas, Wyoming and Hawaii \u2013 are already using ranked-choice voting in the current Democratic presidential primaries, and one state, Maine, uses it for state elections and for US Congress and president. New York City also <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/oct/26/new-york-city-ranked-choice-voting-how-it-works\">recently adopted</a> ranked-choice voting beginning in 2021. But most of the country has yet to catch on.</p> <p>Under ranked-choice voting, voters rank their favorite candidates in order of preference, and if their first choice is no longer viable, their vote would count towards their next choice. The process would continue until all votes are supporting viable candidates.</p> <p>If ranked-choice voting had been in place in Washington, voters who turned in their ballot early for Amy Klobuchar, Pete Buttigieg, Mike Bloomberg or Elizabeth Warren could rest assured that their vote would still count towards their next preference rather than being wasted on a candidate who is no longer in the running. And candidates would probably face less pressure to drop out of the race early.</p> <p>But reforming our primary elections is only one benefit.</p> <p>Under the current plurality voting system, candidates benefit from attacking their opponents and highlighting their ideological differences in an effort to appeal to their base. However, in a ranked-choice election, candidates are also campaigning to be voters\u2019 second and third choices.</p> <p>We saw this happen in the 2018 San Francisco mayoral race: two candidates, Mark Leno and Jane Kim, actually <a href=\"https://www.sfweekly.com/topstories/leno-and-kim-endorse-each-other-for-mayor/\">campaigned together</a> to fight for shared values as they reached out to voters in a ranked-choice election. In a political field that is often fraught with negativity, this kind of positive campaigning is a welcome change.</p> <p>This same system, meanwhile, can help historically marginalized communities achieve representation in their own cities.</p> <p>Here in Washington, for example, Yakima county is in the middle of <a href=\"https://campaignlegal.org/sites/default/files/2020-01/Yakima%20notice%20letter%201.15.20.pdf\">a legal challenge</a> under the Washington Voting Rights Act. The population of the county is approximately 49% Latino, but the county has only ever elected one Latino candidate to the county commission \u2013 partly because it has an at-large general election system that dilutes minority voting rights.</p> <p>\u201cWe are trying to ensure that we have a more equitable election system here in Yakima county,\u201d Dulce Guti\u00e9rrez, a plaintiff in the case, and one of the few Latinx city council members elected told us. \u201cWe believe that there are remedies that can improve the likelihood of representation.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>In Yakima, a switch to ranked-choice voting with multi-member districts would help achieve 'proportional representation'</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Historically, the remedy has been to move to majority-minority districts that concentrate minority voters in a particular geographic district in order to garner representation. However, such a system is vulnerable to gerrymandering and vote splitting and, perversely, only protects communities of color that live in highly segregated neighborhoods.</p> <p>In Yakima, a switch to ranked-choice voting with multi-member districts would help achieve \u201cproportional representation\u201d and guarantee that roughly every one-third of the residents is able to pick one of the three commissioners. Latino candidates regularly get more than a third of the countywide vote, but historically are unable to win countywide races.</p> <p>Washington state has been a leader in adopting commonsense reforms, like mandating marriage equality or legalizing marijuana, but it is well behind the curve in electoral reforms like ranked-choice voting.</p> <p>We have plenty of real-life examples of ranked-choice voting working for communities. It\u2019s already used <a href=\"https://www.rankedchoicevoting.org/where_used\">in several countries</a>, including Australia, Scotland and New Zealand. It\u2019s also gathering momentum in the United States, where it is used in over 20 jurisdictions.</p> <p>After all, our democracy is at stake.<strong><br></strong></p> <p>\u2022 Mohit Nair is partnerships director of FairVote Washington.</p> <p>\u2022 Colin Cole is legislative director and a co-founder of FairVote Washington.

  "<p>Afghanistan\u2019s political chaos has deepened with disputes over presidential election results and a planned prisoner exchange delaying peace talks with the Taliban even as the US starts its troop withdrawal.</p> <p>A US agreement with the Taliban, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/29/us-taliban-sign-peace-agreement-afghanistan-war\">signed last month</a>, on the departure of American forces was meant to set the stage for Afghans to reach a deal on their country\u2019s political future after decades of civil war but those talks, expected to begin this week in Oslo, have been postponed indefinitely.</p> <p>The Taliban say they will not sit down unless they get a mass prisoner release that was promised by the US government, but never cleared with the Afghan authorities who actually hold insurgent fighters.</p> <p>The withdrawal agreement with the US calls for 5,000 Taliban fighters to be released before negotiations start, in exchange for 1,000 government security forces. A proposed compromise has already been rejected by the insurgent group.</p> <p>And with two competing presidents both claiming to have won last year\u2019s vote it may prove hard to provide an official delegation for any talks, although the US envoy Zalmay Khalilzad is on the ground in Kabul trying to broker an agreement between incumbent Ashraf Ghani and his main challenger Abdullah Abdullah.</p> <p>The two on Monday held parallel presidential inaugurations just a few hundred metres apart, broadcast nationwide on split screens.</p> <p>Ghani\u2019s position was strengthened after the US, and other key allies, attended his swearing in and officially recognised his victory. In his inauguration speech, Ghani promised a compromise on the US-negotiated prisoner exchange, which he had initially<a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-51695370\"> furiously rejected </a>as a violation of sovereignty.</p> <p>\u201cThe rapid turnaround of President Ghani\u2019s position on prisoner exchange, which up until his ceremony had been quite hardline \u2026 suggested a stark quid pro quo to many observers here in Kabul: US attendance and recognition for a softened stance on this early hurdle in the peace process,\u201d said Andrew Watkins, senior Afghanistan analyst with International Crisis Group.</p> <p>\u201cInternational recognition isn\u2019t the only or even most important source of popular legitimacy for the Afghan government, but for a country so heavily dependent on foreign assistance, yesterday\u2019s tilt in recognition of Ghani was a heavy blow (for Abdullah).\u201d</p> <p>In the early hours of Wednesday, Ghani\u2019s spokesman, Sediq Sediqqi, said on Twitter that he had \u201csigned the decree that would facilitate the release of the Taliban prisoners in accordance with an accepted framework for the start of negotiation\u201d.</p> <p>Ghani\u2019s administration offered a limited release of 1,500 prisoners starting on Saturday, with 100 men going free a day.</p> <p>Once negotiations began, and if the Taliban reduced attacks, the other 3,500 would be released in batches of 500 every fortnight. All those released would have to sign a pledge not to return to the battlefield, Sediqqi said.</p> <p>The Taliban immediately shot down that offer. \u201cWe handed over to the US team a detailed list of 5,000 prisoners that none can tamper with,\u201d tweeted Suhail Shaheen, spokesman for the Taliban\u2019s political office in Doha, where the deal was signed.</p> <p>\u201cWe never agreed to any conditional release of prisoners,\u201d he later told Reuters by phone. \u201cIt is properly explained in the peace accord that first 5,000 prisoners would be freed and then the Afghan dialogue would be initiated.\u201d</p> <p>The deal signed 29 February allows for American troops to leave Afghanistan within 14 months, allowing Donald Trump to fulfil his promise to end America\u2019s longest war and bring home its soldiers.</p> <p>However, the US commander for the Middle East and Afghanistan has already warned this week that the insurgents are not keeping \u201ctheir part of the bargain\u201d, instead continuing to launch attacks.</p> <p>Marine Gen Frank McKenzie was giving evidence to Congress on Tuesday, hours after US forces began pulling out of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/afghanistan\">Afghanistan</a>. The <a href=\"https://www.state.gov/agreement-for-bringing-peace-to-afghanistan/\">US-Taliban deal</a> followed a week-long partial ceasefire, but it did not include an agreement to continue that ceasefire, and attacks have since increased again.</p> <p>\u201cThey are not directed against coalition forces, they are not occurring in city centres, they are occurring at isolated checkpoints,\u201d McKenzie said. \u201cBut those attacks are occurring, and they\u2019re not consistent with a movement toward a negotiated settlement, and they\u2019re not consistent with the undertaking they made.\u201d</p> <p>Trump administration officials have said that the withdrawal of the 13,000-strong US military presence in Afghanistan would be \u201cconditions-based\u201d. But there has been concern in Washington as well as Kabul about what the requirements might be.</p> <p>Detailed terms are laid out in a secret annex that US lawmakers have been able to read, but not share. Several said they were concerned that the terms were too vague, in interviews with<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/08/world/asia/taliban-afghanistan-annexes-peace-agreement.html\"> the New York Times</a>.</p>",

  "<p>Joe Biden secured a key victory in the Democratic presidential nomination race on Tuesday by winning the vital state of Michigan and delivering a major blow to his rival, the Vermont senator Bernie Sanders<strong>.</strong></p> \n<p>The former vice-president also notched wins in the primaries in Mississippi, Missouri and Idaho. North Dakota went to Sanders, and Washington is still to declare.</p> \n<p>Speaking from Philadelphia, Biden sounded confident about Tuesday\u2019s election results and struck a tone that hinted his race against Donald Trump might be beginning.</p> \n<p>\u201cJust over a week ago, many of the pundits declared that this candidacy was dead. Now we\u2019re very much alive,\u201d Biden said. \u201cAlthough there\u2019s a way to go, it looks like we\u2019re going to have another good night.\u201d</p> \n<p>Biden\u2019s remarks sounded at times like a general election speech rather than one for a candidate who has not yet secured the Democratic nomination.</p> \n<p>\u201cTonight, we are a step closer to restoring decency, dignity, and honor to the White House, that\u2019s our ultimate goal,\u201d Biden said. \u201cAt this moment when there\u2019s so much fear in the country, when there\u2019s so much fear across the world, we need American leadership. We need presidential leadership that\u2019s honest, trusted, truthful, and steady.\u201d</p> \n<p>When he mentioned Sanders, Biden didn\u2019t contrast himself with the Vermont senator, but instead thanked him and reached out to his supporters.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/11/five-takeaways-primaries-democrats-joe-biden-bernie-sanders\">Five key takeaways from primaries as Biden's wins pave way to nomination</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>\u201cI want to thank Bernie Sanders and his supporters for their tireless passion,\u201d Biden said. \u201cWe share a common goal and together we\u2019ll defeat Donald Trump.\u201d</p> \n<p>Both the Biden campaign and the Sanders campaign had cancelled scheduled election night rallies in Ohio as a precaution against spreading the coronavirus. In a sign of the seriousness of his defeat Sanders opted against offering remarks and instead returned to his home in Burlington, Vermont.</p> \n<p>Michigan was the most delegate-rich state of the night and a state that Bernie Sanders won four years ago in an upset over Hillary Clinton. Even before half of the states on Tuesday were called it was clear that Sanders\u2019 path to the nomination had become imperiled. Biden had grown his delegate lead over Sanders to 715 over 584, a remarkable sea change in the race from just a month ago when Sanders\u2019 trajectory was toward being the frontrunner in the primary.</p> \n<p>After Michigan though Sanders has to win more than 55% of the remaining delegates to get the nomination, a near herculean feat.</p> \n<p>Democrats began to argue that Biden\u2019s ascension to being the presumptive nominee was close.</p> \n<p>\u201cI just think this is a great signal going forward that people are ready to put someone in there to beat Donald Trump,\u201d said the former Michigan governor Jennifer Granholm on CNN.</p> \n<p>Guy Cecil, the chairman of the Priorities USA super Pac, announced on Tuesday after Missouri and Mississippi was called that his organization would throw its weight behind Biden.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/guycecil/status/1237541280550244352\"> \n <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n  <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">The math is now clear.

Just a few hours before polls opened on Tuesday afternoon both the Sanders campaign and Biden campaign cancelled planned election night events in Ohio as a precautionary measure in response to the coronavirus.</p> \n<p>However, in Washington state, the center of the outbreak in the US where 22 people have died so far, officials believe <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/486674-washington-state-gears-up-for-primary-election-amid-coronavirus-outbreak\">new rules</a> that mean the primary uses <a href=\"https://mynorthwest.com/1750885/wyman-washington-primary-shatter-turnout/?\">mail-in and drop-off ballots</a> rather than a caucus system should prevent disruption, and may even <a href=\"https://mynorthwest.com/1750885/wyman-washington-primary-shatter-turnout/?\">break turnout records as a result</a>.

The rally drew an estimated 10,000 people, underscoring Sanders\u2019 support in the more progressive quarters of the state. Sanders himself conceded the importance of winning Michigan again during his speech. \u201cMichigan is the most important state coming up on Tuesday,\u201d Sanders said.</p> \n<p>But as results came in on Tuesday night and showed Biden\u2019s lead widening beyond reach, Sanders\u2019 Michigan campaign coordinator, Michael Fasullo, addressed supporters and volunteers gathering in Detroit and characterized the night as \u201cdifficult, frustrating\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cThis work is not easy,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard for many reasons. There are entrenched interests and there\u2019s an establishment that wants to see us not succeed, but we continue on throughout this process no matter what.\u201d</p> \n<p>Sanders\u2019 loss in Idaho was another blow; not only did the Vermont senator win the Idaho caucuses in a landslide in 2016, but western states have also been one of his few strong points in recent weeks.</p> \n<p>Biden\u2019s victories on Tuesday night came after his decisive victory in the South Carolina primary, which then boosted him to a remarkable comeback performance last week on Super Tuesday, where he swept a number of states Sanders had been expected to do well in. Since then the Biden campaign has rapidly gained support from former Democratic primary rivals and other elected officials. Former presidential candidates Kamala Harris and Cory Booker endorsed Biden on Sunday and Monday respectively, and held an event with him in Detroit.</p> \n<p><em>Joan E Greve contributed reporting</em></p>",

  "<h2><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/art-cullen\">Art Cullen</a>: \u2018Voters think Biden is most electable\u2019</h2> <p>Democratic voters in exit polls agree with Bernie Sanders on the issues. They favor universal healthcare. They don\u2019t trust billionaires and think the system is rigged against average people. But they didn\u2019t agree that the Vermont senator is their best bet to beat Donald Trump. The establishment didn\u2019t lock Bernie out. Black voters across the south made the pragmatic decision that Joe Biden is the man to unseat the US president. A broad coalition of voters, from suburban women to white men without a college degree, took their cue from South Carolina and flocked around Biden. It was a flood on Tuesday. Florida and Georgia are ready to pile on the bandwagon.</p> <p>Turnout is up across the nation, especially in Michigan, where Biden and not Sanders is the beneficiary. Democrats are declaring they cannot tolerate any more Trump. They believe Biden can manage a panic. The wave has laid Sanders asunder. The hope for the republic is that Sanders supporters can quickly come to terms with the urgency of throwing their support behind the presumptive nominee, Biden.</p> <ul> <li><p>Art Cullen is editor of the Storm Lake Times in north-west Iowa, where he won the Pulitzer prize for editorial writing.

Getting Donald Trump out of office, which is why, I suspect, primary voters went for what they see as the safe choice instead of the candidate promising free healthcare, free college, free puppies and pizza every Friday (and who\u2019s going to pay for it? Billionaires!). That, or young people were too busy making TikToks to show up.</p> <p>What I\u2019m curious about is what comes next: will the legions of young people who knocked on doors and memed their hearts out for Sanders become so disillusioned by the Democratic party that they sit out the general election, write in Bernie Sanders, lodge a protest vote for Trump or leave the party altogether? It\u2019s possible, which means the Biden vote might not be the safe vote after all.</p> <ul> <li><p>Katie Herzog is a writer for the Stranger</p></li> </ul> <h2><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/benjamin-dixon\">Benjamin Dixon</a>: \u2018Do I still belong in the Democratic party?\u2019</h2> <p>It is a surreal feeling seeing the Democratic party establishment celebrate their victories in tonight\u2019s primaries when that victory all but ensures Donald Trump another four years. It\u2019s a strange sensation seeing people in their righteous indignation and in their conviction align themselves with the wrong side of history.</p> <p>\u201cWhy? Because they rejected Bernie Sanders?\u201d</p> <p>No. Because they rejected the hurting, the marginalized, and the left out. The progressive wing of the Democratic party is what it is because it fights for justice without ceasing. The progressive wing has not always gotten it right, but the mistakes were never because we wanted to maintain power at the expense of the powerless.</p> <p>If we\u2019re honest with each other, we don\u2019t want the same things.</p> <p>We want Medicare for All. You want to maintain a system that allows profiteers to exploit the sick and the dying for profits. We want to cancel student debt; you want to see your children work for the next 30 years to pay off a six-figure education that only cost you four figures.</p> <p>We just don\u2019t want the same things. We\u2019ve outgrown each other. We\u2019ve come to terms with the reality that we probably should go our separate ways.</p> <ul> <li><p>Benjamin Dixon is the host of the Benjamin Dixon show</p></li> </ul> <h2><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/malaika-jabali\">Malaika Jabali</a>: \u2018Our party is more divided than ever\u2019</h2> <p>Democratic primary voters made it clearer today that they would stand behind the man who promised that \u201cnothing would fundamentally change\u201d if he\u2019s elected president. The party has compelled voters to choose the lesser of two evils for so long that basic goods \u2013 in the way of Sanders\u2019 proposals for Medicare for All and free college tuition for instance \u2013 seem like snake oil. But the real ruse \u2013 drummed up incessantly by the Democratic party\u2019s establishment \u2013is that only a centrist can defeat a Republican in the general election.</p> <p>With Sanders losing delegate-rich Michigan and probably the nomination, November will probably once again test this unproven theory. Four years of Trump may be sufficient to excite Democrats into voting him out of office. But with four months of debates featuring a stumbling Joe Biden, Ukraine and Hunter Biden being the new \u201cwhat about her emails\u201d, and focus on Biden\u2019s actual policies, it is hard not to imagine this excitement waning for those on the margins in swing states who have yet to vote and who may not vote at all in the primaries.</p> <p>November will also test the limits of the Democratic party\u2019s so-called \u201cunity\u201d candidate. With arguably deeper fissures in the party now than in 2016, what began as a crack seems like a faultline between the party\u2019s younger, progressive voters and older ones committed to turning things to \u201cnormal\u201d. The normal for millennials and Gen-Z, however, is crushing student loan debt, financial insecurity, and a weakened social safety net, whether Trump or Biden is in office. Even if Biden temporarily pulls these groups together on a single day in November, the inability of party leaders to express commitment to the policies the country actually cares about will continue to divide the country.</p> <ul> <li><p>Malaika Jabali is a freelance writer, activist and attorney</p></li> </ul> <h2><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/lloyd-green\">Lloyd Green</a>: \u2018The wind is in Biden\u2019s back.

Facing losses among the sort of rural and white voters without college degrees who were behind his successes in the 2016 primary, his path to the nomination has narrowed to the point that it is imperceptible. Michigan, which he won in 2016 and lost this year, embodies this shift. The one group that Sanders still wins handily \u2013 young voters \u2013 do not vote in sufficient numbers to make up for his losses in the suburbs, in rural towns, and among white and black working-class voters.</p> <p>Everyone\u2019s attention should now turn to negotiating Sanders\u2019 exit from the race in the way best calculated to defeat Donald Trump. Sanders has built a powerful and proud movement which will not just help Biden but also down-ballot progressive causes and candidates in November, if only it can be won over. Sanders will probably never run for president again and much of his legacy will be determined by the role he plays between now and November. Biden needs to show that he takes this movement seriously, and Sanders should respond by endorsing Biden speedily and campaigning for him with energy. It\u2019s the best way to send Trump into retirement, and to keep the hopes of the progressive movement alive</p> <ul> <li><p>Andrew Gawthorpe is a historian of the United States at Leiden University</p></li> </ul>",
  "<p>The political world has fundamentally changed in the last two and a half weeks.</p> <p>All the way back in mid-February, Donald Trump <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2020/03/politics/coronavirus-trump-cdc-timeline/\">brushed</a> aside the coronavirus as \u201cvery much under control in the USA\u201d.

In the short span of a couple of weeks, American voters have traveled a very long way. If the coronavirus sweeps across the country as the experts predict, that journey will only accelerate, reframing this year\u2019s elections in profound ways.</p> <p>Tuesday\u2019s primaries confirmed the extraordinary transformation of Joe Biden\u2019s campaign, from almost dead-man-walking to almost dead-certain nominee. There are almost no similar cases of a candidate bouncing into such a wide lead in such a short time.</p> <p>The last comparable candidate was John Kerry in 2004, <a href=\"https://www.pollingreport.com/wh04dem.htm\">moving</a> from single-digits in mid-December to more than 50% of Democratic voters in mid-February. That was after Kerry\u2019s comeback win in Iowa, followed by the swift collapse of an earlier leftwing populist from Vermont: Howard Dean.</p> <p>Biden\u2019s resurrection is even more dramatic, moving almost as many points in the polls in half the time. It\u2019s true he was never quite as dismally low in the polls as Kerry. But one month ago, the former vice-president was <a href=\"https://poll.qu.edu/national/release-detail?ReleaseID=3655\">barely</a> ahead of Mike Bloomberg, Elizabeth Warren and Pete Buttigieg.</p> <p>With his blowout wins in Missouri and Mississippi on Tuesday, Biden has all but ended the Democratic contest. Missouri was essentially a tie between Sanders and Hillary Clinton four years ago. Now Sanders has declined so sharply the news networks could call the race shortly after the polls closed.</p> <p>In the biggest contest of the night, in the battleground state of Michigan, Sanders once again underperformed compared with 2016, when he struck a blow against the establishment by winning a surprise victory in the upper mid-west.</p> <p>Sanders\u2019 die-hard supporters have been vocal in their despair, turning their fire variously on the dropout candidates, the party\u2019s elected officials, and the news media. They cannot begin to consider that their candidate\u2019s coalition of diverse, younger voters is nowhere near large enough to win the party\u2019s nomination across the country.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/11/five-takeaways-primaries-democrats-joe-biden-bernie-sanders\">Five key takeaways from primaries as Biden's wins pave way to nomination</a> </p> </aside>  <p>However, the disappointment of the left is only a small part of the story behind Biden\u2019s victory. Democratic voters made it crystal clear in every poll in every state that their overwhelming desire is to beat Trump. The kind of transformative change they were desperately seeking was to kick Trump out of office \u2013 even more than restructuring healthcare and free college tuition, which they wholeheartedly support.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s entirely botched response to the coronavirus pandemic has only intensified this electoral choice. Instead of simply voting for the most electable candidate, Democrats are now voting for the most competent president. In that context, there is vastly more reason to trust a former vice-president than an insurgent outsider.</p> <p>According to CNN\u2019s exit <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/10/politics/exit-polls-michigan-missouri-mississippi-washington/index.html\">polls</a>, nearly 60% of Democratic voters in Missouri said they trusted Biden to handle a crisis, compared with about 25% who said they trusted Sanders. In Michigan and Washington state, the numbers were not much better for Bernie.</p> <p>Other polls underscore how powerful this case is for Biden in his likely general election against Trump. In a <a href=\"https://poll.qu.edu/national/release-detail?ReleaseID=3657\">recent</a> national poll of registered voters of all parties, Biden beats Trump by 16 points on the question of who would do a better job of handling a crisis, while Sanders is ahead by just six points.</p> <p>Those numbers landed before the most devastating effects of the coronavirus crisis on communities, patients and the economy. The next two months may not just effectively end the Democratic nomination contest; they may effectively end the entire Trump presidency.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The next two months may not just effectively end the Democratic nomination contest; they may effectively end the entire Trump presidency</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>For a while on Tuesday night, the only good news for Sanders supporters looked like the screw-up on CNN when the on-air graphics mistakenly suggested that their candidate had won Mississippi.</p> <p>In reality, Biden had won the state.

Just a few weeks ago, centrist Democrats were gaming out ways in which the party\u2019s superdelegates could deny Sanders the nomination. Nowadays leftist Democrats are joining forces with the Trump campaign to spread disinformation about Biden\u2019s health.</p> <p>Biden ignored those malcontents in his victory speech on Tuesday, delivered at the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia without a virus-carrying audience of staffers and supporters. He thanked Sanders\u2019 base for \u201ctheir tireless energy and their passion\u201d, which is one way to put it. \u201cWe share a common goal, and together we\u2019ll defeat Donald Trump,\u201d he explained.</p> <p>Even more powerfully, Biden cast his own comeback as a model for the whole country. \u201cIt\u2019s a comeback for the soul of this nation,\u201d he said. And he cast the response to the coronavirus crisis as a response to three and a half years of living in a constant Trump crisis.</p> <p>\u201cAt this moment, when there\u2019s so much fear in the country and there\u2019s so much fear across the world, we need American leadership,\u201d Biden declared. \u201cWe need presidential leadership that\u2019s honest, trusted, truthful and steady.\u201d</p> <p>Those are lofty standards that used to seem normal. Now Joe Biden has to live by them every day for the next several months of a health crisis we can barely comprehend.</p>",
  "<p>Joe Biden had a big night of wins that are paving a clear path to the Democratic presidential nomination with commanding victories in Mississippi, Missouri and Michigan, a state that was vital to his rival Bernie Sanders.</p> <p>Here are five key takeaways from a night that appears to have put Biden on an unstoppable march to become the Democrats\u2019 2020 champion against Donald Trump in November.</p> <h2><strong>Michigan could be a knockout blow for Sanders</strong></h2> <p>Bernie Sanders lost Michigan, a state that by his own admission was \u201cenormously\u201d important to his chances of becoming the Democratic nominee. It was not only the most delegate-rich of the six states holding primary contests on Tuesday, it was symbolically important, too.</p> <p>Four years ago, Sanders upset Hillary Clinton in the state and revived his underdog bid. Then Trump snatched the state from Democrats and won the election. This time around, a win there on Tuesday would have helped build enthusiasm for Sanders ahead of next week\u2019s consequential slate of primaries and bolster his case that he is the strongest contender to take on Trump. But this year the state delivered a serious blow to Sanders.</p> <p>Propelled by a surge of support in the suburbs, Biden won counties that broke heavily for Sanders in 2016. The result suggests that at least part of Sanders\u2019 support in 2016 was a protest vote against Clinton. This time around proved to be more difficult for Sanders in part because Biden does not share Clinton\u2019s vulnerabilities with rural, working-class voters. At the same time, suburban voters, many of whom may have sat out or voted in the Republican primary four years ago, flocked to Biden.</p> <h2><strong>The establishment strikes back</strong></h2> <p>Before polls closed on the west coast, Biden had been declared the \u201cpresumptive nominee\u201d and the \u201cprohibitive\u201d favorite by most pundits. Former presidential candidate Andrew Yang said the math added up to only one outcome: Biden as the nominee. He then endorsed the former vice-president on live TV.</p> <p>In the past 10 days since the South Carolina primary, the Democratic establishment has coalesced behind Biden in a rapid, unprecedented fashion. Every candidate that has dropped out since then has endorsed him, excluding Elizabeth Warren who has notably not backed anyone. On Tuesday, two Democratic super Pacs that had stayed neutral in primary said they were prepared to get to work for Biden.</p> <p>\u201cThe math is now clear\u201d said Guy Cecil, chairman of Priorities USA, the largest Democratic Super Pac. \u201cJoe Biden is going to be the Democratic nominee for President and<a href=\"https://twitter.com/prioritiesUSA\"> @prioritiesUSA</a> is going to do everything we can to help him defeat Donald Trump in November. I hope others will join us in the fight.\u201d</p> <p>Bradley Beychok, the president of the liberal Super Pac American Bridge, announced it was \u201cALL IN to elect<a href=\"https://twitter.com/JoeBiden\"> @JoeBiden</a> as our next President\u201d.</p> <p>In remarks from Philadelphia on Tuesday night, Biden sought to look past the nomination fight: \u201cI want to thank Bernie Sanders and his supporters for their tireless energy and their passion. We share a common goal and together, we\u2019ll defeat Donald Trump.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Black voters lift Biden again</strong></h2> <p>After Biden\u2019s clean sweep of southern states last week on the strength of his support among African American voters, it was widely projected that he would continue the streak. As soon as polls closed on Tuesday, Biden was declared the projected winner of Mississippi and Missouri, two southern states with large black electorates.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/election/2020/entrance-and-exit-polls/mississippi/democratic\">According to CNN</a>, Biden won the support of a staggering 96% of black voters aged 60 or older in Mississippi, a constituency that made up nearly a third of the Democratic primary electorate in the state.</p> <p>Over the last four years Sanders attempted to make inroads with black voters in the south, cultivating a friendship with Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba of Jackson, a rising star in the party who endorsed the senator. But after his Super Tuesday losses, the Sanders campaign effectively conceded the south to Biden, by cancelling a rally in Mississippi and shifting his focus on the midwest.</p> <p>African American voters have picked the eventual Democratic nominee in every presidential primary since 1992. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"556f8653a0bca9f8f3f4a13175f0397bff0bf4f5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/556f8653a0bca9f8f3f4a13175f0397bff0bf4f5/0_0_3500_2333/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A microphone stand set up for Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders stands empty inside of a room in Burlington, Vermont, on Tuesday.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A microphone stand set up for Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders stands empty inside of a room in Burlington, Vermont, on Tuesday.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lucas Jackson/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>What\u2019s Sanders\u2019</strong><strong> next move? Quit or slog on?</strong></h2> <p>Since entering the race last year, Sanders has sought a two-person showdown with Biden. In the past weeks, his campaign has ramped up his criticism of Biden, hitting him for his support for the Iraq war and past comments on cutting social security, even engaging in debates about his general election prospects against Trump and overall acuity. But none of it has had much of an impact with voters.</p> <p>For a second week in a row, Democratic voters made it abundantly clear they are ready to end the primary contest and begin the tricky process of unifying the party together ahead of a general election fight with Trump.</p> <p>Sanders is at a crossroads in his campaign: does he wage an all-out assault on Biden over their policy differences in a last-ditch attempt to shift the race or does he choose to champion the progressive movement within the party and use his leverage to push Biden leftward.</p> <p>In 2016, Sanders stayed in the race until June, a decision many Democrats believe weakened Clinton in the general election by prolonging the nominating contest.</p> <p>On Tuesday, Sanders returned home and was not expected to address reporters, according to his campaign. His choice will probably be clearer on Sunday, when the candidates are due to face off in a one-on-one debate in Arizona. Two days later, Arizona, Florida, Illinois and Ohio hold primaries. Sanders lost all four in 2016.</p> <h2><strong>Coronavirus fears hit the 2020 presidential race</strong></h2> <p>As the number of Americans with coronavirus neared 1,000, Sanders convened a roundtable discussion about the virus with five public health experts in Detroit.</p> <p>A reporter asked the Vermont senator whether he planned to scale back any of his events due to the size of his rallies, noting that he often holds rallies with \u201cmore than 10,000 people\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cFifteen thousand,\u201d Sanders replied. Realizing his boast, the senator quickly added: \u201cWe do not go forward without consultation with local health officials.\u201d </p> <p>The next day, both Sanders and Biden cancelled election night events in Cleveland following the announcement of new protocols implemented by the Ohio governor to stop the spread of the coronavirus. Shortly thereafter, the host of the next Democratic debate, which will take place on 15 March in Phoenix, announced that there will be no live audience, press filing center or spin room for the event.</p> <p>As the outbreak disrupts the campaign, it\u2019s also highlighting the candidates strengths and weaknesses as they vie for the job of commander-in-chief. While Sanders has used the outbreak to critique the American healthcare system and argue his case for Medicare for All, Biden has taken the opportunity to showcase his executive experience.</p> <p>On the question of who voters trust to handle a major crisis, the former vice-president leads the Vermont senator by wide margins in several of the states with primary contests on Tuesday. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ABCPolitics/status/1237507351776804864\">According to exit polls, </a>61% of voters believed Biden was better suited to the task compared with 27% for Sanders in Missouri. That margin was 46% to 27% in Washington and 51% to 32% among in-person voters in Michigan.</p>",
  "<p>Donald Trump has always been obsessed with his predecessor and polar opposite, Barack Obama. It was therefore perhaps preordained that, barring a political sensation, he will likely have to fight for re-election against Obama\u2019s former right-hand man.</p> <p>Joe Biden appears to be running away with the Democratic primary race after he beat Senator Bernie Sanders in at least three states on Tuesday including Michigan, which had been billed as make-or-break for his opponent. Once again it was the former vice-president and establishment favorite Biden, not the Vermont democratic socialist Sanders, who boosted turnout.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Voters showed that above all they yearn to turn back the clock and default the country back to factory settings</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>After 10 debates, millions of dollars spent and countless rallies and town halls among two dozen candidates, Democratic voters showed that above all they yearn to turn back the clock and render Trump a four-year aberration. They are looking to default the country back to factory settings.</p> <p>Progressives had argued this would be a fallacy, that the America of 2016 contained the seeds of its own destruction and that ultimately, Trump is a symptom of dysfunction rather than a cause. But the party\u2019s disciplined coalescing around Biden suggests trying to put the genie back in the bottle was irresistible.</p> <p>The push for a third term of Obama did not work out so well in 2016, when his former secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, lost to Trump. There were clues in Tuesday\u2019s results that suggest Biden can do better \u2013 but other reasons to think his flaws as a candidate might be even greater.</p> <p>Seemingly down and out just a month ago after beatings in Iowa and New Hampshire, Biden powered through South Carolina and Super Tuesday states like a juggernaut, apparently in spite of weak performances and his campaign team rather than because of them.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/10/democratic-primaries-joe-biden-bernie-sanders\">Joe Biden wins key state of Michigan in major blow to Bernie Sanders</a> </p> </aside>  <p>That set up Tuesday as a replay of the 2016 primary, with Biden stepping into Clinton\u2019s shoes and Sanders reprising his own role. But whereas Sanders won Michigan that night four years ago, gaining fresh impetus for months of bitter fighting, he was on course to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/10/democratic-primaries-joe-biden-bernie-sanders\">los</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/10/democratic-primaries-joe-biden-bernie-sanders\">e it</a> by double digits on Tuesday. He was also down in Missouri and, as expected, was crushed in Mississippi, having never worked out <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/09/us/politics/bernie-sanders-black-voters.html\">how to appeal to African Americans.</a></p> <p>Voters appear to have bought the centrists\u2019 argument that Sanders would suffer the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/feb/15/the-electability-business-is-bernie-sanders-americas-corbyn\">same fate as Labour\u2019s Jeremy Corbyn</a> in Britain. Even in early states that he won, Sanders failed to expand his base compared with four years ago, except among Latino voters. In Michigan, exit polls say, Biden won black voters 66% to 29%.</p> <p>In Missouri, among white voters without college degrees, CNN exit polls found Sanders had beaten Clinton 64% to 36% in 2016, but in 2020 Biden beat Sanders 60% to 33% \u2013 a massive swing. This much mythologized group \u2013 the subject of endless journalistic \u201csafaris\u201d in the midwest \u2013 were a critical constituency for Sanders against Clinton. They also provided a warning for how Clinton would fare against Trump. There are three likely reasons why Biden performed much better among them.</p> <p>One is that they may have been driven by anti-Clinton sentiment in 2016: their vote for Sanders was not so much about him as a protest against her. Another is that the stakes are different this time: the nightmare of the Trump presidency has instilled pragmatic urgency, whereas in 2016 it was merely a fanciful possibility.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/10/sanders-michigan-loss-crushes-staff-and-supporters\">\u2018Hard to comprehend\u2019: Sanders\u2019 loss in Michigan crushes staff and supporters</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Third, there is Biden himself. His manner can be earthy, pugnacious and unpolished, different from the elitist New York image that dogged Clinton. Long before this election cycle began, pundits were speculating that the straight-talking former senator from Scranton, Pennsylvania, would have done better at appealing to blue-collar voters.</p> <p>Unlike Clinton, fairly or otherwise, Biden is seen as having that magic elixir: authenticity. And as with Trump, his gaffes only seem to prove the point.</p> <p>The Democratic primary is not over yet. This election has had many twists and turns. But with states such as Florida and Georgia voting later this month, things are likely to get worse for Sanders rather than better. The coronavirus outbreak is causing rallies to be cancelled, denying Sanders crucial oxygen while protecting Biden from gaffes and scrutiny. Ominously, Sanders spent Tuesday night back in silent retreat in Vermont, while Biden gave a speech that observers praised as presidential.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Republicans will dust off the playbook used against Clinton</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But in their rush to unite and desperation to beat Trump, Democrats risk overlooking their new champion\u2019s obvious flaws.</p> <p>Association with Obama can be an asset to one side of America but a dog whistle to the other. Republicans will dust off the playbook that was used against Clinton: Biden as establishment figure or, to put it another way, swamp creature. Instead of Bill Clinton\u2019s alleged corruption and womanizing, it will be Biden\u2019s son Hunter\u2019s alleged corruption and womanizing.</p> <p>And instead of Clinton\u2019s gender, it will be Biden\u2019s age. At 77, he is four years older than Trump and would be the oldest US president ever elected. He does not wear it lightly, with verbal slips that seem to be coming thicker and faster than ever. And he remains dangerously unpredictable.</p> <p>Touring an assembly plant on Tuesday, Biden was accused by a construction worker of wanting to take away people\u2019s guns. Biden replied: \u201cYou\u2019re full of shit.\u201d As the worker argued, Biden snapped: \u201cDon\u2019t tell me that, pal, or I\u2019m going to go outside with you, man.\u201d The worker objected: \u201cYou\u2019re working for me, man!\u201d Biden retorted: \u201cI\u2019m not working for you. Don\u2019t be such a horse\u2019s ass.\u201d</p> <p>It is hard to imagine Clinton ever having such an outburst or, if she did, ever being forgiven for it. So Biden v Trump, if it happens, will not quite be the same as Clinton v Trump. But Biden and Clinton do share one inescapable burden: they\u2019re no Barack Obama.</p>",

This includes what\u2019s known as \u201c<a href=\"https://foodfirst.org/what-is-parity-and-why-you-should-care/\">parity</a>\u201d \u2013 a fair price for farmers\u2019 crops, guaranteed by the government, to prevent overproduction and market chaos.</p> \n   <p>Subsidies that currently <a href=\"https://ips-dc.org/we-subsidize-the-wrong-kind-of-agriculture/\">propel</a> farming consolidation and mass production of commodities for livestock feed and fuel must be reformed to promote organic, smaller-scale, regionally and local foods. This will help farmers survive and provide communities with resilient and diverse food supplies rather than depending on vast and fragile corporate food supply chains.</p> \n   <p>If there were ever a time to bust up the food and farming monopolies, which are reminiscent of the Beef Trust of the early 1900s, now is it. Centralized corporate power is creating agricultural and economic mono-cropping at a time when we most need a food system that\u2019s diverse, equitable and sustainable.</p> \n   <p>The Covid-19 crisis and worsening climate chaos require far more public-sector direction and coordination of something as central to human survival as food.</p> \n   <p>Amid the current supply-chain breakdown, as news spread of gargantuan food waste, some <a href=\"https://www.wkbw.com/news/state-news/new-york-state-farmers-donate-34-000-pounds-of-milk-beef-and-produce-to-nyc-families-in-need?fbclid=IwAR0L4qkyEIvINGqaGblka5BiOrPTgo-nazaGBJYCfFNmFZ_Zc2NMqz81txU\">farmers</a> and <a href=\"https://www.king5.com/article/news/health/coronavirus/caravan-brings-thousands-of-pound-to-produce-to-western-washington-for-families-in-need/281-1eae725e-6923-4bcc-b7e2-ffb86f4ad56b?fbclid=IwAR2jloI75BLLJRtGwr2uRvLSTU4PlszVTxfkitpzxyheVfiS-euVBTKVfLA\">caravans</a> of volunteers have helped deliver food directly from the farms to people in need \u2013 a truly heroic gift.</p> \n   <p>But this vital act, feeding people in need and averting massive food waste, can\u2019t be left to random acts of kindness.

  "<p>The Tampa, Florida, rally for Joe Biden on Thursday evening began as it normally might have, before a once-in-a-century pandemic transformed all aspects of American life, including the presidential campaign. A local high school student recited the pledge of allegiance, a campaign organizer pleaded with supporters to volunteer and a local DJ spun R&amp;B music between speakers.</p> \n<p>But in a sign of how profoundly the coronavirus crisis has reshaped American politics, that was where the similarities ended.</p> \n<p>With much of the US still in lockdown, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee has been forced <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/17/joe-biden-presidential-campaign-online-lockdown-coronavirus\">to take his campaign to unseat Donald Trump online</a>. It has not always been easy.</p> \n<p>His campaign\u2019s first attempt to recreate a traditional rally \u2013 part of a virtual swing through the battleground state of Florida \u2013 was later described by his opponents as an \u201cunmitigated technological failure\u201d. The video stream was glitchy and pixelated. The audio was choppy, rendering some remarks nearly incomprehensible. And there were lengthy delays between speakers and at one point, the feed went dark for several minutes.</p> \n<p>\u201cAm I on?\u201d asked Biden, beaming into the telecast from his home in Wilmington, Delaware, where he has been isolated since the middle of March. An off-camera voice replied that he was. Biden removed a pair of aviator sunglasses as he walked toward the camera.</p> \n<p>\u201cGood evening, Tampa. Thanks so much for tuning in,\u201d he continued, a hint of irritation in his voice. \u201cI wish we could have done this together \u2013 and it had gone a little more smoothly.\u201d</p> \n<p>For nearly two months, Biden has been the test subject in a novel political experiment: running for president in the age of Covid-19.</p> \n<p>Social distancing restrictions imposed to stop the spread of the virus have already starved the campaign of a victory tour to mark his ascent to the Democratic nomination. It may well deny Democrats the chance to formally nominate him in person at the party\u2019s national convention this summer. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/14/barack-obama-endorse-joe-biden-2020-election-democrats\">Endorsements from former rivals and party leaders </a>occur online to varying degrees of fanfare. . The remote set-up, anathema to Biden\u2019s back-slapping, glad-handing approach to politics, has left the candidate walled off from voters and competing for visibility.</p> \n<p>Yet, technical difficulties aside, his campaign of confinement seems to be working.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"afcfad2a2846b6e42514bb7dd410dca7e6fa02ea\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/afcfad2a2846b6e42514bb7dd410dca7e6fa02ea/88_0_1800_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Joe Biden and Hillary Clinton at a virtual town hall during which she endorsed him last month.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Joe Biden and Hillary Clinton at a virtual town hall during which she endorsed him last month.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Joe Biden Presidential Campaign HANDOUT/EPA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>In recent weeks, Biden has <a href=\"https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2020/president/us/general_election_trump_vs_biden-6247.html\">widened </a>his lead over Trump as the president\u2019s support slips amid <a href=\"https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/coronavirus-polls/\">growing disapproval</a> of his response to the pandemic. Surveys from Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, Florida, North Carolina and Arizona \u2013 key battlegrounds that Trump won in 2016 \u2013 show Biden ahead. At a recent virtual fundraiser last week, Jennifer O\u2019Malley Dillon, his new campaign manager, expressed optimism about Biden\u2019s prospects in Florida and Arizona.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe natural state of this race is to be a referendum on Donald Trump and every time Donald Trump steps to the microphone he hurts himself,\u201d said Mark Mellman, a veteran Democratic pollster. \u201cThat\u2019s a pretty good position for Joe Biden to be in.\u201d</p> \n<p>Biden initially struggled to adapt to his cloistered reality. In March, the campaign turned a recreation room in the basement of his home into a studio, though not fast enough for his critics, who launched a \u201cWhere\u2019s Joe\u201d campaign to mark the candidate\u2019s relative disappearance from the national stage.</p> \n<p>But since then, Biden has been busy. Nearly every day he makes appearances on local TV news channels or national talkshows. He launched a podcast, where he has hosted conversations with prominent Democratic governors and potential vice-presidential candidates. He spends time each day speaking with a voter \u2013 a frontline worker, campaign volunteers \u2013 and he participated in what the campaign billed as a \u201cvirtual rope line\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cSo what\u2019s up?\u201d he <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdxMuFBihZM\">said</a> to Ashley Ruiz of Fort Lauderdale, Florida, one of several voters on the rope line. \u201cTell me about your situation, Ash.\u201d</p> \n<p><strong>\u2022\u2022\u2022</strong></p> \n<p>Biden\u2019s rise in the polls comes as he contends with an allegation from Tara Reade, a former aide in his Senate office who accused him of sexual assault in 1993. In an interview this week with Megyn Kelly, the former Fox News and NBC television host, Reade said <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/07/tara-reade-megyn-kelly-interview-joe-biden-drop-out\">he should withdraw from the presidential race</a>.</p> \n<p>Biden has forcefully denied the allegation. \u201cIt\u2019s not true, I am saying unequivocally. It never, never happened,\u201d he said last week, in an interview addressing her claim for the first time publicly.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/02/joe-biden-tara-reade-allegations-metoo-trump\">Democrats' downplaying of the Biden allegations will damage #MeToo | Arwa Mahdawi</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Publicly, Democrats, including prominent #MeToo advocates, have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/03/gretchen-whitmer-backs-joe-biden-sexual-assault\">rallied around Biden</a>, though privately some in the party have expressed concern about the continuous drip of reporting on the matter.</p> \n<p>So far the allegation appears to have marginally dented his reputation, but not his lead. Most voters \u2013 86% \u2013 are aware of the allegation, according to a Monmouth poll, which found the electorate divided over whether they viewed the claim as credible. At the same time, the poll showed Biden nine points ahead of Trump.</p> \n<p>Despite Trump\u2019s falling electoral fortunes, many Democrats remain anxious about Biden\u2019s position \u2013 and his strategy.</p> \n<p>David Axelrod and David Plouffe, two of Barack Obama\u2019s top campaign strategists, implored Biden\u2019s campaign to expand its digital footprint in a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/04/opinion/axelrod-plouffe-joe-biden.html\">joint New York Times op-ed</a> that compared the atmospherics of the candidate\u2019s home videos<strong> </strong>to \u201can astronaut beaming back to earth from the International Space Station\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cOnline speeches from his basement won\u2019t cut it,\u201d they wrote.</p> \n<p>Lis Smith, the former top adviser to Pete Buttigieg\u2019s presidential campaign, followed with an<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/07/opinion/joe-biden-trump-2020.html?smtyp=cur&amp;smid=tw-nytopinion\"> op-ed on Thursday</a> that offered a blueprint for turning Biden into the \u201chottest bad boy and disrupter in the media game\u201d. She suggested his campaign use TV appearances and digital content to highlight Biden\u2019s empathy, a trait even supporters say the president has lacked in response to the rising coronavirus death toll.</p> \n<p>Part of the campaign\u2019s evolving digital strategy includes partnering with groups that already have an online presence, like <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/JoeMamas2020\">JoeMamas2020</a>, a national coalition of \u201cmoms, caregivers, moms to be, aunts &amp; all the parental figures in between\u201d with about 27,000 Facebook and 1,200 Twitter followers. The group has helped amplify Biden\u2019s appearances and policy proposals while spreading the word about upcoming events.</p> \n<p>Julie Zebrak, the group\u2019s co-founder, said the online army is growing with women energized to help elect a candidate who promises to restore stability and calm after four years of what Trump\u2019s critics view as chaos and controversy.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe are all extremely enthusiastic for Joe Biden to beat Donald Trump,\u201d she said.</p> \n<p>Yet the same traits that endear Biden to a growing coalition of suburban women and Never Trump Republicans have largely failed to excite younger, progressive voters. It\u2019s not that they prefer Trump \u2013 they don\u2019t \u2013 but a lack of enthusiasm among those voters could spell trouble in November if they stay home or vote for a third-party candidate.</p> \n<p>The campaign has also ramped up its outreach to young people, who overwhelmingly supported Biden\u2019s rival Bernie Sanders. On Friday, Biden presented his economic pitch in an appearance on NowThis, a social-media-heavy news outlet with a young, progressive audience.</p> \n<p>\u201cThis crisis hit harder and will last longer because Donald Trump spent the last three years undermining the core pillars of our economic strength,\u201d Biden <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/NowThisPolitics/videos/278343589989804\">said</a> in remarks that attacked Trump\u2019s stimulus efforts a kind of \u201ccronyism\u201d and corporate welfare. Before he began speaking, Biden removed a face mask, a pointed rebuke of the president who had refused to wear one.</p> \n<p>Still, new <a href=\"https://nextgenamerica.org/research/\">research</a> conducted on behalf of NextGen America found many young people weren\u2019t convinced Biden\u2019s policies meet the scale of the challenges bearing down on their generation.</p> \n<p>This makes the efforts of groups like Progressive Turnout Project, which endorsed him this week, all the more important. In the coming months, the group is investing more than $52m to turn out low-propensity Democratic voters \u2013 including young people and people of color \u2013 in 17 key battleground states.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe best thing we can do is go and knock on doors and have face-to-face conversations with voters,\u201d said Alex Morgan, the group\u2019s executive director. \u201cWe are still looking to do that. But it\u2019ll be knocking on that door and then taking a few big steps back and having a more distant conversation.\u201d</p> \n<p><strong>\u2022\u2022\u2022</strong></p> \n<p>Biden\u2019s campaign also faces another looming threat. The Michigan congressman Justin Amash, who left the Republican party last year after voting to impeach Trump, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/03/justin-amash-libertarian-2020-election-trump-win-critics\">recently announced</a> that he would seek the Libertarian party nomination.</p> \n<p>His entrance has alarmed Democrats, who fear he could siphon off Never Trump voters who might otherwise back Biden, particularly in Amash\u2019s home state of Michigan, where third-party candidates pulled away a combined 5% of the vote share in 2016. Hillary Clinton lost the state by just 10,704 votes, less than 0.25%.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"65f2635a13f2d6e816e814bead1ccc1686037e92\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/65f2635a13f2d6e816e814bead1ccc1686037e92/0_19_4096_2458/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Barack Obama endorses Biden via video message in mid-April.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Barack Obama endorses Biden via video message in mid-April.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Brian Cahn/Zuma Wire/Rex/Shutterstock</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Many Democrats believe Biden\u2019s fate may well rest on his ability to persuade their own side to vote.</p> \n<p>\u201cTrump has shown no desire or ability to moderate for those swing voters in this election,\u201d said Addisu Demissie, who served as Cory Booker\u2019s presidential campaign manager. \u201cSo those voters are now likely going to end up either Biden voters or non-voters or third-party voters, and that\u2019s the competition.\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/03/justin-amash-libertarian-2020-election-trump-win-critics\">'Are you a spoiler?': why critics fear Amash's Libertarian bid may ensure a Trump win</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>This week, Trump traveled to the battleground state of Arizona, where he toured a medical mask facility without wearing one himself. The visit was a symbolic show of his administration\u2019s push to reopen the US economy but there were unmistakable elements of his signature campaign rallies, including the music that played when Trump finished his remarks (the Rolling Stones\u2019 You Can\u2019t Always Get What You Want).</p> \n<p>Trump\u2019s cross-country venture stood in striking contrast to Biden\u2019s virtual swing through Florida \u2013 which included a rally, a roundtable in Jacksonville and an appearance on the local news in Tampa. The technical glitches only further highlighted the limitations of his confinement.</p> \n<p>But the coronavirus has also upended Trump\u2019s strategy, erasing the booming economy he has made a centerpiece of his re-election campaign. In recent weeks, his campaign has all but abandoned championing the president\u2019s leadership, instead focusing its efforts on diminishing Biden.</p> \n<p>Trump\u2019s campaign manager, Brad Parscale, previewed the onslaught on Twitter this week, comparing the Trump re-election juggernaut to the Death Star from the Star Wars movies. \u201cIn a few days we start pressing FIRE for the first time,\u201d he <a href=\"https://twitter.com/parscale/status/1258388669544759296\">wrote</a>.</p> \n<p>As Trump prepares to make even greater use of the advantages of incumbency, Biden faces his biggest test yet.

She is waiting to hear if she will be granted clemency or instead returned to jail.

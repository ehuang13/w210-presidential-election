  "<p>Donald Trump isn\u2019t much of a doctor or scientist. He isn\u2019t much of a diplomat or general. His leadership skills match his business skills. There\u2019s a <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2016/live-updates/general-election/real-time-fact-checking-and-analysis-of-the-first-presidential-debate/fact-check-has-trump-declared-bankruptcy-four-or-six-times/\">reason</a> his companies went bankrupt so many times.</p> <p>But he might just be a pioneer with this idea of letting people die for the sake of the country. Only a once-in-a-century leader has the guts to say out loud what the worst among us are really thinking: everyone other than me is expendable.</p> <p>Anyone older is past it, for sure. The younger ones we can easily afford to lose: they don\u2019t actually pay for anything. The smarter ones? Totally annoying. The dumber ones: what\u2019s even the point?</p> <p>The sick are a real drain on us, financially and emotionally. The poor won\u2019t really do much in the long run, no matter how hard we try. The wealthy just keep shoving it in your face. Foreigners aren\u2019t like us at all. And our neighbors are frankly a bit too close for comfort.</p> <p>So when you add it all up, it\u2019s only sensible that we ask everyone else to sacrifice themselves for us. For the sake of the nation and all that\u2019s good, please just go, so that the rest of us \u2013 not counting the undesirables \u2013 can get back to our old lives.</p> <p>\u201cLook, you\u2019re going to lose a number of people to the flu,\u201d this pandemic of a president told Fox News on Tuesday. \u201cBut you\u2019re going to lose more people by putting a country into a massive recession or depression. You\u2019re going to lose people. You\u2019re going to have suicides by the thousands. You\u2019re going to have all sorts of things happen. You\u2019re going to have instability.\u201d</p> <p>Mr President, it might come as a shock to you but we are currently suffering from a viral case of instability, and you are one of its hotspots. As you surely recall, if you lift all restrictions, the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/16/us/coronavirus-fatality-rate-white-house.html\">estimated</a> death count is 2.2 million Americans.</p> <p>\u201cYou can\u2019t just come in and say, \u2018Let\u2019s close up the United States of America,\u2019\u201d continued the president who prides himself on closing the borders of, um, the United States of America.</p> <p>Being a fundamentally religious man, albeit one with a love of <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-cohen/fbi-documents-point-to-trump-role-in-hush-money-for-porn-star-daniels-idUSKCN1UD18D\">paying off</a> porn stars, Trump has a full resurrection in mind for the country in all of two weeks. \u201cI would love to have it open by Easter,\u201d he told the normally diligent hoax-busters at Fox News. \u201cI will, I will tell you that right now. I would love to have that. It\u2019s such an important day for other reasons, but I\u2019ll make it an important day for this too.\u201d</p> <p>Pray tell: what are those other reasons that Easter is important? Perhaps if we could discuss those reasons, you might rethink this one. It seems \u2013 how to put this diplomatically? \u2013 a little perverse to kill large swaths of the population to celebrate Jesus Christ rising from the dead. The White House comms team might think it\u2019s confusing to mix one message of rebirth with another about mass death.</p> <p>Of course, this kind of party-pooping epidemiology is so typical of the elites. They just don\u2019t get it. Or worse: they\u2019re trying to save lives just so they can hurt Donald Trump\u2019s re-election.</p> <p>\u201cThe LameStream Media is the dominant force in trying to get me to keep our Country closed as long as possible in the hope that it will be detrimental to my election success,\u201d <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1242905328209080331\">tweeted</a> our LameStream President on Wednesday. \u201cThe real people want to get back to work ASAP. We will be stronger than ever before!\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>If it\u2019s not the media\u2019s fault, it\u2019s the doctors and scientists, or the governors or the Chinese. Someone, anyone, not called Trump</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The real people won\u2019t be surprised to hear that our fearful leader\u2019s latest gambit is to blame everyone else as he desperately tries to squirm his way to November\u2019s election. How else can he divert attention from his disastrously botched handling of the pandemic and the ensuing economic collapse? If it\u2019s not the media\u2019s fault, it\u2019s the doctors and scientists, or the governors or the Chinese. Someone, anyone, not called Trump.</p> <p>There is some history to this one, naturally. When Hurricane Maria ripped through Puerto Rico in our antihero\u2019s first year in office, he thought it was fine and dandy to let the sick and elderly die. In the early days, the official death toll was so low it was actually worth celebrating their deaths on his one and only trip to the American colony after the storm.</p> <p>\u201cIf you look at a real catastrophe like Katrina, and you look at the tremendous hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of people that died, and you look at what happened here with, really, a storm that was just totally overpowering,\u201d he <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-briefing-hurricane-maria-relief-efforts/\">said</a>, \u201cnobody has ever seen anything like this. What is your death count, as of this moment? Seventeen? Sixteen certified. Sixteen people versus in the thousands. You can be very proud of all of your people, all of our people working together.\u201d</p> <p>Of course, they weren\u2019t working together because they had no commander-in-chief. At the time Trump was talking, the death toll was growing exponentially because our so-called president failed to surge supplies to the island. So the sick and the elderly died in their thousands because there was no reliable power, clean water or food, in hospitals and senior centers.</p> <p>Anyone who complained, like the mayor of San Juan, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-feuds-with-san-juan-mayor-as-tropical-storm-takes-direct-aim-at-puerto-rico/2019/08/28/6b5170e2-c990-11e9-be05-f76ac4ec618c_story.html\">was</a> corrupt or crazy or incompetent: a combination of qualities that Trump should actually trademark. And when the real death toll finally emerged \u2013 at <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2018/05/29/trump-once-favorably-compared-puerto-ricos-death-toll-to-katrinas-a-new-study-shows-more-than-twice-as-many-died/\">more than</a> 4,600 Americans \u2013 it was naturally all a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/13/us/politics/trump-fact-check-hurricane.html\">plot</a> by Democrats to make him look bad.</p> <p>Those old and sick Americans in Puerto Rico were no different from the old and sick Americans whose lives are so cheap for Trump and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/24/older-people-would-rather-die-than-let-covid-19-lockdown-harm-us-economy-texas-official-dan-patrick\">Texas</a> lieutenant governor and the editorial <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/rethinking-the-coronavirus-shutdown-11584659154\">board</a> of the Wall Street Journal.</p> <p>If only we could target the virus to those who get in the way of our economy and, more importantly, Donald Trump\u2019s re-election. It would be so much easier than sourcing more ventilators, or respirator masks, or reviving an economy that is heading for depression.</p> <p>That would require leadership, or at least crisis management skills: rallying a government and nation to a common cause to save each other and ourselves. All the rest is the wishful thinking of a group of people whose malign influence is now a matter of fact.</p> <p>The coronavirus has no sense of morality: it just spreads its selfish genes, along with its misery and chaos, as fast as it can. At long last, this president has finally met his soulmate.</p>",

  "<p>Hours after the Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren ended her presidential campaign and all but assured the next American president would be a white man in his 70s, a group of influential Democratic women gathered for dinner at a Spanish restaurant in downtown Washington.</p> <p>The timing was coincidental, but it underscored the urgency of their meeting.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/16/joe-biden-woman-vice-president-abrams-harris-klobuchar-warren\">Joe Biden's pledge to name a woman as running mate fires speculation</a> </p> </aside>  <p>More than a hundred years after American women earned the right to vote; four years after the first female presidential nominee of a major party won the popular vote by 3 million votes and two years after the election of the most female congressional class in history, six diverse women had entered the 2020 Democratic race and didn\u2019t win a single nominating contest.</p> <p>\u201cWithout a doubt, the secret to Democratic victories in the past three years has been women\u2019s leadership. The idea that that wouldn\u2019t translate into the first woman president was heartbreaking for many of us,\u201d said Heather McGhee, a distinguished senior fellow at the thinktank Demos, who supported Warren and helped organize the meeting. </p> <p>Emotions still raw, the group of women decided to do something about it.</p> <p>Over tapas, they drew up a list of demands for the party\u2019s next nominee: he would choose a female running mate; women would represent the \u201cgoverning majority\u201d of a Democratic administration; appointments would reflect \u201cthe diversity of our communities\u201d and economic issues focused on issues such as paid family leave would be a priority in the first 100 days.</p> <p>They compiled the principles into a <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-81SYLdEYuCaUYvRlTT2R6P3_dIW0C6K/view\">letter</a> that was signed by dozens of prominent party activists and leaders and sent to the Democratic National Committee.</p> <p>Days later, at the 11th Democratic presidential debate, the first without a female candidate on stage, Joe Biden explicitly committed to picking a woman as vice-president.</p> <p>\u201cThere are a number of women who are qualified to be president tomorrow,\u201d said Biden, who holds a nearly unassailable lead over his rival, the Vermont socialist senator Bernie Sanders. He also committed to nominating the first African American woman to the supreme court, a gesture that reflects his reliance on the support of black women, a crucial Democratic constituency.</p> <p>Electing a woman as vice-president would be historic. Only two women have ever been chosen as running mates: the Alaska governor Sarah Palin in 2008 and the New York congresswoman Geraldine Ferraro in 1984. Neither served in the White House.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"30cdd345b4723260926b8a43428e2918c2c894ce\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/30cdd345b4723260926b8a43428e2918c2c894ce/0_0_3000_2060/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sarah Palin during the vice-presidential debate with Joe Biden in St Louis, Missouri, on 2 October 2008.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"687\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sarah Palin during the vice-presidential debate with Joe Biden in St Louis, Missouri, on 2 October 2008.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Carlos Barr\u00eda/REUTERS</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Far from being a \u201cconsolation prize\u201d, McGhee hopes that putting a woman on the ticket will move the country closer to electing the first female president.

The 2016 presidential election brought the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/11/09/men-handed-trump-the-election/\">widest gender gap</a> in a half-century of polling and since then, women\u2019s rage has fueled Democratic victories in every corner of the country. They have led protests, launched political organizations, run for office and voted for Democrats in record numbers. And it is women, far more than men, who most viscerally disapprove of Trump and his policies.</p> <p>While research suggests running mates do little to persuade undecided voters, putting a woman on the ticket could help generate enthusiasm among Democrats . It could also help draw a contrast with Trump, who has been accused of sexual misconduct by more than a dozen women.</p> <p>Jennifer Epps-Addison, the network president of the Center for Popular Democracy, which endorsed Sanders and signed the letter, said Biden should consider his choice of running mate as an olive branch to progressives.</p> <p>\u201cIf the next nominee wants our time and our energy, they have to be willing to negotiate the platform, the policies, the transition and what the future of the Democratic party looks like,\u201d she said. </p> <p>For her part, Clinton <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/videos/tv/2020/03/06/exp-gps-0308-clinton-on-vice-presidential-candidates.cnn\">said</a> recently she would \u201clove\u201d to have a woman on the ticket, but said the nominee must consider the electoral implications: \u201cWhat will help him win the electoral college?\u201d</p> <p>Biden\u2019s announcement has<a href=\"http://theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/16/joe-biden-woman-vice-president-abrams-harris-klobuchar-warren\"> intensified speculation</a> around who he might choose. On Tuesday, the former vice-president <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TheView/status/1242487204586442754?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cnbc.com%2F2020%2F03%2F24%2Fjoe-biden-narrows-vice-president-list-with-help-from-business-allies.html\">told</a> the hosts of The View that he would start vetting a shortlist of candidates \u201csoon\u201d and that it was important his running mate is \u201csimpatico with where I want to take the nation\u201d.</p> <p>His former rivals, particularly Senators Kamala Harris, Warren and Amy Klobuchar, are seen as top contenders.

Their mistakes, it seemed, were punished more harshly by a party that demonstrated a willingness to rally behind men whose success defied political odds.</p> <p>Biden, who is running on his decades of experience, was first elected to the Senate in 1972, at 29. He has previously lost two presidential elections, and placed fourth and fifth in the first two nominating contests. Sanders fought his way back into contention after a heart attack.

After all, more Americans voted for Clinton than Trump.

It\u2019s become a theatrical production rather than a true press briefing.\u201d</p> <p>The last formal briefing by a press secretary took place more than a year ago as Trump decided to become his own spokesman, regularly fielding questions on the White House South Lawn before boarding the Marine One helicopter <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/sep/01/trump-white-house-press-briefing-chopper-talk\">in what was dubbed \u201cchopper talk\u201d.</a></p> <p>But then came the coronavirus pandemic and the reactivation of the near dormant briefing room in the West Wing. At first, the Vice-President Mike Pence, the chair of the coronavirus taskforce, earned praise for his steady handling of the briefing, with one columnist even joking that he <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/03/10/make-mike-pence-the-new-white-house-press-secretary-125182\">should become the new press secretary.</a></p> <p>Perhaps sensing political opportunity, Trump moved swiftly to regain the limelight and become master of ceremonies. At times, he has reassured viewers with an uncharacteristically solemn tone. But at others, he has reverted to his buccaneering style, over-promising vaccines or therapies \u2013 forcing experts to contradict him \u2013 or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/20/trump-coronavirus-question-attack-reporter-over-fears\">throwing a tantrum</a> at a reporter who challenged him.</p> <p>On Sunday, Trump was asked if he had changed his personal investments in advance of the pandemic. He gave a bafflingly rambling answer that, <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-vice-president-pence-members-coronavirus-task-force-press-briefing-8/\">once transcribed,</a> ran to more than 850 words. An excerpt: \u201cGeorge Washington, they say he was a rich man, supposedly. Relatively rich. And he ran the presidency and he also ran his business. They say he had two desks. Nobody complained until I came along. I got elected as a rich person, but nobody complained until I came along. So it cost me billions of dollars to be president and I am so happy I did it. Because who cares? Who cares?\u201d</p> <p>Trump regularly appears with taskforce members including Pence, Dr Anthony Fauci, Dr Deborah Birx and Jerome Adams, who stand closer to him than reporters are allowed sit with each other. </p> <p>Broadcasters were widely criticized for giving Trump\u2019s speeches and rallies wall-to-wall coverage during the 2016 presidential election, granting him free exposure worth billions of dollars in advertising. Although campaign rallies have been suspended because of the virus, there are concerns that history is repeating itself, giving Trump an advantage over his likely opponent, Joe Biden. On Sunday and Monday, the briefings shifted to late afternoon, giving Trump access to peak viewing hours.</p> <p>McCurry, now a professor at Wesley Theological Seminary, said he \u201ctends to agree\u201d with the view that networks should not carry the entire briefings live.</p> <p>\u201cPutting it on because it\u2019s better than whatever else is available to daytime TV is not a good reason. It shouldn\u2019t be a platform for the president to just give out his own message. It\u2019s not reality television,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Margaret Sullivan, a media columnist at the Washington Post, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/media/the-media-must-stop-live-broadcasting-trumps-dangerous-destructive-coronavirus-briefings/2020/03/21/b8a2a440-6b7c-11ea-9923-57073adce27c_story.html\">went further in an article headlined:</a> \u201cThe media must stop live-broadcasting Trump\u2019s dangerous, destructive coronavirus briefings.\u201d She wrote: \u201cMore and more each day, President Trump is using his daily briefings as a substitute for the campaign rallies that have been forced into extinction by the spread of the novel coronavirus.

When I returned from my trip around Central Europe I isolated myself (in a borrowed apartment away from my mother and sister) since the number of cases of COVID-19 (in Germany for instance) were similar to Italy in the beginning. Around ten days ago I started feeling some symptoms, exactly the same time as my father - who traveled with me from Brussels. I was feeling tired, had shivers, a sore throat and coughed. My dad experienced the same symptoms, but much more intense and with a fever. In Sweden you can not test yourself for COVID-19 unless you\u2019re in need of emergent medical treatment. Everyone feeling ill are told to stay at home and isolate themselves. I have therefore not been tested for COVID-19, but it\u2019s extremely likely that I\u2019ve had it, given the combined symptoms and circumstances. Now I\u2019ve basically recovered, but - AND THIS IS THE BOTTOM LINE: I almost didn\u2019t feel ill. My last cold was much worse than this! Had it not been for someone else having the virus simultainously I might not even have suspected anything. Then I would just have thought I was feeling unusually tired with a bit of a cough. And this it what makes it so much more dangerous. Many (especially young people) might not notice any symptoms at all, or very mild symptoms. Then they don\u2019t know they have the virus and can pass it on to people in risk groups. We who don\u2019t belong to a risk group have an enormous responsibility, our actions can be the difference between life and death for many others. Please keep that in mind, follow the advice from experts and your local authorities and #StayAtHome to slow the spread of the virus. And remember to always take care of each other and help those in need. #COVID #flattenthecurve</a></p> \n     <p style=\" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;\">A post shared by <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/gretathunberg/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" style=\" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px;\" target=\"_blank\"> Greta Thunberg</a> (@gretathunberg) on <time style=\" font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;\" datetime=\"2020-03-24T15:22:26+00:00\">Mar 24, 2020 at 8:22am PDT</time></p>\n    </div>\n   </blockquote> \n   <script async src=\"//www.instagram.com/embed.js\"></script> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-03-24T16:06:19.799Z\">at 4.06pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e7a282e8f08e4a2e5edc024\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-24T15:34:36.712Z\">3.34pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Russia</strong> is to close nightclubs and cinemas due to the coronavirus, reports the RIA Novosti news agency.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-03-24T16:02:58.004Z\">at 4.02pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e7a27cc8f08c78e185cfed0\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-24T15:32:15.399Z\">3.32pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Italy\u2019s</strong> economy minister, Roberto Gualtieri, has said the eurozone\u2019s bailout fund should be used to help economies hit by the coronavirus crisis, with no strings attached.</p> \n  <p>\u201cWe must use all the resources available at the EU level, including the ESM [the European Stability Mechanism], without any conditionality,\u201d Gualtieri told parliament.</p> \n  <p>The minister added that the EU should consider issuing a common debt instrument, or safe asset, something so far resisted by some of its richer members.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-03-24T16:02:19.921Z\">at 4.02pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e7a250e8f08d17da4d88b28\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-24T15:23:02.160Z\">3.23pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/NYGovCuomo/status/1242468192712351745\">Cuomo goes</a> on to take aim at Donald Trump\u2019s <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1241935285916782593?s=20\">tweet</a> that the \u201ccure must not be worse than the problem itself\u201d.</p> \n  <p>It\u2019s all very well, the New York governor says, \u201cBut if you ask the American people to choose between public health and the economy then it\u2019s no contest.</p> \n  <p>\u201cNo American is going to say, accelerate the economy at the cost of human life because no American is going to say how much a life is worth.

in adult prisons,\u201d Amnesty International Australia Indigenous Rights Lead, Lidia Thorpe said.</p> \n  <p>\u201cMost of these kids are later released without conviction, only underlining that it\u2019s totally unacceptable to leave them in prison when they would be safer at home with their family.</p> \n  <p>Thorpe said under the Convention of the Rights of the Child, detention of a child before trial or after sentencing must be used only as a measure of last resort, for the shortest time possible, and separate from detained adults wherever possible.</p> \n  <p>\u201cGiven that the spread of COVID-19 is a particular public health concern in custodial environments, the authorities should urgently release these children and seriously consider the same for other groups at special risks,\u201d Amnesty said.</p> \n  <p>Earlier today the NSW government announced new emergency powers aimed at keeping the justice system functional, including giving the corrections minister power to

Carnival Corp\u2019s Ruby Princess, became the country\u2019s largest source of coronavirus infections as one of its passengers also became the eighth fatality nationally. <br><br>In a chain of events described by New South Wales state Police Minister David Elliott as a \u201cmonumental stuff-up\u201d, about 2,700 passengers were allowed to leave the ship when it docked in Sydney on 19 March. <br><br>By Tuesday, around 130 of those passengers had tested positive and officials were frantically hunting down other travellers to test them and track their movements. <br><br>Australia stepped closer to a full lockdown on Tuesday, with authorities warning of harsher penalties for anybody violating self-isolation orders as they began to worry that hospitals were starting to feel the strain. <br><br>With 1,984 cases, Australia has registered significantly lower rates of coronavirus compared to elsewhere in the world, but the infection rate has quickened in recent days and NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian said it was now at a \u201ccritical stage.\u201d <br><br>While schools officially remained open in most of the country, parents were strongly advised to keep their children home, as

Experts <a href=\"https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2020/03/hundreds-of-u-s-coronavirus-cases-may-have-slipped-through-screenings/\">at Harvard University</a> have projected an infection rate in the US of between 20 - 60%, meaning that while it is impossible to reliably estimate the American coronavirus death toll <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/03/16/upshot/coronavirus-best-worst-death-toll-scenario.html\">a reasonable scenario</a> could result in hundreds of thousands of lives lost.</p> \n  <p>On first look, given the potentially devastating death toll directly associated with coronavirus, it appears unlikely to be matched by an increased rate in suicide, making the presidents claim almost certainly inaccurate. </p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><em>In the US, the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline is 1-800-273-8255.

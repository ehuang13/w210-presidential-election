A 53% majority of Floridians in the poll disapproved of Trump\u2019s handling of the crisis, and 58% said they did not trust Trump \u201cto provide reliable information about the coronavirus\u201d.</p> \n<p>Top administration officials issued a coordinated message at the weekend that the US was facing difficult weeks ahead.</p> \n<p>\u201cThis is probably going to be a very bad week,\u201d Dr Anthony Fauci, the country\u2019s foremost infectious diseases expert, said.</p> \n<p>In New York City, the chair of the city council\u2019s health committee warned the morgues were almost full.</p> \n<p>\u201cSoon we\u2019ll start \u2018temporary interment\u2019,\u201d the councilman, Mark Levine, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MarkLevineNYC/status/1247156159896748032\">tweeted</a>. \u201cThis likely will be done by using a NYC park for burials (yes you read that right).

But it will be tough for NYers to take.\u201d</p> \n<p>Levine later said the plan had not yet been put into motion. Mayor Bill de Blasio told reporters: \u201cWe will have the capacity for temporary burials \u2013 that\u2019s all I\u2019m going to say.</p> \n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not going into details.

The temporary hospital set up by the army at the Javits convention centre in Manhattan has already been switched to coronavirus cases.</p> \n<p>Cuomo reported \u201canecdotal suggestions\u201d that hydroxychloroquine, an anti-malarial drug championed by Trump, was proving effective in clinical trials in the city. But he said definitive answers on the drug\u2019s use in coronavirus cases was \u201cweeks if not months\u201d away.</p> \n<p>Cuomo also said the New York healthcare system was operating at full stretch but did not for now need any more ventilators, key machines for people badly affected by the respiratory disease.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe people we lost are the people we couldn\u2019t save,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>As states continued their struggle to obtain ventilators and other life-saving medical equipment, the California governor, Gavin Newsom, whose state had some success at fighting off an early wave of the epidemic, said California would loan 500 \u201cstate-ownded ventilators\u201d to other states.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s more important than ever we are the UNITED States of America,\u201d Newsom tweeted. \u201cI know, if the tables were turned, other states would be there for us.\u201d</p> \n<p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed tentatively in morning trading, but with millions filing for unemployment each week, a former chair of the federal reserve said the economy could sink into depression.</p> \n<p>\u201cThis is a huge, unprecedented, devastating hit, and my hope is that we will get back to business as quickly as possible,\u201d the former chair of the Federal Reserve Janet Yellen told CNBC.</p> \n<p>But she said the unemployment rate was probably as high as 13% and gross domestic product was down at least 30%.</p>",

Now, as coronavirus destroys lives, jobs and businesses \u2013 and threatens to drive Rasmussen\u2019s cosmetology school to the wall \u2013 she is among those Americans who have bumped up the president\u2019s approval ratings even as he faces a barrage of scorn over his handling of the pandemic.</p> <p>The latest <a href=\"https://news.gallup.com/poll/298313/president-trump-job-approval-rating.aspx\">Gallup poll</a> gave Trump the highest approval numbers of his presidency, bolstered by swing voters, independents and even some Democrats.</p> <p>The poll is no more than a snapshot in a rapidly evolving crisis, and opinions may change radically in the coming weeks as the death toll rises and the loss of jobs bites deep.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"0f1a65de87350a7a68c4ec3c6275c86ac5714466\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0f1a65de87350a7a68c4ec3c6275c86ac5714466/0_305_4032_2419/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Holly Rasmussen: \u2018I think he is staying extremely optimistic and I think that\u2019s what a lot of us need.\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Holly Rasmussen: \u2018I think he is staying extremely optimistic and I think that\u2019s what a lot of us need.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chris McGreal</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In addition, Rasmussen lives in the small city of Cresco close to Iowa\u2019s northern border with Minnesota. Like much of the midwest, it has yet to be badly hit by the virus and attitudes to the president\u2019s handling of the crisis may shift against him when it is.</p> <p>But for now, towns and cities across the region are watching the approach of coronavirus with fearful resignation, and many there are prepared to give Trump the benefit of the doubt for now.</p> <p>In southern Missouri, Cindy Anderson \u2013 doing her job in the payroll department of a mental health counselling service from home \u2013 worries that when the virus finally hits, small cities like Kennet will be woefully unprepared not least because its only hospital closed a few months ago.</p> <p>\u201cI think we\u2019ve been forgotten about in a little part of the world because we\u2019re rural. Unfortunately, the area in which we live, there is a lot of poverty and a lot of sick people. When it hits, I\u2019m sure that it will be devastating,\u201d she said.</p> <p>For all that, Anderson thinks Trump is making the best of a bad situation even if he has made mistakes. \u201cI don\u2019t know if he\u2019s got it right, but I think he\u2019s trying. I think he\u2019s effective,\u201d she said.</p> <p>But the 65-year-old is frustrated at what she regards as politicised attacks on Trump over his actions, or lack of them, early on in the crisis when she says the focus should be on how to get through this.</p> <p>\u201cI think that a lot of the news media, they don\u2019t tell the whole story. They tell the piece that sounds the most damning and they don\u2019t add the other piece,\u201d she said.</p> <p>That\u2019s a view shared by Rasmussen.</p> <p>\u201cI would rather have just the issues of what\u2019s going on with the coronavirus and what they are doing to help us then just nit picking stuff that I was seeing,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Rasmussen is critical of the scorn poured on the president when he hesitated to call for businesses to close because of the economic impact. She said his concerns about the financial consequences were legitimate.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"1873c078c4517e97dc4804a41c5d15f31a57b945\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1873c078c4517e97dc4804a41c5d15f31a57b945/0_190_4000_2400/1000..jpg\" alt=\"Donald Trump delivers remarks at a coronavirus briefing at the White House.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Donald Trump delivers remarks at a coronavirus briefing at the White House.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The shut down required Rasmussen to close her cosmetology school, leaving her workers without pay and her school facing bankruptcy if the shutdown lasts more than another two months.

I thought this is unprecedented. I can\u2019t believe Republicans actually are going for that at all,\u201d she said. \u201cLike, wow, I am completely shocked on that. I really am.\u201d</p> <p>To Rasmussen that looks like leadership. She regards Trump\u2019s much derided claim that distancing strategies could begin to be lifted by Easter as aspirational.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s him trying to stay optimistic, I thought that was good. It\u2019s hopeful for people. He was trying to put an end time to this which I didn\u2019t think was the worst thing in the world. And he he took a pretty hard hit for a lot of that,\u201d she said.</p> <p>That\u2019s not how it\u2019s seen by some of those confronting the pandemic.</p> <h2>\u2018He has blatantly played down the crisis\u2019</h2> <p>Ashly Moore works as an occupational therapist at a hospital in Des Moines, Iowa. She is still seeing patients at some risk to herself because only those showing symptoms are tested for coronavirus.</p> <p>\u201cIt is worrying but there\u2019s not a whole lot you can do about it. And I\u2019m happy to have a job. A lot of people right now are experiencing layoffs and uncertainty. You just take all the precautions that you can,\u201d she said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"77f41cc2d7ef904a0c5da55cc1322df11056686c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/77f41cc2d7ef904a0c5da55cc1322df11056686c/0_2_6016_3609/1000..jpg\" alt=\"Ashly Moore in her home in West Des Moines, Iowa, on 30 January 2020.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ashly Moore in her home in West Des Moines, Iowa: \u2018He\u2019s obviously concerned about the optics.

You\u2019re criticised no matter what you do. But he has blatantly downplayed the seriousness of this,\u2019 she said.</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s obviously concerned about the optics. He\u2019s concerned about his re-election. But if you truly care about leading a nation in a time of crisis, your own re-election really shouldn\u2019t be on your radar. It\u2019s very selfish and egocentric to make that a priority right now.\u201d</p> <p>Rasmussen though is not alone in the rural midwest in seeing the president\u2019s shifting position as a reflection of her own uncertainty. At first, the numbers of deaths from coronavirus, compared them to lives claimed by flu, opioid overdoses and car crashes did not look startling, and some wondered if the threat was far away and overblown. Rasmussen came to accept the scale of the crisis as she listened to friends and relatives working in health care in bigger cities.</p> <p>\u201cI myself was thinking, coming from a small community, you don\u2019t see this. But I do have a lot of people in bigger cities that are in health care and hearing some of their stories about not having proper PPE and masks and things, then it started getting a little bit closer to home,\u201d she said.</p>",

It is a less toxic version of chloroquine, another malaria drug, which itself is related to quinine, an ingredient in tonic water.</li> \n   <li>Like many drugs, hydroxychloroquine comes with a number of potential side-effects. These include headaches, dizziness, stomach pain, weight loss and mood changes. </li> \n   <li>A sudden surge in demand for hydroxychloroquine risks shortages of the drug for those who need it most. Hydroxychloroquine is able to keep lupus, a chronic autoimmune disease, in check but some people with the condition have complained they are now unable to find Plaquenil. Trump\u2019s pushing of the treatment has caused many Americans, whether they need it or not, to stock up on the drug.</li> \n  </ul> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e8a65e88f08c9eaf0daf04c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-05T23:13:24.910Z\">12.13am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>US president Donald Trump opened tonight\u2019s White House briefing with well wishes for UK PM Boris Johnson. </p> \n  <p>\u201cHe\u2019s a great friend of mine,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI\u2019m sure he is going to be fine, he\u2019s a strong man, a strong person.\u201d</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e8a65658f08c35a1d11a814\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/sarahboseley\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-05T23:11:14.340Z\">12.11am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <h2>Johnson\u2019s hospital admission suggests virus may have progressed</h2> \n  <p>Most people recover from Covid-19 within a week and cannot even be certain they had it, as they probably won\u2019t be tested.

Spain has recorded 130,759 confirmed cases, according to the health ministry. </p> \n  <p>The latest data suggests the growth in the number of infections has slowed to around 5% \u2013 the smallest increase seen since officials began tracking the outbreak. The actual number of cases in the country, however, is likely higher after hard-hit regions such as Madrid and Catalonia instructed people with mild symptoms to self-isolate rather than seek testing,</p> \n  <p>While officials urged caution in interpreting the data, they noted the figures hint at a downward trend, with fewer hospitalisations and a drop in patients needing critical care. \u201cThe sense that we\u2019re getting from the regions is that the pressure is easing,\u201d said Mar\u00eda Jos\u00e9 Sierra of Spain\u2019s health emergency centre. \u201cIt\u2019s what we expected after three weeks of distancing measures.\u201d </p> \n  <p>Hans Kluge of the World Health Organization echoed her cautious tone. \u201cCareful optimism as a result of bold measures, innovative approaches and courageous decisions,\u201d <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hans_kluge/status/1246732106946023430\">he wrote on Twitter</a> after wrapping up a mission to Spain. </p> \n  <p>He added that he had been deeply impressed by the heroism of the country\u2019s frontline workers and the solidarity among Spain\u2019s residents.</p> \n  <p> The impact of the virus has been widespread across the country, which not a single Spanish region spared. As the number of cases continues its steady climb upwards, a handful of municipalities have cut themselves off from the rest of Spain \u2013 and the world \u2013 in hopes of keeping the virus out.</p> \n  <p>Among the most fervent is the southern Spanish municipality of Zahara de la Sierra. Home to some 1,400 people and perched high on a mountain, local officials have used chains and fences to block off all but one of the five access roads to the white village.</p> \n  <p> Police keep constant watch over the one road that remains open, stopping every vehicle that passes to ensure they have the necessary authorisation to enter the town. </p> \n  <p>Those that are allowed through are sprayed with disinfectant before they can proceed up to the fortress town. \u201cFortunately, we don\u2019t have one (coronavirus) case in this municipality, nor anyone in quarantine,\u201d mayor Santiago Galv\u00e1n told Europa Press. </p> \n  <p> Nearby, the village of Setenil de las Bodegas has also sprang into action. Popular with daytrippers who flock to visit its houses built into the rocks that loom over the village, officials have dumped hundreds of kilograms of dirt to block off most roads leading into the municipality.</p> \n  <p> Home to some 2,700 people, the local council <a href=\"https://twitter.com/aytodesetenil/status/1243961681346248705\">recently announced plans to disinfect</a> all of the streets of the village on a daily basis while any vehicle that enters must pass under a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/aytodesetenil/status/1244986737052524545\">custom-built arch</a> that showers them with disinfectant.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-05T12:20:42.889Z\">at 1.20pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e89c4398f080bdb9f53482d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-05T11:45:52.497Z\">12.45pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Singapore </strong>has recorded a 60% increase in coronavirus cases in a single day.</p> \n  <p>The county\u2019s health ministry reported 120 new cases of the virus on Sunday, in comparison to 75 on Saturday.

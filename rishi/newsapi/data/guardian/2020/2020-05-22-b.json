  "<p>Donald Trump has declared churches, mosques and synagogues \u201cessential services\u201d and threatened to override governors who refuse to reopen them this weekend \u2013 a power he does not possess.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/05/coronavirus-churches-florida-social-distancing\">The US churches and pastors ignoring 'stay-at-home' orders</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>\u201cSome governors have deemed liquor stores and abortion clinics as essential, but have left out churches and other houses of worship,\u201d the president told reporters at the White House on Friday. \u201cIt\u2019s not right. So I\u2019m correcting this injustice and calling houses of worship essential.\u201d</p> \n<p>Trump added: \u201cThe governors need to do the right thing and allow these very important essential places of faith to open right now. For this weekend. If they don\u2019t do it, I will override the governors. In America we need more prayer, not less.\u201d</p> \n<p>After his two-minute statement, the president left the briefing room podium without taking questions.</p> \n<p>His remarks sowed confusion because the federal government does not have the constitutional right to unilaterally order individual states to reopen businesses, churches or schools. But they did seem likely to play well with his support base: Trump won four in five Christian evangelical voters in the 2016 presidential election.</p> \n<p>Earlier this week the Centers for Disease Control published <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/downloads/php/CDC-Activities-Initiatives-for-COVID-19-Response.pdf\">a 60-page plan</a> for restaurants, schools, childcare programs, mass transport and other businesses about reopening. But it omitted details about houses of worship and faith-based organisations.</p> \n<p>There has been friction between Trump and state governors during the coronavirus pandemic. Last month the president claimed he had \u201ctotal\u201d authority over reopening plans but then appeared to backpedal from that position.</p> \n<p>At Friday\u2019s briefing, the White House press secretary, Kayleigh McEnany, deflected questions about Trump\u2019s threat to override governors and clashed with reporters.</p> \n<p>\u201cBoy, it\u2019s interesting to be in a room that desperately wants to see these churches and houses of worship stay closed,\u201d she said sardonically.</p> \n<p>Jeff Mason of Reuters replied: \u201cKayleigh, I object to that. I go to church. I\u2019m dying to go back to church. The question that we\u2019re asking you, and would like to have asked the president and Dr Birx, is is it safe?\u201d</p>",
  "<p>When Joe Biden launched his campaign for president in April last year, the unemployment rate was 3.6%, the <a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/opub/ted/2019/unemployment-rate-3-point-6-percent-in-april-2019-lowest-since-december-1969.htm\">lowest</a> it had been in nearly half a century. Now, months into a once-in-a-century public health crisis, unemployment in the US is nearly four times that, soaring to levels not seen since the Great Depression.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/may/22/coronavirus-us-live-trump-holiday-weekend-latest-news-updates\">Coronavirus US live: experts urge caution on first holiday weekend of summer as deaths pass 94,000</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Millions of laid-off workers <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Health/27-million-americans-lose-health-insurance-coverage-report/story?id=70658766\">risk</a> losing their health insurance, while <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/mcdonalds-workers-strike-coronavirus_n_5ec57c58c5b622c412eb224e\">many Americans </a>with jobs deemed essential are <a href=\"https://medium.com/@amazoniansunitednyc/we-amazon-workers-demand-coronavirus-protections-16f28ad8b15f\">demanding</a> better protections from their employers. It is only a matter of time before the death toll reaches 100,000.</p> <p>During the Democratic primary, Biden spoke of restoring normalcy after four years of Donald Trump, frequently appealing to voters\u2019 nostalgia for the presidency of Barack Obama. But now, as he faces the general election amid the deepening economic turmoil, the presumptive Democratic nominee is reaching for the legacy of a radical American president: Franklin Delano Roosevelt.</p> <p>\u201cThe blinders have been taken off,\u201d Biden told supporters recently during a virtual fundraiser from his Delaware home, where he has been since March. \u201cBecause of this Covid crisis, I think people are realizing, \u2018My Lord, look at what is possible. Look at the institutional changes we can make.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>In recent weeks, Biden, who has climbed above Trump in national polls, has openly courted progressive leaders and ideas, adopting some of the populist rhetoric more commonly associated with his vanquished rivals, Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren. In turn, they have offered their full-throated endorsements, casting Biden, a pragmatic dealmaker who still believes in bipartisan comity, as the perhaps unlikely herald of a new progressive era.</p> <p>\u201cA shift of frame matters \u2013 it\u2019s not to be underestimated,\u201d the California congressman Ro Khanna, who was a co-chair of Sanders\u2019 presidential campaign, said of Biden\u2019s bold messaging. \u201cIt\u2019s a totally different vision for what he thinks the next four years should be about.\u201d</p> <p>Neither Biden nor Trump has yet laid out their vision for what the first 100 days of a new presidency might look like, a benchmark established by FDR during which he offered a series of sweeping reforms.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"15487949ca75156728438b402f9ed98ca453e478\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/15487949ca75156728438b402f9ed98ca453e478/0_0_3000_2301/1000.jpg\" alt=\"President Franklin D Roosevelt\u2019s New Deal was a try-anything moment during the Great Depression that remade the role of the federal government in American life.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"767\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">President Franklin D Roosevelt\u2019s New Deal was a try-anything moment during the Great Depression that remade the role of the federal government in American life.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\ufeffBut Biden and his economic advisers believe they must be prepared to marshal a far more ambitious domestic agenda than they initially imagined. During daily virtual meetings, Biden and his team are beginning to draft a new governing vision that reflects the scale and urgency of the crisis that Biden predicted may \u201ceclipse what FDR faced\u201d.</p> <p>The task is not entirely new to Biden. As vice-president, he led the Obama administration\u2019s response to the recession, and his campaign hopes to leverage his remarkably scandal-free stewardship of the nearly $800bn stimulus package with Trump\u2019s handling of the economy.</p> <p>In the coming weeks, Biden said he would share a detailed plan \u201cfor the right kind of economic recovery\u201d, aspects of which are expected to include massive investment in public health, expansive legislative action on climate change, and broad new protections for workers.</p> <p>Last week, Biden announced six policy taskforces \u2013 centered around issues that include healthcare, climate and the economy \u2013 that pair his supporters with ideological allies of Sanders. Among those chosen to participate are some of the young, progressive leaders most skeptical of his approach, including the New York congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. </p> <p>In a joint press release announcing the taskforces, Biden said the groups would help \u201ctransform our country\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cVice-President Biden understands in his gut that this is a totally different order of magnitude than any president has ever dealt with,\u201d said Mary Kay Henry, president of the Service Employees International Union and a member of the healthcare taskforce.</p> <p>Henry said the coronavirus has exposed the underlying causes of the US\u2019s problems, calling public attention to issues she believes government and business leaders can no longer afford to ignore.</p> <p>\u201cWe had [38] million people that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/21/us-unemployment-figures-jobs-lost-coronavirus\">have lost jobs</a>. But that\u2019s on top of the 64 million Americans who already made less than $15 an hour before Covid,\u201d she said. Without paid sick leave, some essential workers are reporting for work even if they feel ill because they can\u2019t afford the alternative while fast-food and healthcare workers stage protests to demand protective equipment.</p> <p>\u201cThat level of inequality has sort of hit people between the eyes.\u201d</p> <p>Jared Bernstein, one of Biden\u2019s economic advisers, said Biden was looking beyond the \u201ccyclical\u201d challenges posed by the pandemic to the many \u201cstructural\u201d problems it has revealed.</p> <p>\u201cBiden is, I think, developing a particularly robust agenda that really strikes at this reality that the Trump economy was built on a house of sand and has turned out to be totally non-resilient to any shock,\u201d said Bernstein, who advised Biden during his tenure as vice-president.</p> <p>Biden, Bernstein said, recognizes the need for an \u201curgent expansion\u201d that better insulates the American economy from the \u201cshocks that are coming fast and furiously\u201d not as a direct result of the pandemic but from climate change and income inequality.</p> <p>Biden has also made other gestures. He has adopted aspects of Sanders\u2019 free college tuition proposal. He has embraced Elizabeth Warren\u2019s bankruptcy proposal and joined with the senator, viewed as a potential running mate, to call for better oversight of how the Trump administration spends the coronavirus relief fund. </p> <p>Critics on the left have scoffed at the notion of Biden as an FDR-style visionary. After all, they say, Biden once told supporters that under his presidency \u201cnothing would fundamentally change\u201d.</p> <p>David Sirota, a former adviser to Sanders 2020 presidential campaign, dismissed Biden\u2019s overtures to the left as performative politics \u2013 a \u201ccanned SNL skit\u201d that progressives were being asked to accept as \u201csomething real\u201d.</p> <p>\ufeffRepublicans, meanwhile, view Biden\u2019s expanding policy aspirations as a political gift. After the taskforce members were announced, the Republican National Committee tagged Biden a \u201cbanner-man for the socialist agenda\u201d.</p> <p>Biden\u2019s policy platform \u2013 which includes a public option for healthcare and an aggressive plan to combat the climate crisis \u2013 might have been considered far-reaching in another presidential cycle. But during the primary he resisted pressure from activists to embrace progressive litmus-test items such as Medicare for All and a Green New Deal.</p> <p>Campaign aides and allies say Biden\u2019s calls for change are part of a policy evolution in response to the crisis, not a sudden embrace of a Sanders-style agenda. Biden himself has pointed to his nearly 50-year political career as a guide for how he would make \u201cinstitutional\u201d changes \u201cwithout us becoming a socialist country, or any of that malarkey\u201d.</p> <p>Michael Gwin, a spokesman for Biden\u2019s campaign, said: \u201cHe\u2019s scaling up the solutions he\u2019s proposed so that we can meet this moment, get through this crisis, and ensure that we come out on the other end with a stronger middle class and a more resilient country.\u201d</p> <p>Surrounding his planning for the presidency is the uncertainty over who will control the House and Senate, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/18/us-senate-democrats-elections-2020\">which is suddenly within reach for Democrats</a>. Yet there are signs that the coronavirus, and Trump\u2019s handling of the crisis, have scrambled the political calculus, giving Biden new latitude to move in a far bolder direction.</p> <p>A recent survey by the non-partisan <a href=\"https://www.people-press.org/2020/04/21/positive-economic-views-plummet-support-for-government-aid-crosses-party-lines/\">Pew Research Center</a> found that the public\u2019s view of the economy has darkened dramatically: just 23% of Americans describe the economic outlook as \u201cexcellent\u201d or \u201cgood\u201d, down from 57% at the start of the year. The same poll found <a href=\"https://www.people-press.org/2020/04/21/positive-economic-views-plummet-support-for-government-aid-crosses-party-lines/\">overwhelming</a> support for the $2tn coronavirus relief measure passed by Congress last month, a marked contrast from the<a href=\"https://www.people-press.org/2009/03/16/obamas-approval-rating-slips-amid-division-over-economic-proposals/\"> polarized, partisan views</a> of the stimulus package passed to stem the economic fallout from the Great Recession.</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t underscore enough the extent to which this economic moment is unprecedented,\u201d said Steph Sterling, vice-president of advocacy and policy at the liberal Roosevelt Institute. \u201cOur institutions need to shift to meet the moment in a way that only government can.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>People in Afghanistan protested on social media that no women were present at a high-level government meeting, despite assurances from the president that they would be involved in important decision-making roles.</p> <p>The outcry followed a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SediqSediqqi/status/1263434749588185094\">tweeted photo</a> of a meeting of 12 political leaders at the presidential palace \u2013 all of them men. </p> <p>President Ashraf Ghani\u2019s spokesman, Sediq Sediqqi, who posted the image on Thursday, wrote that he thanked the men for their \u201cefforts in the political agreement\u201d they had achieved, calling it an important step towards national unity and political consensus.

We are expecting the government to fight for our rights on the table with the Taliban, but how will they do this when they keep excluding us?</p> <p>She added: \u201cThis is how ugly they look when they exclude us.\u201d</p> <p>More than 40 years of war, including years of Taliban rule, has led to women being stripped of basic rights, including education and freedom of movement. Many women are still made to stay at home and often do not have equal access to schooling.</p> <p>Some people dismissed the criticism on social media, saying there would be no point to include \u201cany powerless woman\u201d, and applauding the ethnic diversity of the men in the image.</p> <p>Earlier this year, Ghani said women\u2019s participation was now seen at all levels in Afghanistan, yet recent meetings \u2013 including the signing of a political agreement between the president and his rival, Abdullah Abdullah, which ended months of political deadlock and will mean the formation of a new cabinet \u2013 were held in the absence of women leaders.</p> <p>\u201cThis is concerning, especially as the government is preparing for intra-Afghan negotiations with the Taliban,\u201d said Shaharzad Akbar, chairperson of Afghanistan\u2019s Independent Human Rights Commission (AIHRC).</p> <p>\u201cThere aren\u2019t enough women in the negotiation team \u2013 numbers are lower than expected and there is a possibility that an almost fully male list of the cabinet is being put forward. This is concerning. It sends the message that the government\u2019s leadership doesn\u2019t take women\u2019s voices, expertise and insights seriously.\u201d</p> <p>After a landmark deal between the Taliban and the US was signed in February, paving the way for a US troop withdrawal and direct negotiations between the Afghan government and the militants, a 21-member delegation for the talks was put forward by the government \u2013 only five were women. The team was due to discuss potential political power-sharing with the militants and human and women\u2019s rights protection.</p> <p>Sediq Sediqqi acknowledged the outcry over the photo on Twitter, and said the government would take note and assured women of their participation in the future.</p> <p>\u201cAfghan women aren\u2019t at the sidelines anymore, but they are leaders,\u201d he said, adding that current meaningful participation of women at all levels of society had been unprecedented in the country\u2019s history.</p> <p>\u201cPresident Ghani\u2019s main policy element on women empowerment for the past five years has not been symbolic, but a meaningful approach to elevate women and bring them to top state decision-making layers,\u201d he said.</p> <p>But after Ghani\u2019s first election win in 2015, only three women ministers were nominated for the cabinet, resulting in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/feb/03/afghan-women-protest-absence-female-ministers-new-cabinet\">protests</a> throughout the capital, Kabul.</p>",

The weekly unemployment claims are also still being impacted by a backlog collapse of claims that overwhelmed many state systems.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/21/us-unemployment-figures-jobs-lost-coronavirus\">US unemployment rises by 2.4m despite easing of coronavirus lockdowns</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5ec6778f8f0886ce4f5d7d19\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-21T12:55:35.976Z\">1.55pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Trump to visit Michigan amid tensions with governor</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Good morning, live blog readers.</p> <p><strong>Donald Trump </strong>is set to visit a Ford manufacturing plant in Ypsilanti, Michigan, today, which has been repurposed to produce ventilators for coronavirus patients.</p> <p>The visit comes amid tensions between the president and the state\u2019s Democratic governor, <strong>Gretchen Whitmer, </strong>who Trump has nicknamed \u201cHalf Whitmer\u201d. The president has expressed support for protesters who have repeatedly gathered at the Michigan state capitol to protest Whitmer\u2019s response to the coronavirus crisis.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"225b7f70593e921ef08d37002b1aaad1f52d6e63\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/225b7f70593e921ef08d37002b1aaad1f52d6e63/0_0_4368_2912/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Barbers give free haircuts on the lawn of the Michigan State Capitol to protest Governor Gretchen Whitmer\u2019s emergency orders.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Barbers give free haircuts on the lawn of the Michigan state capitol to protest Gretchen Whitmer\u2019s emergency orders.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jim West/ZUMA Wire/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The president even threatened to withhold funding from Michigan yesterday after the Democratic secretary of state announced she would send absentee ballot applications to every registered voter.</p> <p>The Michigan attorney general has also sent Trump an open letter saying he has a \u201clegal responsibility\u201d to wear a mask during the Ford tour because the plant has a policy mandating face coverings. </p> <p>The president has been resistant to wearing a mask during other recent trips, despite the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s guidance that Americans should cover their faces to limit the spread of the virus.</p> <p>All of this comes as Trump looks ahead to the general election in November, when he will almost certainly need to carry Michigan (which he narrowly won in 2016) to secure a second term.</p> <p>It should make for an interesting and tense day for the president, not to mention his Michigan hosts. Stay tuned.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-21T13:13:04.999Z\">at 2.13pm BST</time></p>  </div>"

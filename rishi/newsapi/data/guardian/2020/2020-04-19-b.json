  "<p>In the aftermath of the 2016 US presidential election, the American artist and writer Jenny Odell found herself drawn almost every day to a local public garden. \u201cThis wasn\u2019t exactly a conscious decision,\u201d she writes in her book How to Do Nothing. \u201cIt was more of an innate movement, like a deer going to a salt lick, or a goat going to the top of a hill.\u201d</p> <p>In the book, a treatise on slowing down amid a rapidly changing world and news cycle that felt increasingly chaotic and scary, she describes how just existing in a small patch of urban wilderness each day, and redirecting her attention to the birds and plants around her, became more than an escape \u2013 it became something akin to a survival tactic.</p> <p>\u201cIt turns out that groundedness requires actual <em>ground</em>,\u201d she writes.</p> <p>I\u2019ve been thinking about her words this week, as we head towards a second month of pandemic era self-isolation, spending more time than ever confined indoors, watching on as confusing, scary and uncertain events unfold across our devices.</p> <p>Like Odell, this period is giving me a whole new appreciation, even reverence, for whatever small patches of green or wide open spaces I can find.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/15/the-guardian-view-on-natures-return-humans-making-way\">The Guardian view on nature\u2019s return: humans making way | Editorial</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Though almost all my time is spent in my house, every day I\u2019m seeking small, socially distanced and legally sanctioned moments outside: standing in the sun in my tiny, concreted inner-city courtyard among my pot plants, wandering under the grand paperbark trees lining my street to watch confused ibises loiter near empty bins or, best of all, walking or running through my local parks (always moving \u2013 since we are no longer allowed to just sit, even alone).</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>In parks there is still a degree of normalcy, tenderness even</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Exercising with your household or in pairs is the last form of allowable in-person socialising we have \u2013 so the park is the new pub for some of us. Chatting over beers is replaced by sessions sharing whatever crumbs of gossip still exist, while panting three metres apart to the sounds of the Nike Training app (god, I miss the pub). On the weekends, with more time, I have gravitated towards the coast \u2013 to walk along Sydney\u2019s dramatic cliffs, seeking a blast of wind to the face and a faraway ocean horizon to stare at.</p> <p>Parks feel like the last communal place we can encounter other people, strangers, in ways that don\u2019t feel stressful or threatening. Unlike the grocery store, where people eye each other off as they move hurriedly to the toilet paper aisle, in parks there is still a degree of normalcy, tenderness even. Provided paths aren\u2019t crowded, people can literally breathe deeply.</p> <p>One effect of this crisis has been to underscore the importance of public infrastructure we may have previously taken for granted. Where we once watched on as governments neglected or imperilled our robust social safety net and public healthcare system, we now better understand what is at stake. I would add accessible green space in our cities to that list.</p> <p> </p> <p>\u201cWe don\u2019t take it for granted any more,\u201d one Manhattan resident <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/19/nyregion/nyc-parks-coronavirus.html\">told the New York Times recently as he walked under trees in Central Park</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/oct/15/australias-parks-tell-us-what-you-love-and-what-makes-you-despair-about-urban-green-space\">Australia's parks: tell us what you love and what makes you despair about urban green space</a> </p> </aside>  <p> I now feel so lucky to have a couple of parks within easy distance. But having a decent-sized, safe park, wilderness area or patch of coast close by is a luxury in many cities. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/apr/10/coronavirus-park-closures-hit-bame-and-poor-londoners-most\">A recent Guardian report</a> found a third of all land in the wealthiest 10% of London wards was taken up by private gardens, while in the poorest 10%, just over a fifth was found to be taken up by garden space.</p> <p>Similarly, a <a href=\"https://www.planning.nsw.gov.au/-/media/Files/DPE/Reports/report-findings-greater-sydney-outdoors-study-2019-06-06.pdf\">study by the New South Wales government</a> last year found that residents of western Sydney reported they had less access to outdoor recreation space than those in other districts, and the majority spent on average 30 minutes driving just to get to such an area. The quality of your lockdown period is likely to vary pretty wildly depending on your access to such spaces for respite.</p> <p>Last week in Victoria, <a href=\"https://www.theage.com.au/national/victoria/jogger-sent-home-as-confusion-over-lockdown-laws-leaves-victorians-in-breach-20200412-p54j66.html\">a woman who drove to a park to run was cautioned by police</a>. Like with most of the new laws ruling our lives, there\u2019s significant confusion over whether driving to a park to exercise is allowed \u2013 the state\u2019s chief medical officer has said it\u2019s OK if there is nowhere closer to home, but premier Daniel Andrews has discouraged it. I understand the critical importance of the lockdown at the moment, but given their unequal distribution, some leeway here to allow people access to parks is a worthwhile goal.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We should think carefully now about how we can improve everyone\u2019s access to nature</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Parks have always served an important public health function in cities \u2013 giving us space to exercise and be out in the sun, nurturing our physical and mental health. These functions are all the more critical now.</p> <p>City of Sydney councillor Jess Miller <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pg/jessmillersydney/posts/?ref=page_internal\">suggested last week</a> state governments consider opening locked-up green spaces \u2013 such as racing tracks and golf courses \u2013 for socially distanced exercise in congested urban areas. In some foreign cities, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/apr/14/london-pedestrians-and-cyclist-may-get-more-space-on-roads-during-coronavirus-lockdown\">streets are being closed to traffic</a> to allow more space for walking.</p> <p>We should think carefully now about how we can improve everyone\u2019s access to nature, both during this period and beyond it.</p> <p> </p> <p>Moments in nature, as Odell chronicled in her book, also offer us space to refocus our attention in a time of anxiety. Once she started noticing birds in the public garden, she writes, she started seeing them everywhere.</p> <p>\u201cI remember specifically feeling comforted by the presence of these strange birds [a pair of night herons], like I could look up from the horrifying maelstrom of that day\u2019s Twitter and they\u2019d probably be there, unmoving.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s not just the exercise and sunshine and gossip my own moments outside are providing right now. It\u2019s not just a literally different perspective than the confines of my house. Sandstone and shale cliffs formed in the Triassic period, grand trees planted long before I was born, and the flocks of cockatoos that scream overhead unawares as I strain for one more sit-up \u2013 all offer a bit of much-needed perspective on a crisis that will, eventually, pass.</p> <p><br></p>",

The discussions, she <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/video/2020/04/15/playbook-interview-with-rep-alexandria-ocasio-cortez-d-ny-072053\">said</a>, revolved around his policy positions on healthcare, immigration and climate change.</p> \n<p>These discussions are part of a wider effort by the Biden campaign to engage progressive leaders and organizers.</p> \n<p>During a joint livestream this week, when Sanders endorsed Biden, they announced that their teams were developing six policy taskforces to find common solutions on issues involving the economy, healthcare, education, criminal justice, immigration and climate change.</p> \n<p>Biden has also recently embraced proposals to cancel student loan debt for certain middle- and low-income borrowers and to lower the Medicare eligibility age from 65 to 60 in an effort to expand the federal insurance program.

Intensifying mutual antagonism also risks killing any chance that the world\u2019s two biggest powers will cooperate sensibly to eradicate this and future pandemics \u2013 for example, by backing a necessary, independent international inquiry into what went wrong. That, in turn, bodes ill for vital bilateral collaboration on the climate crisis and other urgent global challenges such as debt relief.</p> <p>The world cannot afford another four years of the chaos and carnage personified by Trump. Voting him out in November is the best solution. But what if, fearful of losing amid continuing mayhem, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/14/trump-cant-cancel-the-election-but-he-will-try-to-stop-people-voting\">he tries to delay the election?</a><br><br>Experts say he lacks power to do so. But Mr \u201cTotal Authority\u201d may disagree. Amid so much avoidable death and destruction, why not kill the constitution and the Founding Fathers, too? As everybody surely realises by now, he\u2019s capable of almost anything.</p>"

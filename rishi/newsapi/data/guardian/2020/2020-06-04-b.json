  "<p>Donald Trump wants to be nominated by a Republican national convention with all the trappings of a normal, packed event: the thronging crowds, the balloon drop, the scores of sideshow events. Meanwhile, former vice-president Joe Biden and senior Democratic officials are strongly considering a partially or completely virtual convention.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/04/joe-biden-george-floyd-protests\">Can Joe Biden convince protesters he would be a 'transformational' president?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It is a stark illustration of how the two men \u2013 and their parties \u2013 are reacting to the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on the 2020 race. Trump wants to get back to business as usual in the physical world while Biden and his staff are navigating a new world mostly online.</p> <p>Even as America cautiously reopens from its most quarantined pandemic days, Trump has traveled across the country and been plotting campaign events and an upcoming in-person fundraiser.</p> <p>Biden has been far more cautious, continuing to host online fundraisers while his team have said they are listening to health experts on how quickly to revert back to pre-coronavirus campaigning.</p> <p>When he has delivered speeches or made public appearances, Trump has refused to wear a mask. Biden has made a point of appearing masked in public, a deliberate contrast to Trump.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s in Biden\u2019s interest that the campaign is a referendum on the president and not a choice,\u201d said Republican David Kochel, who was a top adviser for Jeb Bush\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign. \u201cSo if I was Team Biden I would probably be doing the same thing, which is being as low-key as possible, sending a more calm and reassuring message. But I don\u2019t think that Biden needs to get out and try and hold a 10,000-person rally. It\u2019s not his forte anyway.\u201d</p> <p>Kochel added that Trump\u2019s approach made sense for him as well.</p> <p>\u201cThe Trump strategy really makes sense as well because he really does feed off of those rallies \u2013 the energy that he gets from them,\u201d Kochel said. \u201cIt\u2019s an interesting platform for him to launch into his detractors and his rivals and without that platform I think it\u2019s not as easy for him.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"af9841366cf986fb230e3e48c945b44c37518cbd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/af9841366cf986fb230e3e48c945b44c37518cbd/0_206_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Donald Trump wants this year\u2019s Republican convention to replicate the crowded, in-person atmosphere of the 2016 version.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Donald Trump wants this year\u2019s Republican convention to replicate the crowded, in-person atmosphere of the 2016 version.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rick Wilking/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Both Biden and Trump have made appearances in public since the protests sparked by George Floyd\u2019s death have rocked the nation with scenes of unrest. Both have delivered remarks addressing those protests. But where Biden\u2019s public appearances and comments have largely been about calling for reform, Trump has pushed a \u201claw and order\u201d agenda \u2013 although he has publicly acknowledged Floyd\u2019s death.</p> <p>Biden is reportedly expected to attend Floyd\u2019s funeral next week. On Friday Trump is slated to travel to Maine to tour where he will tour a nasal swab facility.</p> <p>The differing approaches extend to fundraisers as well. According to a list obtained by the Guardian, all of Biden\u2019s upcoming fundraising events are virtual. By contrast, Trump and his team are plotting in-person fundraisers, according to <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2020/05/29/trump-schedules-in-person-fundraisers-as-shackles-come-off-289798\">Politico</a>.</p> <p>Ignoring the pandemic is also handy for a president whose response to a disaster that has killed 100,000 Americans and seen 40 million people lose their jobs has been widely slammed as chaotic and ineffective. Meanwhile, Biden\u2019s caution emphasizes the reality that the coronavirus remains an ongoing challenge for the government.</p> <p>\u201cProtesting aside, it\u2019s a tricky time because as we\u2019re seeing, yes some states are starting to open back up but, as we\u2019re seeing, the number of cases is going back up in those places. Just from a campaign perspective, trying to assess what you can do without putting people in danger [is important],\u201d said the Democratic strategist Karen Finney, who served as a senior communications adviser for Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign.</p> <p>Finney added that she doubted voters would rally around Trump\u2019s approach to campaigning like the pandemic never happened. Americans are having to accept that this entire election cycle will be unlike other ones, Finney said.</p> <p>\u201cI think this is also part of us accepting that it\u2019s all going to be very different, voting is going to be different,\u201d Finney added. \u201cWe may have to settle in and be prepared that we may not have a set answer on election night. It may be a two- or three-day process.\u201d</p> <p>The Trump team and the president himself have wanted to turn Biden\u2019s social distancing and virtual campaigning into a liability. Trump has dinged his likely rival as dotty and out of touch. Trump allies hope that if the president is confidently crisscrossing the country without a mask, doing campaign events, that will also offer a stark contrast with Biden. They hope he will appear weak to voters.</p> <p>Finney, though, said the reason Trump has been attacking Biden on the Democrat\u2019s caution is because so far it has helped Biden develop a healthy lead in the polls.</p> <p>\u201cThe reason Trump is attacking [Biden] is because the basement strategy has been very successful and effective,\u201d Finney said. Biden, Finney said, has been able to create virtual events that have been effective. \u201cHe\u2019s been able to deliver a clear, consistent message that actually is resonating with what people hear in this time of crisis and speaking to our fears and our concerns but also trying to put forward a positive message.\u201d</p>",

It\u2019s not an official figure, but comes from their own tally of arrest reports.</p> \n  <p>The AP figures show that Los Angeles has had more than a quarter of the national arrests, followed by New York, Dallas and Philadelphia. Many of the arrests have been for low-level offences such as curfew violations and failure to disperse. Hundreds were arrested on burglary and looting charges.</p> \n  <p>During the course of the protests it has been a common refrain from the authorities that \u201coutside agitators\u201d from out-of-town were responsible for the highly visible protests. Minnesota governor Tim Walz even went as far as to say that 80 percent of the participants in the demonstrations were from out of state.</p> \n  <p>The AP figures tell a different story. In a nearly 24-hour period from Saturday night to Sunday afternoon, 41 of the 52 people cited with protest-related arrests in Minneapolis had Minnesota driver\u2019s licenses, according to the Hennepin County sheriff.</p> \n  <p>Likewise, in the nation\u2019s capital, 86 percent of the more than 400 people arrested as of Wednesday afternoon were, according to AP, from Washington, D.C., Maryland and Virginia.</p> \n  <p>Los Angeles Chief Michel Moore told the city\u2019s Police Commission Tuesday the bulk of the arrests, about 2,500, were for failure to disperse or curfew violations. The rest were for crimes including burglary, looting, assaults on police officers and other violence. </p> \n  <p>The only other U.S. city with an arrest toll that comes close to Los Angeles\u2019 is New York, with about 2,000.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ed8a3848f082107f453a7bb\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-04T07:42:57.226Z\">8.42am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>If you\u2019ve been following the #BlackLivesMatter hashtag on social media you may have been surprised this morning by a sudden flood of Korean characters and the repeated phrase: \u201cWe stand against racial discrimination.

In San Francisco, protesters took the streets by foot and by horse. And in Seattle, demonstrations continued as the mayor announced that the curfew would be lifted.</li> \n   <li><strong>The former defense secretary, James Mattis, who quit over the president\u2019s attempts to withdraw troops from Syria, condemned the president\u2019s handling of protests in DC and around the country. </strong>Mattis, like other former military and defense officials, excoriated Trump for having peaceful protestors gassed so he could pose for a photo. </li> \n   <li><strong>Additional charges were filed against the former police officers involved in the killing of George Floyd. </strong>The<strong> </strong>Minnesota attorney general, <strong>Keith Ellison, </strong>said that the murder charge against <strong>Derek Chauvin </strong>had been elevated to second-degree murder, and three other officers had been charged with aiding and abetting second-degree murder.</li> \n   <li><strong>Kayleigh McEnany signaled defense secretary Mark Esper\u2019s job may be in trouble. </strong>Asked during her White House briefing about whether the president still has faith in Esper, the press secretary said, \u201cAs of right now, Secretary Esper is still Secretary Esper.\u201d The comment came after Esper said he would not support sending active-duty troops to states that have seen protests, as <strong>Trump </strong>has suggested.</li> \n   <li><strong>A prominent US police chief called for a nationwide ban on chokeholds </strong>in response to Floyd\u2019s death.<strong> </strong><strong>Cerelyn \u201cCJ\u201d Davis</strong>, the police chief of Durham, North Carolina, said on Good Morning America, \u201cThe emotions and feelings that we see expressed out on the streets of cities all across the country going way back are substantiated.

But that didn\u2019t stop them from trying to exploit racial tensions among US forces to encourage desertion in the closing days of World War II. </p> \n  <p>\u201cCreating wedges between people had been a Nazi strategy since the party\u2019s inception.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Widely seen as one of the \u201cadults in the room\u201d who attempted to restrain Trump during his first years in office, Mattis resigned as defense secretary over the president\u2019s attempts to withdraw troops from Syria. </p> \n  <p>His dissatisfaction with the president was widely known, but in 2019 the retired marine published a memoir, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/sep/01/call-sign-chaos-review-james-mattis-trump\">Call Sign Chaos</a>, which only obliquely referred to his differences with Trump. Publicising the book, Mattis said he believed it would be inappropriate for him to criticise a sitting president. </p> \n  <p>It seems Trump\u2019s actions on Monday, when he ordered an assault on peaceful protesters outside the White House <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/02/trump-washington-walk-to-the-church-photo-op\">so he could stage a photo op at St John\u2019s church</a>, helped to change Mattis\u2019s mind.

He is optimistic, he says, that \u201cthis country\u2019s going to get better\u201d.</p> \n  <p>The young of America have witnessed too much violence and death, he says, and \u201ctoo often that violence has come from folks supposed to be serving and protecting you\u201d.</p> \n  <p>Obama also acknowledges \u201cthe folks in law enforcement that share the goals of reimagining policing\u201d, who he says he knows are just as outraged as many of the protesters out on the streets across the country. He is heartened, he says, by seeing police and other officers who have engaged with the protests over George Floyd\u2019s death.</p> \n  <p>Obama discusses his <strong>task force on 21st-century policing</strong>, which was formed after the death of Michael Brown in Ferguson in 2014. </p> \n  <p>Its report, he says, \u201cshowcased a range of proven strategies and aims\u201d meant to be used for reforms. Most of the reforms needed should take place locally, Obama says. It is mayors and county executives that determine police practices, he says, and district and state attorneys decide whether to prosecute cases of police misconduct.</p> \n  <p>Obama says he has been hearing \u201ca little bit of chatter\u201d on the internet about \u201c<strong>voting vs protest</strong>\u201d, and that perhaps civil obedience is a better course of action to achieve change. Unsurprisingly, Obama doesn\u2019t agree. </p> \n  <p>\u201cThis is not an either-or,\u201d he says, having noted the local positions above are by and large voted for.</p> \n  <p>He says he is <strong>urging every mayor in the US to review use-of-force policies</strong> with their communities and commit to reforms they can make.</p> \n  <p>He also thinks every city in the US should \u201cbe a My Brother\u2019s Keeper community\u201d, aiming to expand opportunity for young men of colour, because the programme can make a difference.</p> \n  <p>Obama closes these remarks by saying people are reminded of the 60s by the current unrest and discord. There is something different here, he says. Nowadays there is a far more representative cross-section of America, he says, out on the streets protesting, and a majority of Americans think the protests over George Floyd\u2019s death are justified. The country must use this momentum for change, he says.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ed812cd8f08cadb60400993\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-03T21:20:34.298Z\">10.20pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Obama speaks</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Barack Obama is speaking now.

  "<p>Hours before peaceful protests against police brutality were forcibly dispersed so Donald Trump could pose with a Bible in front of St John\u2019s, Joe Biden also went to church.</p> \n<p>Head bowed, Biden prayed with community leaders at Bethel African Methodist Episcopal church in his home town of Wilmington, Delaware.

Their message was clear: he must do more.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe people in this room, we love you,\u201d state senator Darius Brown told him. \u201cBut we\u2019re here not only to love you, but to push you.\u201d</p> \n<p>America faces a stark choice in November. But contrast is not a vision, say activists, scholars and strategists, echoing calls from protesters for changes to the economic and political conditions that led to the death of another black man in police custody.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>In the last several days, the official death toll of the Covid-19 outbreak, which has been disproportionately affecting black communities, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/27/us-coronavirus-victims-stories\">surpassed 100,000 Americans</a>, while the economic turmoil left more than 40 million people without jobs \u2013&nbsp;all before Minneapolis erupted in furious protest, sparking demonstrations in cities across the country and the globe.</p> \n<p>The compounding crises present a critical test of leadership for the 77-year-old presumptive Democratic nominee who has cast his candidacy as a \u201cbattle for the soul of the nation\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cThis has to be about more than beating Donald Trump,\u201d Akunna Cook, the former president of the Black Economic Alliance. \u201cIt is not enough to just be better than Trump.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"0768e714e975e9f1c07b08445ea7bf77370f4788\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0768e714e975e9f1c07b08445ea7bf77370f4788/0_198_6048_3628/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Representative Lisa Blunt speaks with Joe Biden, along with members of the clergy and community leaders at Bethel AME church in Wilmington, Delaware.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Representative Lisa Blunt speaks with Joe Biden, along with members of the clergy and community leaders at Bethel AME church in Wilmington, Delaware.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jim Watson/AFP/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>So far, Biden, vice-president under Barack Obama, the nation\u2019s first black president, has sought to demonstrate he is capable of listening and leading. On Sunday, he made an unannounced visit to a protest site in Wilmington. He hosted a virtual roundtable with mayors to discuss the upheaval. On Tuesday, he traveled to Philadelphia, the birthplace of American democracy, to confront the \u201cracial wounds that have long plagued our country\u201d.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Cook, now a senior fellow at the Democratic thinktank Third Way, is encouraged but challenged Biden to do more to address deep-rooted racial and economic disparities.</p> \n<p>\u201cBiden has the latitude to be a transformational president and to have a transformational presidency,\u201d she said.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Biden won the Democratic primary on the strength of his support among black voters, particularly older, more moderate black voters who helped turn around his struggling presidential campaign starting in South Carolina.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Yet this coalition alone will probably not be enough to beat Trump. Biden\u2019s campaign has acknowledged he must also motivate younger and disaffected black voters who have lost faith in electoral politics.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Many of them are in the streets protesting police killings and institutionalized racism at this moment, said Cliff Albright, the co-founder of Black Voters Matter. He fears Democrats are charting a path that is vulnerable to low turnout.</p> \n<p>\u201cCome November, Democrats are going to be trying to figure out what it takes to get them out to vote,\u201d Albright said. \u201cThey\u2019re telling you what it will take. Does he listen? That will be the real test.\u201d</p> \n<p>The support of African American voters is critical to the success of any Democratic nominee. In 2016, black voter turnout <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/05/12/black-voter-turnout-fell-in-2016-even-as-a-record-number-of-americans-cast-ballots/\">fell</a> for the first time in two decades, the result of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/nov/08/this-was-the-election-of-disillusionment\">disillusionment</a>, compounded by <a href=\"https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/election-2016-restrictive-voting-laws-numbers\">voter disenfranchisement</a> and <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-49987657\">Russia interference</a> targeting African Americans online.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Trump has made a show of his efforts to peel away black support for the Democratic party, despite his long history of racist remarks and behavior. His campaign hosts online gatherings featuring African American surrogates and seized on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/22/joe-biden-draws-criticism-americans-who-back-trump-aint-black\">Biden\u2019s comment</a> last month that African American voters torn between him and the president \u201cain\u2019t black\u201d.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Since the protests began, Biden has sought to emphasize unity and solidarity, drawing a sharp contrast with Trump who characterized those demonstrating as \u201cthugs\u201d and \u201cterrorists\u201d and threatened to deploy the military if governors failed to \u201cdominate\u201d the protests. Amid the national upheaval, Biden has expressed hope that \u201cthe blinders have been taken off\u201d for many Americans, creating space for substantive change.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"9e7ea1f8f11790e4be174a694766d95ca5005c02\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9e7ea1f8f11790e4be174a694766d95ca5005c02/0_224_6720_4032/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A person holds a banner during a protest over the death of George Floyd in Washington on Tuesday.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A person holds a banner during a protest over the death of George Floyd in Washington on Tuesday.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Anadolu Agency/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>A <a href=\"https://www.monmouth.edu/polling-institute/reports/monmouthpoll_us_060320/\">Monmouth University poll </a>conducted as protests erupted, found more Americans trusted Biden than Trump to handle race relations in the country. Fifty-two per cent said they have a great deal or some confidence in Biden\u2019s ability to address the issue while only 40% said they felt the same about the president.</p> \n<p>Jabari Nyomba, 30, was among a crowd of thousands that circled the Barclays Center in Brooklyn to protest police brutality, chanting \u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d and carrying signs that memorialized George Floyd, Breonna Taylor and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ahmaud-arbery\">Ahmaud Arbery.</a></p> \n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re tired of institutional racism,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re tired of seeing our brothers and sisters getting killed by the ones that are supposed to serve and protect us.

Entering the race for president in 2019, Biden said he was motivated by the president\u2019s failure to unequivocally condemn white supremacists in the wake of violent clashes in Charlottesville, Virginia, in 2017.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>But Biden\u2019s record on matters of race is complicated. His treatment of Anita Hill during the 1991 supreme court nomination hearings for Clarence Thomas, and his authorship of a 1994 crime bill that many activists and researchers say led to an era of mass incarceration, are still points of contention.</p> \n<p>During the primary, his more liberal rivals attacked him over his past stances on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jun/27/second-democratic-debate-joe-biden-bernie-sanders\">mandatory school busing</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jun/06/elizabeth-warren-biden-abortion-video-response-clip-msnbc-town-hall\">abortion</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NBCNews/status/1197364395204059136?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1197364395204059136&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rollingstone.com%2Fpolitics%2Fpolitics-news%2Fbooker-biden-marijuana-legalization-915725%2F\">marijuana legalization</a>.

Pressure was already building on Biden to choose a black woman, a list that includes California senator Kamala Harris, congresswoman Val Demings of Florida and former Georgia House Democratic leader Stacey Abrams.</p> \n<p>Others are more concerned about the candidate\u2019s criminal justice credentials,&nbsp;arguing that prosecutors should not be considered. Progressives have singled out Minnesota senator Amy Klobuchar, a former top prosecutor in Minnesota, as particularly problematic, though Harris, a former state attorney general, and Demings, a former Orlando police chief, have also come under renewed scrutiny.</p> \n<p>Perhaps more important than who is on his ticket is who Biden mobilizes behind him, said Rashad Robinson, the president of Color of Change, a racial justice organization. Biden, he said, must do more to engage grassroots organizers leading the next generation of civil rights leaders.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>\u201cThis is a fight for political power and there are deeply entrenched forces that will stand in the way of any change,\u201d he said. \u201cHe cannot just aspirationally ask us to come together.

  "<p>A former <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jan/10/iran-prisoners-abuse-jail\">prosecutor general of Tehran</a> described by activists as a serial human rights abuser has been sentenced to 135 lashes for financial corruption.

He was linked to the case of Zahra Kazemi, an Iranian-Canadian photographer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/apr/05/iran.worlddispatch\">who died in Evin prison in 2003</a>. <br></p> <p>Tara Sepehri Far of Human Rights Watch said Mortazavi was linked with \u201cthe most flagrant human rights abuses committed in recent years\u201d, including \u201ccredible allegations of torture and deaths of protesters detained in the crackdown following the 2009 presidential election\u201d. </p> <p>\u201cWhile this verdict shows that figures such as Mortazavi are not immune from prosecution for ever, justice should first and foremost prioritise addressing his role in Iran\u2019s darkest recent history,\u201d she said. \u201cYet, he also should be treated humanely, something that was denied to Iranians during his time as a prosecutor, and not be subjected to corporal punishment or other inhuman treatment.\u201d<br></p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/iran-blog/2015/nov/02/iran-new-wave-repression-says-akbar-ganji\">Iranian writer Akbar Ganji</a>, a victim of Mortazavi\u2019s targeting of journalists, told the Guardian the sentencing was a \u201cwhitewash\u201d. \u201cIt means that he is not being punished. It is not surprising \u2013 one could not expect anything else from the Iranian judiciary. Mortazavi is protected by the most powerful people in Iran. He acted on their orders,\u201d Ganji said.<br></p> <p>Mortazavi came under scrutiny <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jan/10/iran-prisoners-abuse-jail\">from the Iranian parliament</a> and judiciary soon after allegations surfaced about his role in the deaths of protesters imprisoned at the Kahrizak detention centre. Mortazavi has since been acquitted of charges relating to this. <br></p> <p>Hadi Ghaemi, of the New York-based International Campaign for Human Rights in Iran, said: \u201cThis sentence is yet another example of rampant impunity in Iran. No justice is being delivered here, given the extent of graft and corruption committed by Mortazavi, and his involvement in the torture and deaths of protesters in custody in 2009. Also, sentencing him to flogging, if meant to demonstrate a serious punishment, is just physical barbarity that does nothing to hold him accountable in any meaningful way.\u201d</p> <p>Ahmadinejad went to great lengths to protect Mortazavi after the Kahrizak scandal, appointing him head of Iran\u2019s social security organisation, which provides insurance to many government and private employees. <br></p> <p>In 2013, Mortazavi\u2019s name was mentioned in the Iranian parliament in a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/feb/05/mahmoud-ahmadinejad-ayatollah-ali-khamenei\">hugely embarrassing public row</a> between Ahmadinejad and the parliamentary speaker, Ali Larijani. Ahmadinejad played a secretly filmed tape showing that Larijani\u2019s brother was allegedly trading on his sibling\u2019s influence for personal financial gain in a conversation with Mortazavi. Mortazavi was briefly detained after the incident. <br></p> <p>Amnesty International\u2019s Iran researcher, Raha Bahreini, said: \u201cFlogging and other forms of corporal judicial punishment violate international law and cannot be justified in any circumstances. <br></p> <p>\u201cInstead of meting out brutal punishments, the Iranian authorities should be abolishing all forms of corporal punishment and conducting an independent, impartial and thorough investigation into Saeed Mortazavi\u2019s alleged involvement in human rights violations, including the deaths, torture and arbitrary detention of dozens of protesters following the disputed presidential election in 2009.\u201d</p>",

And I want us \u2013 I want every man out there who\u2019s voting \u2013 to kind of look inside yourself and ask yourself, if you\u2019re having problems with this stuff, how much of it is that we\u2019re just not used to it.\u201d</p> <p>He added: \u201cSo that you \u2013 when a guy\u2019s ambitious and out in the public arena and working hard, well, that\u2019s OK. But when a woman suddenly does the [same] \u2013 you\u2019re like, why is she doing that? I\u2019m just being honest.

The statement comments that \u201dthe case for an increase in the federal funds rate has continued to strengthen\u201d while adding the word \u201csome\u201d to the line that it wants to \u201cwait for SOME further evidence of continued progress towards its objectives\u201d. This all suggests that things are moving in the right direction, but the Presidential election is an obvious reason for waiting.</p> <p>Assuming Clinton wins, markets are likely to react with relief given expectations of policy continuity. This, coupled with the reasonably firm growth, rising employment and a gradual pick-up in inflation should reinforce market expectations for a December rate hike. Should Trump win then this is likely to hurt market sentiment given uncertainty as to what he will actually do when in power. It is hard to imagine the Fed hiking in this environment. We also have plenty more data to come ahead of the December 14 FOMC meeting, including two more job reports so there are other reasons for caution.</p> </blockquote> <p>The Fed statement has failed to give much support to the dollar, and US markets have struggled for direction after the news.

Combined with a slump in oil prices following a record weekly rise in US crude stocks, this has pushed markets in Europe sharply lower.</p> <p>But on Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which lost 100 points or so on Tuesday, has not been hit as badly (so far), and is currently down just 20 points ahead of the latest US Federal Reserve interest rate decision.<br></p> <p>Meanwhile the Vix index of volatility, seen as a gauge of investor fears, is up 3% to 19. When Clinton looked a shoo-in to win, the index was hovering around 13. But despite this recent rise, it is still well below the 25 level it reached after the Brexit vote in June. Jasper Lawler, market analyst at CMC Markets, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Less than a week out from the US election and markets are demonstrating both complacency and a palpable fear at the same time.

Kathleen Brooks, research director at City Index, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The markets are not in full on panic mode right now, suggesting that they still think Clinton could clinch a win next week. This is reflected in the Vix volatility index, which is considered a fear gauge for Wall Street. Even though it has risen in recent days it is still below 20%, to put this in context, after the Brexit vote in June volatility spiked above 25%.</p> <p>Global stock markets are generally lower on Wednesday, but US markets have outperformed their European counterparts even with 6 days to go before the US election. Interestingly, the Dow Jones Transport Index, considered a lead indicator for Wall Street, is higher today. Considering a Trump presidency is considered the worst outcome for the US economy, the fact that this index has not fallen further on the back of the bad poll news for the Clinton camp, suggests that the US equity market may not sell off sharply until volatility spikes further, or until the actual result is confirmed.</p> </blockquote> <p>But the other potentially market moving event is the US Federal Reserve interest rate announcement later. Brooks said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The market is expecting a 14% chance of a hike tonight. If the Fed does hike, that would throw the cat among the pigeons, and we could see a steeper sell off in equities, a rally in bond yields and a broad-based recovery in the dollar.</p> <p>However, in our view the bigger risk from today\u2019s meeting could be a dovish slant from the Federal Reserve, who may not want to commit to a rate hike until the election result is confirmed. Although the Fed is expected to be politically neutral, a potential market sell-off on the back of a win for Trump next week could put the prospect of a December rate hike to bed for the Fed. Added to this, the Fed chair and vice chair have given speeches with fairly dovish slants in recent weeks, so a sell-off in the dollar on Wednesday could be in advance of a dovish \u201cshock\u201d from the Fed later on today.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5819fcc5e4b029b92ca44c01\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-02T14:48:42.158Z\">2.48pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/ReutersJamie/status/793825218724782080\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">$50 fading fast.

Originally the former deputy prime minister was quoted in Tatler magazine as saying that the alsatian, Kim, had turned violent so he \u201ctook Kim\u2019s collar \u2013 a sort of choke chain \u2013 and pulled it tight. Suddenly he went limp. I was devoted to Kim, but he\u2019d obviously had some sort of mental breakdown.

But since the ensuing furore, and criticism from the RSPCA, Lord Heseltine has insisted that Kim recovered after he had strangled him, that Kim was later taken to the vet to be put down in a non-strangulation manner, and that anything else was \u201cterrible misrepresentation\u201d.</p> <p>Whether or not Heseltine intended a finely judged temporary incapacitation, his anecdote weirdly reminded me of the famous ending of Franz Kafka\u2019s The Trial, in which the hero,&#xa0;Josef K, is brutally stabbed by two well-dressed gentlemen. As he loses consciousness, he murmurs reproachfully: \u201cLike a dog!\u201d It was \u201cas if he meant the shame of it to outlive him\u201d.

  "<p>Let\u2019s face it, this year our options in the voting booth are historically terrible. <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/10/31/clinton-loses-popularity-edge-in-tight-race-with-trump-new-post-abc-tracking-poll-finds/\">Poll</a> after <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/other/trump_favorableunfavorable-5493.html\">poll</a> after <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/other/clinton_favorableunfavorable-1131.html\">poll</a> has told the same story: the majority of Americans, some six in 10 by most counts, view both Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton negatively. Not, \u201cThat movie was a real waste of time,\u201d negatively; more like, \u201cIf my daughter goes out with him she may not come home again,\u201d negatively.</p> <p>Another way to say that is, most people either despise or fear both major party candidates, which befuddles both presidential contenders and their insular entourages but not the rest of us. That\u2019s why this year millions of voters are <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/29/us/politics/hillary-clinton-millennials-third-party.html\">exploring</a> casting their ballot for third, and even fourth, party candidates.

That was before people even knew who he was, so many voters were elated to find out there was someone on their ballots who wasn\u2019t Trump or Clinton.</p> <p>Then Johnson <a href=\"http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/presidential-races/283878-johnson-ive-stopped-using-marijuana-while-running-for\">put down his marijuana pipe</a> and started to introduce himself to voters.

Then he <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/onpolitics/2016/09/28/gary-johnson-another-aleppo-moment/91249582/\">failed to name a single world leader</a> when lobbed a softball question in a town hall.

And as despicable as Donald Trump\u2019s words are, I find Hillary Clinton\u2019s actions and track record is very troubling.\u201d</p> <p>But a cursory look at <a href=\"http://www.jill2016.com/platform\">Stein\u2019s platform</a> reveals she\u2019s living in an alternative universe from most American voters. While most voters fear the growth of Isis, she\u2019s calling for cutting military spending by 50% along with closing more than 700 US military bases abroad. This may be why her longshot bid keeps her hovering at around the 2% mark in national polls.</p> <p>In Utah and 11 other states, voters will see Evan McMullin on their ballots. The former CIA operative and Republican congressional staffer is taking advantage of Trump\u2019s repugnance to many Mormons and <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2016/11/evan-mcmullin-independent-election-230615\">is angling to win just one state</a> in order to have his name thrust before the all-important electoral college. </p> <p>McMullin makes sense for many Utah voters who say their faith prohibits them from supporting either Trump or Clinton. But barring deep religious conviction, in other states the notion of casting a protest vote is just too dangerous in this cycle.</p> <p>The Grand Ole Party is having a grand ole food fight for all to see. The Tea Party wing of the party has morphed into a Trump-fueled alt-right populist movement that <a href=\"http://www.mystatesman.com/news/news/state-regional-govt-politics/the-voice-in-donald-trumps-head-austins-alex-jones/nst9F/\">trusts Alex Jones conspiracy theories</a> more than facts and data. And Trump himself has even lashed out at the House speaker, Paul Ryan, and other congressional Republicans in recent weeks.</p> <p>But in a sign of the times for the GOP, Ryan <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/11/us/politics/donald-trump-gop-hillary-clinton.html\">abandoned Trump</a> last month only to <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/paul-ryan-votes-donald-trump-house-freedom-caucus-2016-11\">cast his vote for him</a> this week. It\u2019s that kind of unprincipled, even feckless, leadership from the Republican party that led to the rise of the misogynistic and racist Donald Trump. Republican leaders have stoked fear in their base since President Obama was elected and now they have lost control of their own narrative and voters.</p> <p>That\u2019s why this isn\u2019t the year to mess with a third-party vote \u2013 since no third-party candidate is going to win, all those votes might do is prevent a Clinton victory, putting the GOP meltdown front and center in global governance. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/31/us-election-green-party-jill-stein\">Don't settle for the lesser of two evils in this election.

  "<p>The race between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump appears to be getting even closer with just six days left before the election. An <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/us/general_election_trump_vs_clinton-5491.html\">average of six different polls</a> shows that Clinton is now just 1.7 percentage points ahead of Trump. But there\u2019s still a lot of variation \u2013 one poll finds that Clinton is three points ahead, another finds that she is six points <em>behind </em>Trump. Both surveys were conducted after news that the justice department had obtained a warrant to investigate an aide to Clinton\u2019s emails, before which her lead was already shrinking. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video element--supporting\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/nov/03/donald-trump-hillary-clinton-nevada-voters-women\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/5aj3x\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2867968\"            data-video-name=\"Nevada's women stand divided over Trump and Clinton on eve of election \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-581aee5ae4b029b92ca45061\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/11/03/161026Awbwvegasv2_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/11/03/161026Awbwvegasv2.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/11/03/161026Awbwvegasv2_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/nov/03/donald-trump-hillary-clinton-nevada-voters-women\">Nevada\u2019s women stand divided over Trump and Clinton on eve of election</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>That variation between polls isn\u2019t surprising \u2013 it can be explained by the fact that different polls speak to different people. For example, the LA Times poll which has consistently found that Trump has more national support, includes one <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/13/upshot/how-one-19-year-old-illinois-man-is-distorting-national-polling-averages.html\">19-year-old black male</a> respondent who consistently said he\u2019ll vote for the Republican nominee. That one individual has a disproportionate impact because of a statistical process called <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/video/2016/jun/01/political-polls-bad-for-democracy-heres-why-video\">weighting</a> (where one respondent can end up representing hundreds of thousands of voters). </p> <p>So, are current polls a good reflection of what will happen on election day? Historically, the answer is \u201cnot bad\u201d, although they will probably be a much better indicator by the morning of 8 November rather than now. Clinton\u2019s email scandal will probably go down in US political history as an \u201c<a href=\"http://politicaldictionary.com/words/october-surprise/\">October surprise</a>\u201d, a last-minute news event that can cause a shift in public opinion. Those surprises \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/01/us/october-surprises-dont-necessarily-sway-elections-or-occur-in-october.html\">which have included Lyndon Johnson\u2019s announcement of a halt in the bombing of North Vietnam in 1968, and the news of a drunk-driving charge for George W Bush in 2000</a> \u2013 typically don\u2019t affect final outcomes all that much though, as the chart below shows.

In 2000, it wasn\u2019t just ABC and the Washington Post that predicted a Bush win \u2013 polling averages also showed the Republican <a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-much-do-october-surprises-move-the-polls/\">three points</a> ahead of Al Gore. Though both candidates ended up with 48% of the popular vote, that\u2019s only after rounding. The actual result was Gore-Bush, <a href=\"http://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/national.php?f=0&amp;year=2000\">48.4%-47.9%</a>. Bush ultimately became president because the distribution of those votes worked in his favour \u2013 he collected 271 of the 538 electoral college votes (270 are needed to win). </p> <p>The map looks a little more daunting for the 2016 Republican candidate, though. Even if Trump can win <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/fl/florida_trump_vs_clinton-5635.html\">Florida</a>, <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/oh/ohio_trump_vs_clinton-5634.html\">Ohio</a> and <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/ia/iowa_trump_vs_clinton_vs_johnson_vs_stein-5981.html\">Iowa</a> (three important states where he is in a close race with Clinton), <em>and </em>all the other states where he is leading (including those where it\u2019s close), he would still need to secure at least one state with a <a href=\"https://www.archives.gov/federal-register/electoral-college/allocation.html\">decent number</a> of electoral college votes like <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/va/virginia_trump_vs_clinton-5542.html\">Virginia</a>, <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/pa/pennsylvania_trump_vs_clinton-5633.html\">Pennsylvania</a> or <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/mi/michigan_trump_vs_clinton-5533.html\">Michigan</a>. But Clinton is ahead in all three of those states by a pretty safe margin of five to seven points. </p> <p>The Trump campaign may take solace in the fact that history might not be a great guide in this election. The accuracy of polling is now in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/datablog/2016/jan/27/dont-trust-the-polls-the-systemic-issues-that-make-voter-surveys-unreliable\">doubt</a>. More importantly, in this election, Americans are faced with a choice between two of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/31/polls-donald-trump-hillary-clinton-unpopularity\">most disliked</a> presidential candidates in living memory, where media reporting on polling data is continually shaping their choices. If would-be Democratic voters think a Clinton win is inevitable, or dislike both candidates in equal measure, they might just <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/01/clinton-trump-polls-election-voter-turnout-suppression\">stay at home</a>. And if there are enough of those voters in the right states, Trump could still become the 45th president of the US. </p>",

Eighty-seven percent of counties in the United States do not have an abortion provider. </p> <p>In 2016, black and Latina women continue to face enormous systemic barriers to reproductive healthcare, resulting in higher rates of death from breast and cervical cancer and higher rates of uninsurance.</p> <p>Many immigrants are excluded from healthcare coverage or face other hurdles to getting care for themselves and their families. And LGBTQ communities face major barriers to access to reproductive healthcare, from lack of culturally competent training of providers to meet their healthcare needs to outright discrimination.</p> <p>There are steps we can take to level the playing field for those left behind by uneven progress. Right now the discriminatory <a href=\"https://www.plannedparenthoodaction.org/issues/abortion/hyde-amendment\">Hyde amendment</a> forces women who rely on Medicaid to pay out of pocket for abortion, a financial hurdle that makes their right to safe and legal abortion meaningless. </p> <p>Hillary Clinton will work to overturn it. Because she understands the experiences of women, she\u2019s committed to building on the progress of the Affordable Care Act, which covers preventive care for women, maternity care, and bans insurance companies from charging women more for the same coverage as men. She has plans for expanding <a href=\"https://www.hillaryclinton.com/issues/health-care/\">access to care</a>, especially where it\u2019s needed most, for ending HIV/Aids, for women\u2019s health, and more.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/20/nasty-woman-insult-hillary-clinton\">'Nasty woman' is an insult we know all too well</a> </p> </aside>  <p>We need Hillary Clinton\u2019s leadership because politicians like Donald Trump and Mike Pence do not trust women to make their own healthcare decisions.

In race after race this cycle, we have seen candidates pretending to embrace policies that support women while voting repeatedly to defund Planned Parenthood and restricting access to birth control. And in many states, including my home state of Texas, anti-women\u2019s health politicians hold the majority. In the first half of 2016 alone, these politicians introduced <a href=\"https://www.guttmacher.org/article/2016/07/laws-affecting-reproductive-health-and-rights-state-trends-midyear-2016\">445 provisions</a> to restrict access to safe and legal abortion. </p> <p>Deciding when and whether to have children is one of the most important decisions anyone makes in their lifetime, and it\u2019s not the government\u2019s role to interfere.</p> <p>The week she clinched the nomination, Hillary Clinton <a href=\"http://time.com/4364631/hillary-clinton-planned-parenthood-speech-transcript/\">spoke</a> to Planned Parenthood Action Fund members, saying, \u201cLife is freer, fairer, healthier, safer, and far more humane when women are empowered to make their own reproductive health decisions.\u201d</p> <p>She knows this from her own life, as a woman, mother and grandmother, and she has made it one of the central themes of her career as a public servant. She made it clear as first lady when she traveled to Beijing, against the advice of those who told her it would rock the boat, with the message \u201cwomen\u2019s rights are human rights, once and for all\u201d.</p> <p>She put it into action as secretary of state, prioritizing education, health and opportunity for women and girls. </p> <p>Hillary Clinton is the fiercest champion for women and reproductive rights to ever be within reach of the presidency. For her, these are not fringe issues \u2013 for women, they touch every aspect of our lives. </p> <p>This election is a choice between someone who will divide and insult us, and set us back decades in ensuring equality and economic security for ourselves and our families, or someone who has set a new precedent for bold leadership on behalf of women\u2019s health and rights. </p> <p>There is no contest.

The backlash was so intense that it caused Belamire to suspend her Twitter account.</p> <p>Can you be sexually assaulted in virtual reality? And can anything be done to prevent it? Those are a few of the most pressing ethical questions technologists, investors and we the public will face as VR grows. </p> <p>And growing it is. According to Digi-Capital, there <a href=\"http://www.digi-capital.com/news/2016/04/arvr-investment-hits-1-7-billion-in-last-12-months/#.WBjCGJMrI_V\">was</a> $1.7bn worth of augmented reality/virtual reality investments in the 12 months to Q1 2016. Goldman Sachs Group <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-01-13/goldman-sachs-has-four-charts-showing-the-huge-potential-in-virtual-and-augmented-reality\">has estimated</a> that by 2025, the VR industry could be worth $80-$182bn.</p> <h2>A big ethical question</h2> <p>To understand the importance of VR in our future, we need to think of it not as an industry but as an interface, a new way of interacting with the world. We\u2019ve gone from desktops to mobile computing; the next step-change is VR. It can be hard to see this now: VR is still in its infancy and can be easily dismissed as gimmicky, or just for gamers. However, as the technology scales, the potential of VR is enormous. It could change our economy, our media, and how we live our lives. </p> <p>What excites people about VR is its immersiveness. VR doesn\u2019t just give you the opportunity of being in other places, it lets you put yourself in other people\u2019s shoes. As such, it\u2019s often been described as an \u201cempathy machine\u201d.</p> <p>Jeremy Bailenson, director of Stanford University\u2019s Virtual Human Interaction Lab, has said that \u201cfeeling prejudice by walking a mile in someone else\u2019s shoes is what VR was made for\u201d. Charities are leveraging VR\u2019s empathy equity to help people understand what it\u2019s like to be a refugee. The NFL is using it for diversity training. As such, VR has enormous potential for good. But, as Belamire\u2019s experience also illustrates, it also has potential for very real harm. Think about the harassment that women and minorities are routinely subject to online today. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>To understand VR, we need to think of it not as an industry, but as a new way of interacting with the world</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Now think about that in virtual reality. If we\u2019re not careful we could end up amplifying the divides and inequality in the real world in a virtual one; we could effectively make VR a no-go area for anyone who isn\u2019t a privileged straight white man.</p> <p>If we want virtual reality to have a positive impact on our actual reality, we need to start designing for this now, anticipating the potential for harassment and discrimination in VR and finding ways to stop them. We need to avoid the mistakes that were made when social media networks were developed. </p> <p>The most important way to do that is ensuring that the people who are creating VR technology and content are from a diverse set of backgrounds. After all, what we get out of VR depends on what we put into it.</p> <p>Amelia Winger-Bearskin, a technologist, says we are at a turning point with VR \u201cwhere the way we interact computationally with the world is going to shift. If we don\u2019t have diverse people in the beginning of that conversation then we will just increase this gulf that we have between people who are able to be part of that conversation and those who aren\u2019t.\u201d</p> <h2>A bug in the matrix</h2> <p>Diversity has been a bug that an overwhelmingly white, male Silicon Valley has been trying to fix for several years, so far unsuccessfully. Defending themselves against their dismal diversity numbers, tech companies often like to focus on the \u201cpipeline\u201d problem: that there simply aren\u2019t enough skilled minorities to hire in the first place. </p> <p>However, they don\u2019t have that excuse with virtual reality. Because VR is in its infancy, it\u2019s still a fairly flat playing field when it comes to who is equipped to break into it. We\u2019ve got a chance to fix that pipeline from its start. And, to be fair, tech companies seem to be rising to the occasion. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/apr/04/techies-photography-project-silicon-valley-diversity-helena-price\">Picturing 'techies': photo project captures the unseen diversity of Silicon Valley</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Earlier this year Oculus, the Facebook-owned VR company, announced a diversity program called Launch Pad to attract the development efforts of \u201cwomen, people of color, members of the LGBTQ community\u201d. Winger-Bearskin was selected to be one of around 100 Launch Pad fellows and took part in a virtual reality bootcamp in May. Since then Oculus has mentored the fellows via online forums and will be announcing scholarships for select fellows in the next couple weeks. </p> <p>Apart from a spate of food poisoning that, one fellow told me, had large numbers of the diversity fellows violently vomiting in the Facebook bathrooms during the bootcamp, all seemed to be going very well with the Launch Pad program. Many of the fellows praised it as an example of how Silicon Valley should be thinking about and going about diversity. Diversity programs can often feel superficial or tokenistic but Launch Pad \u201cdidn\u2019t feel like a charity\u201d, said Aliah Darke, a diversity fellow. \u201cIt felt like \u2018we have all these questions in VR and we need as many people solving these questions as possible\u2019. It felt like they understood the value of diversity in helping to come up with novel ideas.\u201d </p> <p>Then on 22 September, news broke that Palmer Luckey, Oculus\u2019s founder, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/sep/23/oculus-palmer-luckey-funding-trump-reddit-trolls\">had been secretly funding</a> a pro-Trump organization called Nimble America, a shady organization (which has now erased itself from the internet) dedicated to swaying the election Trump\u2019s way through \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/sep/23/oculus-rift-vr-palmer-luckey-trump-shitposts\">shitposting</a>\u201d. </p> <p>This basically involves troll armies overwhelming online conversations with inane memes. The idea being to derail conversations and, therefore, shut people up. It\u2019s the opposite of an open internet. It\u2019s the opposite of empathy.</p> <h2>Hitting back at the bro-gammer culture</h2> <p>Many people in the VR community look up to Luckey, idolize him even. He is a wunderkind who developed a groundbreaking VR headset in his parents\u2019 basement then sold it to Facebook for $2bn in 2014. He\u2019s one of the most influential people in VR, and he\u2019s only just turned 24. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"6adb00c4fca7a87af4656e009f48904e40127a8f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6adb00c4fca7a87af4656e009f48904e40127a8f/0_0_870_1157/752.jpg\" alt=\"Palmer Luckey, the founder of Oculus Rift, on the cover of Time magazine.\" width=\"752\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Palmer Luckey, the founder of Oculus Rift, on the cover of Time magazine.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Time magazine</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The idea that he might be aligned with the alt-right, a group that has been vocal in its hatred for many marginalized groups, caused widespread dismay. </p> <p>Some developers said they would boycott Oculus as a platform. A number of the diversity fellows started to wonder how serious Oculus really was about diversity. </p> <p>It didn\u2019t help that, shortly after the news about Luckey broke, Amy Thole, Oculus\u2019s diversity manager, emailed Launch Pad participants to say she was leaving the company. She was replaced by Ebony Peay, who had spent two years at Oculus as an executive assistant. It\u2019s not clear whether this had anything to do with Luckey; neither Thole nor Peay responded to multiple requests for comment. Shortly after, Oculus also announced that it was delaying the announcement of the Launch Pad scholarship and the fellows have been frustrated at the lack of communication from Oculus since.</p> <p>Some of the diversity fellows began to wonder whether it would feel right taking Oculus\u2019s money anyway. Darke wasn\u2019t one of these people. \u201cMy answer was, taking money from powerful white men that I disagree with is my happy place,\u201d she told me over Skype. \u201cI don\u2019t think that marginalized people should deny themselves opportunities because of something foolish that a young white guy did.\u201d</p> <p>The problem, however, is whether marginalized people might end up being denied opportunities because of something a privileged white guy did. When influential people align themselves with extreme views, they help normalize them. </p> <p>Jeris JC Miller, who at 60 is one of the oldest fellows on the Launch Pad, told me she believes that Luckey\u2019s actions set \u201ca precedent that misogyny, sexism, racism, implied racism is OK\u201d. This has real ramifications on the working culture in tech which has a knock-on effect in diversity in tech and VR. \u201cIt\u2019s really challenging to live and create in a bro-grammer culture. It\u2019s hard. There\u2019s an ethos and an ethic and a style of relating that in many cases is quite painful for women and minorities.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Palmer Luckey's actions set a precedent that misogyny, sexism, racism, implied racism is OK</p> <footer> <cite>Jeris JC Miller, Facebook diversity fellow</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Of course, Luckey is just one man. While he appears to still be employed by Oculus (neither Facebook nor Oculus responded to repeated requests for comment) he doesn\u2019t necessarily represent their values, as Luckey made clear in an apology he posted after the news first broke. </p> <p>What\u2019s more, at the Oculus Connect developer conference earlier this month \u2013 from which Luckey was conspicuously absent \u2013 Oculus (and by extension Facebook) announced it would be spending $10m to fund diversity programs for VR.</p> <p>At the same time that Facebook is throwing money at diversity and distancing itself from Luckey, however, it has found itself dealing with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/oct/18/donald-trump-peter-thiel-support-facebook\">Peter Thiel\u2019s support of Trump</a>. Thiel, an influential board member of Facebook, recently gave $1.25m to the Republican presidential nominee. As this donation came in the wake of multiple sexual assaults allegations against the nominee, it was construed by some as condoning Trump\u2019s actions. </p> <p>Mark Zuckerberg has stood by Thiel; defending Thiel\u2019s donation in an internal Facebook post, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/oct/19/peter-thiel-support-donald-trump-mark-zuckerberg\">framing it as a question of \u201cdiversity\u201d</a>. Diversity of points of view, he said, was as important as diversity of background.</p> <p>Zuckerberg\u2019s reframing of diversity is worrying sophistry. Everyone is entitled to their viewpoint, of course. But most people don\u2019t have the resources, power and influence that the likes of Thiel and Luckey do. </p> <p>These are the people at the helm of building the infrastructure of tomorrow, who are leveraging technology to create a virtual world to their tastes. If Trump loses in November, his followers may well just build an alternative Trumpmenistan in the virtual world. And that will have a real effect on us all.</p>",
  "<p>With the presidential election one week away, a handful of Republicans are already vowing to oppose any nominee to the supreme court proposed by Hillary Clinton should she be elected.</p> <p>At least three Republican senators have voiced support for indefinitely blocking Clinton from filling the supreme court vacancy left by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/feb/13/antonin-scalia-dead-us-supreme-court-justice-obituary\">the late justice Antonin Scalia</a>, thus breaking with a 150-year precedent for having nine justices serving on the nation\u2019s highest bench.</p> <p>Senators Ted Cruz, of Texas; John McCain, of Arizona; and Richard Burr, of North Carolina have all suggested leaving Scalia\u2019s seat open if Clinton reaches the White House. Cruz, in particular, argued there was a \u201clong historical precedent\u201d for having fewer than nine justices on the supreme court.</p> <p>Senate Republican leaders have yet to hold a hearing or a vote on Merrick Garland, who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2016/mar/16/obama-nominates-merrick-garland-supreme-court-dc-appeals-court-judge\">was nominated by Barack Obama to replace Scalia in March</a>. Republicans justified their refusal to move forward on the Garland nomination by saying the next president should fill the vacancy. But as Donald Trump\u2019s path to the White House narrows, a potential split is emerging within the party ranks on how to proceed when Congress returns after the election for a lame duck session.</p> <p>Florida senator Marco Rubio, for example, was not willing to go as far as Cruz and his other colleagues when asked by the Guardian if he supported an indefinite blockade under a prospective Clinton presidency.</p> <p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t believe that we should do that if they propose nominees that are good,\u201d Rubio, who ran unsuccessfully for the Republican presidential nomination, said in an interview last week. \u201cI\u2019m not going to go and predispose them that way.\u201d</p> <p>Rubio\u2019s response came with the caveat, however, that he found it unlikely Clinton would nominate an individual who shared his view of the role of the court.</p> <p>\u201cIf it\u2019s someone good who understands that their job is to apply the constitution, according to its original intent, then that will be a welcome surprise,\u201d he said. \u201cBut barring whether it\u2019s Republican or a Democrat, if they appoint someone who I believe doesn\u2019t meet that standard I\u2019ll oppose that nominee.\u201d</p> <p>Rubio, facing a tighter than expected re-election battle in Florida, has not met with Garland and has expressed his opposition to Obama\u2019s nomination.</p> <p>Burr, who is locked in a dead heat for his own re-election in North Carolina, made a far more declarative statement on how he would treat a supreme court nominee under Clinton.</p> <p>\u201cIf Hillary Clinton becomes president, I am going to do everything I can do to make sure four years from now, we still got an opening on the supreme court,\u201d Burr told Republican volunteers in a private meeting, according to leaked audio <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/31/politics/richard-burr-hillary-clinton-gun-owners/index.html\">first reported by CNN</a>.</p> <p>McCain, another vulnerable incumbent Republican, similarly vowed to oppose any nominee under Clinton last month, stating in a radio show interview: \u201cI promise you that we will be united against any supreme court nominee that Hillary Clinton, if she were president, would put up. I promise you.\u201d</p> <p>McCain later <a href=\"http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/politics/ct-john-mccain-hillary-clinton-supreme-court-20161017-story.html\">walked back his pledge</a> when faced with criticism.</p> <p>McCain\u2019s colleague from Arizona, Senator Jeff Flake, has adopted a far more conciliatory tone by calling on Republicans to move forward with the Garland nomination in the lame duck session if Clinton is elected.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s a difference between what might be constitutional and what you could do politically and what you should do,\u201d Flake <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2016/10/republicans-split-supreme-court-vacancy-230395\">told Politico</a>. \u201cAnd I think leaving a vacancy for up to four years is not why we\u2019re here.</p> <p>\u201cIt may be what becomes a litmus test if you\u2019re a true conservative \u2026 Just to go on record, I won\u2019t be part of that.\u201d</p> <p>Chuck Grassley, the Iowa senator who chairs the Senate judiciary committee, also rejected the proposed tactics of blanket opposition.</p> <p>\u201cIf that new president happens to be Hillary, we can\u2019t just simply stonewall,\u201d Grassley told reporters on a conference call last month.</p> <p>Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, has also reaffirmed his belief that the next president should fill the vacancy left by Scalia.</p> <p>The White House sharply criticized Republicans proposing a smaller supreme court bench under Clinton. Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary, said such an approach was \u201cthe same kind of dysfunction that has infected Washington for the last six years\u201d.</p> <p>Public opinion of the supreme court reveals a fairly even ideological split in its favorability and how it should interpret the constitution. But a majority of the American public has expressed <a href=\"http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/09/26/5-facts-about-the-supreme-court/\">disagreement</a> with the decision by Republicans to not hold a hearing on Garland\u2019s nomination.</p>",

  "<p>People are surprised when I express support for Hillary Clinton. My economic politics are hard to the left and, unlike hers, explicitly socialist.

The Australian writer <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://thebigsmoke.com.au/2016/08/01/phenomenon-silent-hillary-clinton-supporters/\">Jane Caro described an experience of praising Clinton</a> and being \u201cabused, sneered at, patronised (oh my God, how you will be patronised) and sent endless propaganda purporting to prove she\u2019s corrupt, a criminal, a murderer, a warmonger etc\u201d.</p> <p>I\u2019ve received this propaganda too. Clinton\u2019s critics cite unstructured blog posts about petrodollars, blame her for the US mire in the Middle East, and post links to rough-edit YouTube videos proclaiming her ownership by the banks.</p> <p>The alpha-bro outfit WikiLeaks has fuelled some<strong> </strong>old-school conspiracy theories by tweeting sly suggestions that she\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.thetruthseeker.co.uk/?p=136983\">a puppet of the Rothschilds</a>. There are those who \u2013 unbelievably \u2013 insist she\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/election-us-2016-35422862\">\u201cjust as bad\u201d as Trump</a>.</p> <p> Such ardent behaviour is global, and unrestricted to those US citizens who can determine the election.

Since the primaries exposed this behaviour, vast communities have formed of women organising secret Facebook groups so they can praise, analyse and debate concerns about the Clinton candidacy without abuse. I\u2019m in two of them \u2013 an Australian and American one \u2013 there are thousands more, and various groups run into memberships of thousands.</p> <p>It\u2019s not just leftwing women, either. <a href=\"http://www.marieclaire.com/politics/a23149/the-secret-hillary-clinton-voters/\">An article in Marie Claire</a> observed the phenomenon of evangelical women in conservative communities secretly organising for Clinton as well. </p> <p>Why there\u2019s open hostility by certain men towards Clinton as well as how her female voting base is locked down in their support for her is simplistically <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com.au/entry/joe-biden-double-standard_us_58160212e4b064e1b4b3059b\">explained as an act of and response to sexism</a>. But there are more complex and nuanced elements here that apply to a broader western conversation about policy priorities.</p> <p>Problems of pay inequality, parental leave and access to affordable childcare exist across the western world because of the scarcity within political leadership of those who fight for women\u2019s causes beyond lip service and make actual legislative change. </p> <p>Fighting inequality in the US \u2013 and global \u2013 context has defined Clinton\u2019s political engagement for her entire career.

  "<p>\u201cJust because you\u2019re paranoid doesn\u2019t mean they aren\u2019t after you,\u201d wrote Joseph Heller in the novel Catch 22. But it is doubtful he envisaged that algorithms used by search engines, social media platforms and websites would be after you to \u2018personalise your experience\u2019. Consequently, perhaps, personalisation and privacy have taken a new direction with the shift to messaging as the go-to communication platform.</p> <p>Search and social media platforms derive their income from advertising, so it makes sense for them to tailor what users see. Facebook\u2019s presentation at the <a href=\"https://theaisummit.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">AI Summit</a> in San Francisco explained how artificial intelligence (AI) is used to personalise the pages of each of its 1.7 billion users. </p> <p>How accurate \u2013 or intrusive \u2013 this is will be determined by our online activity. Connected devices and location data add context; Google\u2019s DoubleClick (which develops internet ad serving systems) take this further by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/oct/21/how-to-disable-google-ad-tracking-gmail-youtube-browser-history\">combining personally identifiable information from Gmail</a> with browsing data.</p> <h2>Slaves to the algorithm</h2> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/16/slaves-to-algorithm-machine-learning-hidden-bias\">Machine learning: why we mustn\u2019t be slaves to the algorithm</a> </p> </aside>  <p>We have little or no control over the multiplicity of algorithms using our data, particularly as more devices become connected.

Tailoring content to user preferences potentially compromises online research. Search engines and ad networks are fingerprinting devices in real time, so it is impossible to know how neutral your search results are. And because search results are based on browsing history, we are less likely to see something new. Added to this is the platforms\u2019 own bias. The past few weeks have seen reports of Facebook\u2019s selective news curation and <a href=\"https://sputniknews.com/us/201609121045214398-google-clinton-manipulation-election/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Google\u2019s perceived political bias</a> towards Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential candidacy.</p> <p>Josh Sutton, global head of data and AI at Publicis Sapient, believes that transparency is the key as it enables people to make a well-informed judgement call. \u201cTrust is enabled by transparency\u201d he explains. \u201cThere has been an implicit bias in our communications since the invention of the printing press, and we accepted this because we could assess the people who were creating and curating content. I believe that a similar opportunity must be provided in the age of machine learning by enabling people to understand the sources of the algorithms and the training data that powers them.\u201d</p> <p>But we cannot blame the personalisation phenomenon entirely on algorithms. It is also a conscious choice. As social media has matured \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/2016/10/twitters-woes-signal-end-social-wars/?mbid=nl_101116_p2&amp;CNDID=43693487\" rel=\"nofollow\">and perhaps peaked</a> \u2013 we have become adept at blocking what we don\u2019t want to see \u2013 or don\u2019t agree with. Elections and referendums have seen social media users divide into tribes rather than engage in political debate.</p> <h2>A new kind of privacy</h2> <p>While voice is the obvious interface for human-machine conversation, with chatbots on many websites and virtual assistants on multiple devices \u2013 human-to-human conversation has shifted to messaging platforms. Snapchat, WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger etc allow us to have rapid, private interactions with selected parties. </p> <p>This is a new kind of privacy because we don\u2019t know the extent to which the platform can read or understand our messages. WhatsApp, a secure messaging system with end-to-end encryption, still includes in its terms the option of sharing our account information with Facebook to improve ads and product experiences.</p> <p>In 2015 mobile messaging platforms <a href=\"http://uk.businessinsider.com/messaging-apps-have-completely-overtaken-social-networks-to-become-the-dominant-platforms-on-phones-2015-4\" rel=\"nofollow\">overtook</a> social networking platforms in terms of monthly active users (MAU). This has not been lost on investors \u2013 or advertisers. eMarketer forecasts that Snapchat will generate $367m (\u00a3300m) in advertising revenue this year, <a href=\"https://www.emarketer.com/Article/Snapchat-Ad-Revenues-Reach-Nearly-1-Billion-Next-Year/1014437\" rel=\"nofollow\">rising 155% to $936m</a> in 2017.</p> <p>A large part of the appeal of messaging is that it\u2019s \u201cfriction free\u201d \u2013 WhatsApp\u2019s brand promise is \u201cno ads, no games and no gimmicks\u201d. So how do brands join the conversation?</p> <p>\u201cThe responsibility of brands is changing,\u201d says Sutton. \u201cHistorically, the goal of advertising was to make people aware of a product and its merits. Today that is shifting to providing people with hyper-personalised information about products that might be useful to them at a specific time.\u201d</p> <h2>Brands join the conversation</h2> <p>The <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT206906\" rel=\"nofollow\">iMessage App Store</a> is a case in point, offering apps and extensions which perform actions within a conversation.</p> <p>Jason Alan Snyder, CTO at Momentum Worldwide, underlines the experiential nature of bringing brands to messaging. \u201cMachine intelligence makes conversational commerce possible even in a \u2018private\u2019 conversation,\u201d he says. \u201cIt is all about timing, so it makes sense to use data around location, weather and sentiment to determine the right opportunity to engage.\u201d Crucially, personalisation must be subtle and appropriate. \u201cFor example, it is not awkward to use an iMessage app to call an Uber or book a restaurant within the context of a conversation.\u201d And messages increasingly include emojis and stickers, which represent a massive opportunity for brands.</p> <p>\u201cMessaging is peer to peer,\u201d observes Vivian Rosenthal, founder of Snaps, which creates chatbots, emojis, GIFs and stickers for brands. \u201cThere\u2019s an immediacy that just isn\u2019t there in social.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media-network/2016/aug/10/artificial-intelligence-the-new-creative-mind\">What does artificial intelligence mean for the creative mind?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It\u2019s all about opting in. \u201cTraditional pop-ups and banner ads are annoying,\u201d she adds. \u201cThey get in the way of something else you want to do.

  "<p><strong><em><br></em></strong>A key confidante of Donald Trump has provided new details about the \u201cmutual friend\u201d of Julian Assange who served as a back channel to give him broad tips in advance about WikiLeaks\u2019 releases of emails to and from key allies of Hillary Clinton.</p> <p>Roger Stone, a longtime unofficial adviser to the Republican presidential nominee, was briefed in general terms in advance about the sensitive and embarrassing leaked Democratic emails by an American libertarian who works in the media on the \u201copinion side\u201d, he told the Guardian in an interview. </p> <p>Stone claims his American source, whom he declined to identify, has met with Assange, the WikiLeaks founder, in London and is a \u201cmutual friend\u201d of Stone and Assange. The WikiLeaks source, Stone said, is not tied in any way to the Trump campaign but has served as a back channel for Stone, who is an outside adviser to the Republican presidential candidate, allowing the adviser to tweet and comment very broadly prior to some key WikiLeaks disclosures.</p> <p>A source close to Trump Tower also told the Guardian that Stone once boasted to him of meeting with Assange himself and told the source, who is active in GOP political circles, that WikiLeaks would be \u201ccoming down like a ton of bricks\u201d on Clinton. Stone adamantly denied meeting with Assange (\u201cYour source is bullshitting u\u201d he wrote in an email) or having any direct contact with Assange or anyone with WikiLeaks.</p> <p>Despite Stone\u2019s advance tweets and comments about some major WikiLeaks disclosures \u2013 including recent ones in October relating to Clinton campaign chair John Podesta and the Clinton Foundation \u2013 the self-styled \u201crabble rouser\u201d and onetime Watergate dirty tricks operative<strong> </strong>said the FBI had not contacted him in its investigation into the illegal computer hacking of private Democratic emails, and he was not worried.</p> <p>\u201cThere is nothing to investigate,\u201d Stone said. The Obama administration has <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/08/us/politics/us-formally-accuses-russia-of-stealing-dnc-emails.html\">accused Russia</a> of being the source of the hack.</p> <p>But Stone\u2019s tweets and comments about forthcoming WikiLeaks releases have put him in the media spotlight and is just one of the controversial ways he has played a role as an outside Trump booster and adviser, after a several-month stint last year as a key campaign insider.</p> <p>In August, well before WikiLeaks released Podesta\u2019s emails, Stone <a href=\"https://twitter.com/rogerjstonejr/status/767366825743097856\">tweeted</a>: \u201cTrust me, it will soon [be] Podesta\u2019s time in the barrel.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/RogerJStoneJr/status/767366825743097856\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Trust me, it will soon the Podesta&#39;s time in the barrel. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/CrookedHillary?src=hash\">#CrookedHillary</a></p>&mdash; Roger Stone (@RogerJStoneJr) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RogerJStoneJr/status/767366825743097856\">August 21, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>After <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/11/clinton-campaign-wikileaks-hack-russia-donald-trump\">thousands of Podesta\u2019s emails were published last month</a>, Podesta told reporters: \u201cIt\u2019s a reasonable conclusion that Mr Stone had advanced warning and the Trump campaign had advanced warning about what Assange was going to do.\u201d</p> <p>In response to Podesta\u2019s comments, Stone told the conservative Daily Caller: \u201cI\u2019ve admitted I\u2019ve been in communication with Assange through an intermediary,\u201d adding: \u201cThey don\u2019t tell me what they\u2019re going to release.\u201d</p> <p>Likewise in August, Stone told a Florida audience: \u201cI actually have communicated with Assange.

  "<h2><strong>What is going on in South Korea?</strong></h2> <p>South Korea\u2019s president, Park Geun-hye is confronting the most damaging political crisis of her four-year presidency. At the centre of the growing scandal is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/02/new-south-korea-pm-appointed-as-cronyism-scandal-widens\">Park\u2019s relationship with Choi Soon-sil</a>, a close friend of 40 years who is being investigated on suspicion of exerting undue influence on the 64-year-old president. </p> <p>Choi, who befriended Park after the president\u2019s father, Park Chung-hee, was assassinated in 1979, has also been accused of using their friendship for personal financial gain. Money scandals involving relatives of South Korean leaders are nothing new, but many are struggling to understand how Park has benefited from bringing Choi, to whom she is not related, into the heart of state affairs, from checking advance copies of speeches to selecting her wardrobe for public appearances. </p> <p>According to some media reports, Choi also acts as Park\u2019s close spiritual adviser.</p> <h2><strong>Is the president\u2019s job safe?</strong></h2> <p>Yes \u2026 for now. South Korean presidents can serve only one five-year term, and it is now unlikely that Park has the political capital she needs to go through with plans to allow the country\u2019s leaders to serve a second term. </p> <p>With a little over a year left in the presidential Blue House, one likely scenario is that she will be allowed to limp on until a new leader is elected towards the end of 2017. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/30/south-korea-rasputin-like-friend-president-park-geun-hye-returns\">'Rasputin-like' friend of South Korean president returns amid protests</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Despite widespread anger over her conduct \u2013 which last week elicited a brief apology that many have criticised as woefully insufficient \u2013 Park has not indicated she is ready to resign, and calls for what could be a lengthy and damaging impeachment have so far failed to resonate. </p> <p>But there is little doubt that Park\u2019s presidency has been irrevocably damaged by revelations about her ties to Choi, who after hiding out in Germany is now <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/01/choi-soon-sil-arrested-made-in-south-korean-presidential-cronyism-scandal\">in \u201cemergency detention\u201d in Seoul</a> facing questions over alleged influence peddling and fraud.</p> <h2><strong>Who is the woman at the centre of the scandal?</strong></h2> <p>Until recently, the 60-year-old Choi largely operated under the media radar as Park\u2019s adviser and, according to some media, as her spiritual guru. Those revelations alone would not have invited the opprobrium heaped on Choi and Park had it not been for Choi\u2019s apparent influence on economic, foreign and defence policy \u2013 and allegations she used her position to pocket some of the $70m she solicited from major South Korean companies for two foundations she had set up.</p> <p>Choi was first seen in public with Park in the late \u201970s after the assassinations of the latter\u2019s father. Park has described Choi as a source of comfort during difficult times in her life, but denies granting her the sort of influence that would be unprecedented for a private citizen who has never held public office and does not have security clearance.</p> <p>Choi is the daughter of Choi Tae-min, a self-styled Christian pastor who founded a religious cult called the Church of Eternal Life that is now led by his daughter. The older Choi, who died in 1994, befriended Park after her mother\u2019s death at the hands of a pro-North Korean spy in 1974. He reportedly told the young, grieving Park that her mother had appeared to him in a dream and asked him for help. </p> <h2><strong>What has the public reaction been?</strong></h2> <p>The response from South Korean voters has been brutal. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/29/south-korea-president-orders-10-staff-members-to-resign-amid-worsening-crisis\">Thousand of protesters took to the streets</a> of Seoul and other cities at the weekend to demand her resignation. Having exploited her father\u2019s role in developing the South Korean economy \u2013 and deflecting criticism of his human rights abuses \u2013 Park came to power promising better ties with North Korea and progress for the country\u2019s economy. Four years later, she has failed to deliver on both policy commitments, leaving her with little political room for manoeuvre as she attempts to contain the scandal. Park\u2019s approval ratings have plummeted to about 10% \u2013 by far the worst since her inauguration in February 2013.</p> <h2><strong>Where could this go?</strong></h2> <p>Park has attempted to defuse the crisis with a root-and-branch <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/02/new-south-korea-pm-appointed-as-cronyism-scandal-widens\">reorganisation of her embattled administration</a>. Last week she told 10 of her senior secretaries to resign; on Wednesday, she moved again to divert attention from the scandal by appointing a new prime minister and finance minister. </p> <p>The measures failed to have much impact, however, with opposition parties accusing her of shuffling senior staff in a desperate attempt to save her presidency. It isn\u2019t clear how much influence the new prime minister, Kim Byong-joon, will have over policy. The Chosun Ilbo, South Korea\u2019s biggest newspaper, last week urged Park to appoint a caretaker premier and in effect end her involvement in governing the country.</p> <h2><strong>Does it have implications outside South Korea?</strong></h2> <p>Early coverage of the scandal was mostly confined to the domestic media, but the lurid details of Choi\u2019s relationship with Park have caught the attention of the international media in recent days. </p> <p>The scandal has caused only minor ripples on the stock and currency markets, but it he will be causing concern in the US and Japan as they seek to put on a united front over North Korea\u2019s nuclear weapons programme. </p> <p>Amid such low expectations for the rest of Park\u2019s term, it would probably take a dramatic development in inter-Korean relations to gauge just how much Choi-gate has compromised her ability to govern. If Park does survive until the next election, the UN general secretary, Ban Ki-moon, is among those being tipped to succeed her.<br><br></p>",

And later that year, a protest by the FPI turned <a href=\"http://www.straitstimes.com/asia/se-asia/indonesia-radicals-in-violent-protest-against-new-jakarta-governor\">violent</a> leaving several police officer injured.</p> <p>On Friday, demonstrators will attend prayers at Istiqlal Mosque and then march to the presidential palace, where armoured personnel carriers have been stationed and the police and military will be deployed.</p> <p>\u201cI appeal to everyone to stay calm.

The Indonesian military will provide a further 500 troops.</p> <p>The rally is the second large demonstration against Ahok in a month. On 14 October, thousands took park in a generally peaceful event outside city hall.</p> <p>As the world\u2019s largest Muslim-majority nation, Indonesians largely practice a moderate form of Islam. While the FPI is a relatively small group, the country\u2019s largest Islamic organisation, Nahdlatul Ulama, has told its 40 million members not to support the protests.</p> <p>But equally, Indonesia\u2019s Ulama Council, the country\u2019s top Muslim clerical body, agreed that Ahok had committed blasphemy and should be prosecuted. It said a non-Muslim should not become a leader of Muslims.</p> <p>The southeast Asian nation has a history of sporadic and isolated violence against Christian as well as its large ethnic Chinese minority, many of whom are Buddhists.</p> <p>International militant jihadists, some with influence and members in Indonesia, are looking to capitalise on the anti-Ahok sentiment.</p> <p>Last month, al Qaida\u2019s branch in Syria, Jabhat Fatah al-Sham, said that Indonesia should sentence Ahok or it would \u201csentence him with bullets\u2019. And ISIS supporters have sent messages to their supporters asking them to use the rally \u2018to fan the flames of jihad\u2019.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s clear that everyone is worried about violence, and huge numbers of police and soldiers have been called up for duty,\u201d said Sidney Jones, the director of the Institute for Policy Analysis of Conflict.<br></p> <p>The governor is looking toward a February election and looks likely to win. He is politically close with president Widodo, who also served as Jakarta governor for 18 months before rising to the country\u2019s highest office and handing over to Ahok.</p> <p>But Jones said that supporters of Anies Baswedan, a former minister of education who is second behind Ahok in the gubernatorial race, are exploiting the potentially explosive upheaval to damage him politically.</p> <p>\u201cThe problem is that there are too many interests involved here: Ahok\u2019s rivals would like to decrease his likelihood of winning; hardline civil society groups want to show that they control the streets; pro-shariah groups want to show massive support for Islamic law; the tiny jihadi groups are urging their members to show their courage by attacking police.\u201d</p>",

The bad news? This series is heading back to Progressive Field and the Cubs have zero margin of error, one loss to the Indians and this series is over.</p> <p>It should be a great pitching matchup today, with the Cubs starting last year\u2019s Cy Young winner Jake Arrieta (18-18, 3:10) against Josh Tomlin (13-9, 4.40), who has allowed just 4 runs in 3 postseason games. <br></p> <p>This might be the most important game in Cubs history since 1945, although that distinction would change should they force a Game 7. Heck it might also be the most important Indians game since 1958.</p> <p>I know I keep on saying this every liveblog, but we strongly encourage everyone to share their thoughts, questions, jokes and any-and-all vaguely baseball-related things to us, either via email (to <a href=\"mailto:Hunter.Felt@theguardian\">Hunter.Felt@theguardian</a>) or by Twitter (to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/HunterFelt\">@HunterFelt</a>). We\u2019ll be sharing them in this liveblog throughout the game.</p> <p> Okay, enough chatter, it\u2019s the Chicago Cubs vs. the Cleveland Indians at Progressive Field for Game 6 of the World Series.

According to the ABC/Washington Post tracking <a href=\"http://www.langerresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/1184a102016ElectionTrackingNo10.pdf\">poll</a> published on Tuesday (conducted October 27-30), the Democratic candidate has now slipped behind Donald Trump, on 45% to her Republican opponent\u2019s 46%. The polling <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/us/general_election_trump_vs_clinton-5491.html\">average</a> calculated by RealClearPolitics, a much better indication of national sentiment, shows Clinton is now leading by just 2 percentage points, down from 5 percentage points a week ago.</p> <p>Those numbers are interesting but not necessarily indicative \u2013 polling won\u2019t neatly translate to votes. Far more important will be the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2016/oct/29/voter-turnout-us-election-2016-register\">turnout</a> - especially since the two leading presidential candidates are so <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/31/polls-donald-trump-hillary-clinton-unpopularity\">close in terms of unpopularity</a>. And the candidates know it. A senior adviser to Donald Trump reportedly <a href=\"http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/presidential-races/303034-trump-aide-we-have-three-major-voter-suppression\">revealed</a> last week that \u201cwe have three major voter suppression operations under way\u201d intended to reduce votes for Clinton among African Americans, white liberals and young women.<br></p> <p>Even though election day is still a week away, we already have some clues about whether turnout is lower among those groups \u2013 because more than <a href=\"http://www.electproject.org/early_2016\">25m</a> ballots have already been cast under the US early voting system. Approximately 125 million to 145 million Americans are <a href=\"https://www.predictit.org/Market/2188/What-will-be-2016-voter-turnout-for-the-presidential-election\">predicted</a> to vote in the 2016 election, so those early votes represent a significant share of the expected total.</p> <h2><strong>Higher turnout than at this time in 2012</strong></h2> <p>Of the 15 states that provide detailed information about those ballots, North Carolina, California and nine other states report <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/10/31/us/elections/earlyvoters.html?_r=0\">more</a> early voters than at the same point in the 2012 election. Ohio, Nevada, Colorado and Iowa showed a decline in early voting, and those declines were small.</p> <h2><strong>Early signs of declining turnout from black voters and young voters</strong></h2> <p>The early results offer mixed news for Clinton. Early votes suggest that young voters \u2013 who are much <a href=\"http://www.people-press.org/2015/04/07/a-deep-dive-into-party-affiliation/\">more likely</a> than older voters to lean Democratic \u2013 might be staying at home. In 12 states, fewer Americans aged 18 to 29 have cast a ballot so far in this election compared with this point in 2012. This could be especially problematic for Clinton if this group is indicative of a broader \u201c<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/1031867576877207/\">Bernie or bust</a>\u201d sentiment in which supporters of the former Democratic candidate Bernie Sanders choose to stay at home rather than voting for Clinton.<br></p> <p>Young voters aren\u2019t the only demographic group that appears put off. Early votes suggest that black turnout has fallen in eight states \u2013 especially in North Carolina, a state that yields <a href=\"https://www.archives.gov/federal-register/electoral-college/allocation.html\">15 of the 270</a> electoral college votes needed to win the election and where polling suggests Clinton is in a <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/nc/north_carolina_trump_vs_clinton-5538.html\">close contest</a>. If Trump\u2019s strategy is indeed to suppress the black vote, that makes a lot of sense \u2013 those voters could be crucial for Clinton to secure the White House.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/01/clinton-trump-polls-election-voter-turnout-suppression\">Election polls tighten \u2013 but turnout is the real key to Clinton v Trump</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58192559e4b07ceadb3a169c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-01T23:31:01.602Z\">11.31pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Speaking in Eau Claire, Wisconsin, Donald Trump predicted \u201can unprecedented constitutional crisis\u201d if Hillary Clinton were to be elected president.</p> <p>\u201cThe work of government would come to an unbelievably unglorious halt,\u201d Trump said, and \u201cshe is likely to be investigated for years, likely to be concluded with a very large-scale criminal trial.\u201d</p> <p>The audience chanted \u201cLock her up!\u201d in response.</p> <p>\u201cThis is a message for any Democratic voter who have already cast their ballot for Hillary Clinton and have a severe case of buyer\u2019s remorse,\u201d Trump said, referring to a few states - Wisconsin included - where early ballots can be reversed before election day. \u201cA lot of stuff has come out since you\u2019ve voted.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou can change your vote to Donald Trump - we\u2019ll make America great again, okay?

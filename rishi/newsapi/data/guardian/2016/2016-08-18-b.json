This morning they have changed their forecast to 348-190 for Clinton, sensing a Democratic drift in the second congressional district in Nebraska, which is one of two states that splits its electoral votes. Do they know what they\u2019re talking about? <a href=\"http://www.centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/articles/clinton-rises-to-348-electoral-votes-trump-drops-to-190/\">You be the judge</a>. Here\u2019s a bit from their analysis:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We are putting Clinton over the 270-mark in the Electoral College (273 electoral votes, to be precise) with states we have classified as Likely Democratic or Safe Democratic. Clinton had previously been at 269 in those categories. To us, this means that Trump has to find a way not just to sweep all Republican states and the remaining states classified Leans Democratic (see our map, below) but to dislodge at least one Likely or Safe Democratic state. Anything can happen over the next dozen weeks, but we wouldn\u2019t recommend betting your children\u2019s college funds on a Trump administration.</p> </blockquote> <p>The Sabato map does not detect any tossup states. That judgment is not unique among pros. The map almost exactly resembles FiveThirtyEight\u2019s <a href=\"http://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2016-election-forecast/?ex_cid=rrpromo#plus\">polls-plus model</a>, which bakes in polling numbers with other fundamentals such as economic stats and historical data.</p> <p>Here\u2019s a basic version of the map (but visit <a href=\"http://www.centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/articles/clinton-rises-to-348-electoral-votes-trump-drops-to-190/\">Sabato\u2019s site</a> for subtleties and analysis):</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"270\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.270towin.com/maps/Eb4Km&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.270towin.com/presidential_map_new/maps/Eb4Km.png&quot; width=&quot;460&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;vertical-align: middle;&quot; src=&quot;http://www.270towin.com/uploads/3rd_party_270_30px.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt; Click the map to create your own at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.270towin.com/maps/Eb4Km&quot;&gt;270toWin.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>If you like electoral college maps but haven\u2019t discovered <a href=\"http://www.270towin.com/\">270towin.com</a> yet, <a href=\"http://www.270towin.com/\">visit them</a>, it\u2019s fun.</p> <p>Update: also <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/paloma/daily-202/2016/08/18/daily-202-why-florida-is-trump-s-best-swing-state/57b50086cd249a2fe363ba26/?postshare=8261471524775146&amp;tid=ss_tw\">read James Hohman in the Washington Post</a> on why Florida is MR BREXIT!\u2019s \u201cbest swing state\u201d:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><strong>Florida is the only battleground that moved in Trump\u2019s direction after both conventions. </strong><a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2016-election/polls-clinton-running-table-key-battlegrounds-n629136\">Seven states</a> were surveyed by <a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/first-read/polls-clinton-ahead-trump-midwest-battlegrounds-n626541\">NBC, the Wall Street Journal and Marist</a> before and after.

By Thursday afternoon, it had garnered more than 7,300 likes and nearly 3,300 comments.

  "<p>Green party presidential candidate Jill Stein has sought to quash a \u201cridiculous\u201d perception that she is anti-vaccines, during a televised town hall meeting where she denounced both Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton.<br></p> <p>Stein, a Massachusetts physician, has recently been plagued by accusations that she rejects the mainstream scientific view that vaccines are fundamentally safe. She has <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2016/07/29/jill-stein-on-vaccines-people-have-real-questions/\">said</a> that there are \u201creal questions\u201d about corporate influence over vaccines and that there is \u201c<a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4ixbr5/i_am_jill_stein_green_party_candidate_for/d31ydoe\">widespread distrust of the medical-industrial complex</a>\u201d.</p> <p>But in a CNN town hall event on Wednesday, Stein said her statements have been taking out of context and that previous concerns over mercury in vaccines have now been resolved.</p> <p>\u201cI think there\u2019s kind of an effort to divert the conversation from our actual agenda, because the idea that I oppose vaccines is completely ridiculous, or that I\u2019m anti-science,\u201d Stein said.</p> <p>\u201cI am certainly not hostile to science. I\u2019m not anti-science. I believe that asking questions is part of our responsibility as scientists. And as physicians, we always need to be asking those questions.\u201d</p> <p>Stein spent much of the televised question-and-answer session lambasting Trump and in particular Clinton, stating that she will \u201chave trouble sleeping at night\u201d if either the Republican or Democratic candidate is elected.</p> <p>\u201cAs despicable as Donald Trump\u2019s words are, I find Hillary Clinton\u2019s actions and track record is very troubling,\u201d she said. \u201cSo Donald Trump, you know, bashes immigrants and is a xenophobic and racist loudmouth, but Hillary Clinton, you know, has been promoting these wars that have killed a million black and brown people in Iraq, for example.</p> <p>\u201cThe Democratic Party has become the party of deportation and detentions and night raids with, you know, millions of people deported under Barack Obama.\u201d</p> <p>Stein said Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server while secretary of state violated rules \u201cwith a sense of impunity\u201d, and she accused the Democratic candidate of organizing a \u201csmear\u201d against erstwhile opponent Bernie Sanders.</p> <p>\u201cBernie did everything right, and his supporters did everything right, but the playing field was really steeply and unfairly tilted against you,\u201d said Stein, who has actively courted Sanders supporters and the man himself, even <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/08/jill-stein-bernie-sanders-green-party\">offering to stand aside</a> as the Green party candidate in favor of him. </p> <p>\u201cMany people have looked to us from Bernie\u2019s campaign as Plan B, so that if they ran into trouble, they could continue building this revolutionary campaign, but now all the stronger for being inside of a revolutionary party that supports the work that you\u2019re doing and will continue to build it until we prevail.\u201d</p> <p>Stein said her campaign is largely aimed at 43 million young people who would benefit from her policy of abolishing student debt through the Federal Reserve. The Green party candidate also wants the US to transition to 100% renewable energy by 2030, introduce a single-payer public health insurance program, establish a $15-an-hour federal minimum wage and slash military spending by \u201cat least\u201d 50%.</p> <p>Stein said her running mate, activist Ajamu Baraka, is an \u201cinspirational and passionate advocate for justice and for human rights\u201d. But Baraka, who also appeared at the town hall, was questioned over his previous description of Barack Obama as an \u201cuncle Tom\u201d.</p> <p>Baraka said he used the term to \u201csort of shock people into a more critical look at this individual. And that\u2019s how I did it. And I stand by that, even though it sounds very inflammatory, and provocative, and probably very strange to this massive audience here tonight.\u201d</p> <p>Baraka also warned that \u201cwe\u2019re going to have to deal with Donald Trump even after the election, win or lose, because he is appealing to a social base that is prepared to continue to embrace some of the darker side of humanity\u201d. </p> <p>\u201cHis appeal to folks who embrace xenophobia, racism, his bigotry around religion, the unfortunate reality is that it has resonated with some elements of the society,\u201d Baraka said.</p> <p>Stein\u2019s initial goal is to break through 15% in opinion polling in order to take the stage with Trump and Clinton during the presidential debates. This appears to be an optimistic target, however, given that recent polling puts the Green party candidate <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/us/general_election_trump_vs_clinton_vs_johnson_vs_stein-5952.html\">under 5%</a>. </p> <p>A new Public Policy Polling survey of Texas voters found that Stein<a href=\"http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/291759-poll-jill-stein-tied-with-harambe-trailing-deez-nutz-in-texas\"> is tied</a> with Harambe, a western lowland gorilla shot and killed at Cincinnati zoo in May, at 2%.</p>",
  "<p>Russia will hold its first nationwide elections in more than four years next month, but political analysts are paying more attention to a series of curious changes in Vladimir Putin\u2019s inner circle than they are to the campaigning. While the elections are seen as a foregone conclusion that will decide little, tremors inside the Kremlin could be much more significant.</p> <p>Last week, one of the president\u2019s oldest allies, his chief of staff Sergei Ivanov, was replaced with his deputy Anton Vaino, who has a reputation as an able technocrat but has little political heft. Ivanov, who like Putin was a KGB agent \u2013 and was once spoken of as a potential successor \u2013 was given what appears to be a humiliating demotion to the transport and environment brief.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/10/vladimir-putin-may-believe-time-is-ripe-for-another-invasion\">Vladimir Putin may believe time is ripe for another invasion</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Ivanov was just the latest of Putin\u2019s old friends to be shuffled aside.

First, it\u2019s clear that Trump is an ardent supporter of the leave campaign \u2013 or at least, he became one when he finally found out what it was.</p> <p>When Trump was asked by journalist Michael Wolff for a <a href=\"http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/features/donald-trump-conversation-politics-dark-898465\">Hollywood Reporter</a> interview published in June what he thought about Brexit, he was flummoxed:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cAnd Brexit? Your position?\u201d I ask.</p> <p>\u201cHuh?\u201d replied Trump.</p> <p>\u201cBrexit.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHmm.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe Brits leaving the EU,\u201d I prompt, realizing that his lack of familiarity with one of the most pressing issues in Europe is for him no concern nor liability at all.</p> <p>\u201cOh yeah, I think they should leave.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>The UK vote \u2013 inspired, in part, by fears of immigration and anger with the way the economy has been gamed by a global elite \u2013 has clear echoes of the billionaire property tycoon\u2019s own platform. Immigration \u201chas been <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/blogs/2016-gop-primary-live-updates-and-results/2016/05/donald-trump-brexit-222874#ixzz4HhECYHSg\">a horrible thing</a>\u201d for Britain, he told Fox News. \u201cA lot of that was pushed by the EU,\u201d he said.</p> <p>And after the vote, on his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/24/donald-trump-hails-eu-referendum-result-as-he-arrives-in-uk\">trip to Scotland</a> to promote his golf course, Trump called the vote \u201ca great victory,\u201d attributing the Brexit vote to immigration and opposition to the \u201cglobal elite\u201d before boarding his gilded private jet to return to the US campaign trail.</p> <p>But why go back to Brexit now? Assuming Trump reads more than his own press cuttings, he may have spotted some news that suggests Brexit has not, as yet, been as catastrophic to the UK economy as first feared.</p> <p>Yesterday, the US Federal Reserve issued the minutes of its latest meeting and mentioned <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/17/federal-reserve-interest-rates-brexit\">Brexit 20 times</a>. However, for all its concern the Fed concluded that Brexit had had little impact on the US and global economy. And in the UK, public <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/17/public-confidence-in-uk-economy-recovers-after-brexit-vote-survey-finds\">confidence has rebounded</a> after the Brexit vote, with consumers shrugging off fears of imminent doom.</p> <p>Of course, the consequences of Brexit (or a Trump victory) will play out over years, not weeks. All of Britain\u2019s trade agreements with the EU must now be renegotiated. Top companies including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/28/ford-considers-closing-factories-raising-prices-europe-brexit\">Ford</a> and Goldman Sachs have warned they may cut back or leave the UK following the vote.</p> <p>Back in the US, Trump\u2019s economic policies are under attack and he has been forced to reshuffle his election team in the face of withering polls. But just for a moment this morning, maybe, Trump thought he\u2019d backed a winner. And like the Brexit, he\u2019ll surprise us all come November.</p> <p>Go ahead, call him MR BREXIT.<br></p>",
  "<p>On a quiet, tree-lined street in this town with a population of just over 1,000, a lone yard sign bearing the name of Bernie Sanders serves as a faint reminder of the Vermont senator\u2019s grassroots movement.<br></p> <p>It is the home of Missey Bower, a special education professional, who cast her vote for Sanders in the Pennsylvania Democratic primary and helped the senator carry the working-class Wyoming County in which her modest, one-storey home sits across from a public library.</p> <p>But it was Hillary Clinton who claimed victory in the state and ultimately the contest for the Democratic party\u2019s presidential nomination. And Bower is precisely the kind of voter Clinton must still persuade in her favor with 81 days remaining until election day.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/17/zephyr-teachout-bernie-sanders-woodstock-us-election\">Zephyr Teachout aims to keep Bernie Sanders\u2019 vision alive in Woodstock</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Hours after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/15/joe-biden-hillary-clinton-campaigns-rebukes-donald-trump\">the former secretary of state rallied with Joe Biden in neighboring Scranton</a>, the vice-president\u2019s hometown where Clinton also has roots, Bower said she is watching closely as the Democratic nominee campaigns on a progressive agenda while simultaneously making direct overtures to the Republicans and center-right independents who cannot fathom voting for Donald Trump.</p> <p>Her concern, like many Sanders supporters, is whether his radical platform taking on Wall Street and corporate interests, and offering free college tuition, will be discarded as she courts Republicans.</p> <p>Bower is \u201cterrified\u201d of a Trump presidency but voiced concerns with Clinton\u2019s balancing act.</p> <p>\u201cI think she\u2019s saying what she needs to say to pull people from Trump, which is a good thing,\u201d she said, \u201cbut I don\u2019t know when she\u2019s being sincere and when she\u2019s just doing what she needs to in order to get elected.</p> <p>\u201cI just feel like she\u2019s been in the system for so long, how could she not be part of the system?\u201d</p> <p>Her campaign has trumpeted endorsements from prominent Republicans, including national security officials and prolific donors. Appearing on behalf of his wife last week, Bill Clinton fielded a question on how she could be trusted by citing her support from former aides to George W Bush and Ronald Reagan.</p> <p>The rationale is clear: given Trump\u2019s erratic behavior and history of offensive rhetoric toward minorities and women, the election is much broader than a choice of policies. As framed by Clinton\u2019s campaign, it is a battle for the principles upon which America was founded, in which the question facing voters is whether they would hand the Oval Office to a candidate deemed by members of his own party as fundamentally unfit to lead the nation.</p> <p>It was precisely this message that Biden and Clinton brought with them to a sports facility in Scranton this week, with the vice-president telling more than 3,000 supporters Trump was \u201ctotally, thoroughly unqualified\u201d to assume the role of commander-in-chief.</p> <p>Down the road, at a local coffee shop often frequented by Sanders supporters, a pair of young voters debated whether the anti-Trump missive was enough for them to cast their ballots for Clinton.</p> <p>\u201cOne of my issues is she tries to appeal to both left and right at the same time, and that\u2019s difficult because it\u2019s so polarized right now,\u201d said Anna Salerno, a 20-year-old native of Scranton who attends college in New York.</p> <p>Seated across from her was Willie Demyan, a 21-year-old college graduate who characterized Clinton as embracing \u201cmore of a political strategy\u201d that left him questioning whether she was committed to a liberal platform.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I liked about Bernie, he might seem monotonous,\u201d he said, before Salerno completed the sentence for him: \u201cBut you knew he wasn\u2019t going to waver on it.\u201d</p> <p>Salerno nonetheless said she planned to vote for Clinton to shut Trump out of the White House, while Demyan had yet to be convinced.</p> <p>While laying out her agenda at the Democratic national convention in Philadelphia last month, Clinton vowed to champion many of the issues injected into the race by Sanders and his progressive base of supporters.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/aug/17/hillary-clinton-donald-trump-campaign-shakeup-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/5v8z9\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2663694\"            data-video-name=\"Clinton: Trump's campaign shakeup won't change who he is \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"Reuters\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57b4ba41e4b0178756b5da27\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/08/17/160817clinton_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/08/17/160817clinton.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/08/17/160817clinton_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/aug/17/hillary-clinton-donald-trump-campaign-shakeup-video\">Clinton: Trump\u2019s campaign shakeup won\u2019t change who he is</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>From campaign finance reform and raising the minimum wage to providing debt-free college and regulating Wall Street, the blueprint she provided while accepting the Democratic party\u2019s nomination \u2013 and has carried with her to the stump \u2013 remains very much in line with promises made while tacking left in the primary.</p> <p>If there is any movement toward the center, it appears to be less in substance than it is in tone. Trump, put simply by Clinton, is a threat to American democracy.</p> <p>The argument is resonating, with Clinton opening up a double-digit lead in several key battleground states in recent weeks. In Pennsylvania, one new poll found her holding a 10-point advantage over Trump \u2013 undercutting the real estate mogul\u2019s efforts to seek out a pathway to the presidency in America\u2019s blue-collar rust belt.</p> <p>Clinton nonetheless implored Democrats at a voter registration event in west Philadelphia on Tuesday not to underestimate the stakes ahead.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t be complacent, my friends,\u201d she warned. </p> <p>\u201cEven though we\u2019re doing fine right now, I\u2019m not taking anybody, anywhere, for granted.\u201d</p> <p>Bowers, standing on her porch just in front of her Sanders yard sign, said she was monitoring the polls while weighing her own indecision. </p> <p>\u201cDonald Trump is taking us so far back.

The 21-year-old, who voted for Sanders in the Pennsylvania primary, said friends had accused him of selling out when they learned he was now supporting Clinton.</p> <p>\u201cI told them there is no other candidate,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the other party, there\u2019s fear mongering, there\u2019s hatred.</p> <p>\u201cThere is no alternative.

  "<p>Over the years, Iran has sometimes played a disproportionately large part in US politics. Jimmy Carter blamed the 1979-81 embassy hostage crisis for his failure to secure a second term, and Reagan\u2019s second term was damaged significantly by the Iran-Contra revelations. </p> <p>The deal secured by the Obama administration with Iran over the nuclear question in July 2015 has proved violently divisive between Democrats and Republicans. So it was no surprise that Iran surfaced again in the debate between the presidential candidates on 26 September. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Iranians have not forgotten Clinton's 2008 statement that America could \u201ctotally obliterate\u201d Iran</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Hillary Clinton attacked Donald Trump\u2019s maverick tendency by referring to his apparent willingness to open fire on Iranian gunboats in the Persian Gulf if they threw insults at US sailors. Trump hit back at Clinton for going along with Obama\u2019s Iran policy, complaining \u201cwe lose on everything\u201d \u2013 referring back to his theme of a US diminished by Obama\u2019s presidency. The exchange thus summed up what each candidate saw as one of the other\u2019s main weak points.</p> <p>President Rouhani of Iran can scarcely be enthusiastic about the prospects for the US presidential election. Trump has said directly that the 2015 nuclear deal was \u201cdisastrous\u201d and he would repudiate it, doubling and tripling sanctions (quite how, he doesn\u2019t specify) to force the Iranians to renegotiate. Clinton has supported the nuclear deal and is more likely to follow in Obama\u2019s footsteps, but she has consistently been more hawkish on Iran than Obama. She was enthusiastic in the drive to harden sanctions on Iran in the latter part of Obama\u2019s first term, and Iranians have not forgotten her statement during the presidential nomination contest in 2008 that the US could \u201ctotally obliterate\u201d Iran if it were to attack Israel with a nuclear weapon \u2013 widely reported at the time as \u201cClinton wants to obliterate Iran\u201d.</p> <p>Rouhani himself is engaged in an election campaign (the election will take place in May 2017) and, though still popular, is under increasing pressure because economic benefits from the nuclear deal have yet to reach ordinary Iranians. Iran\u2019s supreme leader, Ali Khamenei, has suggested that the US has failed to honour its commitment to lift sanctions. It is an unwritten rule of Iranian politics that Iranian presidents always get a second term, but Rouhani cannot be complacent. He has to appease hardliners, which is why he avoided meeting Obama at the UN general assembly earlier in September. Since the nuclear deal, Iran has drawn closer to Russia over Syria and the US has seemed keener to mollify its ally Saudi Arabia than to explore new opportunities for a better relationship with the Iranians. Depressingly, both Iran and the US have retreated to their familiar comfort zones of mutual hostility.</p> <p>If Trump were elected and really were to follow an America-first policy, retreating from global commitments, conciliating Putin and allowing Russia a larger role (as he has hinted, bizarrely) then relations between states would shift in the Middle East. </p> <p>Saudi Arabia would be isolated (the folly of the UK\u2019s support for Saudi Arabia in its sectarian cold war with Iran would be even more exposed) and the Iranian regime might rejoice. But Trump has also said those things about renegotiating the Iran nuclear deal, and has run an ad campaign saying he would \u201ccut the head off Isis and take their oil\u201d, which, though hard to construe, sounds like more intervention rather than less. If he were elected, a lot would depend on Trump\u2019s advisers, but that is no cause for reassurance. John Bolton, whom Trump has spoken of as a possible secretary of state, said in March 2015 in the last weeks before the nuclear deal that the US could still bomb Iran, and that bombing was the only way to stop Iran getting a nuclear weapon. Another figure close to Trump, Lt Gen Michael Flynn, made a statement in July 2016 that seemed to suggest he thought Ali Khamenei\u2019s predecessor, Ayatollah Khomeini, was still alive and in office.</p> <p>As many around the world look on at this election with alarm and some despondency, I remember Henry Kissinger\u2019s infamous comment on the Iran-Iraq war \u2013 \u201cit\u2019s a pity they can\u2019t both lose\u201d. It seems to be a choice between a man whose daddy bought him a route to the top and a woman whose path was smoothed by the charm of her less intelligent husband. </p> <p>Broadly, in assessing the likely direction of policy under either of the two candidates, one has to expect that Trump would follow through on his rhetoric and take a hard line on Iran. Trump is plainly populist and unpredictable \u2013 an American version of Iran\u2019s former president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. But even to him, a US policy initiative to tear up the nuclear deal must look like only adding to the problems of a murderously chaotic region.</p> <p>Clinton by contrast appears a relatively safe choice \u2013 but would that mean following the unimaginative anti-Iranian groupthink in Washington rather than exploring the opportunities that the Iran nuclear deal should have opened up? In a statement earlier in the year she spoke in all-too-familiar terms of Iran as continuing to threaten the peace and security of the Middle East, of \u201cIran\u2019s negative actions in the region\u201d and standing \u201cside-by-side with our ally Israel and our Arab partners\u201d. We know from Wikileaks that she believed privately in the past that Saudi Arabia was the largest source for terrorist funding worldwide, and that the Saudi government was not doing enough to stop that funding. But a more balanced view of the Saudi-Iranian confrontation has not emerged in her public utterances.</p> <p>Perhaps if, as the polls still indicate, Clinton wins the US presidential contest, greater political freedom of action will permit her to be more imaginative, bold and judicious in the Iran context. Let\u2019s hope so.</p>",

Deutsche Bank is trading at a record low level. There\u2019s real worry about whether it has enough capital. Have you spoken to Chancellor Merkel about Deutsche Bank and the needs of the German banking sector?</p> <p><strong>Lagarde</strong>: Well, we completed back in June, actually, a financial sector assessment of the German banking system. And it is a system that is critically important with some systemic players. Deutsche Bank is certainly one of them. So I think we all have a stake in making sure that this situation is addressed, that the right measures are taken, that we don\u2019t fall into over dramatisation either. But I trust that these measures will be taken.</p> <p><strong>Eisen</strong>: Do you trust that the German government would step in if capital is necessary?</p> <p><strong>Lagarde</strong>: You know, this is something that they\u2019re going to debate amongst themselves. I don\u2019t see...</p> <p><strong>Eisen</strong>: Would you recommend it?</p> <p><strong>Lagarde</strong>: I don\u2019t see that particular institution as - at a stage where state intervention is absolutely called for at the moment. And I would hope that the right measure are taken internally so that the whole financial sector in Germany is solid and that systemic players [are] strengthened. It has recovered a bit today, by the way.</p> <p><strong>Eisen</strong>: Yes, it has. But do you see it as a global systemic risk?</p> <p><strong>Lagarde</strong>: Deutsche Bank is a systemic player.

While some banks\u2019 business models may indeed need to adapt to the current low interest rate environment, they also need to address their own structural issues, such as overcapacity, the stock of non-performing loans and the potential impact of technological innovation. Low profitability is closely linked to low operational efficiency. In Germany cost to income ratios are on average relatively high compared to other jurisdictions.

Shares in Germany\u2019s biggest bank by assets have dropped almost a fifth since it confirmed that the United States Department of Justice wants it to pay $14 billion to settle charges of mis-selling mortgage-backed securities. Final bills paid by other banks suggest Deutsche will hand over a fraction of that amount.</p> <p>Calculating penalties is an inexact science. But one way to assess how much Deutsche might pay is to look at the fine as a proportion of the mortgage-backed securities it issued. Bank of America, for example, settled on a sum worth just over 2 percent of the instruments it underwrote, says KBW. Citigroup was the hardest hit so far, with fines totaling 11 percent of its issuance, according to Goldman Sachs analysts.</p> <p>Apply that range to the estimated $67 billion of securities that Deutsche underwrote \u2013 and deduct the $1.9 billion it has already forked out to the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) \u2013 and the remaining fine could be anything from $200 million to $5.5 billion. That might not be all hard cash, either. Settlement bills can include so-called consumer relief \u2013 loan forgiveness or extra credit offered to borrowers over defined periods.</p> </blockquote> <h2>More here: <a href=\"http://www.breakingviews.com/considered-view/past-mortgage-fines-give-deutsche-room-for-hope/\">Another fine mess</a></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/DominicElliott/status/781099707946917889\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">I calculate range of &quot;fair&quot; U.S. Justice Department fine for <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DeutscheBank\">@DeutscheBank</a> based on what other banks have paid as between $200m and $5.5bn <a href=\"https://t.co/TJ8F58HUc1\">https://t.co/TJ8F58HUc1</a></p>&mdash; Dominic Elliott (@DominicElliott) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DominicElliott/status/781099707946917889\">September 28, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57ebc07be4b049b74e4caf0d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-28T13:22:54.257Z\">2.22pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"2eff76dc43e736487554f4a44242260e19dd183b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2eff76dc43e736487554f4a44242260e19dd183b/0_0_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A Deutsche Bank logo adorns a wall at the company\u2019s headquarters in Frankfurt, Germany.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>Although Deutsche Bank clearly has problems, some analysts argue that its troubles are being overstated.</strong></p> <p>Reaching an agreement with the Department of Justice to pay <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/16/deutsche-bank-14bn-dollar-fine-doj-q-and-a\">rather less than $14bn for misselling mortgage-backed securities</a> would remove one dark cloud, and free it up to raise fresh capital if needed.</p> <p><strong>Neil Wilson</strong>, analyst at <strong>ETX Capital,</strong> explains how Deutsche has some firepower left:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>At the end of June, its core tier one capital ratio stood at 10.8% - well above the minimum required by regulators since the financial crisis, albeit below its main peers.</p> <p>Deutsche is pretty well capitalised and it could raise fresh capital \u2013 this would hit the share price but it\u2019s not the end of the world. And it has plenty of assets it can sell quickly to raise the ratio if required. Selling the asset management arm might be required, although this would be negative for earnings growth going forward.</p> </blockquote> <p>He also argues that we\u2019re not facing a repeat of the 2008 crisis (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/sep/28/deutsche-bank-ceo-help-opec-oil-draghi-germany-live?page=with:block-57eb77c6e4b08ca277ca0ee5#block-57eb77c6e4b08ca277ca0ee5\"><em>as UBS chairman Axel Weber said this morning</em></a>).</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It\u2019s not a Lehmans moment in the offing. Banks are generally better capitalised and able to cope with adverse shocks. And Deutsche\u2019s derivatives exposure can be overstated. These exposures are netted out and hedged so it\u2019s not like Deutsche could lose the trillions of dollars as is sometimes hinted at. Nevertheless, these derivatives are hard to value, particularly post-Brexit, and therefore pose a risk, while there is a worry is that a lower credit rating will make it harder to deal in these derivatives, hitting earnings.</p> </blockquote> <p>But that doesn\u2019t mean that Deutsche Bank isn\u2019t in a fix:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Deutsche\u2019s problem is not capitalisation \u2013 it\u2019s just that its costs have soared (mainly through litigation and fines) and it\u2019s not that profitable any more. That is a much longer-term question about its future than whether it\u2019s in need of a bailout to boost some arbitrary capital requirement. Deutsche has to face down the short hedgies first and then look to raise capital. In that sense a \u2018whatever it takes\u2019 kind of nod from Berlin may help.\u201d</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57ebc182e4b0757c5291926c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-28T13:12:04.092Z\">2.12pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>How things change...</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/ReutersJamie/status/781073088947621888\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">From February:<br>JP Morgan named Deutsche its top global investment bank pick;

According to Die Zeit\u2019s research, shared with The Guardian ahead of publication, the German government is \u201cdebating a state takeover of as much as 25 per cent\u201d of the bank.</p> <p>One advantage of such a solution is that such an intervention would allow the German government to push Deutsche Bank towards a fusion with Commerzbank, of which around 15% are already state-owned.</p> <p>However, a state-sponsored bailout for Deutsche Bank would provide much embarrassment for a lender whose former boss Josef Ackerman said in 2008 that he would be \u201cashamed\u201d to take money from the state \u2013 as well as a German government which has been insisting on limiting state aid for ailing banks in southern Europe.</p> <p>The bailout would also come with considerable economic risk. Under a new rule put into force across the EU at the start of the year, no bank can be bailed out with public money until creditors accounting for at least 8 per cent of the lender\u2019s liabilities have contributed towards footing the bill.

  "<p>Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, the Iranian hardliner who presided over a period of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/16/sanctions-against-iran-to-be-lifted-after-compliance-with-nuclear-deal\">deepening and damaging sanctions</a>, has been blocked from running for president in Iran\u2019s elections next year. <br></p> <p>The former president\u2019s hopes were dashed after the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, indicated in public that he did not see the prospect of his candidacy as being in the interests of the country. <br></p> <p>In a letter published on Tuesday, Ahmadinejad announced he would not be running, submitting to the wishes of the 77-year-old ayatollah. <br></p> <p>It comes after months of speculation that Ahmadinejad had been building up a campaign to confront the current president, the moderate cleric Hassan Rouhani, in next year\u2019s vote. Rouhani has to seek re-election if he wants to remain in power for another four years. Under Iranian law, presidents are only allowed two consecutive terms.</p> <p>Earlier this month, the semi-official Fars news agency reported that the supreme leader had explicitly told Ahmadinejad he should not run. Later, two conservative politicians confirmed those reports.</p> <p>On Monday, Khamenei\u2019s official website, in an apparent move to put his opinion on the record, published the transcription of his speech during a meeting with a group of his followers. </p> <p>\u201cSomeone came to see me and considering his own interests and the interests of the country, I told him he should not participate in that matter [elections],\u201d Khamenei is quoted as saying. \u201cI didn\u2019t tell him not to participate, I told him I won\u2019t recommend him participating.\u201d</p> <p>In his letter on Tuesday, which was addressed to Khamenei, Ahmadinejad revealed he had a meeting with the leader at the end of last month, during which he was told not to run. </p> <p>\u201cYou recommended that it was not in [my] interests to run in the elections and I stated my obedience,\u201d he wrote. <br></p> <p>In theory, Ahmadinejad can still put his name on the list as a nominee and the supreme leader does not have the automatic power to block him. In practice, however, the ayatollah has the ultimate power in all state matters. </p> <p>The Guardian Council, a body of jurists and clerics who are close to Khamenei, vets all candidates before any elections in Iran, in a process that has been the subject of much controversy. There has been a heated debate over whether the Guardian Council has the constitutional footing to block candidates but in recent years, it has blocked many reformists and independents, as well as conservatives, from running in parliamentary and presidential elections. <br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e96ac69e166e52fc1177b9018ac39be58bf27cb1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e96ac69e166e52fc1177b9018ac39be58bf27cb1/0_80_2400_1440/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Iran\u2019s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Iran\u2019s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, indicated he did not see the prospect of Ahmadinejad\u2019s candidacy as being in the interests of the country.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: HO/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jul/18/life-iranians-nuclear-deal\">After the nuclear deal, the west should not disappoint Iranians for the third time | Saeed Kamali Dehghan</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Despite the vetting process, which has raised questions about the fairness of Iranian elections, turnouts are usually high in presidential elections.

The size of that lead can vary significantly from poll to poll - she was <a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2016-election/poll-clinton-leads-trump-ahead-first-debate-n652141\">seven percentage points</a> ahead according to an NBC poll, then only <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/docs/2016/SEPT_26_NAT_PRES_+_BP.pdf\">one percentage point</a> ahead, according to Quinnipiac University \u2013 but they still suggest Clinton is winning the majority of support. </p> <p>Numbers from LA Times and USC published on Wednesday tell a very different story, though, because they suggest Trump is <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://graphics.latimes.com/usc-presidential-poll-dashboard/\">four percentage points</a> ahead of Clinton. What\u2019s more, LA Times and USC polling have consistently suggested a more optimistic picture for Donald Trump (no wonder the candidate has <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/767150340726779904\">tweeted</a> their poll results). So, is this poll more or less accurate than the others? </p> <p>To understand, you have to take a peek at their methodology.</p> <p>Unlike most polls, LA Times and USC tracks a panel of roughly 3,000 US citizens that were randomly contacted from across the country rather than trying to find new respondents each time.

But now, millennials<a href=\"http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/04/25/millennials-overtake-baby-boomers/\"> have pushed out</a> baby boomers to become the largest single voting bloc in the US.</p> <p>That\u2019s why you simply can\u2019t keep alienating young Americans if you want to get elected.

Beyond being a history-making candidate, Obama talked about issues young voters care about.

His failure to follow through on some of those issues contributed in part to the<a href=\"https://www.thenation.com/article/im-millennial-and-im-disappointed-obama/\"> enthusiasm gap</a> of 2012.<br></p> <p>Who else has resonated strongly with twentysomethings? You don\u2019t have to look farther than this past primary cycle. Senator Bernie Sanders connected with young voters in a way no one else has this year. Sanders spoke about a number of \u201cpain points\u201d that millennials are feeling, including student debt, under-employment and a government they believe serves interests instead of people.</p> <p>That doesn\u2019t mean that politicians need to embrace the democratic socialist solutions that the Vermont senator championed. But it does demonstrate that millennials are just waiting for a politician to speak up about the problems they face on a daily basis. </p> <p>At the very least, candidates need to make an effort to address these very real \u2013 and growing \u2013 issues. The problems with our education system aren\u2019t clearing up any time soon. While employment has improved, many millennials continue to<a href=\"http://finance.yahoo.com/news/millennials-buying-home-distant-dream-140000668.html\"> lag behind</a> their parents\u2019 prosperity. They are waiting longer for kids, mortgages and even personal purchases, due to under-employment.</p> <p>Yet winning them over doesn\u2019t just mean nailing the big ticket issues. Young voters have a number of defining characteristics that shape their voting habits. These are often missed, as there are a lot of misconceptions about this generation. For example, the media often labels<a href=\"http://time.com/247/millennials-the-me-me-me-generation/\"> millennials as selfish</a>. But <a href=\"http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/files/2010/10/millennials-confident-connected-open-to-change.pdf\">studies show</a> a generation focused on family, community and helping others.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/global/Documents/About-Deloitte/gx-millenial-survey-2016-exec-summary.pdf\">The reason</a> they aren\u2019t a fan of those 9-to-5 corporate jobs?

Across the board young voters overwhelmingly believe in equality for everyone. And guess what kind of politician these young voters want to represent them? Someone who shares those same values.</p> <p>Millennials need a reason to show up to the polls: so give them one. Down-ballot candidates have a genuine opportunity to make inroads with this demographic. You can show commitment to the community you represent, or work for greater transparency in local government or break down hurdles for first-time small business owners. Often times state representatives and city council members have more chances to impact these issues than our presidential candidates.</p> <p>And don\u2019t forget to show up. Be present. Not just in Washington DC, or the state house, or at your party meetings \u2013 go to where these voters are. Visit your local shelters where millennials are<a href=\"http://www.today.com/news/do-you-give-time-or-money-nbc-poll-finds-millennials-t58736\"> helping out</a>. Join young professional groups at their social events. Speak at your local chamber of commerce and PTA meetings. Attend a charity run. You won\u2019t find many millennial voters sitting in your office\u2019s waiting room: they\u2019re out there in the community making a difference.</p> <p>It\u2019s way past time to start listening to millennials. Before asking for their vote, why not ask what they care about and begin tailoring your focus to that? It\u2019s a good idea to start now, because every year this generation will become more likely to show up and vote. Don\u2019t you want to make sure it will be for you?</p>",

  "<p>Alicia Machado became an American citizen just in time to vote against Donald Trump. It\u2019s a vote that has been a long time coming.</p> <p>In May 1996, the Venezuelan beauty queen was just 19 years old when she was crowned the winner of the Miss Universe pageant, which had recently been bought by the Manhattan business mogul. That year should have been one of sheer happiness and possibility for Machado, and for a moment it was. \u201cI remember I hug my mom and I tell her, now our lives is going to be changed forever,\u201d she told the Guardian in an interview in her adopted hometown of Los Angeles.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/27/donald-trump-alicia-machado-miss-universe-fox-and-friends\">Trump attacks Alicia Machado again: 'She gained a massive amount of weight. She was the worst'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But when she put on weight soon after winning, Trump turned what should have been a golden year into the most traumatizing one of her life. It wasn\u2019t just that Trump shamed her about about gaining weight, calling her things like \u201cMiss Piggy\u201d and \u201can eating machine\u201d. It wasn\u2019t even that he did so publicly. It was that he did it with the biggest audience he could find, in an attempt to sear her weight fluctuation into the public consciousness, forever changing how she would be remembered.</p> <p>Then on Monday night, in a twist of cosmic justice, Trump \u2013 now the Republican nominee for president \u2013 was presented with a bigger audience for his comments about Machado\u2019s weight than he ever could have imagined, or wanted.</p> <p>In what has been billed as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/27/debate-clinton-trump-recap-presidential-election-hofstra\">the most-watched debate in presidential history</a>, Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton made Trump\u2019s remarks to Machado a centerpiece of their first televised clash, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/27/donald-trump-alicia-machado-miss-universe-fox-and-friends\">citing the name-calling</a> \u2013 in particular, Trump calling her \u201cMiss Housekeeping\u201d in reference to her Latina origins \u2013 as a prime example of her opponent\u2019s demeaning views about women.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s treatment of Machado reached its nadir in January 1997 when, having put the recently crowned Miss Universe on a stringent diet and exercise regime, he scheduled a trip with her to a New York City gym. There he blindsided her with dozens of cameramen, who gathered to film her jumping rope, lifting weights and pedaling a stationary bike. Trump cast himself in the role of disapproving dad, leaning over Machado as she hid her mortification behind a show of charms only the world\u2019s top beauty queen could have mustered, laughing along with reporters and even once planting a kiss on Trump\u2019s cheek.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"182c369144cbcc05e3426777492f101cf5a3bc56\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/182c369144cbcc05e3426777492f101cf5a3bc56/0_0_1478_1790/826.jpg\" alt=\"Alicia Machado of Venezuela reacts as she is crowned Miss Universe on 17 May 1996.\" width=\"826\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alicia Machado of Venezuela reacts as she is crowned Miss Universe on 17 May 1996.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Eric Draper/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Although she appeared happy, smiling for the crowd of cameras as she dutifully skipped rope, she tells the Guardian she felt like a mouse in a cage, running endlessly on her fixed wheel for the entertainment of others. \u201cI was in some gym in New York like a mouse,\u201d she said. \u201cLook at that mouse: how she run, how she jump, how she make exercise. Like that. In that moment is when \u2026 problems come to me and start.\u201d</p> <p>The media loved the spectacle, and so did Trump, who didn\u2019t hesitate to pass out some memorable if fallacious tidbits himself. \u201cShe weighed 118 pounds or 117 pounds and she went up to 170, so this is somebody who likes to eat,\u201d he said in an interview at the time. In fact Machado says she gained only a fraction of that weight but she didn\u2019t dare correct him; she was already frightened he\u2019d make good on a threat to strip her of her crown if she didn\u2019t follow through on the performance at the gym. (Trump\u2019s campaign did not return a request for comment.)</p> <p>Machado never did lose her crown, but she lost her health for a time. Though she had never suffered from eating disorders previously, in the years that followed the ordeal at the gym, she struggled with anorexia and bulimia. It took five years before she was fully recovered, and longer before she could talk about what she went through. Now she hopes to use the insights gleaned to help teenagers struggling to love their bodies.</p> <p>\u201cNo matter what, no matter who tells you that you don\u2019t look good, that is only outside,\u201d she said, speaking partly, perhaps, to her younger self. \u201cYou are more than some weight. You are more than some phase. You are more than if you are short or tall, or you are black or you are white, or you are skinny or fat or whatever. Your value is how you can work, how you can feel for the people around you.\u201d</p> <p>She added: \u201cIn this moment 20 years later, the only thing I need to say is I\u2019m a really happy person. I\u2019m a very successful person. I have my family, my daughter, my career, my dreams, my ideas.\u201d Referring to Trump\u2019s character, she said: \u201cAnd he can\u2019t be a president of the United States of America.\u201d</p> <p>That Machado is thriving these days was readily apparent from where she sat in her publicist\u2019s fourth-floor office in West Hollywood, and apparent in many different realms. She has traded pageants for success as an actor, starring in a string of telenovelas \u2013 a childhood dream come true. She is also a successful businesswoman, with a line of products bearing her name. And she is the proud mother of a seven-year-old girl, whose privacy she fiercely protects; a question about whether she would encourage her daughter to compete in beauty pageants was met with stern disapproval.</p> <p>More recently, she has added another title to her list of identities: activist. In June,<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/virginia-politics/former-miss-universe-civil-rights-legend-delores-huerta-team-up-against-trump/2016/06/15/a287616e-3313-11e6-8758-d58e76e11b12_story.html\"> Machado teamed up with civil rights icon Dolores Huerta</a> in Virginia to join immigrant advocacy groups in encouraging Latinos to register \u2013 and to vote for Clinton. She took her own advice to heart, too. On 19 August she became a registered US citizen, pledging in a<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BJS8lOEjhGV/\"> post on Instagram</a> to cast her ballot for Clinton. Later that month she traveled to Florida to lend her star power to a Clinton campaign drive to register Latino voters, posting video excerpts from the trip to social media accounts.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"I so proud and inspiration to be a U.S. Citizen!

It\u2019s a similar case with his continued insistence on how right he is to call women out for their weight. Machado understands this, perhaps even more acutely than Clinton, because she\u2019s lived it; and she is willing to relive and keep reliving this painful episode if it means shedding light on a man she feels has no business anywhere near the Oval Office.</p> <p>On a call organized by the Clinton campaign on Tuesday afternoon billed as a chance to let Machado respond to Trump\u2019s most recent attacks, the former beauty queen was much more interested in talking about his Democratic rival, whose mention of her story in the debate the night before had moved her to tears. She \u201cnever imagined it would matter to someone so powerful\u201d, she said. </p> <p>But as someone who straddles two powerful voting blocs this election cycle, Machado is a double threat to Trump, and she feels that her celebrity means she has a responsibility to speak up about her experiences when they can help people. \u201cIf I can be a voice for my Latino community in this moment, I will do it,\u201d she told the Guardian.</p> <p>It\u2019s not just a matter of Trump: a few years ago she survived a battle with breast cancer, and as a person of faith, she said she struggled to make sense of why God sent her such a challenge. Tearing up ever so slightly for the first time in an hour-long interview, she said she finally determined it was because she needed to share her story: \u201cPeople believe in my words,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople look at me as a strong person. That is my character \u2013 I\u2019m a strong woman.\u201d</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/shimon-peres\">Shimon Peres</a>, one of Israel\u2019s defining political figures and a Nobel peace prize laureate, has died at the age of 93, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/13/shimon-peres-suffers-stroke-former-israeli-president\">two weeks after suffering a stroke</a>.</p> <p>Peres had twice served as prime minister of Israel and later as the country\u2019s ninth president. He had been seriously ill on a respirator in an Israeli hospital near Tel Aviv and died after his condition deteriorated sharply.</p> <p>Among those who have said they will attend his funeral and burial on Jerusalem\u2019s Mount Herzl on Friday are Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton and Bill Clinton, as well as Prince Charles and Fran\u00e7ois Hollande.</p> <p>In more than six decades of political life his defining achievement <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/sep/12/oslo-israel-reneged-colonial-palestine\">was as one of the key architects of the Oslo peace accords</a>, for which he was jointly awarded the Nobel peace prize in 1994 with the then Israeli prime minister, Yitzhak Rabin, and Yasser Arafat, the chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organisation.</p> <p>Those peace agreements \u2013 signed in Washington in 1993 and Taba, Egypt in 1995, \u2013 foresaw the creation of a Palestinian state, and were named after the Norwegian capital where the two sides launched eight months of secret negotiations in which Peres played a key role.</p> <p>With Peres\u2019s death the last of that trio has now gone. </p> <p>Rabin was cut down by a rightwing assassin\u2019s bullet in 1995, with Arafat dying nine years later. Today, the prospect of the peace and two-state solution offered by Oslo is far away, after the collapse of that peace process in 2014. </p> <p>Peres\u2019s death was formally confirmed on Wednesday morning by his son Chemi in a news conference at the hospital where his father had been treated.

But it is still possible \u2026 I think the tragedy is both people [Palestinians and Israelis] in majorities want to move to a two-state solution. It is not moving because of politics. But his dream will be implemented.\u201d </p> <p>Despite his role in the Oslo accords, Palestinians and the wider Arab world saw the legacy of Peres differently.

  "<p>Time-travel is a recurring trope in pop film and TV culture. Whether it\u2019s Marty McFly in Back to the Future, Tom Cruise in Minority Report, or the forthcoming Timeless and Frequency, it is something couch potatoes love to nerd out to.</p> <p>While Oprah Winfrey and director Ava DuVernay\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Py1GVEAVv4E\">Queen Sugar</a> series isn\u2019t a sci-fi fantasy, it does deal with time travel on a symbolic level. The show, based on the novel of the same name<a href=\"https://www.colorlines.com/articles/queen-sugar-author-natalie-baszile-planting-sugar-cane-riding-zydeco-trail-and-blessing-tv\"> by Natalie Baszile</a>, follows the family drama of the three Bordelon siblings: Charley, an NBA wife and business mogul in Los Angeles; Ralph Angel, a single-father parolee with tough luck and a troubled past; and Nova, a journalist and activist with a complicated personal life. The trio reunites back at their familial home in St Josephine, Louisiana, due to the death of their father Ernest, who left them his sugarcane farm.</p> <p>The central narrative is their family drama, but Queen Sugar also tackles the African American nostalgia for \u2013 or fear of \u2013 symbolic time travel. Going back to the south creates ambivalence in black characters. It\u2019s a reconnection to ancestral and spiritual roots, but also means confronting the pain of a place in which their ancestors were dehumanized. </p> <p>Though research has shown that the idea of time as linear is more framing than fact (born from Eurocentric visions of \u201cthe progress narrative\u201d and <a href=\"https://medium.com/@chanda/decolonising-science-reading-list-339fb773d51f#.3b7lpuvrf\">how science was also \u201ccolonized\u201d during colonization</a>), people born within western civilization\u2019s cultural influence tend to look at the past as \u201cregressive\u201d and the future as \u201cprogressive\u201d. Within US history, this conception has a geographic \u201cnorth\u201d versus \u201csouth\u201d element. Therefore, in the general US historical imagination, for black people, leaving the south was tantamount to travelling to the future. Staying in the south was being stuck in limbo, and going back to the south, like going back in time, is inherently regressive.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"471353dc1110f4918c3915465d9429ea7663bb7a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/471353dc1110f4918c3915465d9429ea7663bb7a/0_0_5760_3840/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The series alludes to the idea of going back to the land.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The series alludes to the idea of going back to the land.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Patti Perret/Oprah Winfrey Network</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Charley Bordelon\u2019s move from liberal urban Hollywood to the rural Louisiana highlights the difficult transition in her life, but also calls on different historical instances in which black people had to go back to the land (during and in the aftermath of the Haitian Revolution, Reconstruction-era sharecropping, worker camps, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ABpWhY5Xzk\">the Louisiana State Penitentiary in Angola</a>, for instance). So while nostalgia is a universal human emotion, romanticizing the past is deeply racialized within American history. </p> <p>To give a different example, westerns are rooted in mainstream America\u2019s nostalgia of \u201chome on the range\u201d living, frontierism, manifest destiny, and prosperity gospel (the idea that social, political, or economic power or the lack thereof is directly correlated with divine will, favoritism, or a person or group\u2019s faith). But for Native Americans, westerns bring back memories of their physical and cultural genocide. </p> <p>Our nostalgia is a megaphone for racial subjectivity of American history (but also any racially diverse country\u2019s history) and the blind spots it can cause. In a piece for the New York Times, James Baldwin <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/books/98/03/29/specials/baldwin-dream.html\">once wrote</a> \u201cIt comes as a great shock to see Gary Cooper killing off the Indians, and although you are rooting for Gary Cooper, that the Indians are you.\u201d</p> <p>Queen Sugar screens at a time where racial subjectivity is clear in the 2016 presidential election, where the call for change and the desire to \u201cgo back\u201d (literally or symbolically) collide. </p> <p>Donald Trump\u2019s campaign slogan is \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d. This phrase appeals to mainstream white voters, but it undoubtedly awakens the historical anxieties of black people especially. The word \u201cagain\u201d begs the question that if America is not great now, then what time period is the Trump campaign is referring to? And for many minorities, the answer doesn\u2019t matter, since backwards time-travel for them is regressive. Comedian Louis CK\u2019s joked on how African Americans would avoid going backwards if time machines existed, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyQTAIiCa4Y\">calling time travel a \u201cwhite privilege\u201d</a>. </p> <p>As a show deeply informed by its diverse depictions of blackness, Queen Sugar taps into the \u201cprogress narrative\u201d historical zeitgeist of African Americans. The death of Ernest Bordelon, the father of the three siblings, sparks their return to St Josephine, but it also augments their need to conquer their individual struggles (Charley caught up in her husbands sexual assault scandal; Ralph Angel struggling to be a good father as an ex-convict whose son\u2019s mother is a recovering drug addict; Nova wrestling with her political life as journalist and activist with her role as \u201cthe other woman\u201d in a complicated affair). </p> <p>These anxieties are amplified not only through the racial tension shown in the episodes (for example, a genteel white landowner who wants to buy the farm, black adolescents locked up in adult prisons, or white repo-men who come to take their father\u2019s tractor), but the actual setting: a sugarcane farm. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"74a92b1e061f04a1a4c88dcd086ee0574ffa5ccd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/74a92b1e061f04a1a4c88dcd086ee0574ffa5ccd/0_0_4800_3200/1000.jpg\" alt=\"All of the Bordelon siblings are chasing different types of \u201cprogress\u201d in their lives.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">All of the Bordelon siblings are chasing different types of \u201cprogress\u201d in their lives.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Skip Bolen/Oprah Winfrey Network</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p> In many literary or visual media with a narrative conflict between characters, the setting is a conflict as well. Indiana Jones running from a giant bolder, or Matt Damon, who has to \u201cscience the shit\u201d out Mars\u2019 terrain to stay alive in The Martian, are examples of this. </p> <p>While a sugarcane farm isn\u2019t a trap or another planet, it augments the internal and external conflict of the characters. Charlie has business acumen, but her affluent California upbringing distances her from the complex work it entails to grow sugar cane. Ralph Angel has the physical stamina, good intentions, and eagerness to help, but his impulsiveness causes him to make bad decisions. And as of now, Nova is playing a facilitator role in running the farm, as she\u2019s busy working on a watchdog story digging into a criminal justice scandal affecting young, black male Louisianans (something her brother may have been a victim of). </p> <p>All of the Bordelon siblings are chasing different types of \u201cprogress\u201d in their lives. But their efforts are impeded by the different forces of the past, and the sugarcane farm is a physical proxy for these things: Ernest\u2019s death, his struggles as a black farmer, the complicated relationships they have with him and between themselves, and all the historical struggles (both within US racial history and locally in St Josephine) they inherited once they inherited the farm. </p> <p>But aside from the setting, DuVernay and her writing team augment it through the characters and the choices she made while adapting Baszile\u2019s novel. In the book, Charley is an inner-city art teacher and widower (her husband got shot in a hold up from refusing to give up his stuff) drowned in student loans. While her move to Saint Josephine is still informed by her father\u2019s death and the racial and gendered tension of her presence, this backstory gives the relocation a more redemptive, \u201cstarting a new life\u201d quality to it; that although the adjustment is tough, the move is ultimately good for her and her daughter. </p> <p>But in the show, Charley is recast as a rich NBA wife and business owner going through a career and marriage crisis. This greatly increases the conflict inherent in the move: the dramatic lifestyle change in going from liberal, cosmopolitan, multi-cultural Hollywood to the conservative, rural Louisiana. This astute backstory alteration heightens the tension of both Charley\u2019s adjustment, the setting as an obstacle and the conflict within her family. </p> <p>The Bordelon tribe\u2019s complicated relationship is a metaphor for the themes that arise in many African Americans\u2019 complicated relationship with American history: pain, hope, sense of responsibility, baggage, searching for home, displacement, gif-and-a-curse dichotomies, double consciousness and more. If the series so far is any indication, Queen Sugar will continue to wrestle with the themes of time and space travel in complex and interesting ways. </p>",
  "<p>Ever since the state of Israel was created in 1948, Shimon Peres, who has died aged 93, was at or near the centre of action. A protege of David Ben-Gurion, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/from-the-archive-blog/2012/may/14/archive-1948-establishment-israel-jewish-state\">Israel\u2019s first prime minister</a>, Peres became premier himself on three occasions, foreign minister for another three, and state president from 2007 until 2014. He fashioned alliances with France in the 1950s, and planted the seeds for Israel\u2019s embryonic electronics and aircraft industries. During the 60s, he honed the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) and secretly amassed Israel\u2019s nuclear weapons.</p> <p>For 15 long years after it fell from power in 1977, Peres led the Labour party. In the early 80s, he resuscitated Israel\u2019s economy, and in 1994 shared the <a href=\"http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1994/\">Nobel prize</a> for his role in the efforts to create peace in the Middle East through the Oslo accords. In the same year, he cemented Israel\u2019s peace treaty with Jordan. Defeated at the polls in 1996, he returned in 2001 as foreign minister, thereby giving Israel\u2019s controversial new premier, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jan/11/ariel-sharon\">Ariel Sharon</a>, a much-needed veneer of respectability. And in 2006, he left Labour, his home for five decades, to help Sharon set up his powerful new breakaway faction, Kadima.</p> <p>A simple listing of achievements only hints at the phenomenon that was Peres. The Jerusalem Report news magazine called him \u201cIsrael\u2019s only world-class statesman, perhaps Zionism\u2019s last pragmatic visionary\u201d. Peres wrote 11 books, read poetry voraciously, and could quote from Old Testament prophets, French literature and Chinese philosophy with equal ease. After the assassination of <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituaryyitzhak-rabin-1580649.html\">Yitzhak Rabin</a> in 1995, he bound together a shattered nation.</p> <p>And yet, despite all his talent, there was something tragic about the man. Peres contested five elections without winning a single outright victory. His longest tenure as premier was two years, and came while he was in an awkward alliance with his Likud enemies. He lost the Labour leadership on the eve of the party\u2019s return to power in 1992. A slew of terrorist attacks in early 1996 allowed <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/binyamin-netanyahu\">Binyamin Netanyahu</a> victory over Peres in Israel\u2019s first direct prime ministerial elections. No wonder Orly Azoulay titled her 1996 biography of him The Man Who Didn\u2019t Know How to Win.</p> <p>Some of his initiatives were halted before they had got going, such as his 1987 London agreement with <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/obituary-king-hussein-of-jordan-1069507.html\">King Hussein of Jordan</a>. Others collapsed because opponents chipped away at the scaffolding, as with the Oslo accords. Even when in 2000 he stood for state president \u2013 the ultimate consolation prize for veterans \u2013 Knesset members opted not for him but for the pedestrian <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/moshe-katsav\">Moshe Katsav</a>.</p> <p>All the same, Peres campaigned well into his 80s. No sooner had the media written him off as a \u201cserial loser\u201d than he would pop up again as a saviour in a time of crisis. He was used to playing the long game. In 2007 Katsav resigned in disgrace amid charges of sexual improprieties, and Peres was elected president in his stead. Virtually across the board, Israeli editorials spoke of a national sigh of relief in recognition of a long-maligned yet irreplaceable figure.</p> <p>\u201cI am a child of the generation that lost one world and went on to build another,\u201d Peres once wrote.</p> <p>Son of Yitzhak and Sarah Persky (he later Hebraised the family surname), he was born in Vishneva, then a largely Jewish town located in the borderlands between modern Belarus, Poland and Lithuania. His New York-born cousin Betty Perske, one year his junior, went on to achieve fame as the actor <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/aug/13/lauren-bacall-obituary\">Lauren Bacall</a>. Shimon\u2019s maternal grandfather, Zvi Meltzer, who later died in the Holocaust, inspired his love for literature. Frequent antisemitic raids undermined Vishneva\u2019s patina of autonomy. At the age of 10, Shimon left to settle in Tel Aviv, where his father, a lumber merchant, had emigrated two years earlier.</p> <p>At 15 Peres joined the Ben Shemen agricultural youth village, a crucible of future Israeli leaders. He soon met the Ukrainian-born Sonia Gelman and wooed her by moonlight with readings from Marx\u2019s Das Kapital. The couple married in 1945 after Sonia had served as a nurse and driver with the British Army in Egypt. She became a source of strength to him in private and an enigmatically deferential figure in public.</p> <p>Peres became leader of the Hano\u2019ar Ha\u2019oved (Working Youth) Zionist movement when he was 19, and founded Kibbutz Alumot in the Jordan Valley. Apprised of his skills, Ben-Gurion appointed Peres head of mobilisation for the Haganah underground in 1947. He procured plane parts from the US, Italy and Czechoslovakia during the 1948 war. He even became secretary of Israel\u2019s navy, although he confessed: \u201cMy experience consisted of moderate proficiency at breaststroke and one childhood attempt to launch a raft off the coast of Tel Aviv.\u201d</p> <p>In 1950 Peres travelled to Washington as military attache. By 1953, aged 29, he was director of the entire defence ministry, an office he held until 1959. Peres helped plan the Sinai campaign of 1956. In 1957, he successfully lobbied the French government for a nuclear reactor, and established a hi-tech intelligence unit, Lakam, whose operatives served him in future clandestine ventures. He also tried to abolish military rule over Israel\u2019s Arab citizens, but Ben-Gurion overruled him and the law was only repealed in 1966.</p> <p>Israel later promised that it would not introduce atomic weapons into the region \u2013 \u201cat my urging\u201d, wrote Peres. Though he conceded that Arab leaders saw his creation, Israel\u2019s secret Dimona plant in the Negev Desert, as \u201ca worrisome fuzzy deterrent\u201d, Peres the politician enjoyed creating such deliberate ambiguities.</p> <p>In 1959 Peres was elected to the Israeli parliament, the Knesset, for the ruling Mapai party (forerunner of Labour) and immediately became deputy defence minister. He bought Israel\u2019s first US weapons, but resigned in 1965 with the prime minister, Ben-Gurion. Their breakaway Rafi party proved unsuccessful, winning only 10 seats, and in 1968 Rafi rejoined Labour, as did Peres, who became its deputy general secretary.</p> <p>Israel gained the Palestinian-populated territories of Gaza and the West Bank in the 1967 war \u2013 an acquisition that was to change its politics more profoundly than was realised at the time. In 1969 Peres was charged with developing these areas, and absorbing new eastern European immigrants. He then served in turn as communications, transport and information minister. When, in 1974, the prime minister, Golda Meir, was forced to resign, Peres gamely stood for election to the vacant post of party leader, but lost narrowly to an equally youthful, native-born military hero, Rabin. This was a battle that would be repeated often over the next two decades.</p> <p>Appointed defence minister that June, Peres immediately plunged into the intricacies of negotiating a second interim Sinai treaty with Egypt. He also opened a \u201cgood fence\u201d border crossing with Lebanon, revitalised the IDF after the near-humiliation of the 1973 war, allowed legally questionable settlements on the West Bank, and masterminded the daring rescue of hostages from Entebbe in 1976. Yet support haemorrhaged for a government blighted by scandal and economic malaise. Rabin resigned in April 1977 and Peres was prime minister for barely a month before <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/bday/0816.html\">Menachem Begin</a>\u2019s Likud demolished Labour at the polls.</p> <p>Peres thus won the dubious privilege of becoming Labour\u2019s first-ever opposition leader. He then saw Begin negotiate the historic peace agreement with Egypt that he had expected to make himself. Rabin\u2019s memoirs decried Peres for betraying him in 1977, and Begin was able to exploit the spat to triumph at the 1981 polls. Peres meanwhile became a vice-president of the Socialist International in 1978. There he befriended <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-willy-brandt-1556598.html\">Willy Brandt</a>, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1990/07/30/obituaries/bruno-kreisky-austria-s-leader-for-a-record-13-years-dies-at-79.html\">Bruno Kreisky</a>, British Labour politicians and delegates from Africa and Asia. Such ties were to prove invaluable.</p> <p>Likud\u2019s ill-fated Lebanese war of 1982 allowed Peres to tap into national unease. He fought the 1984 elections to a dead heat, and duly headed a national unity government, agreeing that he would hand power to Likud\u2019s pugnacious new leader, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jul/01/yitzhak-shamir\">Yitzhak Shamir</a>, after two years. As prime minister, Peres made up for lost time. He withdrew troops from Beirut to a narrow \u201csecurity zone\u201d in southern Lebanon. Then he slashed Israel\u2019s inflation rate from 450% to 16% by forcing the Histadrut labour confederation and big business into a national compact. When Shamir became prime minister, Peres served as foreign minister (1986-88), during which time the iconoclastic pragmatist and security hawk, who once called settlements \u201cthe roots and eyes of Israel\u201d, blossomed into a peace campaigner.</p> <p>He had first met King Hussein in 1974. Their mutual respect was clear from the outset. Peres felt that a Jordanian-Palestinian confederation could break the stalemate in the territories, and bring peace to Israel, and in 1987 negotiated with the king in London. Shamir, angry that Peres had \u201cgone behind his back\u201d, quashed the deal. The acrimony between them deepened, and probably exacerbated Palestinian frustration. For his part Hussein blamed Peres for leaking their secret talks.</p> <p>Israel\u2019s 1988 election took place against the backdrop of the Palestinian intifada (the uprising against Israel in the occupied territories). It ended in deadlock, and led to another unsatisfactory \u201cunity government\u201d. Peres rejected Shamir\u2019s endorsement of settlements and, in 1990, sought to topple the government. At the last moment, the religious Shas party withdrew the support it had promised him. In early 1992, Rabin replaced Peres as party leader, and went on to win the June elections for Labour.</p> <p>Miraculously, their enmity turned to partnership, with Peres, the foreign minister, as the engine and Rabin, the prime minister, as the gears and brakes (or so Peres later described it). A longtime foe of the Palestine Liberation Organisation, Peres now persuaded Rabin to consider talks with the PLO leader <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/nov/11/israel.guardianobituaries\">Yasser Arafat</a>. Peres\u2019s lieutenants, led by Yossi Beilin and Uri Savir, opened a secret track with PLO negotiators outside Oslo. At the subsequent White House lawn signing in September 1993, Peres nudged a reluctant Rabin to shake hands with Arafat \u2013 an image that went round the world.</p> <p>For two years, Peres worked furiously to keep the imperfect peace on track. Given the problem of settlements, it was, he quipped, an attempt \u201cto turn an omelette back into eggs\u201d. He negotiated directly with Arafat, turned the \u201cGaza and Jericho First\u201d proposals agreed at the White House into reality, drafted the 1994 Paris Protocol of Israeli-Palestinian economic relations, promoted regional summits and in 1995 sealed Oslo II (an agreement to restore Palestinian rule to six major West Bank towns). Rabin, meanwhile, concentrated on Syrian talks via his protege, the military chief of staff Ehud Barak.</p> <p>But Israeli fury at persistent terrorism prompted demonstrations against the Rabin-Peres administration. In 1995, Yigal Amir assassinated Rabin at a peace rally. Peres, Amir\u2019s other intended target, was just metres away. He took over as prime minister on a wave of sympathy. With hindsight, Peres\u2019s decision not to call immediate elections was an error. Nonetheless, he achieved much in his six months in charge: he implemented Oslo II ahead of schedule, assuaged the religious right, bolstered the economy and co-operated with Arafat over the first-ever Palestinian elections.</p> <p>Support for Peres evaporated when successive bomb attacks killed dozens in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem, and talks with Syria came to naught. Likud warned: \u201cPeres will divide Jerusalem.\u201d Arab states feared that his dream of a borderless Middle East spelled Israeli economic colonialism by stealth. Peres\u2019s retaliatory invasion of Lebanon in April 1996 also misfired, when more than 100 refugees perished in one Israeli bombing. For all Peres\u2019s Panglossian fantasies of a \u201cnew Middle East\u201d the electorate narrowly yet decisively favoured Netanyahu that May.</p> <p>Peres chided \u201cBibi\u201d for \u201c111 days of verbiage\u201d, and held on as party chairman until Barak ousted him in 1997. After Labour\u2019s victory in 1999, Barak gave Peres the nebulous portfolio of \u201cregional co-operation minister\u201d, but sidetracked him over the peace process. Peres had meanwhile founded a centre for peace in his name, with headquarters in Ajami, a largely Arab neighbourhood of Jaffa. It is dedicated to dialogue, cultural, economic and youth initiatives, and healthcare assistance to Palestinians.</p> <p>In 1998 he wrote forewords to four books on the 50th anniversary of Israel\u2019s independence. He also released For the Future of Israel, a series of philosophical conversations with the author Robert Littell. Where other Israeli politicians grudgingly accepted a Palestinian state as inevitable, only Peres argued in Le Monde that it was necessary for Israel\u2019s future. When the new intifada broke out in 2000, polls backed Peres to restore the peace process. In the event, Barak sabotaged his rival\u2019s \u201cvirtual candidacy\u201d, only to lose at the polls himself. Peres emerged as foreign minister under Sharon in a Likud-Labour coalition government. This time Peres was the liberal brake to Sharon\u2019s determinedly rightwing engine. Whether he was an effective brake was another story.</p> <p>Although many Israeli leftists felt outraged at his \u201cbetrayal\u201d, experienced Peres-watchers knew that his personal friendship with Sharon counted for more than ideological congruence. Less charitable souls felt that his overvaulting ambition had once again trumped his principles. Similar charges resurfaced in 2005, when he left Labour to co-found Kadima with Sharon, barely a month after losing the Labour leadership to an outside candidate, Amir Peretz. Peres served as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/ehud-olmert\">Ehud Olmert</a>\u2019s deputy premier after Kadima convincingly won elections in 2006. The following year, by now Israel\u2019s longest serving parliamentarian, he left the Knesset to contest the presidency.</p> <p>As Israel\u2019s ninth president, he helped restore his nation\u2019s battered reputation. He became the first Israeli head of state to address a Muslim state legislature when he spoke to Turkey\u2019s national assembly in November 2007. Turkey and Japan supported his \u201cvalley of peace initiative\u201d for economic revival and joint industrial projects in the West Bank. In 2008 he launched the Israeli Presidential Conference, an annual brainstorming forum which attracted guests including George W Bush, Elie Wiesel, Robert De Niro, Rupert Murdoch and Bernard-Henri L\u00e9vy. In 2009 Peres served as \u201cnational host\u201d for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/pope-benedict-xvi\">Pope Benedict XVI</a>\u2019s visit to Israel. At last he gained the affection of Oriental Jews \u2013 half of Israel\u2019s population \u2013 who had once seen him as an Ashkenazi elitist.</p> <p>Most unusually for an Israeli president, Peres became his nation\u2019s top diplomat. He asked Palestinians and Arab nations to join in \u201ca great journey towards a world built on logic and intellect, not land\u201d. He negotiated directly with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/mahmoud-abbas\">Mahmoud Abbas</a>, president of the Palestinian Authority, on behalf of a taciturn Netanyahu. He placated President Barack Obama when Israeli actions offended the Oval Office. And in 2013 he delivered a video interview beamed from Jerusalem to a security summit in Abu Dhabi for 29 foreign ministers of Arab and Muslim countries. His honours included appointment as honorary GCMG in 2008, award of the US presidential medal of freedom in 2012 and the Congressional gold medal in 2014.</p> <p>Nonetheless, Peres still engendered controversy. In his inaugural presidential speech he bluntly stated that Israel had to \u201cget rid of the territories\u201d. He averred that he had changed his position, not his beliefs. Although many hailed him as a man of vision and peace, Israeli rightists flayed him for playing into the hands of the PLO. Many Likud supporters resented the way he pushed his peace agenda while the foreign minister, Avigdor Lieberman, was persona non grata in most capitals. More than that, his stance seemed to contradict Netanyahu\u2019s policies.</p> <p>For their part, the Israeli left accused Peres of acting as a figleaf for an obdurate Likud administration. They were dismayed when in 2009 he defended Israel\u2019s continuing attack on Gaza. Days later he found himself at the centre of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/jan/30/turkish-prime-minister-gaza-davos\">an unseemly row</a> with the Turkish prime minister <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/recep-tayyip-erdogan\">Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan</a> at the Davos world economic summit as a result. Though Peres\u2019s diplomatic intercession smoothed ruffled feathers, he still warned against a nuclear Iran \u201ctaking over the Middle East\u201d and rejected the critical UN report into the Gaza war. Former liberal allies were perplexed when, that May, he proclaimed newly elected Likud premier Netanyahu a peace pioneer \u2013 an opinion he reversed in 2015 when he blamed Netanyahu (re-elected that year) for talking peace but doing nothing to implement it.</p> <p>\u201cOver the years,\u201d wrote the Israeli historian Ze\u2019ev Sternhell, \u201cShimon Peres \u2026 destroyed everything of value [in Labour].\u201d Other leftists blamed him for initiating with Oslo II the settlement bypass roads that seemed to render a contiguous Palestinian state impossible. Peres repeatedly called Abbas a serious and true partner for peace, even admiring the courage, if not agreeing with the timing, of Abbas\u2019s 2012 UN bid for Palestinian statehood. Yet many Palestinians blamed Peres for saddling them with inferior terms in the Paris economic deal of 1994. Now Israeli critics charged him with abusing the apolitical nature of the presidency.</p> <p>After leaving the presidency in 2014, Peres continued work for his peace centre. When Israeli authorities denied the centre tax-exempt status because it trained doctors from Gaza, the centre suspended its application and continued with its programme, which by 2015 had helped 250 personnel. As late as November 2015, his health now failing, he insisted that Israel faced \u201ceternal war\u201d if there was no Palestinian state.</p> <p>Peres was an intriguingly contradictory figure: a romantic in a cynical age, an Israeli icon with a Polish accent and francophone sensibility, who carried about him the taint (deserved or otherwise) of political chicanery. Unlike holiness, he told <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2013/sep/01/sir-david-frost\">David Frost</a>, politics is built on compromise. Nor was he above taking audacious decisions, as in 1989 when he ordered Mossad to abduct the nuclear whistleblower Mordechai Vanunu from British soil, or in 2002, when he attracted millions to invest in nanotechnology.</p> <p>He certainly brought a touch of aesthetic philosophical discrimination to the world of politics. His books included The Next Step (1965), David\u2019s Sling: The Arming of Israel (1970), Entebbe Diary (1991), The New Middle East (1993), Battling for Peace (1995), The Imaginary Voyage: With Herzl in Israel (2000) and Ben Gurion: A Political Life (2011). Among the numerous biographies of him are Matti Golan\u2019s Road to Peace (1989) and Michael Bar-Zohar\u2019s Shimon Peres (2013).</p> <p>He is survived by his daughter, Zvia, sons, Yonathan and Nehemia, and six grandchildren.</p> <p>\u2022 Shimon Peres, statesman, born 1 August 1923; died 28 September 2016.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 28 September 2016. An earlier version said that Peres was survived by his wife, Sonia. She died in 2011.</p>",

After the 2004 and 2012 convention seasons, both George W Bush and Obama were able to hold onto their convention bumps for a few weeks. (For Bush, his post-convention bump lasted about a month. For Obama, his numbers stayed high for two weeks.)</p> <p>But, in both cases, the candidates\u2019 poll numbers took a hit after the first debate.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/08/polling-debates/\" data-alt=\"How debates affect candidate's poll numbers\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/08/polling-debates/\">How debates affect candidate's poll numbers</a> </figure>  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Despite trailing Bush in the polls for much of the fall of 2004, a majority of viewers polled thought John Kerry won the first debate. The candidates sparred over the war in Iraq for nearly two-thirds of the debate, and Bush\u2019s defenses appeared weak in the face of Kerry\u2019s persistent criticisms. Bush subsequently lost around five points of his polling lead.</p> <p>A similar scene played out again in 2012, between another incumbent, Obama, and Republican challenger Mitt Romney. Despite trailing in the polls, Romney was well prepared for the first debate, and Obama \u2013 often glancing at his notes \u2013 didn\u2019t perform particularly well. More than seven in 10 Americans told Gallup that Romney did a better job, which was reflected in post-debate polls when Obama\u2019s lead decreased by around three points.</p> <p>If Clinton\u2019s current lead holds up by the first debate in late September (which would be a very long post-convention bump indeed), her debate performance could once again change the balance of the race.</p> </blockquote> <p>Clinton\u2019s post-DNC bump had disappeared almost entirely by yesterday, with the latest shows pre-debate showing the pair neck-and-neck. </p> <p>But largely favorable reviews across the board for Clinton\u2019s debate performance may now affect polls - even if that may not reflect the eventual election winner.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57ea8416e4b08ca277ca0bdd\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-27T14:53:34.851Z\">3.53pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Mary J Blige interviews Clinton</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Hip hop queen Mary J Blige interviewed Hillary Clinton for a new show to be unveiled on Apple Music Friday, with a preview showing Blige questioning Clinton about race and singing to her. </p> <p>\u201cA lot of people in my community think Obama was blocked in Congress because he was black.

But he also wisely used his discretion to keep the debate going at times instead of sticking to the somewhat arbitrary 15 minutes allotted for each segment.</p> </blockquote> <p>At the New York Times, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/27/us/politics/lester-holt-moderator.html?smprod=nytcore-ipad&amp;smid=nytcore-ipad-share&amp;_r=0\">Michael M Grynbaum called him</a> the \u201cminimalist moderator\u201d:</p> <blockquote> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>He was silent for minutes at a time, allowing Hillary Clinton and Donald J. Trump to joust and bicker between themselves \u2014 and sometimes talk right over him \u2014 prompting some viewers to wonder if Mr. Holt had left the building.</p> <p>But his reticence as moderator also gave viewers an unfiltered glimpse of the candidates: their views, speaking styles, and reactions under pressure.</p> </blockquote> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://nypost.com/2016/09/26/lester-holt-shows-he-doesnt-know-the-meaning-of-impartial/\">Kyle Smith in the New York Post</a> said Clinton got off easy compared to Trump:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>In the early going, it looked like it was going to be an ideal, Jim Lehrer-style performance from Lester Holt, the \u201cNBC Nightly News\u201d anchor. Lehrer was so boringly nonpartisan, so unwilling to play gotcha that he was always hotly in demand to moderate debates. For the first half or so, Holt gave simple, broad, open-ended questions and let the candidates go at it. He didn\u2019t venture into live fact-checking, didn\u2019t much quarrel with the nominees, didn\u2019t ask persnickety questions... But in the last half of the show, Holt started going after Trump. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57ea76a0e4b08ca277ca0b96\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-27T13:49:23.759Z\">2.49pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Two of the country\u2019s major publications are running campaign ads across their debate coverage this morning.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/nataliewsj/status/780761459785687040\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">WSJ and the Washington Post right now, and the banner ads running on top.

Didn\u2019t ask about her foundation,\u201d said Trump.</p> <p>He also echoed his claim made after the debate last night, that after Clinton grilled him on his treatment of women, including former Miss Universe winner Alicia Machado, he wanted to bring up Bill Clinton\u2019s extramarital affairs but didn\u2019t out of respect for their daughter Chelsea Clinton.</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t feel comfortable doing it with Chelsea in the room,\u201d said Trump.</p> <p>But he said he might mention the affairs in the next debate. \u201cI may hit her harder in certain ways.

Does he really think these patriotic Americans are not smart? He\u2019s a guy who is proud of a phrase he made famous: \u201cYou\u2019re fired.\u201d </p> </blockquote> <h2>In today\u2019s campaign movements:</h2> <p>Trump is off to Melbourne, Florida, for a rally tonight (reporter Ben Jacobs will be there). His VP pick Mike Pence was supposed to hold and event in Wisconsin, but that\u2019s since been cancelled. Clinton\u2019s hosting a rally in Raleigh, North Carolina, and has her surrogates out in force today. Her VP pick Tim Kaine has a canvass kickoff in Orlando, while husband Bill is hosting events in Ohio. Joe Biden will speak at a rally in Philadelphia.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-09-27T13:10:06.729Z\">at 2.10pm BST</time></p>  </div>"

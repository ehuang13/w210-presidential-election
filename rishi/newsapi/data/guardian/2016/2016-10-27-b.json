  "<p>Scarred by the 2015 general election and humbled by the Brexit vote, it\u2019s hardly surprising that many in the British political and media class continue to hedge their bets on the 2016 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-elections-2016\" title=\"\">US presidential election</a>, even as the climax of the contest draws near. The instinct for caution is understandable. These have been chastening times in British politics. No one wants to make three wrong calls in a row.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2016/oct/27/trump-clinton-news-vote-election-2016\">Michelle Obama campaigns with Clinton as Trump hits Ohio \u2013 election live</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In the case of the US election, however, there is also an uneasy self-awareness of something close to groupthink. Unlike the UK general election or the EU referendum, where divisions within the political and media class were real and deep, there is something close to unanimity about British antipathy to Donald Trump. You have to be intensely anti-American or anti-Clinton \u2013 which some are \u2013 to positively wish a Trump victory on America and the world.</p> <p>This helps to explain, though not to excuse, the reluctance to face the overwhelming probability about the US presidential contest. That probability is that Hillary Clinton, with all her strengths and weaknesses, is going to win on 8&#xa0;November, and is quite possibly going to win by a very large margin. Unless something quite exceptional and so far wholly undetected is happening \u2013 the instinct for bet-hedging, you see, is hard to shake off even here \u2013 Clinton will be taking over the White House in January.</p> <p>The clearest and most immediate evidence is in the opinion polls, which consistently show Clinton ahead in the popular vote. That process has been strengthened by the televised debates and, in particular by the final debate, which Clinton clearly won, and in which Trump\u2019s hostility to women seems to have had a lasting mobilisation impact.</p> <p>That generally strong Clinton lead is also buttressed by local polling in the states where victory is essential under America\u2019s electoral college system. With&#xa0;occasional exceptions, these polls show Clinton on course for a large electoral college win. Dismiss the polls if you like. But the fact that Trump and his running mate Mike Pence are spending time campaigning in states such as North Carolina and Utah shows that they are having to defend their own territories rather than attack in Clinton\u2019s.</p> <p>All this may change, of course. It\u2019s&#xa0;the&#xa0;safest prediction in the book to say that the contest will narrow in the final days. But the general likelihood is surely&#xa0;that it will not narrow much. By this stage in 2012, only 9% of voters had not made up their minds. It seems unlikely that the proportion would be much different in such a bitterly contested election as this one has been. The big unpredictability this time is voter turnout. If Trump brings lots of new voters to the polls, and at the same time&#xa0;Clinton fails to bring significant parts of the Obama coalition to them, then an upset \u2013 which at this stage would be a much tighter Clinton win, not a Trump win \u2013 might just happen.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/oct/20/presidential-debate-highlights-clinton-and-trumps-final-face-off-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/58aff\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2822379\"            data-video-name=\"Presidential debate highlights: Clinton and Trump's final face-off \u2013\u00a0video\"            data-video-provider=\"Reuters / AP\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-58086051e4b055209adaf6c9\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/10/20/161020Debatesub_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/10/20/161020Debatesub_V4.webm\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/10/20/161020Debatesub.m3u8\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/oct/20/presidential-debate-highlights-clinton-and-trumps-final-face-off-video\">Presidential debate highlights: Clinton and Trump\u2019s final face-off \u2013 video</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Even in an election as bitter as this one, the claim that lots of states are \u201cup for grabs\u201d is less true than ever. Since 1992, 31 of America\u2019s 50 states have voted consistently in every presidential contest. In most modern US elections, people who consider themselves Democrats vote Democratic, while an equally large proportion of people who consider themselves Republicans vote Republican. A lot is always written at this stage in the campaign about the importance of self-described independents, but these voters tend to lean either Democratic or Republican, and to vote the way they lean too. One estimate puts the proportion of pure independents at only 5%. The veteran poll analyst Charlie Cook says that most voters are already \u201cbaked into the cake\u201d.</p> <p>Part of that is simply because of long-established demographic changes that advantage the Democrats. When Bill Clinton won in 1992, white voters cast 87% of the total vote. By the time of Barack Obama\u2019s re-election in 2012, just 20 years later, the white share had fallen to 72%. One prediction says it will be 70% in November. If each demographic group votes the same way in 2016 as in 2012, the Democratic lead will rise by about 1.5%. Trump has done nothing to combat this and plenty to feed it. In light of Trump\u2019s attacks on women during the campaign, it seems likely that an even higher proportion of white women voters will move into the Democratic column too.</p> <p>All this appears to be entirely consistent with the much discussed recent book <a href=\"http://press.princeton.edu/titles/10671.html\" title=\"\">Democracy for Realists</a> by the American political scientists Christopher Achen and Larry Bartels. They argue that elections are not determined by voters\u2019 policy preferences or ideologies, as many of us like to think, but \u201con the basis of who they are \u2013 their social identities\u201d. Certainly the Achen-Bartels thesis chimes with the Brexit vote in Britain. In America, though, where race and ethnicity are such important components of social identities, but not the only ones, Trump\u2019s consistent attempt to appeal to white male voters and alienate minority and female voters does not look like a winning strategy at all; indeed quite the reverse.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/membership/2016/oct/27/middletown-trump-muncie-clinton\">The view from Middletown: 'Trump speaks to us in a way other people don\u2019t'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The immediate question, 12 days from the election, is less whether Clinton will win the presidency. It is more whether she can manage to persuade enough voters to elect a Congress that can work with her, not against her, as has been Obama\u2019s fate for the past six years. The Democrats stand a good chance of winning the four seats necessary \u2013 Illinois, Wisconsin and two from seven other toss-up states \u2013 to regain control of the Senate (where 34 of the 100 seats are up for election). However, control of the House of Representatives (where all 435 members are contested but incumbency is frequently decisive) seems likely to remain in Republican hands. All this suggests that Clinton will not have an easy presidency, even in the first two years, unless Republicans allow that to happen. Since Republicans expect to make gains in the 2018 midterms, they have little incentive to do that.</p> <p>The Republican pollster Frank Luntz&#xa0;\u2013 whom Trump described on Twitter as \u201ca total clown \u2026 a low-class slob\u201d \u2013 said that if the campaign this autumn were about Trump, then Clinton would win; if it were&#xa0;about Clinton, then Trump could pull it off. Overwhelmingly, the campaign has proved to be about Trump. But that\u2019s now about to change.</p> <p>Increasingly, Donald Trump looks like&#xa0;a more incidental figure, preoccupied with his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/26/donald-trump-opens-international-hotel-campaign-trail-brand\" title=\"\">hotels</a> and his media ambitions. The big question in American politics is not whether Hillary Clinton will be president. It is what kind&#xa0;of president she is likely to be.</p>",
  "<p>At last, child refugees are being rescued from the squalor and danger of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/23/fear-stalks-final-hours-calais-camp\" title=\"\">the Calais camp</a> and brought to Britain. But the process has taken far too long; and even now it is still too slow. This evening, 24 hours after the French government declared \u201cjob done\u201d, the home secretary was sending angry messages to her opposite number to demand that children left to sleep rough on the first night were now properly protected. The Home Office is finally grinding into action. But the inaction of both London and Paris, allowing the camp to fester for years, has meant it metastasised into a crisis of inhumanity, devastating for its victims and shaming for the British government.</p> <p>Many of the people who cross Europe to Calais do so to come to Britain, a country where many have family, where they share a language, and think they have the best chance of getting a job or an education. They are only a tiny number compared with the thousands who find refuge in Germany and Sweden. But the British government still insists that asylum seekers must apply in the first safe country they reach. It argues that admitting asylum seekers through Calais acts as a pull factor, attracting even young and vulnerable children to make a perilous journey from which only people smugglers benefit.</p> <p>Charities that work in the camps and try to help people with their paperwork believe the inertia comes from the very top of the British government. Even after the Home Office was forced by parliament earlier this year to accept the Dubs amendment allowing in as many as 3,000 unaccompanied minors without family ties in the UK, the decision was taken to work in Greece and Italy among newly arrived refugees, rather than in Calais. While Yvette Cooper, now chair of the home affairs committee, argued that each country should take half the children and teenagers, progress remained near-invisible. Only this month, as domestic political pressure <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/24/french-presidential-election-brexit-closure-calais-refugee-camp\" title=\"\">embarrassed French politicians into bulldozing the camp and dispersing its occupants</a>, has the Home Office agreed to take children under the Dubs deal along with those with British family.</p> <p>So for months over the summer, when children could have been interviewed and assessed and their British families contacted and visited, nothing at all happened. At the end of August the new home secretary Amber Rudd met her opposite number Bernard Cazeneuve and they <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/30/uk-plays-down-calais-border-tensions-with-critical-ally-france\" title=\"\">reaffirmed their commitment</a> to the Le Touquet agreement, allowing UK immigration officials to work in France \u2013 politically helpful for Britain, but little help to the thousands of migrants. Only a fortnight ago, with the demolition of the camp now scheduled, was there a further meeting at which Ms Rudd promised to take 300 children from the camp regardless of family ties. A week later, Mr Cazeneuve wrote <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/18/uk-french-blame-game-over-calais-camp-must-end-warns-cazeneuve\" title=\"\">a stinging comment article </a>for the Guardian denouncing Britain\u2019s \u201cselfish\u201d policy and demanding that it take responsibility for the misery of the Calais camp. That is a charge few even of the government\u2019s most vehement critics would accept. Yet if Britain is not to blame for the lack of safeguarding for children in the camp, particularly teenage girls, nor for the squalor of the conditions, it is true that first Mrs May and then Ms Rudd, desperate to isolate the UK from the global refugee crisis, failed to act for far too long.</p> <p>The Home Office knows how to do this. Campaigners are appreciative of the management (if not the scale) of the scheme to take 20,000 vulnerable Syrians identified and processed in camps neighbouring the country. That was the result of designating a responsible minister, who assembled a team of officials to tackle the inevitable obstacles. Dealing with Calais has appeared to be a much more haphazard process. Professionals like <a href=\"http://www.tactcare.org.uk/about-us/?gclid=CjwKEAjwy8bABRD5osXMovTHpmQSJACfZY0FikpoScho1g7X7ZSoGSHkShKbh4pRsdJy7rkNMPw0_BoC6yDw_wcB\" title=\"\">The Adolescent and Children\u2019s Trust</a>, a charitable fostering and adoption agency, wonder why officials and social workers were not sent out together weeks ago to identify lone child refugees, find out how many there were, and start the process of assessing them. Councils complain that not enough money has been allowed to support the children; they fear the money will run out after this financial year. And while in the past couple of weeks real effort has gone into speeding up the process, the Home Office lacked even reliable figures for the number of unaccompanied minors it wanted to find \u2013 and still seems uncertain how many have arrived. A start has been made. Children and teenagers can at last imagine a future. But it began too late; it has taken too long. And much still remains to be done.</p>",

Honey G, as she keeps telling us, is the real deal.</p> <p>It\u2019s hard to know what to make of all this. The X Factor always has a novelty act \u2013 just like it always has a plain-faced Scottish boy, a girl who cries ugly when she goes through each week, a boyband that keeps River Island in business through bomber jacket expenses alone, and an exceptionally talented vocalist who, sadly, is over 25, so can\u2019t win.

She has held effortlessly on as three actual vocalists toppled and fell.

There is another person who, we can comfortably say, \u201ckeeps offending minorities while hamfistedly trying to reach out to minorities\u201d. There is another person who has won over just the right numbers of a voting public to keep afloat in a race they are in no way qualified to be running in.</p> <p>Do you see where I am going with this? Honey G, X Factor novelty and the bizarre cultural touchstone we never knew we needed to bring 2016 to a close, is the British Donald Trump. That is the fact we all have to deal with now. And we can map out how G is going to fare in the competition based on how Trump does in the election:</p> <p>Option 1: Trump loses, gives some sort of disgraceful losing speech, yells so much his body turns around on the spot, gets into a helicopter and furiously shoots into the sky while unfurling a banner reading \u201cHILLARY CROOKEDTON\u201d and is last seen sprinting naked around his own golf course in Scotland. This is the option we can reasonably hope for, and see it easily mapped on to Honey G\u2019s X Factor career: she will get cleanly voted out with about six weeks to go, yell \u201cWEEZY\u201d slightly too close to a microphone so much that Dermot O\u2019Leary has to apologise for any viewers offended at home, then fade away into nothing again, recruiting anonymously against the dying of the sun.</p> <p>Option 2: Trump wins, flipping two majestic birds into the air as sparklers erupt around him, gets into a helicopter and furiously shoots into the sky while unfurling a banner reading \u201cHILLARY CROOKEDTON\u201d, gives every presidential press conference from the Apprentice US boardroom, and somehow drives America into the sea. And this is the one we have to fear, for how it will translate to Honey G \u2013 she walks stiff-legged to the X Factor win, her Gilford ego and G id fusing in one perfect moment of victory, and, long story short, this ends with Honey G having her hands on the nuclear code and doing a \u201cWhen I say \u2018bomb\u2019, you say \u2018Russia\u2019\u201d call-and-response to a rapt studio audience. This is the bad path.</p> <p>Trump and G are inextricably linked, now, because they are the same person spread across two mortal vessels. We must work together on this one. None of us can allow Option 2 to happen.</p>",

Nevertheless, Russian state media has made no secret of its preference for Trump, and has suggested the election may be rigged in Hillary Clinton\u2019s favour.<br></p> <p>Putin also praised Trump\u2019s style and campaign: \u201cHe chose his own way of reaching voters\u2019 hearts. Of course he\u2019s behaving extravagantly, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s necessarily without reason. I think he is representing the interests of that part of the American electorate, and it\u2019s a significant part, that is tired of the same elite who have been in power for decades. He is representing the interests of ordinary people.\u201d </p> <p>At the same time, he claimed there was little difference between Trump and Clinton: \u201cIf you look at the programmes of the different candidates, you get the feeling that they are all tailored in the same way, and that the differences between them are insignificant, and in reality there are no differences.\u201d</p> <p>Putin said the US had a number of problems, including huge debt and gun crime, and that politicians had no answers. \u201cThere is nothing to calm society with, and so it\u2019s easier to distract people with supposed Russian hackers, spies and agents of interest.\u201d<br></p>",
  "<p>From the moment that Donald Trump denied, in a nationally televised presidential debate, that he had ever groped or kissed a woman without her permission, it was only a matter of time before <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/22/trump-news-porn-star-jessica-drake-gloria-allred\">Gloria Allred got involved</a>. </p> <p>An ambulance chaser to her critics, a righteous crusader to her admirers, the 75-year-old women\u2019s rights attorney is never far when a scandal of this nature bursts into national view.

Her involvement has placed Allred back in familiar territory: holding court at one of her trademark press conferences, surrounded by a phalanx of news crews.</p> <p>Politics is her strong suit. Allred tanked Meg Whitman\u2019s bid for California governor when she announced that Whitman\u2019s former nanny would be suing for unpaid wages. And she fanned the flames engulfing Herman Cain\u2019s presidential campaign when she introduced a woman who claimed that Cain once grabbed her head, forced it toward his crotch, and leered, \u201cYou want a job, right?\u201d </p> <p>But the California attorney has also pursued causes that have chagrined her fellow feminists. It was not so long ago that Allred\u2019s press conferences starred Tiger Woods\u2019 ex-girlfriend or a woman who had an online flirtation with Anthony Weiner. Allred <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2010/12/tabloid-feminist/308300/\">proclaimed</a> that Woods\u2019 ex was \u201ca victim because he broke her heart\u201d.<br></p> <p>\u201cSome of her causes are incredibly worthy,\u201d the writer Emily Bazelon <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/20/fashion/20ALLRED.html?_r=0\">told the New York Times</a>. \u201cBut her way of going about it makes me cringe.\u201d</p> <p>I spoke with Allred this week about her supposed baggage, Trump\u2019s accusers, the cultural shifts around rape and sexual assault and what young women may not understand about Hillary Rodham Clinton.</p> <p>Our conversation took place in two, 15-minute bursts. \u201cI just have so many people trying to contact me,\u201d she said as she excused herself from our first conversation. \u201cBasically, women about Trump. And I have to get back to them.\u201d How many? \u201cMany.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Supposedly we\u2019re in a moment where the culture and the media is much less suspicious of women who say they\u2019ve been raped or assaulted or harassed in the workplace. Less suspicious of people like your clients.</strong></p> <p>Yes and no. Someone just sent me a rape case. And in that case, the jury, when they were discussing with the prosecutor afterwards why they voted the way they did on the case, some of the jurors, according to the prosecutors, said the fact that the woman said \u201cno\u201d was not enough.</p> <p>If a woman does say \u201cno,\u201d why would that not be enough? I mean, if \u201cno\u201d is not enough to indicate a lack of consent, what does a woman have to do? </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/oct/18/donald-trump-sexual-allegations-nine-women-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/583qb\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2817569\"            data-video-name=\"Eleven women who have accused Trump of sexual misconduct \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"Guardian, Access Hollywood, AP, CNN, Getty Images, NBC, Reuters, Palm Beach Post\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-58066cf1e4b0cd26ff71e6cc\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/10/24/161024women_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/10/24/161024women.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/10/24/161024women_KP-2166838.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/oct/18/donald-trump-sexual-allegations-nine-women-video\">Eleven women who have accused Trump of sexual misconduct</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p><strong>So where do you think some of this optimism comes from, this idea that it\u2019s getting better?</strong></p> <p>Maybe it\u2019s the old two steps forward, one step backwards? A step forward is some of the laws that have been passed in some states, what we call the yes-means-yes laws. </p> <p>I\u2019ve also been active on working to change the laws, now in three states, to eliminate the statute of limitations for the criminal prosecution of rape and sexual assault. To eliminate that arbitrary time period. That\u2019s a step forward because it means that more women can have access to justice. But it\u2019s no guarantee.</p> <p><strong>You\u2019re a lawyer, but you said once that women \u201chave to be heard in the court of public opinion as well as in the actual courts\u201d.

I do this case by case. We settle many, many cases confidentially. No one except the parties and the lawyers will ever know that there even was an allegation.<strong><br></strong></p> <p><strong>And the women accusing Trump \u2013 what goes into the decision to have those big, trademark press conferences?</strong></p> <p>Mr Trump\u2019s own words. I won\u2019t use the P-word, but he did. That, and then his denial. I knew, as soon as I heard those words, the denial in the debate, that women would start contacting me and want to come forward. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/us-membership/free.html\" data-alt=\"membership callout\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/us-membership/free.html\">membership callout</a> </figure>  <p>Actually, many women contacted me even prior to the release of the Access Hollywood tape. They just wanted me to know what Mr Trump had done. </p> <p><strong>The accusations being made in these press conferences become news almost instantaneously. How is your office vetting these claims before you make them public?</strong></p> <p>We have spoken to individuals who are potential witnesses, who corroborate that at approximately the time or at some point after the incident occurred, not too long thereafter, they actually told one or more people about what happened.</p> <p><strong>Your critics see you as a serial attention-seeker. And that jibes with Trump\u2019s claim \u2013 and this is how a lot of people dismiss claims of assault \u2013 that these women are lying for their \u201c10 minutes of fame\u201d. Do you think your involvement with these stories could be seen as compromising?</strong></p> <p>It\u2019s hard to think of anyone who wants more fame than Mr Trump.</p> <p><strong>Well, yes.</strong></p> <p>But I don\u2019t call him an attention-seeker. I just call him a bully. Having said that, some of the women who came out before I did a press conference, they\u2019ve been labelled all kinds of things by Trump supporters. As Mr Trump said early on in his campaign, he could shoot someone on Fifth Avenue and his supporters would still support him. </p> <p><strong>This is something that Emily Bazelon <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/20/fashion/20ALLRED.html\">said about you</a>, I believe around the time that you were hosting press conferences with Tiger Woods\u2019 ex-girlfriends, who weren\u2019t, to my memory, accusing him of a crime: \u201cSome of her causes are incredibly worthy, but her way of going about it makes me cringe.\u201d Why do you think you make this other feminist cringe? </strong></p> <p>I don\u2019t know who Emily Bazelon is.

Do you notice a generational divide among women in how excited they are to see the first woman elected president, potentially?</strong></p> <p>I\u2019m not a pollster. I will say this: I think that there are many women, older women, who really understand how important it is that we have a woman president. </p> <p>Four years from now, and I think of this often, it will be 2020. And Hillary Rodham Clinton \u2013 if, as, and when she\u2019s elected in November \u2013 will still be president. And in that year we will mark the 100th anniversary of women\u2019s winning the right to vote in the United States. </p> <p>That will be so important. And yes, I believe that we do, as mothers, as grandmothers, understand the importance of having a woman in the White House. Not only for the purposes of what I\u2019ll call herstory, but as an inspiration for our daughters. And it\u2019s just long overdue. </p> <p><strong>Is \u201cherstory\u201d really your preferred word for history?</strong></p> <p>Yes!</p> <p><strong>Really?</strong></p> <p>Now it is. If she wins, she really is going to be making herstory.</p> <p><strong>You referred to Hillary Clinton as Hillary Rodham Clinton. Which I love, I don\u2019t see many people referring to her using her maiden name. Is that a conscious choice?</strong></p> <p>Yes. At some point when she was in Arkansas, after she got married, she added her married name. She\u2019s chosen to keep both names. And I\u2019m glad she did. She\u2019s saying, consider me on my own merits. </p> <p>I went to an all-girls high school, and many of these girls went on to be accomplished leaders and very successful. When it\u2019s time for a reunion, it\u2019s difficult to find some of these girls, because some of them have shed the only name we knew them by.</p> <p><strong>A colleague of mine keeps saying she\u2019s surprised no one is selling shirts that just read \u201cHillary Rodham\u201d. </strong></p> <p>Yes! I like it. Listen, part of why I admire her is because I have a small sense of what she\u2019s endured. She has taken all of this criticism. That\u2019s the price you pay for standing up for women\u2019s rights, which is a statement by itself. Her election will be a message to our daughters: yYou too can overcome. I think this is herstoric and I\u2019m so excited.</p> <p><strong>I\u2019m sorry, did you say herstoric or historic?</strong> </p> <p>It\u2019s herstoric.</p> <p><strong>The Obama presidency unleashed in many ways a racist backlash. Do you think a Hillary Clinton presidency could have the potential to do the same for sexism?</strong></p> <p>There are some people who think that women should be denied opportunities because of their gender. But I think she\u2019s going to show, through deeds, not just words, what a president can be. For many of the misogynists and male chauvinists out there, just experiencing a woman in power hopefully will help to eliminate some of those stereotypes. </p> <p><strong>What\u2019s your level of optimism?</strong></p> <p>There will still be some who will cling to the gender stereotypes and traditional gender roles. But this is it. We\u2019re moving ahead. I\u2019ve already made my reservations for the inauguration.

They are different for every search engine, highly secret and determine the significance or ranking of a web page.</p> <p>Merkel has joined a growing number of critics who have highlighted the dangers of receiving information that confirms an existing opinion or is recommended by people with similar ideas.</p> <p>\u201cThis is a development that we need to pay careful attention to,\u201d she told the conference, adding that a healthy democracy was dependent on people being confronted by opposing ideas.</p> <p>\u201cThe big internet platforms, through their algorithms, have become an eye of a needle which diverse media must pass through [to access their users],\u201d she said.</p> <p>There has been increasing concern about so-called filter bubbles and echo chambers \u2013 the result of an internet search in which an algorithm supposes the information someone would like to see based on previous searches, as well as information it might have about their location or preferences \u2013 in the light of the growing strength of populist movements in Europe, the Brexit vote in the UK and the rise of Donald Trump in the US.

The concern that the phenomenon of narrow debate which has been seen during the US presidential campaign might be replicated in Germany is one shared across Germany\u2019s established parties.</p> <p>Merkel called the issue a \u201cchallenge not just for political parties but for society as a whole\u201d. If it was unclear what mechanisms were being used, it could \u201clead to a distortion of how people perceive things\u201d, she said.</p> <p>Thomas Jarzombek, the digital policy spokesperson of Merkel\u2019s Christian Democratic Union, <a href=\"http://www.spiegel.de/netzwelt/netzpolitik/angela-merkel-warum-die-kanzlerin-an-die-algorithmen-von-facebook-will-a-1118365.html\">told Spiegel Online </a> he did not think she was advocating that companies such as Google and Facebook should disclose company secrets, \u201cbut we do need more information from these operators as to how their algorithms function generally speaking\u201d.</p> <p>A cross-party working group is compiling recommendations urging more openness by internet platforms, including making details on how their algorithms collect, choose, evaluate and present information available to users. Its recommendations will be sent to Brussels, for the EU digital commissioner G\u00fcnther Oettinger to work them into guidelines by next year.

Just like the main character, they think America was greater in an idealized past that no longer exists. They make fun of PC culture, diversity and inclusion. They take stabs at the younger generation for getting trophies just for participating and for thinking that work should be fun. Yeah, this show would be perfect for Trump.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/oct/24/best-fall-tv-amazon-hbo\">This week's best TV: Good Girls Revolt, The Great Indoors and Charlie Brown</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The red hat surrogate is Jack Gordon (Joel McHale) a 40-ish adventure reporter. His boss Roland (Stephen Fry) calls him in from summiting Denali and wrestling with wolf cubs in Siberia because the outdoors magazine he works for is folding its print edition and Jack has been reassigned to the digital team. This then leads to him picking on job titles like \u201conline content curator\u201d, the fact that his colleagues expect promotions after six weeks and that everyone seems to pull out their phones rather than \u201clive in the moment\u201d. The pilot episode packs in just about every other cliche about millennials except that they\u2019re willing to pay $6 for a can of PBR just to seem cool. Oh, wait. That one is in there too. </p> <p>While Jack\u2019s co-workers \u2013 the bumbling Clark (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) who is in love with Jack, the disaffected Emma (Christine Ko), and the ambiguously gay Mason (Shaun Brown) \u2013 get in plenty of good digs on Clark\u2019s account, it always seems like the show is taking his side. Maybe it\u2019s because the multi-camera format, especially on an older-skewing network like CBS, seems like just as much of a relic as Clark that it seems natural it would side with him. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMij2R-XL9E\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/sMij2R-XL9E?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p> Just like Trump voters take solace in his rhetoric, to everyone else it\u2019s anathema. Jack is just as wrong as the Trump voters. He makes fun of his new team because they\u2019d rather post articles about the best tools to have in the zombie apocalypse or Five Things to Do in a Bear Attack. Jack wants to keep publishing stories about sleeping out in tents in the wild and other amorphous topics. Show creator Mike Gibbons (Tosh.0) seems to agree with Jack\u2019s belief in putting more weight on the \u201cserious journalism\u201d than the popular listicles. However, anyone with any familiarity with digital media will tell you that Five Things to Do in a Bear Attack is going toattract way more clicks than whatever vague story Jack is pitching.</p> <p>The only saving grace that keeps Jack from being as loathsome as all the Joe the Plumber types shouting \u201cBuild that wall!\u201d is that he is played by McHale, whose charisma and dexterity with a withering verbal attack can\u2019t be undone by the toothless and overused comedy in the pilot. </p> <p>The second episode sees Jack\u2019s young colleagues help him navigate the world of online dating. While the old dog does learn some new tricks thanks to the twentysomethings in the office, it\u2019s still the old-fashioned skills that help get him out of a jam. </p> <p> The gulf between the younger generation and those that are trying to fit into their world is fertile ground for comedy and there are definitely some great lines sprinkled throughout.

  "<p>The west risks breaching <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/16/west-failing-deliver-nuclear-deal-promises-iran-vice-president-ali-akbar-salehi\">the landmark nuclear agreement</a> if it fails to give Iran proper access to the international financial system, a former British ambassador to Iran has argued.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Sir Richard Dalton, who served in Tehran between 2003 and 2006, said <a href=\"http://tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/03068374.2016.1225896\">in a report published this week</a> in the journal of the Royal Society of Asian Affairs in London that the US and its allies had made \u201csome potentially significant mistakes\u201d in respect to reconnecting Iran to global banks after the deal. </p> <p>Hassan Rouhani, under pressure to show tangible benefits of the lifting of sanctions to Iranians before the next presidential vote in 2017, complained at the UN in September that the US was failing to fulfil its obligations. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>The Iranian president\u2019s comments were echoed by the head of the country\u2019s Atomic Energy Organisation, Ali Akbar Salehi, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/16/west-failing-deliver-nuclear-deal-promises-iran-vice-president-ali-akbar-salehi\">who told the Guardian last month</a> that \u201cthere are hints to do away [with] or to rewrite the deal, and on the other hand to unilaterally impose excessive oversighting and overcompliance to the point of Iran\u2019s discouragement and ultimate submission.\u201d</p> <p>Dalton\u2019s article, published on the<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/18/iran-deal-adoption-day-conditional-sanctions-waivers\"> first anniversary of the nuclear deal coming into effect</a>, stated that the nuclear deal was the product of diplomacy. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Noting that the nuclear agreement would only endure \u201cif everyone works at it\u201d, Dalton wrote that \u201ccommon sense suggests that, if the situation is not appreciably better later in the year, it will be impossible for the US and its partners to argue credibly that they are not in breach of\u201d the nuclear deal, which is known in Iran by the acronym Barjam. </p> <p>According to Dalton, the US and its partners have notably failed to re-authorise Iran\u2019s access to U-turn transactions [used by Iranian banks to avoid US sanctions] in dollars, or to reassure non-US banks on handling Iranian payments, or to give general licences allowing non-US entities to use US software in their businesses dealings in Iran. Banks have remained reluctant to enter Iran <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/12/us-and-uk-urge-banks-to-do-business-with-iran\">despite attempts</a> by the US secretary of state, John Kerry, and his European counterparts. </p> <p>Among other impediments are \u201cunwillingness [by the west], apparently, to use governmental influence with state-owned banks to get them to help carry out government policy\u201d such as \u201cproviding clearing facilities in London\u201d, Dalton said. <br></p> <p>The ongoing banking difficulties have prevented Iran from capitalising on interest shown by western businesses in returning to the country, or finalising lucrative deals with the west, such as the purchase of planes from Airbus and Boeing. Iran is also partly to blame because it does not have adequate regulations on transparency, anti-corruption and money laundering.</p> <p>Esfandyar Batmanghelidj, founder of the Europe-Iran Forum business conference series, said the mood in Tehran was mixed. \u201cOn one hand, major multinationals like Siemens, Peugeot, Unilever and Vodafone have signalled ambitious plans for Iran, generating optimism in Iran\u2019s business community,\u201d he told the Guardian. \u201cOn the other hand, there are frustrating gaps in the US Office of Foreign Assets Control\u2019s licensing policy. OFAC has issued so-called \u2018general licences\u2019 to help open the door for non-US companies to trade with Iran, but these provisions use broad language and do not fully account for the complexity of trade and investment by multinational companies.\u201d</p> <p>Dalton served in the British Foreign Office for more than 35 years and was among a group of former western ambassadors to Tehran <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/jun/09/iran-nuclear-power-un-threat-peace\">who co-penned an article in 2011</a> saying there was \u201cno evidence that the country is building nuclear weapons\u201d and urging dialogue. He is currently an associate fellow at the London thinktank Chatham House.</p> <p>Dalton predicted that the nuclear agreement would last \u201cprovided that mutual benefit is delivered in practice\u201d and that the US \u201cuses its power wisely\u201d. Iran would not be the first to renege, he argued, saying that \u201cthe overwhelming interest of Iran is to comply\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThe nuclear deal will stick, subject to US policy. And even if a Republican wins in the US, it is not a foregone conclusion that a candidates\u2019 hostility to perceived past \u2018concessions\u2019 to Iran would translate into active sabotage of the deal \u2013 it is too obviously a good agreement for US, regional and world security against the spread of nuclear weapons.\u201d A Donald Trump presidency would be unlikely to change that, he said. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>With Iran\u2019s own elections scheduled for May, the moderate Rouhani faces a tough time ahead. \u201cHigh expectations in Iran of economic progress have not been realised. Disappointment has set in and criticism of the limited benefits that have accrued to Iran by the supreme leader and by President Rouhani\u2019s opponents is rising in intensity; 2017 will see a presidential election in Iran and the right scent Rouhani\u2019s blood.\u201d<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Economically, Dalton viewed Iran as an emerging Bric country, alongside newly advanced economies such as Brazil and India. \u201cThey have a $1.4tn diversified economy, growing at some 4-5%, with a backlog of investment in all sectors, a reforming government (for the next year at least) and a well-educated population (total 80 million) striving to take advantage of the country\u2019s improved prospects,\u201d he observed. \u201cCrude production will soon go above 4m barrels per day. The oil minister projects a production capacity of 4.8m barrels per day within five years.\u201d<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>On the regional context, Dalton wrote that \u201cwe should compare [Iran] not with post-Ottoman, post-imperial Egypt or Saudi Arabia, but with Russia and other Asian powers.\u201d </p>",
  "<p>In Little Havana, a vibrant Latino neighborhood just west of downtown Miami, a queue of a couple of dozen prospective voters had formed outside one of Hillary Clinton\u2019s field offices.</p> \n<p>Sandwiched between an insurance company and immigration counsel office, the group had arrived for tickets to a free Jennifer Lopez concert. But there was one caveat: to attend the Saturday evening show, at Bayfront Park on Miami\u2019s Biscayne Bay, fans were first required to visit a Clinton campaign field office.</p> \n<p>It was one of the many creative ways in which the Democratic nominee\u2019s campaign was seeking to engage likely voters in the critical battleground of Florida, a state with a key role in determining whether Clinton or her Republican opponent Donald Trump is elected on 8 November as the next president of the United States.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/08/state-factboxes/?id=FL\" data-alt=\"Florida\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/08/state-factboxes/?id=FL\">Florida</a> \n</figure> \n<p>Inside this modest campaign space, one of 82 Clinton field offices in the Sunshine State, yellow-painted walls bore signs that read phrases such as \u201cJuntos Se Puede\u201d (Together We Can) and \u201cWhy build a wall against Hispanics when they built this country?\u201d</p> \n<p>\u201cEnglish or Spanish?\u201d a volunteer asked as two sisters stepped into the office hoping to secure a pair of concert tickets. \u201cSpanish,\u201d they responded.</p> \n<p>Azalia and Lucia Rodriguez, both US citizens originally from Nicaragua, had already made up their mind. Trump had hit a nerve, they said, within Florida\u2019s sprawling Hispanic community.</p> \n<p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t vote, that\u2019s an extra vote for Trump,\u201d said Lucia, a 19-year-old college student. \u201cI have family members that might be deported, and just to be safe I wouldn\u2019t vote for him.\u201d</p> \n<p>Azalia, a 27-year-old in real estate, put it even more bluntly when asked why she was voting for Clinton: \u201cWell, I\u2019m Hispanic and I don\u2019t like what Trump says.\u201d</p> \n<p>Turnout among Hispanic voters might sway the outcome of the election in a state where one of the fastest-growing demographics in the country holds substantial influence. A half-dozen volunteers worked the phones in both English and Spanish, targeting a list of likely Clinton supporters while making a strong push for the early voting process that began on 24 October.</p> \n<p>The Obama campaign worked out of the same office in 2012, recognizing a shift in demographics. While the Cubans who dominated the area typically voted Republican, a younger generation has in recent years leaned Democratic; and non-Cuban Hispanics, a reliably Democratic voting bloc, also increasingly live in the area.</p> \n<p>In 2000, a controversial recount in Florida determined whether Al Gore or George W Bush would become president. Sixteen years later, the state is still vital terrain in the presidential race \u2013 Trump, trailing Clinton in other must-win swing states, needs to secure the state\u2019s 29 electoral votes to have a path to victory.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom element--supporting\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"a0abf86a-cf7d-402f-a24a-7e2898260047\" data-atom-type=\"explainer\"> \n  <div>\n   <figure class=\"element element-explainer element-atom\" data-display-type=\"flat\"> \n    <h1>How will the election be decided? </h1> \n    <div>\n     <p>The president is chosen through the electoral college, in which each state is assigned a \n      <gu-note title=\"Vicky Frost 22/9/2016 at 12:21\" data-note-edited-by=\"Vicky Frost\" data-note-edited-date=\"2016-09-22T11:21:30.549Z\" data-click-action=\"collapse\" data-note-id=\"80ca109a-7c23-445f-d54c-9ce6f6ccc7e6\" class=\"note note--start note--end\">\n       \u200bcertain \n      </gu-note>\u200bnumber of \n      <gu-note class=\"note note--start note--end\" data-note-edited-by=\"Vicky Frost\" data-note-edited-date=\"2016-09-22T11:18:42.316Z\" data-click-action=\"collapse\" data-note-id=\"b36c395a-1920-42b2-b57b-faa721b9d586\" title=\"Vicky Frost 22/9/2016 at 12:18\">\n       \u200bvotes called \n      </gu-note>\u200belectoral votes&nbsp;(EVs)\n      <gu-note class=\"note note--start note--end\" data-note-edited-by=\"Vicky Frost\" data-note-edited-date=\"2016-09-22T11:13:04.426Z\" data-click-action=\"collapse\" data-note-id=\"a3e31fdb-e028-4a34-e986-31a419d7747e\" title=\"Vicky Frost 22/9/2016 at 12:13\">\n       \u200b.

But of over a dozen phones, only two were occupied. </p> \n<p>Many of the volunteers, comprising mainly older Cubans, complained of an election that was rigged.</p> \n<p>The media was in Clinton\u2019s pocket, the volunteers argued, and even the Republican establishment was colluding to defeat the real estate mogul who earlier this year defied all odds to become the GOP\u2019s nominee for president.</p> \n<p>\u201cI\u2019m here for Donald Trump, not for the Republican party,\u201d said Abraham Alvarez, a 47-year-old ramp supervisor at Miami international airport who for the last month has been volunteering for the campaign unpaid.</p> \n<p>\u201cHave you heard of the New World Order?\u201d he added, invoking the conspiracy about a globalist elite that plans to take control of the world through authoritarian rule. \u201cThe whole establishment, they\u2019ve been working on this for a long time.\u201d</p> \n<p>To Floridians like Alvarez, the election had already been rigged in Clinton\u2019s favor.</p> \n<p>It is highly unlikely that the outcome on 8 November will be anything like that of 2000, when the result of the month-long recount over Florida\u2019s electoral votes was ultimately decided by the US supreme court after vicious partisan squabbling over hanging chads and butterfly ballots.

Jamie grew up in Muncie but moved away because she feared being drawn into a life of drugs and crime she saw in her neighbourhood. A whip-smart working-class white woman, for me Jamie singlehandedly rescued potential Trump voters from caricature. She voted for Obama in 2008, laments the impact of systemic racism, calls Trump \u201cgarbage\u201d but thinks he\u2019ll be better than Hillary.</p> <p>I had the privilege to sit in on a meeting of conservative Muncie residents, called the Citizens of Delaware County for Good Government. It included some candidates and office holders, who are engaged in local campaigns. It was a feisty, raucous group not at all reticent about speaking their mind.

Because of the radical redistricting Ohio Republicans implemented in 2010, they were able to carve up the map so that they have 75% of Ohio House seats. It\u2019s so bad, a <a href=\"http://www.cleveland.com/open/index.ssf/2014/11/conservative_and_liberal_group.html\">recent study showed</a> you can predict the results of any race in Ohio with a virtual certainty just by knowing the political makeup of a particular district.</p> <p>You can see how gerrymandering can manipulate election results in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/19/gerrymandering-supreme-court-us-election-north-carolina\">Guardian\u2019s excellent look at</a> \u201cthe nation\u2019s most gerrymandered district\u201d in North Carolina, which was so narrow at one point state representative Mickey Michaux, a Democrat from Durham, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/19/gerrymandering-supreme-court-us-election-north-carolina\">once said</a>: \u201cIf you drove down the interstate with both car doors open, you\u2019d kill most of the people in the district.\u201d</p> <p>The United States district map <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/01/13/this-is-actually-what-america-would-look-like-without-gerrymandering/\">would look radically different</a> if computers, rather than partisan humans, drew the maps based on US census data. That\u2019s why it\u2019s encouraging that President Obama <a href=\"http://www.vox.com/2014/4/15/5604284/us-elections-are-rigged-but-canada-knows-how-to-fix-them\">will reportedly make redistricting reform</a> a central part of his post-presidency plans. Given the extent to which it affects our elections, it\u2019s an underreported problem \u2013 and until it becomes a national scandal, it will persist.</p> <p>Gerrymandering has several effects beyond just making it easier for one party to control the majority of seats in the House. It drives down voter turnout, since so many elections are lopsided and unopposed. It increases polarization and deadlock in Congress since a lot of congressional members don\u2019t have to worry about a serious challenger from the other party. It also <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/06/09/how-a-widespread-practice-to-politically-empower-african-americans-might-actually-harm-them/\">deprives minority groups</a> of political power.</p> <p>It isn\u2019t a new problem; the practice is <a href=\"http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/world/us-election/how-does-gerrymandering-work/article32467642/\">almost as old as the country itself</a>, and Democrats have engaged in it as well. But no one has perfected it as well as Republicans did in 2010, and until the practice is done away with once and for all, democracy will suffer.</p>",

Every two weeks the <a href=\"http://www.forgoodgovernment.com/\">Citizens of Delaware County for Good Government</a>, a conservative group, meets here primarily to discuss campaigning on local issues. </p> <p>Nationally Hillary Clinton is <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/latest_polls/elections/ \">ahead in most polls</a>; regionally they suggest she is mounting a challenge in states such as <a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/card/clinton-campaign-makes-play-arizona-buys-ads-texas-n667706\">Utah, Georgia and even Texas</a>, where Democrats haven\u2019t won in decades; <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2016/10/what-the-early-voting-numbers-are-telling-us.html\">early voting</a> is on balance looking promising for the DNC. But when I ask the 12 people in the room how many still think he has a shot, they nearly all raise their hands.</p> <p>A reader of this project suggested I contact Hiatt, who told me: \u201cI don\u2019t necessarily think the polls are rigged. But I think there\u2019s a hidden vote and people are giving the PC answer they think people want to hear rather than how they\u2019ll actually be inclined to vote.\u201d</p> <p>Secret Trump supporters are waiting to cause an earthquake, goes the theory. To the CDCGG members present, the alternative \u2013 that Trump loses \u2013 is unthinkable. \u201cIf she gets elected ...\u201d says Judy Campbell and then shakes her head where the end of her sentence might be. \u201cPeople can\u2019t seriously be thinking about voting for that woman. I mean what in the world ... What can they be thinking?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cA lot of what he\u2019s done and said is indefensible,\u201d says Jim Arnold. \u201cBut when you compare it to what she\u2019s done they\u2019re not comparable.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt makes me worry about the intelligence of some of these people,\u201d says Margaret Niccum.</p> <p>\u201cWell you can\u2019t fix that,\u201d says Arnold. </p> <p>More than 50 million people are likely to vote for Trump, even if he goes down in flames. It would be unhelpful to generalise about all of them, reducing them to caricature only to dismiss them. Something is happening here and it behooves people to try to understand it, whether or not they like it. From interviews with a range of Trump voters in Muncie, it\u2019s clear most are not blind to his flaws, even if they wouldn\u2019t necessarily describe them in the manner of his detractors. </p> <p>The CDCGG was originally set up to repeal property taxes in Indiana which the group argued were exorbitant. After a successful campaign, they gained the ear of the governor and won a cap on property taxes statewide, and transformed themselves into a local group rallying around local issues. Mostly small businessmen and retirees, half male, half female, all white, it feels like a reconstitution of the Tea Party. </p> <p>Good government, in this context, means small government; with <a href=\"http://www.ibj.com/articles/58583-muncie-mayor-says-fbi-investigating-city-government\">Muncie\u2019s Democratic administration under investigation by the FBI for corruption</a> they feel like they are pushing at an open door and would push harder if the local Republican hierarchy were not so reticent. The atmosphere in the room is cordial; these are not just ideological allies, with a keen sense of civic engagement \u2013 two are running for local office and the conversation touches on water rates, sewage rates and teachers\u2019 contracts among other things \u2013 but also friends.</p> <p>Only a couple had wanted Trump to win in the Republican primaries earlier this year. Most preferred Ted Cruz, the Texan who has tried to style himself as a Reaganesque disruptor of Republican politics, or Marco Rubio, the Cuban-American senator from Florida. \u201cI would have been happier with almost anyone else,\u201d says Arnold. \u201cI wanted [Ben] Carson, then Cruz then Rubio. Trump would have almost been my last choice.\u201d</p> <p>When I ask if they are worried that he will do something embarrassing again they mostly laugh and nod.</p> <p>Dave Jamison, who is retired and voted for Obama twice, says he thought Trump was an \u201carrogant SOB when he was on The Apprentice\u201d, but his hunting buddies in southern Indiana persuaded him to take a second look and now he\u2019s thinking seriously of voting for him.</p> <p>Jamie Walsh, who is in her early 30s and training to be a mortician, variably describes Trump as \u201cgarbage\u201d and a \u201cword-butcher\u201d. Walsh, who got in contact with the Guardian through this project, grew up in Muncie but moved away because she saw drugs, single parenthood or incarceration claiming her peers on the southside \u2013 the white working class part of town \u2013 and felt the need to escape. She now lives in the Indianapolis suburb of Brownsburg and probably would have voted for John Kasich, one of the more moderate Republicans in the primaries, if she had registered for a party. \u201cI hated Donald Trump during the primaries,\u201d she says. \u201cHe was a mockery.\u201d </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"3f46b0f1f895a60c804d632b3af5de701337d68c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3f46b0f1f895a60c804d632b3af5de701337d68c/0_58_4500_2700/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A Trump and Pence election sign outside a house near downtown Muncie\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A Trump and Pence election sign outside a house near downtown Muncie</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Levene for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Walsh has only voted in a presidential race once: for Obama in 2008. She is likely to vote for Trump now, but says of him: \u201cHe\u2019s a 70-year-old white man. He\u2019s been supported in bigotry his entire life. He\u2019s been validated his entire life. And people wonder why he acts like this. No wonder he acts like this.\u201d</p> <p>One local senior Republican tells me privately: \u201cLook, he\u2019s a bully. Everyone can see that.\u201d</p> <p>The question of why they would vote for a man of whom they apparently have such a low opinion brings us to something else that connects most of them: their loathing of Hillary Clinton.</p> <p>It is a disdain of such depths that not a single virtue can be salvaged; a contempt nurtured and tended with such animus and anomie over the decades that she has been in the public eye that any redeeming features she might claim have long been stripped away. \u201cUnlike Hillary, he hasn\u2019t done anything criminal,\u201d says Hiatt. </p> <p>Niccum believes this moment is the culmination of a longstanding plot hatched by the Clintons several years ago. \u201cShe\u2019s been planning this since she was in college,\u201d she says.</p> <p>\u201cHow do you let all this stuff go?\u201d asks Walsh, referring to things Clinton has been accused of of late. \u201cThat\u2019s crazy stuff going on in these emails if you read \u2019em. This is all the stuff the crazy people have been talking about for years and now it turns out it\u2019s most likely true ... She\u2019s a professional politician. How do you make millions of dollars as a politician? You\u2019re supposed to be a civil servant.\u201d </p> <p>Jamison is rare among Trump supporters I\u2019ve met, in saying he could vote for Hillary, if Trump were \u201cto go off the deep end again\u201d.</p> <p>But for the overwhelming majority, <a href=\"http://www.dailykos.com/story/2016/2/8/1478776/-Why-Do-People-Hate-Hillary-Clinton-So-Much\">Hillary hatred</a> is their driving force. What they see as the apocalyptic scenario of Clinton running the country has them reaching for the largest immovable object to stop her. This cannot simply be dismissed as misogyny. Until just a couple weeks ago Clinton and Trump were running almost even among white women, while white women without college degrees <a href=\"http://www.langerresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/1184a12016ElectionTrackingNo1.pdf\">still favour him 51-42</a>. </p> <p>\u201cWhat has she ever done for women?\u201d asks Campbell. \u201cJust look at the kind of women she has standing behind her.\u201d</p> <p>When Trump called Clinton a \u201cnasty woman\u201d at the last debate he not only faithfully reflected their sentiments \u2013 he actually understated it. They do not only think she is dishonest, they think she is a criminal, scheming, cheating snob who will sell America to the highest bidder and pocket the proceeds.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"173ddacb9ab862b73b7405fc4a2c0aefc9336dcc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/173ddacb9ab862b73b7405fc4a2c0aefc9336dcc/160_0_2400_1440/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Trump window sticker in Muncie.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Trump window sticker in Muncie.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gary Younge for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThey look at things through the global order,\u201d says Will Statom, the head of the Delaware Republican party. \u201cA lot of people are looking at Hillary Clinton as nothing good. It\u2019s laughable that she can relate to the middle class \u2013 laughable. They\u2019re elitists. They have always have been elitists. They were elitists in Arkansas. They have just found a way to get ultra rich with that sham called the Clinton Foundation.\u201d</p> <p>There are policies of Trump\u2019s they like too. \u201cUnderneath all the crap there are decent ideas but people don\u2019t see them,\u201d says Walsh. \u201cYou have to go looking for them. That\u2019s his own fault. His position on tax reform, trade reform \u2013 they\u2019re not bad. And the plan to privatise the Veterans Administration, that\u2019s a really good plan.\u201d</p> <p>The US Department of Veterans Affairs is the government agency that is supposed to provide services, including healthcare, to those who have served in the military. It is so notoriously badly run that <a href=\"https://www.armytimes.com/story/entertainment/2015/08/06/jon-stewart-vs-va-how-tv-host-raged-against-red-tape/31207623/\">Jon Stewart made improving it a campaign on The Daily Show</a>. Walsh\u2019s husband served in Iraq and has PTSD and hearing loss, following an IED explosion. The VA care he is entitled to is hard to access and inadequate when he does get it, so he uses his employer\u2019s health insurance instead.</p> <p>\u201cOnce they get home the VA just hands them pills and sends them home,\u201d says Walsh. \u201cBut psychological pills aren\u2019t one size fits all. You need therapy and treatment and they\u2019re not getting that. It\u2019s like a flow chart of pills. It\u2019s a mess. We have soldiers killing themselves in epic proportions and it\u2019s because they\u2019re waiting for care.\u201d</p> <p>For Arnold it\u2019s the supreme court \u2013 currently hanging in the ideological balance after the death of the conservative Justice Antonin Scalia left a four-four split between liberal and conservative judges. \u201cThat can change our lives,\u201d he says. \u201cI can\u2019t see how anyone who calls themselves a Christian can vote for her. There\u2019s Roe v Wade, LGBTQ and then she says she\u2019s for the second amendment but then she\u2019ll tell you all the restrictions she\u2019ll put on gun owners.\u201d</p> <p>But the economy is the biggest issue of all in a town like Muncie, which lost much of its manufacturing base as companies moved south. About a third of what was once a thriving blue-collar town lives in poverty; <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/membership/2016/oct/25/middletown-muncie-factories-photo-essay-midwest\">huge factory plants lie abandoned</a>, sitting like gigantic art installations depicting the post-industrial era. The broad consensus is that the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta), which liberalised trade between the US, Canada and Mexico, helped kill the economic life of this town: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jun/08/hillary-bill-clinton\">an agreement championed by Bill Clinton</a> and supported by Hillary.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"eff3198f199983f8af88503d0f93057c8c32f681\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/eff3198f199983f8af88503d0f93057c8c32f681/0_0_5000_3256/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Indiana Steel &amp; Wire Co used to employ 300 people but closed operations in 2002 and now only two staff members remain on site.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"651\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Indiana Steel &amp; Wire Co used to employ 300 people but closed operations in 2002 and now only two staff members remain on site.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Levene/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As Statom drove me around the empty factories, elegising about the loss of both jobs and communities, the tumbledown streets where his grandparents lived and the shuttered buildings where they and his father used to work, he tells me he helped load the last machines on to the trucks in nearby Anderson that took the jobs to Mexico. \u201cI\u2019m not anti-union,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the unions got greedy. That was part of it. And then Nafta did the rest.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s why I like Trump,\u201d says Jamison. \u201cGet America back, middle-class jobs and everything. I think we need some of that.\u201d Do you think those jobs are coming back? I ask Jamison. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t,\u201d he says.</p> <p>The devastation wreaked by that hollowing-out is what Walsh felt the need to escape when she left Muncie. \u201cI have friends from high school who were incarcerated for bank robbery. One of the guys I went to high school was killed not so long ago. My best friend, who has a daughter, she\u2019s on her own. It\u2019s just a mess. People addicted to drugs. There\u2019s nothing to do. It\u2019s a sad situation. It\u2019s textbook of how you create an inner city.\u201d</p> <p>During the primaries, when all but a couple of the Republican contenders had dropped out, Trump did well on the southside where Walsh grew up. The white working class \u2013 and particularly white men without a college degree among whom he leads by a whopping 60-21 \u2013 form a significant part of Trump\u2019s core support. But it would be a mistake to conclude from that that he has the bulk of support in these areas. <a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-mythology-of-trumps-working-class-support/\">Nationally, Trump supporters are generally wealthier than most Americans</a> and considerable wealthier than those who voted for Clinton. <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.dcelectionday.com/2016-2/primary-election-2016/\">Democrats outpolled Republicans by a significant margin</a> during the primaries in most, if not all the southside precincts in Muncie. Bernie Sanders, the \u201cdemocratic socialist\u201d insurgent on the Democratic side, got more votes than Trump on the southside and even though Clinton lost to Sanders there, she wasn\u2019t far behind Trump in vote totals.</p> <p>\u201cNobody speaks up for the poor,\u201d says Walsh, explaining Trump\u2019s appeal to those she grew up with. \u201cThere is systemic racism but black people have advocates. Poor white people don\u2019t. They\u2019re afraid. They\u2019re afraid that they\u2019re stupid. They don\u2019t feel racist, they don\u2019t feel sexist, they don\u2019t want to offend people or say the wrong thing. But for them white privilege is like a blessing and a curse if you\u2019re poor. The whole idea pisses poor white people off because they\u2019ve never experienced it on a level that they understand. </p> <p>\u201cYou hear privilege and you think money and opportunity and they don\u2019t have it. I understand how it works but I don\u2019t think most people do. So when Trump says stuff, they can understand what he\u2019s saying and he speaks to them in a way other people don\u2019t.

  "<p>It\u2019s hard to be a Republican candidate these days if you were late to the renounce-Donald-Trump party. It\u2019s especially tough to be Joe Heck.</p> <p>The three-term Nevada congressman is embroiled in what may be the highest-profile contest for the US Senate in 2016: the race to fill the seat of Democrat Harry Reid, the powerful, outgoing Senate minority leader and the man Republicans most love to hate.</p> <p>The race between Heck and Catherine Cortez Masto, a former Nevada attorney general, could decide whether the US Senate stays in Republican hands or tips to the Democrats. If Cortez Masto wins, she will be the first Latina ever elected to the largely white, largely male legislative body.</p> <p>With so much at stake, the Nevada race has become one of the most expensive in the country, attracting tens of millions of dollars from outside Super Pacs, including more than $8m from the Koch brothers\u2019 Freedom Partners Action Fund. <br></p> <p>Heck was believed to have the best chance to wrest a Senate seat away from the Democrats this year.</p> <p>But not any more.

  "<p>Donald Trump is a man of many amazing boasts; someone who never met a hyperbole he didn\u2019t like. The truth can be a hazy thing in business, real estate and even taxes. But golf is supposed to be different. Golf lives in absolutes, and is governed by a strict honor code that players <a href=\"http://sports.yahoo.com/golf/blog/devil_ball_golf/post/Davis-calls-penalty-on-himself-gives-up-shot-at?urn=golf,234963\">rigidly follow</a>. Or at least they should. And so it is in golf, as most everything else with Trump, where the line between fact and fiction is hazy.</p> <p>Trump has bragged about having a handicap of three. For years, this number <a href=\"http://www.golf.com/instruction/forget-boardroom-donald-will-dominate-you-tee-green-game-thats-better-you-think\">was accepted</a> with little public question, probably because nobody cared enough to investigate it. Forbes once reported his handicap as four, with the caveat that <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/monteburke/2012/04/18/famous-golfers-and-their-um-handicaps/#7d483c346ea8\">he has yet to produce a signed scorecard</a> as proof. But mostly Trump\u2019s word was that.</p> <p>The Republican presidential nominee lists his handicap <a href=\"http://www.ghin.com/lookup.aspx\">as 2.8 </a>on the US Golf Association\u2019s Golf Handicap and Information Network, making him an extraordinary golfer at any age \u2013 but truly phenomenal for someone who is 70. And it raises the question: how likely is this claim to be truthful? Is it yet another story of virility fabricated by a man who has a long history of distorting reality?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/12/donald-trump-scotland-golf-course-resort-losses\">Donald Trump has lost tens of millions on Scottish golf courses, accounts show</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Trump\u2019s age should not be an impediment.

In fact, he says, there are 70-year-old golfers who show up at Langston with legitimate three handicaps.</p> <p>There is a hitch, though.</p> <p>\u201cWith someone who has a schedule like Donald Trump\u2019s, it\u2019s unlikely,\u201d Somerville said. \u201cThat\u2019s almost scratch, someone who can play almost professionally. It\u2019s not somebody who has a schedule like his.\u201d</p> <p>The 70-year-olds who come through the clubhouse with three handicaps are usually retired. \u201cThey aren\u2019t in and out of meetings,\u201d Somerville said. And they are also men who have been playing their entire lives, probably starting as teenagers and who either played in college or somehow found a way to play nearly every day through adulthood.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s very remote that someone could do this with the schedule he has,\u201d Somerville added.</p> <p>There are many tales of Trump bending the rules on the golf course. Last year, former Sports Illustrated managing editor Mark Mulvoy <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/does-donald-trump-cheat-at-golf-a-washington-post-investigation/2015/09/02/f8a940b2-50c4-11e5-9812-92d5948a40f8_story.html\">told the Washington Post</a> that once playing with Trump in the 1990s he realized that Trump had placed a ball just feet from the pin that he had never hit. \u201cAhh, the guys I play with cheat all the time,\u201d Mulvoy said Trump told him. \u201cI have to cheat to keep up with them.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/oct/26/donald-trump-rumbelows-cup-saint-and-greavsie-ian-st-john-jimmy-greaves\">\u2018Donald Trump had no idea what the Rumbelows Cup was.

When former North Korean leader Kim Jong-il played the first ever round of golf on the 7,700-yard championship course at Pyongyang in October 1994, state media reported that the Dear Leader finished with an 18-hole score of 34, including no less than five holes-in-one.</p> <p>That said, Trump clearly has some talent as a golfer, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JlzunW6YgA\">as seen in this 2011 YouTube video.</a> But his claim of a three handicap is hard to quantify, especially when his 20 most recent scores on his GHIN index are mostly from 2014 and stretch back to 2009. Even assuming he did not include his best rounds, it\u2019s not the kind of record you would see from a 70-year-old with a reputation as a scratch golfer.</p> <p>And it might just be yet another golf story.</p>",

  "<p>Two years ago, when the UK had a future in the European Union and Ed Miliband was a potential prime minister, the chief business commentator of the Financial Times, John Gapper, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b6e43e54-f8a3-11e3-befc-00144feabdc0\">announced the demise</a> of Britain\u2019s rightwing tabloids. Unusually for an FT journalist, Gapper had once worked at the Daily Mail, and at the FT he often writes about the media, sweepingly and authoritatively even by that paper\u2019s standards. \u201cThe era of the Fleet Street tabloids, the populist and fearsome emblems of British culture and politics, is over,\u201d he wrote on 25 June 2014. \u201cIt has been over for some years, in fact, but neither they nor their critics chose to admit it.\u201d</p> <p>He pointed to their shrunken print circulations: in 1950 the Daily Express was \u201cthe world\u2019s best-selling paper\u201d, he wrote, and \u201csold more than 4m copies each day\u201d. Yet by 2014 it was selling barely a ninth of that; and it has weakened further since. \u201cThe tabloids appeal to a readership limited by class, occupation, and social attitude,\u201d Gapper continued. \u201cThat is not sufficient in the digital era. Young people are not loyal to one tabloid title and few of them will subscribe online.\u201d</p> <p>Gapper cited <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/phone-hacking\">the phone-hacking scandal</a> which closed the News of the World in 2011; competition from politically neutral, free tabloids such as Metro; the distraction of readers by smartphones; and the advancing years of key tabloid figures such as Paul Dacre, now 67, who has been the crusading, splenetic editor of the Mail for almost a quarter of a century. Gapper predicted that Dacre would probably be the last tabloid editor to successfully \u201cexpress their readers\u2019 inner thoughts and emotions \u2026 more strongly than the readers could themselves\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2016/nov/14/revenge-of-the-tabloids-podcast\">Revenge of the tabloids \u2013 podcast</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In recent years, the many observers and enemies of the tabloids have repeatedly forecast their political decline.

In August, a former managing editor of the Sun, Stig Abell, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/11/opinion/britains-paper-tigers.html?_r=0\">wrote in the New York Times</a> that the other tabloids had become \u201cliving relics\u201d, with the Express \u201cno more than an incontinent shriek of made-up facts about health and immigration\u201d. The headline for the piece was \u201cBritain\u2019s Paper Tigers\u201d.</p> <p>Yet on 23 June 2016, almost two years to the day after Gapper had written their obituary, one of the biggest, oldest dreams of the tabloids came spectacularly to life, when Britain voted to leave the EU, against the predictions of most broadsheet commentators. It was an outcome for which the tabloids had campaigned doggedly for decades, but never more intensely \u2013 or with less factual scrupulousness \u2013 than this spring and summer, when the front pages of the Sun, Mail and Express bellowed for Brexit, talking up Britain\u2019s prospects afterwards, in deafening unison, day after day. Two days before the referendum, the Sun gave over its first 10 pages to pro-Brexit coverage.</p> <p>The referendum has not been the only tabloid triumph of the last 18 months. At the 2015 general election, again contrary to most predictions, the Conservatives won a majority against the Labour bogeyman the papers had alternately mocked and feared for the previous five years: \u201cRed\u201d or \u201cWeird\u201d Ed Miliband. At Loughborough University, Prof David Deacon and his colleagues have studied the tabloid coverage of the last six general elections, going back to 1992. \u201cWe were doing our initial analysis of 2015 while the campaign was going on,\u201d he remembers, \u201cand there seemed to be laughably extreme anti-Labour headlines. The levels of partisanship were at least the equal of what we recorded in 1992,\u201d widely considered the previous high point \u2013 or low point \u2013 of tabloid electoral influence.</p> <p>\u201cOn polling day in 2015,\u201d Deacon continues, \u201cI was doing the final data runs, and I thought to myself, \u2018If Miliband gets a hung parliament, in spite of this hostility, it will be extraordinary. This election will put us out of business.\u2019\u201d He pauses. \u201cBut it didn\u2019t.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/oct/28/when-tabloids-publish-and-dont-give-a-damn\">When tabloids publish and don\u2019t give a damn | Letters</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Finally, this July, Theresa May suddenly swept past the favourite Boris Johnson to become Conservative leader and unelected prime minister. The Mail has long admired and promoted her as a stern, controlling figure, like Dacre himself. To his usually formal paper, which was thrilled by her fierce party conference speech this month, she is \u201cTheresa\u201d.</p> <p>British politics now feels relentlessly tabloid-dominated. From the daily obsession with immigrants to the rubbishing of human rights lawyers, from the march towards a \u201chard Brexit\u201d to the smearing of liberal Britons as bad losers and elitists, the tabloids and the Conservative right are collaborating with a closeness and a swagger not seen since at least the early 90s.</p> <p>\u201cThe Sun and Mail have more power now than they have for a long time,\u201d says David Yelland, editor of the Sun from 1998 to 2003. \u201cYou could argue that in Brexit the tabloids had their most powerful moment ever.\u201d In a text less than an hour after the Brexit victory was declared, the current editor of the Sun, Tony Gallagher, told the Guardian\u2019s media editor: \u201cSo much for the waning power of the print media.\u201d</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Even the most confident and successful<strong> </strong>modern British politicians have regarded the tabloids as culturally and electorally pivotal. In 2012, Tony Blair told the Leveson inquiry into the behaviour of the British press: \u201cIf you have a readership of three to four million \u2026 that\u2019s power \u2026 I don\u2019t know any other way of describing it.\u201d In his autobiography, Blair writes of his decision as Labour leader to appease the Sun and its proprietor Rupert Murdoch: \u201cNot to [do so] was to say carry on and do your worst, and we knew their worst was very bad indeed.\u201d</p> <p>Like almost every book about New Labour, Blair\u2019s has dozens of index entries for the Sun and Mail. Conservatives tend to be more reticent about their relations with the tabloids: there are no index references to the Sun in either volume of Margaret Thatcher\u2019s memoirs. But shortly before her 1987 general election victory, she spoke privately about Murdoch to her confidant Woodrow Wyatt. \u201cWe depend on him to fight for us,\u201d she said. \u201cThe Sun is marvellous.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"3094b0b1a09238e686b6edd408dc7f77f4dddd3e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3094b0b1a09238e686b6edd408dc7f77f4dddd3e/125_79_3201_4358/735.jpg\" alt=\"The Daily Mail has long admired Theresa May\" width=\"735\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Daily Mail has long admired Theresa May.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Daily Mail</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>According to <a href=\"https://yougov.co.uk/news/2015/06/08/general-election-2015-how-britain-really-voted/\">research by YouGov</a>, the paper you read is still \u201ca far better predictor of Labour and Tory support than any other indicator\u201d. This applies to all national papers \u2013 in 2015, Guardian readers chose Labour over the Tories by 10 to one. But with the rightwing tabloids, uniquely, the link is rapidly growing stronger. At the 2015 general election, the Tory advantage over Labour among Sun readers was one-and-a-half times as big as it had been in 2010. Moreover, as John Curtice of Strathclyde University, the veteran analyst of British voting behaviour, points out: \u201cPeople who still read papers in print are disproportionately politically interested. They vote!\u201d</p> <p>The word \u201ctabloid\u201d was invented in 1884 by the pharmaceutical magnate Henry Wellcome; before it referred to pithy newspapers, it meant a concentrated dose of medicine.</p> <p>Consider some headlines from the Express this autumn: \u201cMigrant Influx Is Threatening To Destroy Our Way Of Life\u201d; \u201cMuslim Bus Driver \u2018Put Children\u2019s Lives At Risk\u2019 By Stopping For Prayer\u201d; \u201cBenefit Cheats Spared Jail As Fraud Rockets\u201d. For the rightwing tabloids, they are unremarkable \u2013 such themes and stereotypes and phrases have run through the papers for decades: on front pages, in news stories, in features, editorials and pieces by columnists, almost all the articles agreeing with each other, almost every day. The papers have tirelessly devoted themselves to what the Italian political theorist Antonio Gramsci referred to as the manufacturing of \u201ccommon sense\u201d, by which he meant the partisan but often unnoticed and unchallenged assumptions that tilt public opinion rightwards. In 2013, an in-depth survey by <a href=\"https://www.ipsos-mori.com/researchpublications/researcharchive/3188/Perceptions-are-not-reality-the-top-10-we-get-wrong.aspx\">Ipsos MORI revealed</a> that Britons vastly overestimate the number of British immigrants, Muslims and benefit fraudsters.</p> <p>In an era when agreed facts are becoming rarer, and voters are increasingly impatient and distracted, but also disorientated by shock events, influencing how issues are talked about is more important than ever \u2013 possibly more important, in fact, than influencing elections. In Britain, uniquely among democracies, a few tabloid newspapers are at the heart of both; their preoccupations so familiar that the terms \u201ctabloid\u201d and \u201crightwing tabloid\u201d have become almost synonymous.</p> <p>Yet the exact workings and nature of their influence are fiercely disputed. Politicians, journalists, academics, and tabloid proprietors say contradictory things about it. Defenders of the papers say that tabloids understand and represent their readers; critics say that they talk down to them and manipulate them. Even the owners of tabloids can\u2019t always keep their story straight. In 2012, Murdoch told the Leveson inquiry that the Sun\u2019s famous claim after the 1992 election \u2013 \u201cIt\u2019s The Sun Wot Won it\u201d \u2013 had been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/apr/25/rupert-murdoch-sun-wot-won-it-tasteless\">\u201ctasteless and wrong \u2026 We don\u2019t have that sort of power.\u201d</a> But at the Sun\u2019s offices in London, some of the rooms have glass walls with reproductions of its most mythologised headlines embedded in them, including the front page from the day of the 1992 election, about the then Labour leader, Neil Kinnock: \u201cIf Kinnock wins today will the last person to leave Britain please turn out the lights.\u201d</p> <p>Like Miliband, Kinnock unexpectedly lost. Murdoch told the Leveson inquiry he thought this front page was \u201cabsolutely brilliant\u201d. He could not resist revelling in his paper\u2019s power, it seemed, even as he denied it.</p> <p>In 1992, the political scientist Ken Newton wrote that identifying the political role of newspapers was \u201ca classic conundrum of the behavioural sciences\u201d. Do people think and vote as rightwingers because they read rightwing papers \u2013 or is it the other way around? Are tabloids just one voice in a larger media babble, or do they play a unique role in setting the agenda for other journalists, such as broadcasters? To what extent do the tabloids shape their readers\u2019 social values \u2013 or have the tabloids\u2019 own values been made to shift by changing public attitudes towards race and gender and sexuality?</p> <p>In the Britain of Theresa\u2019s Brexit and seemingly perpetual Tory government, the rightwing tabloids reign again \u2013 even as their business, like the rest of the print media, continues to crumble. Is theirs a brittle supremacy? Or is their hold on the national discourse secure for another generation?</p> <p>One way to investigate these questions is to tell the story of their political influence on modern Britain. It is not a simple tabloid tale.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Britain is in many ways a perfect environment for a partisan press. It is a small, centralised country with a raucous party politics and an enduring culture of national newspapers. Unlike local papers, the nationals do not have to appeal to everyone, but can have intense relationships with particular readerships. British newspapers first appeared regularly during the civil war of the 1640s: the earnest Mercurius Britannicus supported parliament, the mocking Mercurius Aulicus backed the royalists. Three hundred years on, political bias remained so blatant that in 1947 Clement Attlee\u2019s Labour government established a royal commission to investigate the press, in particular the power of its disproportionate number of rightwing proprietors. Lord Beaverbrook, the domineering owner of the Express, told the ineffectual commission: \u201cMy purpose originally was to set up a propaganda paper, and I have never departed from that.\u201d</p> <p>Two years later, the pioneering social research organisation Mass Observation conducted one of the first British studies of the interactions between newspapers and their readers, by scrutinising press consumption in libraries and other public places. \u201cMost people choose their paper primarily for its politics,\u201d it found. Fifty-eight per cent of people read political news stories, far more than read sport or \u201cgossip\u201d. With huge electoral turnouts and party memberships, Attlee\u2019s Britain was a highly politicised society. \u201cNewspaper influence on [reader] opinion,\u201d the study went on, was \u201ca subtle, almost imperceptible process\u201d: either \u201cthe long-term reinforcement of opinions already held\u201d, or to \u201csow seeds and implant suggestions on points to which people have up to now given next to no thought\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"aef06dcd98537d709e418dee36c26edd1aa25b42\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/aef06dcd98537d709e418dee36c26edd1aa25b42/0_0_3259_4164/783.jpg\" alt=\"The Daily Express has run a steam of anti-migrant front pages.\" width=\"783\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Daily Express has run a steam of anti-migrant front pages.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Express Newspapers/Daily Express</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But Mass Observation warned over\u2011ideological proprietors: \u201cPeople tend to resist newspaper influences that lead them in a direction they are not disposed to follow.\u201d During the 1945 general election, one Express headline read, \u201cGestapo In Britain if Socialists Win\u201d. Attlee won by a landslide.</p> <p>So used to thinking of tabloids as always omnipotent, modern Britain has forgotten that their political influence actually dwindled during the postwar decades. Improving literacy and the complexities of the war reduced the impact of simplistic newspapers. Mass Observation found the press falling behind \u201cbooks\u201d, \u201cpersonal experience\u201d, and \u201cfriends and family\u201d as political influences. The arrival of television during the 50s, which was not allowed to be partisan, made the Mail and the Express, founded in 1896 and 1900 respectively, look still more like bombastic Victorian throwbacks. So did the increasingly consensual nature of postwar party politics.</p> <p>In 1952, the Labour politician and diarist Richard Crossman spent a hospital stay reading a British newspaper history: \u201cWhat struck me,\u201d he wrote afterwards, \u201cwas the enormous power of the press in politics before 1918 and its steady decline since... Today, [when there is] a campaign against a cabinet minister, the effect is usually to strengthen his position.\u201d</p> <p>As the economy recovered from the war, advertising revenue became more important to papers, and this brought a pressure to publish fewer political, potentially reader-alienating stories. According to the media historians James Curran and Jean Seaton, the amount of \u201cpublic affairs\u201d coverage in the tabloids halved between 1945 and 1975. The Mail and Express carried on backing the Conservatives, but their readers increasingly ignored the editorials: by 1963, 28% of Mail readers and 38% of Express readers supported Labour.</p> <p>In 1964, the struggling Daily Herald, founded half a century earlier as a radical paper for striking trade unionists, was relaunched as the Sun. It remained Labour-supporting;<strong> </strong>but as its apolitical-sounding, blandly uplifting name might suggest, it was more interested in consumerism, and in what it called \u201cpacesetters\u201d: young working-class people, often women, who were joining the expanding middle class of southern England.</p> <p>The idea that newspapers should no longer lecture their readers received support from academia. The Sun was conceived partly on the advice of a sociologist and social forecaster, Dr Mark Abrams. He produced reports with graphs and tables which appeared to prove the existence of a new, increasingly well-educated, less politically tribal, mass newspaper readership. Meanwhile in America, where most academic work on the media was done, the analysis of press influence converged on a \u201cminimal effects model\u201d. It noted that few voters changed their minds during presidential races, when coverage of politics was at its most feverish, and concluded that papers were not much of a factor in electoral contests.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"7a12941e044bc5f936f928e83dc0d5d4bab4bc7f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7a12941e044bc5f936f928e83dc0d5d4bab4bc7f/0_0_1036_1351/767.jpg\" alt=\"Rupert Murdoch told the Leveson inquiry that this Sun front page was \u2018tasteless and wrong\u2019.\" width=\"767\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rupert Murdoch told the Leveson inquiry that this Sun front page was \u2018tasteless and wrong\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: GNM/NI</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Like many postwar American ideas, \u201cminimal effects\u201d quickly crossed the Atlantic, and helped shape the thinking of the small number of British media analysts. In 1974, the respected Colin Seymour-Ure wrote languidly in his book The Political Impact of Mass Media: \u201cMost British national newspapers ... are \u2018partisan\u2019 in only a loose sense.\u201d Beaverbrook had died in 1964. The equally rightwing co-creators of the Mail, Viscount Northcliffe and Viscount Rothermere, had died in 1922 and 1940, respectively. Newspapers were increasingly controlled by corporations seeking profits or prestige rather than political clout. In a 1977 essay titled \u201cThe Organization of Public Opinion\u201d, the media academic Tom Burns concluded: \u201cThe power of the press barons has gone.\u201d</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>It had not. In 1969 Murdoch bought his first British paper, the News of the World. While mostly interested in sex and scandals, it was traditionally a Tory paper. According to Roy Greenslade\u2019s reliable 2003 book <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2003/oct/18/society1\">Press Gang: How Newspapers Make Profits from Propaganda</a>, Murdoch was permitted to acquire it partly because the other potential buyer was Robert Maxwell, then a book publisher and Labour MP.</p> <p>Murdoch\u2019s own politics, at this stage, were a slightly unformed but usefully ambiguous mix, both pro-business and pro-trade union. Despite the elite-bashing persona which he would deploy, brilliantly and shamelessly, in the intensely class-sensitive world of British newspapers for decades to come, he was in fact the son of an Australian press magnate, Sir Keith Murdoch. Sir Keith had been so influenced by the Mail\u2019s Northcliffe that he was nicknamed Lord Southcliffe. When Murdoch junior was asked if he would tell the News of the World what to say, he replied: \u201cI did not come all this way not to interfere.\u201d</p> <p>When the Sun was also put up for sale in 1969, after its first incarnation attracted too few readers, Murdoch and Maxwell again competed to buy it. Maxwell wanted to slim the Sun\u2019s staff, while Murdoch assured the paper\u2019s powerful unions that he had no such intentions. Again, Murdoch won. His Sun tried to be youthfully, fashionably left-liberal: it was against the death penalty, nuclear weapons and the Vietnam war; for Labour and personal freedom. Its endorsement of the party at the 1970 general election deferred to readers rather than tried to browbeat them: \u201cThis \u2026 far-from-perfect Labour government has just about earned the right to \u2026 another term of office. That is our view. But you have a mind of your own.\u201d</p> <p>During the late 60s and early 70s, the large advantage that the Conservatives had always enjoyed among the tabloids, in terms of both circulation and opinions expressed, suddenly evaporated. When the national union of mineworkers (NUM) went on strike in 1972 against Edward Heath\u2019s Tory government, the Express, despite still being owned by the Beaverbrook family, was sympathetic: \u201cThese men do a hard, dirty, dangerous job \u2026 All they ask is a decent wage. They should have it.\u201d The Mail acknowledged \u201cwidespread public support\u201d for the strike, and commented: \u201cSympathy for the miners is a good cause. It makes sense for Britain.\u201d The editor of the Sun, Larry Lamb, was the son of an NUM official and had once edited a union journal. Of the Sun\u2019s pro-strike coverage, Murdoch said afterwards, \u201cWe certainly pushed public opinion very hard behind the miners.\u201d</p> <p>Just as startling and forgotten, in Britain\u2019s first referendum on EU membership, in 1975, the tabloids urged their readers to vote in favour of Europe. When the pro-EU side won by 67% to 33%, the Mail rejoiced: \u201cThis is the most crushing victory in British political history. The effects of this thunderous YES will echo down the years.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"54b44b4916709999db45cefad43a9a877459f631\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/54b44b4916709999db45cefad43a9a877459f631/0_0_4096_3302/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rupert Murdoch inspects one of the first copies of the Sun in 1969\" width=\"1000\" height=\"806\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rupert Murdoch inspects one of the first copies of the Sun in 1969.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PA/PA Archive/Press Association Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Yet the tabloids\u2019 flirtation with cosmopolitanism and the left was short. In 1974, the miners went on strike against Heath again, and the Mail condemned them. When he called a general election that February, to try to end the dispute, the Sun endorsed the Conservatives. Some of this shift was a reaction against the increasing radicalism of parts of the union movement and the Labour party. The Mail became preoccupied by the presence of communists in the NUM. But the tabloids were also increasingly hit by strikes themselves. The stalling, inflationary British economy of the mid-70s had brought lower advertising revenues, higher newsprint costs, and higher wage demands. All Fleet Street papers had prickly unions, but the Sun\u2019s were the most rebellious of all, regularly stopping editions from appearing.</p> <p>James Alan Anslow joined the Sun in 1977, and worked there on and off for four decades, as well as writing and lecturing in academia about tabloids and their readers. \u201cSoon after I started at the Sun,\u201d he told me, \u201cI was working on production, and I let the word \u2018victory\u2019 through on a headline about a strike by the firemen\u2019s union. Kelvin MacKenzie [who later became the paper\u2019s most aggressively rightwing editor] gave me a bollocking. He said, \u2018Don\u2019t you know what we\u2019re all about?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>After Margaret Thatcher seized the Tory leadership from Heath in 1975, Larry Lamb quickly became a convert. The Sun editor would invite her to his office for evening chats and whisky, and published so many favourable pieces about her that the more cautious Murdoch, anxious about the Sun\u2019s large residue of Labour readers, would phone Lamb and ask, \u201cAre you still pushing that bloody woman?\u201d The Sun had backed the losing side at both the 1970 and February 1974 general elections. But by the late 70s many voters were turning against unions and collectivism, and the individualistic Sun\u2019s circulation surged, doubling over the decade. In 1978, it overtook its once-dominant leftwing rival, the Daily Mirror, to become Britain\u2019s best-selling daily paper. In January 1979, amid the strike chaos of the Winter of Discontent, the Sun lethally punctured the credibility of the Labour prime minister, Jim Callaghan, with a headline that sounded like a quote from him but was actually disguised editorialising: \u201cCrisis, What Crisis?\u201d</p> <p>The Mail was an early and effective Thatcher ally too. Its editor during the 70s and 80s was David English, a zealously rightwing former entrepreneur who had backed her coup against Heath (the Mail was the only paper to do so). English modernised the Mail\u2019s design, and turned the paper into a less fusty, more seductive advocate of Conservative values, presenting them as basic British common sense, somehow above mere party politics. The day before the 1979 general election, the Mail\u2019s front page read, \u201cThe Woman Who Can Save Britain\u201d. The Sun\u2019s endorsement of the Conservatives was less personal and more equivocal, but eye-catching: \u201cVOTE TORY THIS TIME.\u201d The return of the rightwing tabloids was complete \u2013 and with it came the press culture we still live in now.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>As British voters have become more disengaged since the 70s, the tabloids\u2019 political messages have had to become louder. \u201cVOTE FOR MAGGIE,\u201d yelled the Sun\u2019s front page on the day of the 1983 general election. When Labour moved rightwards after losing, choosing the pragmatic Kinnock as leader, the Sun immediately dismissed him regardless: \u201cHe has no intellectual depth, no coherent philosophy.\u201d</p> <p>Kinnock\u2019s strategist Philip Gould, who would become Labour\u2019s key interpreter of voter behaviour during the 90s, began reading the tabloids closely. \u201cI looked at those papers and silently wept,\u201d he wrote after the 1992 general election campaign. Some tabloid journalists had mixed feelings about their papers\u2019 power. James Alan Anslow remembers: \u201cWhen the Sun did the lightbulb\u201d \u2013 its famous 1992 front page of Kinnock\u2019s balding head inside a bulb \u2013 \u201cI was out on the doorstep canvassing for him. Politically, I thought it was awful. Journalistically, I felt \u2026 professional admiration. I couldn\u2019t help smiling. In the office after the paper came out, there was a lot of chatting and smiling. There was a sense of being in amongst it \u2013 of counting.\u201d</p> <p>When Labour lost, despite a tired Conservative government, there was a surge of academic and media interest in the tabloids\u2019 political role. The \u201cminimal effects\u201d model had already begun to attract British doubters. In 1991, the media analyst William Miller had written about what he instead called \u201cthe Basildon effect\u201d. In this heavily working-class Essex constituency, which had one of the highest proportions of Sun readers in the country, a small and supposedly vulnerable Conservative majority had risen rather than fallen at the 1987 election. According to Miller, this swing had happened late in the campaign \u2013 when the Sun\u2019s onslaught on Labour was at its loudest \u2013 and it had been repeated in other similar Tory marginals. He suggested the paper had played a major role.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"51c1fe1b3a9785cb8adaeff8801526fc2f3aa100\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/51c1fe1b3a9785cb8adaeff8801526fc2f3aa100/0_0_590_768/384.jpg\" alt=\"The famous 1992 front page of Neil Kinnock\u2019s head inside a bulb.\" width=\"384\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The famous 1992 front page of Neil Kinnock\u2019s head inside a bulb.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: GMN/NI</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In 1992, John Curtice interviewed a panel of voters from across the country, before and after the general election. Unlike Miller, he did not find tabloid readers shifting from Labour to the Conservatives. But he wrote that the papers did play a part in \u201cwinning over or maintaining in the Conservative camp electors who might otherwise have abstained or voted Liberal Democrat\u201d. All the scare stories about Labour, it appeared, had persuaded these pivotal voters to choose the Tories as the lesser evil, as they would in 2015.</p> <p>More ominously still for non-Tories, in 1992 Ken Newton found that people with Labour views who read a rightwing paper \u2013 of whom there were still millions \u2013 were more likely to vote Conservative than people with Tory views who read a leftwing one were to vote Labour. Tory papers were better at making converts than Labour ones, in other words, just as they would prove better at turning leftwing readers into Brexiters than the Labour press would be at creating remainers.</p> <p>By the 90s, many political observers assumed that readers of rightwing tabloids were a sort of block vote, to be deployed en masse by proprietors as decisively as union members had been by their leaders during the 70s. In academia and beyond, the tabloid factor was frequently cited as a reason why Labour would never win power again.</p> <p>There were weaknesses in this argument. The gap between the Conservative share of the newspaper market \u2013 between 70 and 80% \u2013 and the Conservative share of the vote at general elections \u2013 around 40% \u2013 suggested that papers were not terribly efficient creators of Tory voters. Even in 1979, when the Sun had said \u201cVOTE TORY\u201d, fewer than half of its readers had done so. Another third actually believed it had endorsed Labour. As Britain became a less deferential, less politicised society, readers could no longer be relied on to absorb or even notice bossy political articles in the way that they had in the editorialists\u2019 heyday of the 40s.</p> <p>Yet by the mid-90s, after four consecutive general election defeats, Labour was not interested in examining such complexities. Under Blair, the party generally sought to accommodate rather than challenge rightwing interests: Gould decided that the Mail was \u201cthe key influencer of Middle Britain\u201d, Blair that Murdoch was \u201cimmensely powerful\u201d. More than a year before Blair became Labour leader in 1994, a delicate political dance began between him and the tabloids \u2013 each side seeking to draw maximum advantage from the rising strength of the other \u2013 which culminated in the Sun endorsing Labour at the 1997 general election.</p> <p>The day before the announcement, Blair\u2019s press secretary Alastair Campbell was contacted by the Sun and told to call its editor, Stuart Higgins. \u201cHe said they were going to come out for us in a big front page tomorrow,\u201d Campbell wrote in his diary, capturing the sense of mutual triumph and machismo. \u201cStuart said Rupert Murdoch was sure [about Blair], and laughed \u2026 I took [Blair] to one side and \u2026 I said you remember in 1994 when I said we should try to get the Sun on board and you said you weren\u2019t sure it was possible, well, they are. He thought it was good news in its own right \u2026 [and] in the effect it would have on the other side\u2019s morale.\u201d The next day, the Today programme on Radio 4 reported that the Conservatives felt bewildered: \u201cOld friends\u201d \u2013 its correspondent meant the Sun \u2013 \u201care passing them by on the other side of the street.\u201d</p> <p>Less noticed was the fact that the paper had endorsed Labour on its own, almost unchanged, rightwing terms. \u201cLike us, Blair recognises that the Tories under Maggie Thatcher achieved remarkable reforms,\u201d said the Sun. \u201cBlair has promised to slay the dragon of Europe,\u201d it went on, and might even \u201ctame\u201d the welfare state. As well as choosing governments, the tabloids now wanted to decide what they did.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>In 2004, George Lakoff, a professor of linguistics at Berkeley, published a deceptively breezy political book called Don\u2019t Think of an Elephant! Its central argument was that how issues are \u201cframed\u201d \u2013 which points of view the media and other political tastemakers defined as acceptable, and the language used to do so \u2013 largely decides how voters think about them.</p> <p>For the last two decades, through Labour, coalition and Conservative governments, the tabloids have successfully chosen and then framed most of the debates that have dominated British domestic politics, ensuring that law and order, immigration, the role of the state, and Britain\u2019s relationship with Europe have all been discussed in ever more rightwing terms.</p> <p>The Blair government\u2019s determination to be \u201ctough on crime\u201d; the Brown government\u2019s \u201cBritish jobs for British workers\u201d; the Cameron government\u2019s onslaught on benefits-claiming \u201cshirkers\u201d; the May government\u2019s \u201cBrexit means Brexit\u201d \u2013 all have been catchphrases, not always with workable policies attached, intended to \u201cplease the tabloids\u201d, in the euphemistic stock phrase of British political punditry.</p> <p>On occasions, the newspapers have directly intervened in the making of government policy. According to Nick Davies\u2019s book <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/aug/21/hack-attack-truth-rupert-murdoch-nick-davies-review\">Hack Attack: How the Truth Caught Up with Rupert Murdoch</a>, in 2001 the Sun forced Brown as chancellor to permit more private sector involvement in the NHS. First, the paper condemned his cherished plan to increase NHS spending as too profligate, writes Davies, then a \u201cpanicked\u201d Brown \u2013 desperate not to be portrayed as a traditional tax-and-spend leftwinger \u2013 \u201ccontacted the Sun \u2026 agreed to rearrange his diary so that he could go to their office that day \u2026 [and] sat down with the Sun\u2019s outspoken rightwing political editor, Trevor Kavanagh, for an interview which \u2026 rapidly became a negotiation about policy.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"0ff0099559541821fd4340b2de64fb6748741e78\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0ff0099559541821fd4340b2de64fb6748741e78/47_36_1149_1569/732.jpg\" alt=\"The Daily Mail backs Theresa May for prime minister.\" width=\"732\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Daily Mail backs Theresa May for prime minister.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Daily Mail</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the meantime, policy ideas that have been popular with the public but not with these papers, and their proprietors \u2013 raising taxes on the wealthy or on property; renationalising loathed and ineffective privatised utilities \u2013 have almost never been enacted.</p> <p>During the Blair era, tabloid circulations, like those of all newspapers, stagnated and then fell. British party politics, fixated on the \u201ccentre ground\u201d, was often as consensual as it had been during the 50s, when the tabloids had felt obliged to tone down their rhetoric. Yet this time they did the opposite, emboldened by the Blair government\u2019s acceptance of their agenda and eagerness to have friendly relations. The tabloids became more influential still.</p> <p>Meanwhile, as the media in general adjusted to a new world of internet competitors, squeezed budgets, and recycled content, the papers became a dependable source of polemic for other outlets. \u201cSky and the BBC are still obsessed by reviewing the papers,\u201d says Charlie Beckett, a former TV executive who is professor of media at the London School of Economics. Presenters holding up tomorrow morning\u2019s front pages to the camera, he points out, \u201cis cheap telly\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The need for broadcasters to be balanced, once seen as a threat, has created a market for tabloid shrillness</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Yelland says: \u201cThe first thing you do when you\u2019ve put together a front page, is get it over to Sky, to the paper review shows.\u201d Tom Baldwin, Ed Miliband\u2019s press strategist as Labour leader, told me: \u201cThey could say \u2018Black Is White: Exclusive\u2019 on the front of the Mail, and the next day, there\u2019d be a story on the BBC: \u2018Controversy over whether black is white \u2026\u2019\u201d The legal requirement for British broadcasters to be balanced, once considered a threat to the tabloids, has created a new market for their shrillness.</p> <p>It is even possible that the papers\u2019 political stances are even more influential now than in the past, precisely because they are less and less read. Their positions are simply assumed \u2013 rather than widely scrutinised for flaws or contradictions \u2013 and politicians and public opinion adjust accordingly. Gramsci, who died in 1937, would be appalled and fascinated.</p> <p>As the editor of the Sun, says Yelland, \u201cI was very much aware that most people were not reading the political stuff. But the Sun set the mood music of Westminster, of the lobby [journalists], of the morning meetings in every department in Downing Street.\u201d Like any good tabloid journalist, he may be overstating a little, but to manipulate the elite while insisting your journalism is for the masses is certainly quite a trick.</p> <p>While Labour leader, Miliband tried to break out of his party\u2019s suffocating tabloid relationship. Baldwin, who supported the move, remembers: \u201cAt first, we felt we had better keep talking to them, have dinners with the editor of the Sun. Ed would have drinks with Dacre. Then phone-hacking happened \u2026\u201d Miliband reacted to the scandal by attacking the tabloids\u2019 political influence, and calling for them to be properly regulated. \u201cThere weren\u2019t ever drinks with Dacre after that,\u201d says Baldwin. \u201cDacre was screaming down the phone at Ed. It felt liberating, exciting, scary. Gordon Brown said to us, \u2018This is a big thing you\u2019ve done. You\u2019ve got to keep your foot on their neck, or they\u2019ll come back up and smack you.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Yet as often with Miliband, his anti-tabloid initiative petered out. \u201cEd\u2019s management style is to balance,\u201d says a former adviser, \u201cand there were some good personal relationships in the Labour team with some tabloid reporters.\u201d Baldwin says: \u201cWe lost the [internal] argument. We got back to business as usual.\u201d At the 2015 election, the tabloids tore into Miliband and Labour regardless.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>During the Cameron governments, it felt like Murdoch and Dacre were the adults, and the politicians were children</p> <footer> <cite>David Yelland</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>David Cameron underwent a similar experience with the papers. At first, as Tory leader \u2013 influenced by his adviser Steve Hilton, who believed that in the digital era the views of newspapers were of increasingly minor relevance \u2013 Cameron decided that rather than \u201csucking up to Murdoch\u201d, as one of his aides put it, it was better to \u201ckeep your distance\u201d from the tabloids, and to focus instead on television appearances. Yet when the effectiveness of Cameron\u2019s leadership was widely criticised in 2007 \u2013 not least by Murdoch\u2019s papers \u2013 he quickly changed his approach. He hired the former News of the World editor Andy Coulson as his director of communications, and maintained a high-profile, highly political friendship with the editor of the Sun and Murdoch favourite, Rebekah Brooks. In 2009, the Sun switched its support from Labour back to the Conservatives.</p> <p>Despite <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2011/jan/21/andy-coulson-resigns-david-cameron\">Coulson\u2019s resignation over phone-hacking</a> in 2011, and conviction for the same offence in 2014, Cameron\u2019s governments remained tabloid-friendly throughout, straining to come up with populist policies and language.But while the Mail backed the Conservatives as always, Dacre and his paper remained lukewarm towards the metropolitan Cameron. And when Cameron finally challenged the tabloids\u2019 worldview, the EU referendum, they were brutal towards him, and helped terminate his premiership.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"23ee1058c1c337f8d863433588946bd42451e386\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/23ee1058c1c337f8d863433588946bd42451e386/24_23_761_981/388.jpg\" alt=\"When Cameron challenged the Sun\u2019s views on Europe he was brutally attacked.\" width=\"388\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">When Cameron challenged the Sun\u2019s views on Europe he was brutally attacked.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: The Sun</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Baldwin says, \u201cI\u2019ve been amused to hear Craig Oliver\u201d, Coulson\u2019s successor as Cameron\u2019s communications director, \u201craging to left-of-centre journos about the rightwing press and how awful they are.\u201d Yelland argues that the tabloid barons are simply \u201cbetter at what they do than the politicians. Murdoch and Dacre have been around for so long, fashioning words and campaigns. During the Cameron governments, it felt like they were the adults, and the politicians were children.\u201d</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Will the reign of the tabloids ever end?<strong> </strong>It was interrupted when the second world war created a kinder Britain, and again, fleetingly, after the phone-hacking scandal in 2011. Profound social change, or the exposure of journalists\u2019 excesses, can weaken even apparently impregnable tabloid citadels.</p> <p>Over recent decades, shifting public attitudes have undermined some of the papers\u2019 certainties. \u201cWhen I look back at the words I used to use as a Sun sub,\u201d James Alan Anslow remembered, \u201c\u2018the gay plague\u2019, \u2018black gangs\u2019. You\u2019d get sacked if you used those now!\u201d</p> <p>Charlie Beckett detects a hard-nosed rationale behind this softening: \u201cIn a tightening market, you don\u2019t want to put off readers. When you had a circulation of four million, it mattered less if you said something racist, say, and put off 5% of your readers.\u201d Moreover, the tabloids have sometimes received disproportionate credit for their liberal moments. The Mail\u2019s much-praised campaigning for the truth about the racist murder in 1993 of the black teenager Stephen Lawrence sits uneasily with the endless xenophobic nudges of its immigration coverage.</p> <p>The tabloids still look much the same now as they did three decades ago. Redesigns have been much rarer and more cautious than at other papers. So have alterations to the basic tabloid prose style. \u201cYou know what you\u2019re going to get from the first sentence,\u201d says Beckett. \u201cThey haven\u2019t caught the conversational tone of the internet \u2026 their style is very clunky.\u201d David Deacon of Loughborough University says that in his research on election bias he finds that \u201cPeople are far more aware [now] of the narrative games, of tabloid-speak.\u201d The tabloids have always been self-conscious \u2013 \u201cIt\u2019s The Sun Wot Won It\u201d \u2013 but nowadays their political rages would be almost camp, if they did not have such consequences. As Baldwin puts it, the papers often read \u201clike a parody of themselves\u201d.</p> <p>Anslow, who is 65, said he sometimes sensed a nostalgia in the air at the Sun\u2019s offices. \u201cIf we do a special front page, people say, \u2018It\u2019s a real classic. It\u2019s just like the old days.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Two years ago, the paper moved from its old premises in east London, an intimidating compound of hulking, almost windowless blocks behind high-security fences, widely known as \u201cFortress Wapping\u201d, to a much blander, more generic office building in central London. Its glass-walled, approachable-feeling lobby faces directly on to the street. Down one side are blown-up photographs from various Murdoch publications. The Sun\u2019s is just a generic showbiz shot, as if the paper\u2019s political coverage is less of a priority nowadays. On the Sun and Mail websites, political stories are much less prominent than in their print editions.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn is 14 months into an experiment in ignoring the tabloids. It may well be doomed; but his leadership has already lasted longer than the tabloids expected, and their ceaseless attacks on him, like their shouting down of anyone who doubts Brexit will be a success, have a small undertone of anxiety about them.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"00019ddb76e32e5f9e22e148aa42199f851bfbb3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/00019ddb76e32e5f9e22e148aa42199f851bfbb3/0_0_3153_4055/778.jpg\" alt=\"Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn may be ignoring the tabloids but they are not reciprocating.\" width=\"778\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn may be ignoring the tabloids but they are not reciprocating.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Twenty-four years ago, the British political scientist Ken Newton pondered the multilayered puzzle of how newspapers and their readers relate politically, and produced perhaps the closest thing to an answer. \u201cThe press and its readers are likely to be mutually dependent,\u201d he wrote, \u201cinfluencing each other in a constantly shifting process of mutual adaptation.\u201d The tabloids may have adapted \u2013 a little \u2013 to their readers\u2019 changing attitudes, but the papers retain an old-fashioned suspicion of new kinds of Briton, and a nastiness towards people who do not fit their rigid worldviews. Above all, the tabloids remain stubbornly attached to the optimistic free-market ideas of the one prime minister that they have never turned against, Margaret Thatcher \u2013 an optimism that many of their readers have not felt since at least the 2008 financial crisis.</p> <p>This autumn, both the Sun and the Mail have responded to what the Mail\u2019s owner called a \u201cchallenging market\u201d for newspapers by making editorial redundancies. A Sun journalist emailed me: \u201cJust had massive compulsory redundos in editorial. Hardly enough bodies left to get out the paper. Mood is of the post-apocalyptic variety \u2013 survivors staggering around dazed and confused.\u201d</p> <p>Anslow, who started on the Sun 39 years ago, was one of those culled. Well before it happened, he told me he could imagine a Britain without tabloids \u201cwithin my lifetime\u201d. He went on: \u201cIf you take that kind of political communication away, we [Britons] will all go into our own ideological silos, because of the way social media works.\u201d</p> <p>More surprisingly, Tom Baldwin also fears that if the tabloids die, then what comes next could be worse. \u201cTheir political stories contain at least kernels of truth,\u201d he says. \u201cWithout the tabloids, we\u2019ll be in a totally post-truth world.\u201d But in a world without tabloid truths, perhaps other kinds of politics will have a chance.</p> <p>\u2022 Follow the Long Read on Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/gdnlongread?ref_src=twsrc^google|twcamp^serp|twgr^author\">@gdnlongread</a>, or sign up to the long read weekly email<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2015/jul/20/sign-up-to-the-long-read-email\"> here</a>.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Producing in-depth, thoughtful, well-reported journalism is difficult and expensive \u2013 but supporting us isn\u2019t.

Even liberal second amendment experts have called some of Clinton\u2019s explanations of her position \u201codd\u201d.</p> <p>As one law professor who supports gun rights put it, Clinton on guns is like a Republican politician who claims she supports abortion rights, even as she opposes Roe v Wade.</p> <p>At the final presidential debate last week, Clinton reiterated her position that the supreme court was wrong in its 2008 decision in District of Columbia v Heller, which overturned Washington DC\u2019s ban on handgun ownership, as well as a law that required other guns in homes to be \u201ckept nonfunctional\u201d.</p> <p>In a controversial 5-4 decision, the court ruled that Americans have a constitutional right to have and use firearms in their homes for self-defense.<br></p> <p>Clinton had <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/DemocraticDebate/story?id=4670271&amp;page=1\">dodged giving a clear answer</a> about her opinion of the ongoing case during a presidential primary debate in early 2008, though she suggested that the supreme court would probably find a full ban on handguns unconstitutional. But in 2015, the <a href=\"http://freebeacon.com/politics/leaked-audio-clinton-says-supreme-court-is-wrong-on-second-amendment/\">Washington Free Beacon reported</a>, Clinton told an audience at a private event that \u201cthe supreme court is wrong on the second amendment.

A Gallup poll from 2008 found that <a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/poll/105721/public-believes-americans-right-own-guns.aspx\">73% of Americans</a> believed the second amendment \u201cguarantees the rights of Americans to own guns\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/26/hillary-clinton-gun-rights-second-amendment\">Why gun rights advocates don't trust Clinton on the second amendment</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58111e09e4b0219a00d390b0\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-26T21:20:30.042Z\">10.20pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>With less than two weeks before the general election, Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign deployed one of its most potent weapons in the fight against Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump: Khizr Khan, the father of a Muslim war hero killed in the line of duty.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/jul/28/khizr-humayun-khan-donald-trump-video-democrat-convention\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/4p98f\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2624631\"            data-video-name=\"Father of Muslim American soldier: \u2018Donald Trump, you have sacrificed nothing\u2019 \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"AP\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-579aceebe4b075867609e4f3\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/07/29/160728father_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/07/29/160728father_synd_768k_vp8.webm\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/07/29/160728father.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2016/07/29/160728father_small.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2016/07/29/160728father_large.3gp\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/jul/28/khizr-humayun-khan-donald-trump-video-democrat-convention\">Father of Muslim American soldier: \u2018Donald Trump, you have sacrificed nothing\u2019</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Khan, a Gold Star father whose <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/29/khizr-khan-democratic-convention-constitution-trump\">impassioned speech</a> on the final night of the Democratic National Convention helped knock Trump down to his current position in the presidential race, spoke on Clinton\u2019s behalf to congregants and guests of a mosque in Norfolk, Virginia, home to the world\u2019s largest naval base and more than 60,000 active duty military personnel.</p> <p>\u201cThe courage [to speak against Trump] wasn\u2019t ours,\u201d Khan said at Masjid William Salaam, the first of three stops in Norfolk Khan made on Wednesday. \u201cThe courage was given to us.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPeople ask would I do it again,\u201d Khan continued. \u201cA million times - again and again and again - up until hatred and political bigotry is wiped out of this United States, we will continue to speak.\u201d</p> <p>Khan\u2019s son, Marine captain Humayun Khan, was killed in 2004 by a car bomb after instructing the soldiers under his command to fall back from the vehicle.

Nor is the fact that campaign reporters often start sourcing up to cover the next campaign the moment the current one ends.

Sheryl Crow\u2019s call to shorten our presidential cycle will resonate with just about everyone this year. Who isn\u2019t counting down the days until this is over?

By comparison, Canada had its <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/canadas-election-cycle-has-taken-less-than-three-months-and-canadians-are-tired-of-it/2015/10/18/b57ce852-7419-11e5-8d93-0af317ed58c9_story.html\">longest campaign season</a> in recent history last year, and it lasted just 11 weeks,\u201d she writes. \u201cCountries across the globe have limited campaign seasons to as short as 6 weeks. With an organized system, a successful, informative, professional campaign could be run.\u201d</p> <p>Her suggestion for how we reform our electoral process \u2013 that we ask the DNC and RNC to reform the process \u2013 is less compelling. In a segment on Morning Joe on Wednesday, she threw out 5 days as the optimal amount of time (was she joking?). And she\u2019s previously floated the notion that all 50 states and the District of Columbia should hold their primaries on the same day, a move that would prove hugely advantageous to the richest candidates by short-circuiting grassroots campaigns. [...]</p> <p>Again the sentiment is relatable but perhaps the problem is less the length of the cycle than the fact our Republican nominee for president actively brags about \u201cgrabbing\u201d women by the \u201cpussy\u201d; a fact which, it\u2019s worth noting, didn\u2019t come out until more than 500 days into the cycle.</p> <p>Read further:<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/26/sheryl-crow-short-presidential-election-cycle-bad-democracy\">A short US election cycle sounds great, but it wouldn't be good for democracy | Lucia Graves</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5810f4aae4b08d944ba4af82\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-26T18:24:40.172Z\">7.24pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Isn\u2019t it kind of cold in Wisconsin right now to be running around at night in your undies?</p> <p>This is in Platteville, a southwestern university town in Grant county, which Barack Obama won by 14 points in 2012. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/NBCNews/status/791341142277185537\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Man wearing only his underwear takes blowtorch to his neighbors&#39; Trump sign \u2014 and they caught it all on camera <a href=\"https://t.co/XxdHdjAveM\">https://t.co/XxdHdjAveM</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/mwWFZAwlBI\">pic.twitter.com/mwWFZAwlBI</a></p>&mdash; NBC News (@NBCNews) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NBCNews/status/791341142277185537\">October 26, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-10-26T18:28:46.515Z\">at 7.28pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5810f397e4b08d944ba4af7b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-26T18:21:34.401Z\">7.21pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Does anyone have any appetite for individual national polls anymore?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/JohnJHarwood/status/791342375692017664\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">new USA Today/Suffolk national poll: Clinton 47%, Trump 38%, Johnson 4%, Stein 2%</p>&mdash; John Harwood (@JohnJHarwood) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JohnJHarwood/status/791342375692017664\">October 26, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>The new Suffolk poll happens to <strike> mirror </strike> be 50% again as large as the margin in <a href=\"http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/pollster/2016-general-election-trump-vs-clinton\">HuffPost Pollster\u2019s average</a> [sorry, misread the #s at first]:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6509dc913a224691c77d930d963a53cba5d3a2e0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6509dc913a224691c77d930d963a53cba5d3a2e0/0_0_1500_948/1000.png\" alt=\"HuffPost Pollster\u2019s average for a head-to-head race.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"632\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">HuffPost Pollster\u2019s average for a head-to-head race.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: HuffPost Pollster</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-10-26T18:51:04.482Z\">at 7.51pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5810ec1fe4b0219a00d38fc5\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-26T17:50:02.341Z\">6.50pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>In which conservative Wall Street Journal columnist Peggy Noonan praises a get-out-the-vote video targeting Hispanic voters, paid for by an outside group, that ends with a dicey election result and a young girl asking her pap\u00ed, \u201ccan we stay?\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Peggynoonannyc/status/791328053758656512\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Put your stands, your decision, aside for a moment.

Mormon aversion to Trump and the independent candidacy of Evan McMullin have changed the calculus this time around. </p> <p><strong>Hillary Clinton</strong> has two rallies in Florida today, one in Palm Beach County in the south-east and one in Hillsborough County on the Gulf coast. <strong>Tim Kaine</strong> has two events in Pennsylvania, while <strong>Bill Clinton</strong> is diligently trying to put his wife over the top in North Carolina, with three stops there today after three stops there yesterday. <strong>Chelsea Clinton</strong> has three stops in Ohio, while senator <strong>Elizabeth Warren</strong> has an event in Pittsburgh.</p> <h2>Trump with narrow Florida edge \u2013 Selzer poll</h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2016-10-26/florida-poll\">A poll of likely voters</a> in Florida by gold-star pollster J Ann Selzer for Bloomberg politics has Trump slightly ahead of Clinton in the state, 45-43, when third-party candidates are included. That\u2019s within the margin of error of plus or minus 3.2 percentage points. Trump had 46% to Clinton\u2019s 45% in a head-to-head matchup. Clinton has a three-point lead in polling averages of the state. </p> <h2>Trump wants Biden behind barn</h2> <p>The campaign action overnight was typically nasty and nausea-inducing, with Trump saying that yes, he would like to go in back of the barn with Biden (Biden <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2016/oct/21/joe-biden-donald-trump-election-campaign-2016\">had said gym</a>), and campaign surrogate Newt Gingrich accusing Fox News host Megyn Kelly of having a \u201cfascination with sex\u201d because she takes the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/oct/18/donald-trump-sexual-allegations-nine-women-video\">women who say Donald Trump violated them</a> seriously.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/video/2016/oct/26/trump-says-he-would-love-to-beat-up-mr-tough-guy-joe-biden-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/599d2\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2841266\"            data-video-name=\"Trump says he would love to beat up 'Mr Tough Guy' Joe Biden \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-581013e6e4b0219a00d38b1c\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/10/26/161026trump-biden_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/10/26/161026trump-biden.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/10/26/161026trump-biden_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/video/2016/oct/26/trump-says-he-would-love-to-beat-up-mr-tough-guy-joe-biden-video\">Trump says he would love to beat up \u2018Mr Tough Guy\u2019 Joe Biden</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p></p> <p>The row on Tuesday night between Kelly and one of Trump\u2019s most stalwart supporters began when the host brought up the multiple <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/13/list-of-donald-trump-sexual-misconduct-allegations\">sexual assault and misconduct allegations</a> against the candidate.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMlC0-Ut8Ng\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/oMlC0-Ut8Ng?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>During the ensuing debate, which bordered on personal attack, Gingrich said the host was \u201cfascinated with sex\u201d and Kelly urged him to \u201ctake your anger issues and spend some time working on them\u201d.</p> <p>Dan Scavino, Trump\u2019s director of social media, later responded on Twitter, saying Kelly had \u201cmade a total fool out of herself\u201d and warning: \u201cWatch what happens to her after this election is over.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/DanScavino/status/791095922709200897\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">.<a href=\"https://twitter.com/megynkelly\">@MegynKelly</a> made a total fool out of herself tonight- attacking <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump\">@realDonaldTrump</a>.

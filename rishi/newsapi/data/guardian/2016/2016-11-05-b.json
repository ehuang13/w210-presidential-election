On Saturday, <a href=\"http://www.mcall.com/news/local/elections/mc-pa-poll-trump-clinton-toomey-mcginty-20161105-story.html\">a Morning Call poll</a> put Toomey up just 43% to 42% against the Democrat, Katie McGinty, in a race that could be key to deciding control of the Senate.</p> <p>Obama also admonished Toomey for his role in the current impasse over his supreme court nominee, Merrick Garland, saying: \u201cVoting to shut down the government and against bills to close the terrorist gun loophole isn\u2019t courage. And playing politics with the supreme court isn\u2019t courage.\u201d</p> <p>The same Morning Call poll put Trump six points behind Hillary Clinton in Pennsylvania, one of the states he would probably need to win the White House on Tuesday.

There\u2019s nothing too surprising about that \u2013 11 of the past 12 months have been the warmest of each month. Only July did not set a record \u2013 it had to be content with being the third-warmest July on record.</p> <p>The 12 months to September set a new high for the warmest 12-month period recorded (breaking the old record set in August) of 1.04C above the average of the 1951-1980. The same period in 1908 was 0.42C <em>below</em> the average.</p> <p>So things have changed.</p> <p>Back in 1908 there was also a US presidential election. There were no debates then but, ironically, the same number of questions on climate change were asked in this year\u2019s debates as back then \u2013 zero.</p> <p>We now have the prospect of a US president who either believes climate change is a hoax perpetrated by the Chinese, or at best believes it\u2019s just a hoax perpetrated by some vague group because \u201c<a href=\"https://www.factcheck.org/2016/11/the-candidates-on-climate-change/\">it\u2019s a money-making industry</a>\u201d.

Climate change at least was the topic of one question in the leaders\u2019 debate but it hardly dominated the election. And, like the US, we also have multiple politicians who fall at the first hurdle when it comes to intelligence by professing that climate change is a con.</p> <p>Mostly here, the topic comes up as the cause of blame \u2013 such as renewable energy being cited as the cause for the blackout in South Australia or even again this week with the announcement of the Hazelwood power station closing.</p> <p>As such, the discussion revolves around the negative aspect of the cost of policies that will reduce carbon emissions.

No, he\u2019s not the gibbering fool; he is just the appeaser of those fools within his government.

While the cost of living has traditionally been lower in places like Ripon, voters face the same soaring bills for essentials such as healthcare and college tuition.</p> <p>In the Democratic primary, Wisconsin was one of the 22 states that rejected Clinton in favour of Bernie Sanders.

McCain himself was to flip-flop over endorsing Trump as he sought to win a difficult nomination battle before pivoting to a much more diverse general electorate.</p> <p>On Thursday, at a community centre in Phoenix, Kaine gave a speech entirely in Spanish.

  "<p>The US is not the only western nation to be undergoing political ructions over the faltering post-crisis recovery.

Its unemployment rate is low and youth unemployment is the lowest in EU. But not everyone feels they are getting the benefits of Germany\u2019s stand-out performance. Wage growth has been relatively modest, and anger has intensified recently over meagre returns on savings as the European Central Bank cut key interest rates into negative territory. That has exacerbated grievances some Germans have long held over the euro, a union they feel benefits poorer countries more than their own.</p> <p>Animosity towards the single currency was behind the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/19/frauke-petry-acceptable-face-of-germany-new-right-interview\" title=\"\">founding of the populist Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland (AfD) party in 2013</a>.

So, surely, engaging an architectural practice south of the border to oversee the project would be politic?</p> <p>That\u2019s the thinking behind the Mexican architectural practice Estudio 314\u2019s proposal, which offers a distinctly Latin take on the Republican wall. A team of seven interns working under 314\u2019s creative director, Leonardo D\u00edaz Borioli and Hassanaly Ladha from the American experimental design lab the Mamertine Group, reimagined the border proposal in the spirit of the great 20th-century Mexican architect Luis Barrag\u00e1n.</p> <p>Barrag\u00e1n, who won the Pritzker prize in 1980 and died in 1988 at the age of 86, was known for combining simple, modernist designs with lyrical, spiritual flourishes, employing bright pinks, as well as other startling pastel shades, in his otherwise restrained works.</p> <p>Estudio 314\u2019s rendering adopts a Barrag\u00e1n colour scheme with an equally faithful lack of ornament, though the studio has a little fun with other features in this imaginative, uncommissioned proposal. This wall also encloses \u201ca prison where 11 million undocumented people will be processed, classified, indoctrinated, and/or deported\u201d, the studio explains, making reference to Trump\u2019s immigration plans. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5eb776a82142d8945230c01e3e9aa686e123ebd6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5eb776a82142d8945230c01e3e9aa686e123ebd6/0_333_2048_1228/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Interior view of the house and studio of Mexican architec Luis Barragan\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Interior view of the house and studio of the Mexican architect Luis Barrag\u00e1n.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: HO/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At other points, the wall could also accommodate a shopping mall, or even an observation terrace, where would-be migrants might look upon, but not touch, the Land of the Free.</p> <p>Of course the architectural practice, which is based in Barrag\u00e1n\u2019s birthplace of Guadalajara, does not sincerely believe its pink wall will break ground anytime soon.

And while Barrag\u00e1n may have approved of the pigmentation and the clean lines, there\u2019s very little else likely to endear the scheme to the late Pritzker laureate, including the flamboyantly haired client north of the border and his swingeing terms of payment.</p> <p>As the architecture critic Jonathan Glancey put it in a 2001 article, Barrag\u00e1n was a generous man. \u201cWhen he was asked to rebuild and extend a convent in Tlalpan not far from his own home, he paid for the extra work needed to give the resident nuns a special design far and above what they had expected. The result was a sensual, spiritual place influenced by the Court of the Myrtles at the Alhambra.\u201d</p> <p>It seems unlikely that, in years to come, anyone will be choosing similar words to describe this wall or its chief commissioner, no matter what the colour.</p>",

His former ghostwriter, <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/07/25/donald-trumps-ghostwriter-tells-all\">Tony Schwartz</a>, has pointed out how Trump\u2019s attacks on others aren\u2019t random, but constitute a precise inventory of his own faults: \u201cunstable\u201d, \u201creckless\u201d, \u201cbigoted\u201d, \u201ctrigger-happy\u201d, exhausted and prone to lying. </p> <p>As Sheena Monnin, the former Miss Pennsylvania sued by Trump after she criticized his Miss USA pageant, put it in <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2016/10/25/former-miss-pennsylvania-sheena-monnin-intv-sued-by-trump-sot-cooper.cnn\">an interview</a> with CNN: \u201cI have a degree in psychology, and I understand that underneath the bullying tactics, there\u2019s usually a lot of emptiness, and a strong need to feed the ego.\u201d </p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/2016/09/anxiety/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/2016/09/anxiety/boot.js\" data-alt=\"{&quot;chart&quot;:&quot;trump&quot;}\"> </figure>  <p>Trump told his biographer Michael D\u2019Antonio: \u201cI don\u2019t like to analyse myself, because I might not like what I see.\u201d But the rest of us haven\u2019t had much choice. Like a traffic pile-up, the candidate\u2019s involuntary self-exposure has been impossible not to gawp at. (On that note, the October APA survey found that the election was having a significant negative impact on productivity.)</p> <p>Yet throughout this intensely psychological election, psychology professionals have been restrained by a widespread, though fragmenting, consensus that Trump\u2019s mental health ought not to be discussed at all. </p> <p>This stance is most clearly expressed in the American Psychiatric Association\u2019s so-called <a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/psychiatrists-cant-tell-us-what-they-think-about-trump/\">Goldwater rule</a> \u2013 the prohibition on diagnosis-at-a-distance introduced following the incident in 1964 when 1,100 psychiatrists told a news magazine they believed that Barry Goldwater, the Republican candidate for president, was unfit for office. </p> <p>In a <a href=\"https://www.psychiatry.org/news-room/apa-blogs/apa-blog/2016/08/the-goldwater-rule\">finger-wagging statement</a> released in August (\u201cThe Goldwater rule: why breaking it is unethical and irresponsible\u201d), the APA\u2019s president, Maria Oquendo, reaffirmed the ban. But while there are certainly strong arguments in favour of it \u2013 it risks undermining public confidence in psychiatrists, and stigmatising people with mental illness \u2013 it\u2019s been far from obvious, in 2016, that these outweigh the ethical arguments for flouting it. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.vox.com/2016/8/12/12447742/diagnosing-trump-sham-psychology\">Writing in Vox</a>, the psychologist Cedar Riener compared psychiatrists disregarding the rule to a doctor diagnosing cancer \u201cjust by looking at my behaviour or public statements\u201d. But in the case of psychological disorders, unlike physical illnesses, behaviour and speech are always the primary sources of diagnostic data. And it has often seemed as if we might have more direct access to the darkest recesses of Trump\u2019s mind than to some of our closest friends.</p> <p>\u201cLike many Americans, I was more amused than alarmed by Trump at the beginning,\u201d says <a href=\"http://dohertyrelationshipinstitute.com/\">Bill Doherty</a>, a marriage and family therapist from Minnesota. But as the Trump movement picked up steam, Doherty happened to be travelling in Austria, where he encountered a neo-fascist political demonstration and visited a concentration camp. \u201cSo I did some reading about the responses of mental health professionals in Germany and Austria in the 1930s, and they were largely silent, and some were complicit.\u201d </p> <p>Upon his return, he wrote a manifesto \u2013 <a href=\"http://citizentherapists.com/\">Citizen Therapists Against Trumpism</a> \u2013 which more than 3,300 of his colleagues have now signed. Doherty insists this doesn\u2019t violate the Goldwater rule \u2013 he\u2019s condemning Trumpism as a threat to public health, not diagnosing Trump as, say, a <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/07/22/is-donald-trump-a-textbook-narcissist/\">narcissist</a> or <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2016/07/trump-and-sociopathy/491966/\">sociopath</a>, the disorders most frequently attributed to him. </p> <p>As \u201ccitizen therapists\u201d, Doherty says, \u201cwe must be willing to speak out on issues that affect the mental health of our clients, instead of just sitting in our offices and dealing with the fallout.\u201d </p> <p>Trump-induced distress is especially acute, he says, for anyone who has been exposed to a personality style like his \u2013 focused on bullying, scapegoating and the kneejerk demeaning of critics \u2013 earlier in their personal lives. His status as a presidential candidate \u201cbrings legitimacy to his way of relating to other people. There have always been personalities like Trump, but his power and the hundreds of people at his rallies say to anyone who has any psychological vulnerability that, yes, their fears were legitimate, and that there\u2019s no accountability for anyone who says and does these things. And that\u2019s exactly what\u2019s happened in their lives: there\u2019s been no accountability for the people who harmed them.\u201d</p> <h2>Daddy issues: \u2018a fantasy of being rescued by a powerful father figure\u2019</h2> <p>Beyond the confines of therapy, the rise of Trump has demonstrated more broadly how bad we are at understanding politics in psychological terms. For months, an <a href=\"http://www.vox.com/2016/8/15/12462760/trump-resentment-economic-anxiety\">almost entirely futile debate</a> between pundits has sought to establish whether Trump\u2019s supporters are motivated by economic anxiety or by racism, as if the two could be neatly distinguished and measured. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/2016/09/anxiety/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/2016/09/anxiety/boot.js\" data-alt=\"{&quot;chart&quot;:&quot;clinton&quot;}\"> </figure>  <p>For Jonathan Shedler, professor of psychiatry at the University of Colorado school of medicine, his appeal is better understood through the lens of \u201ctransference\u201d: in times of stress, whatever the complex blend of causes for that stress, people revert to a childhood desire for an omnipotent protector \u2013 an understandable need in young children, but dysfunctional in adulthood. </p> <p>\u201cTrump is benefiting from a childlike fantasy of being rescued by an all-powerful, larger-than-life father figure, so all of these qualities get attributed to Trump,\u201d he says. If the candidate\u2019s serially outrageous behaviour fails to alienate them, that\u2019s at least partly because the appealing qualities they\u2019re seeing aren\u2019t really in him; instead, \u201cthey\u2019re in the minds of the people who are doing the attributing, expressing their not-quite-conscious yearnings.\u201d</p> <p>Meanwhile, the question of whether Trump himself is suffering from a personality disorder is beside the point, Shedler argues \u2013 the consequence of trying to force our thinking about personality into a \u201cmedical model\u201d in which narcissism or antisocial attitudes, like cancer, are discrete diseases, invading an otherwise healthy body. But Trump\u2019s narcissism, insecurities and viciousness are intrinsic components of who he is, and they\u2019ve already damaged the world\u2019s wellbeing \u2013 whether or not they\u2019re best thought of as formal disorders.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/04/voters-experiences-us-2016-election-trump-clinton-campaign\">Pain, anger and fear: US voters deprived of a serious presidential election</a> </p> </aside>  <p>At a rally in Henderson, Nevada, earlier this month, Trump <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2016/10/donald-trump-campaign-waste-time-money-energy-if-lose-229206\">told supporters</a>: \u201cIf I don\u2019t win, this will be the greatest waste of time, money and energy in my lifetime, by a factor of 100.\u201d</p> <p>It was a fairly typical statement from Trump, in its profound self-absorption and total lack of interest in the impact of his victory or defeat on the country he proposes to lead.

Local TV and radio is dominated by ads for the campaigns. Both candidates have been through town several times, and it\u2019s easy to see why.

Unemployment across the state has fallen dramatically under Obama (although here John Kasich, Ohio\u2019s governor, a former Trump rival and a current critic, gets more credit) and in the state as a whole is just below the 4.9% national rate. In Mahoning County, unemployment is down from close to 14% in 2010 but is still close to 6%, and that number <a href=\"http://www.vindy.com/news/2016/oct/26/valleys-unemployment-rate-up--in-septemb/\">has risen close to a percentage point</a> in the last year.</p> <p>But for Clinton\u2019s opponents, this election is more about existential economics than macro trends. Rightly or wrongly, Democratic critics in the county question whether they can survive four more years of business as usual, as dictated from Washington by denizens of either stripe. Trump, at least, promises change.</p> <p>\u201cEven though he\u2019s not intellectually there, I don\u2019t think, on a lot of things, if he surrounds himself with the right people, which I\u2019m hoping and praying he does, if he gets elected, we\u2019re going to have this government running like a company, and that\u2019s the way it needs to be, I think,\u201d says Strimbu.</p> <p>This was once steel country.

Half the trucks he buys now are produced in Mexico. He has seen China \u201cdestroy our steel industry, our rubber industry, our textile industry, our electronic industries.

They cost $6m-$8m each and the company used to make four a year. It shipped two in 2015 and hasn\u2019t made one this year.<br></p> <p>\u201cMy biggest frustration is this: in 2007, before President Obama even became president, he ran on the platform that he was going to bankrupt the coal industry. He had a press conference where he literally declared war on coal. I do not believe in leading through punitive regulations, or punishing an industry into compliance with your agenda,\u201d she says.<br></p> <p>Mitchell believes in climate change and agrees it should be addressed but, she says, business should be incentivized to change. \u201cPunishing an industry into bankruptcy, leaving hundreds of thousands of hard-working Americans out of work. That doesn\u2019t make any sense to me,\u201d she says. Clinton, she fears, will simply continue in Obama\u2019s footsteps.<br></p> <p>At the same time as business has slowed, War Fab\u2019s costs have risen. The company\u2019s healthcare costs increased by 14% following the introduction of Obama\u2019s signature healthcare policy, the Affordable Care Act. A rule that covers the dependent children of insured workers up to the age of 26, touted as a boon for parents of college kids, has also led to the coverage of many of her workers\u2019 adult offspring even though they are not in school. If those legal adults don\u2019t have their own coverage, they turn to their parents\u2019 insurance. The average number of dependents on War Fab\u2019s insurance in 2012 was 2.2; in 2016 it is almost 4.9, and some of the ensuing costs have had to be passed on to workers.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/11/unemployment-obama/\" data-alt=\"unemployment chart\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/11/unemployment-obama/\">unemployment chart</a> </figure>  <p>The Federal Reserve\u2019s decision to dig its way out of the last recession with record low interest rates has also hurt War Fab. Low rates have led to a strong dollar and for the first time ever, the company is losing bids to Canada in terms of costs. \u201cI would lose whatever to China based on the labor and regulation rates. I used to always win those quotes from Canada. Now all that work is going north,\u201d she says.<br></p> <p>The cost of doing business in the US has become too high even for those who want to, says Mitchell. During the election, Trump has been hit several times for using Chinese steel in his building while railing against their trading practices. \u201cWell, we use Chinese steel too,\u201d she says. \u201cYou have to to survive.\u201d<br></p> <p>War Fab has remodeled and reshaped its business to meet the trends and Mitchell is confident she can do it again. But she says the federal government has done precious little to help and in the meantime she is denying work to a community crying out for it.

Historically, efforts to mobilize off-duty police officers to patrol voting places \u201chas had a chilling effect on African American and other minority voters\u201d, Kristen Clarke, president of the Lawyers\u2019 Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, said last week.

In Arizona, more than 1,000 local Republicans have signed up to be poll watchers, a fivefold increase since the last presidential election, state party spokesman Tim Sifert said, though it\u2019s not clear how many will actually show up. </p> <p>In Fort Worth, Texas, the county Republican party office has been fielding calls from supporters about poll watching, and they now have enough volunteers to put a Republican in some role in all of the county\u2019s 346 voting locations, county chairman Tim O\u2019Hare said. The number of Republican volunteers in previous years was \u201cnot even close\u201d, he said. \u201cIn any modern time, we\u2019ve never had somebody at every spot.\u201d</p> <p>In Virginia, Reagan George, a voter fraud prevention advocate who leads Republican poll watcher training sessions, said: \u201cFrom what I\u2019m gathering from the people I\u2019ve made contact with, they\u2019ve probably trained more people with this election than they have in 30 years.\u201d The state party did not respond to a request for comment. </p> <p>In Pennsylvania, where Trump has repeatedly made wild allegations of voter fraud, a state GOP spokeswoman said they had measured \u201ca small uptick\u201d in poll watcher registration since 2012. Local Republican officials in other battleground states downplayed the issue, with an Ohio Trump campaign spokesman saying the campaign would monitor voting activities \u201cas candidates from both parties in Ohio have done in every recent statewide and presidential election\u201d, and a Republican party spokeswoman from Michigan saying there was \u201cnothing different\u201d about poll watching this election cycle. </p> <p>The Republican National Committee is still being monitored by a federal judge over past alleged intimidation of minority voters. In 1981, the group sent armed off-duty law enforcement officers wearing \u201cBallot Security Task Force\u201d arm bands to patrol the polls in minority neighborhoods. Under a federal consent decree, the RNC is still banned from participating in any \u201cballot security\u201d programs \u201caimed at preventing voter fraud\u201d.</p> <p>The Democratic National Committee has been battling in court this week to prove that the RNC has violated this ban. In legal filings, lawyers for the RNC said it has nothing to do with Trump\u2019s proposed poll watching efforts and that it is abiding by its consent decree. It slammed what it called the Democrats\u2019 \u201ctabloid litigation tactics\u201d.</p> <p>While small-scale voter fraud has been documented, there is simply no evidence to support claims of widespread voter fraud or \u201celection theft\u201d, as others describe it. The Bush administration\u2019s own crackdown against the practice, led by the former attorney general Gonzales and lasting five years, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/22/us/how-charges-of-voter-fraud-became-a-political-strategy.html?_r=0\">resulted in just 86 convictions by 2007</a>, many of which were for minor infractions such as completing multiple voter registration forms. Researchers at the Loyola Marymount University <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2014/08/06/a-comprehensive-investigation-of-voter-impersonation-finds-31-credible-incidents-out-of-one-billion-ballots-cast/\">found just 31 instances of voter impersonation out of a billion votes cast</a> in numerous US elections between 2000 and 2014.</p> <p>Voting rights advocates have warned that 2016 will be the first presidential election <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/26/us/supreme-court-ruling.html\">since a 2013 supreme court ruling</a> severely weakened the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which offered significant legislative safeguards to African American, Latino and other minority voters. The ruling has also weakened the Department of Justice\u2019s authority and resources to monitor local polling places. The DoJ will still send \u201chundreds\u201d of monitors across the country and work \u201ccooperatively\u201d with local jurisdictions to \u201ckeep an eye on the proceedings\u201d, Vanita Gupta, the head of the department\u2019s civil rights division, told the Guardian in a statement.</p> <p>Some voters have already reported tense interactions at the polls during early voting. Alyssa Day, a New York Times-bestselling author who lives in Florida, said <a href=\"https://twitter.com/alyssa_day/status/793083990076952576?refsrc=email&amp;s=11\">she watched</a> an older white man scream insults at a young black woman inside a polling place on Monday in St Johns County. \u201cHe started yelling, \u2018She\u2019s a racist, she\u2019s a racist,\u201d and she was trying to explain he had said something offensive to her in the parking lot and she told him, basically, \u2018Leave me alone,\u2019\u201d Day told the Guardian. Inside the polling place, she said the man was shouting: \u201cI\u2019m going to sue you.\u201d</p> <p>The man appeared to be just another voter, not a poll watcher or affiliated with a campaign, Day said. A sheriff\u2019s deputy at the polling place quickly intervened, Day said, and the young woman was able to vote. But Day offered to walk the woman back to her car afterwards, she said. \u201cShe was shaken. I was very shaken,\u201d Day said. \u201cI think this election year has been so incredibly divisive, and that\u2019s carrying right into the polling places.\u201d</p> <p><em>Jason Wilson contributed reporting. </em></p>",

Mine is tremendous, incredible, doctors tell me I have the greatest dick of all time,\u201d Trump wrote in the first email, with photographic evidence.</p> <p>Reports say the two men sent one another more than 572,000 photos of their penises (the FBI has asked for a collective lobotomy after reviewing the evidence).

He thought it was because it smelled good.)</p> <p>Meanwhile President Clinton the second has appealed for calm (and help with setting up her White House email). As promised to the gods in return for ensuring her victory, she passes legislation that no member of the Kardashian family will be on TV again, ever. But trouble lies ahead: Ivanka, her heart filled with fury, vows to avenge her father. She doubles the size of her lifestyle website, which features coded messages that subliminally sow unrest and revolution.

Sisters in Kenya fighting against genital cutting, and sisters in Iraq building safe houses as fast as women are being taken and enslaved. Again and again there was one panicked question: is it possible that Donald Trump <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/01/barack-obama-samantha-bee-halloween-episode-trump\">could become president</a> of the United States?</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I want us to declare we are united and will never elect an assaulting, insulting, disgusting man to lead our nation</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>They are all trying to make sense of how a man like this could be on the brink of becoming the most powerful person in the world. A man who has openly admitted and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/07/donald-trump-leaked-recording-women\">bragged</a> that he can grab women without consent by their genitalia. A man who has now been accused by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/13/list-of-donald-trump-sexual-misconduct-allegations\">numerous women</a> of harassment or assault. A man who is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/12/donald-trump-jeffrey-epstein-alleged-rape-lawsuit\">fending off a lawsuit</a> from a woman who claimed she was raped by him as a 13-year-old. A man who has an ex-wife who claimed in a divorce deposition that he raped her.

Yes, we could have the first woman president. But more importantly this election will determine whether we stand against blatant misogyny, or whether we reward it. It is an election which has unleashed the subculture of sexual violence in America \u2013 and that could be our breakthrough, or our breakdown.</p> <p>They reminded me that next Tuesday, we have the power to direct this moment of truth. We as women have such difficulty believing that how we are seen and treated could be the central criteria for judging our candidates. Patriarchy has normalized our suffering, and made us terrified about speaking up. How often do we excuse the most oppressive, denigrating behavior of male leaders, because we believe there is something more important? We as woman often put everything else before ourselves.</p> <p>But this time it should be different. The truth despite the differences between us is that we are 50% of the population of the world. Women do two-thirds of the work of the world but get paid 10% of the income. If we were to start tomorrow refusing to nurse, serve, clean, teach, nanny, mother, organize, create, lead, support, sell, arrange, the world would come to a complete halt. Everything would crumble.</p> <p>There are an endless list of reasons not to vote for Donald Trump. By contrast, Hillary Clinton \u2013 for all her real flaws \u2013 is a woman who knows what it feels like to be hurt and humiliated by a womanizer. If we choose Trump and not her, all our years of struggle will be for naught. The culture under a Trump will be a Doris Lessing-esque nightmare. I don\u2019t want to spend the next four years using their language, playing in the cesspool of their degradation. I get to determine my own identity. I am done being traumatized.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jul/11/white-people-racism-america\">It's time for white people to reckon with racism | Eve Ensler</a> </p> </aside>  <p>You don\u2019t have to trust Hillary Clinton.

So much of the fury that Trump has unleashed is because all too many of us are perceived as breaking the chains of a society built on gender and race hierarchies.

  "<p>The capture of eastern Aleppo by Syrian rebels in July 2012 was a severe blow to the regime of Bashar al-Assad early in the country\u2019s civil war. Ever since, the brutal, attritional warfare wrought on Syria\u2019s second city has served as a microcosm of the wider conflict.</p> <p>Russia\u2019s pro-regime intervention in late September 2015 turned the military tide, allowing Assad to prioritise the isolation and eventual recapture of opposition-held districts. These already devastated areas now stand on the brink of a renewed offensive as Moscow tries to force a decisive victory for Assad while the US is preoccupied with its presidential election. </p> <p>This objective is ambitious \u2013 rebel fighters know the territory intimately and have had years to prepare for a street-by-street assault. But Moscow and Damascus know that a rebel defeat would be a psychological blow from which their cause might not recover. Aleppo is their last urban stronghold, and relegating the rebellion to a rural insurgency is a major aim of the regime.</p> <p>Using highly granular data tracking nearly 1,500 locations in Aleppo, it is possible to show how the stranglehold on the east of the city has tightened since Russia\u2019s intervention; and how even ceasefires appear to have been used strategically, with hostilities pausing only when the regime reached important waypoints.</p> <h2>Early October saw the familiar pattern of airstrikes, regime gains and then a pause</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--immersive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/11/aleppo-zip/giv-14067LSlVsXtZxiE/\" data-alt=\"October map\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/11/aleppo-zip/giv-14067LSlVsXtZxiE/\">October map</a> </figure>  <p>Since the collapse of the September ceasefire, regime forces backed by Russian airstrikes have continued their assault on Aleppo\u2019s eastern districts. The main theatres have been to the north of the rebel-held redoubt, where the regime continues to consolidate its control of roads which might be used to resupply the rebels, and in the south, where the regime has retaken an outlying district and resisted attempts by the rebels to link up with their allies in the western suburbs.<br></p> <p>A three-day ceasefire in mid-October was not long enough to evacuate civilians, but the intervening period has been relatively calm. The rebels sought to use this period to break the siege by shelling government-held areas of western Aleppo. Regime forces have fought back and limited the rebel gains, and all the while the Russians have signalled that they are preparing for a major offensive. A large Russian taskforce led by the country\u2019s sole sole aircraft carrier, Admiral Kuznetsov, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/26/russia-cancels-spanish-fuel-stop-for-syria-bound-warships\">has been sailing towards Syria</a>, and a Russian deadline for people to abandon eastern Aleppo expired on Friday night.</p> <h2>September\u2019s brief truce came only after pro-regime forces encircled the rebels</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--immersive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/11/aleppo-zip/giv-1406dLzSZO8bkIyh/\" data-alt=\"September map\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/11/aleppo-zip/giv-1406dLzSZO8bkIyh/\">September map</a> </figure>  <p>The nationwide ceasefire that began on 12 September was supposed to help deliver aid to besieged rebel-held areas and pave the way for an ambitious US-Russian air campaign against Islamic State and other extremist groups. Fighting did briefly subside but no aid made it through and the fragile truce collapsed on 19 September when a UN aid convoy was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/19/syria-ceasefire-is-over-says-countrys-military\">destroyed by an airstrike</a> widely believed to have come from Russian aircraft.

Breaking that link restored the siege of rebel-held districts, isolating 275,000 people who had been deprived of aid since July. The ceasefire froze this situation on the ground at a time advantageous to the Assad regime.</p> <h2>The ceasefire in late February was also preceded by key gains for the regime </h2>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--immersive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/10/archive-23-zip/giv-1406Dt5MyLGu3CBH/\" data-alt=\"Mar 1\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/10/archive-23-zip/giv-1406Dt5MyLGu3CBH/\">Mar 1</a> </figure>  <p>UN-brokered peace talks opened in Geneva in early February just as pro-regime forces began a major offensive north-west of Aleppo that was backed by the heaviest airstrikes since the Russian intervention began.

Moderate opposition groups were reluctant to disentangle from Jabhat Fateh al-Sham, which many fighters viewed as an effective military ally that may be able to protect them from airstrikes. </p> <p>A Russia and US-backed truce was in place by the end of February, by which point the regime had already significantly weakened rebel positions. Hostilities paused with conditions favourable to the regime, its gains in the countryside north of Aleppo cutting vital supply lines to Turkey. </p> <h2>At least 150,000 people fled the regime\u2019s February offensive north of Aleppo</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/10/archive-15-zip/giv-1406PEh2UKT8CM91/\" data-alt=\"Mar 1 disp\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/10/archive-15-zip/giv-1406PEh2UKT8CM91/\">Mar 1 disp</a> </figure>  <p>Entire settlements were emptied as pro-regime forces moved to eliminate the opposition\u2019s strategic depth in countryside between Aleppo and A\u2019zaz.

Today\u2019s Friday and the election\u2019s on Tuesday. That\u2019s soon. You read it here first. </p> <p><strong>Donald Trump is not giving up on Pennsylvania. </strong>His last event of the work week is scheduled to take place in Hershey, in Dauphin County, which Barack Obama won by six points in 2012 \u2013 better than his statewide average. Pennsylvania is a big prize. It awards 20 electoral votes \u2013 gives them every time to the Democrats, in fact, going back six elections. It would be a great win for Trump. But he appears to be losing there. We don\u2019t know what his internal polling says.

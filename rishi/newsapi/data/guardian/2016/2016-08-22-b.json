  "<p>Lawyers for Melania Trump are pursuing legal action against the Daily Mail for reporting \u201c100% false\u201d rumors that she worked as an escort in the 1990s as well as raising questions about her immigration status at the time.</p> <p>While Donald Trump has a reputation for threatening and pursuing litigation, it is unusual for a major party nominee or their spouse to mount legal action against a publication only months before an election.</p> <p>The Republican nominee\u2019s wife had <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MELANIATRUMP/status/761212858944421888?lang=en\">previously denied</a> a story in Politico<em> </em>in which questions about her immigration status were first reported but had not previously addressed the other accusations.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/04/melania-trump-nude-photos-work-visa-immigration\">Melania Trump denies working unlawfully as model in US on improper visa</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The suit comes in the wake of Trump launching an offensive against many media outlets, banning some such as Politico and the Washington Post from covering his rallies as well as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/feb/26/trump-pledges-curb-press-freedom-libel-laws-first-amendment\">calling for stricter libel laws</a> in the US. He also <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/25/donald-trump-media-ban-guardian-denied-entry-campaign-event\">banned the Guardian from attending an event in Scotland</a> after Trump took offence when reporter Ewen MacAskill questioned the Republican nominee about his allegedly \u201ctoxic\u201d politics. </p> <p>In a statement to the Guardian, Charles Harder, an attorney at the firm of Harder, Miller and Abrams which is representing Trump, said: \u201cThis law firm is litigation counsel for Melania Trump. Mrs Trump has placed several news organizations on notice of her legal claims against them, including Daily Mail among others, for making false and defamatory statements about her supposedly having been an \u2018escort\u2019 in the 1990s. All such statements are 100% false, highly damaging to her reputation, and personally hurtful. She understands that news media have certain leeway in a presidential campaign, but outright lying about her in this way exceeds all bounds of appropriate news reporting and human decency.\u201d</p> <p>Harder\u2019s not-quite-four-year-old Beverly Hills firm, Harder Mirell &amp; Abrams LLP, is perhaps best known for representing Hulk Hogan in the lawsuit that eventually <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/jun/10/gawker-media-bankruptcy-auction-hulk-hogan-lawsuit\">bankrupted Gawker Media</a>, which was sold at auction to media company Univision earlier in August. The suit was funded by Silicon Valley billionaire Peter Thiel, who spoke on behalf of Trump at the Republican national convention in Cleveland. Harder has also represented a number of other plaintiffs against Gawker as well; most recently, Harder has threatened a lawsuit against the now-defunct website because of <a href=\"http://gawker.com/now-peter-thiels-lawyer-wants-to-silence-reporting-on-t-1781918385\">an investigative report</a> about Donald Trump\u2019s hair.<br></p> <p>A spokesperson for the Daily Mail did not respond to a request for comment. </p> <p>Harder has since confirmed to the Guardian that Melania Trump is also considering filing lawsuits against other publications including Politico and the Week. Harder said that those publications are all \u201con notice\u201d and no suit has been filed yet. The Guardian has since learned that Politico has received a letter from Harder putting the publication on notice of a potential legal action. The lawyer\u2019s complaints <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2016/08/melania-trump-immigration-donald-226648\">related to a 4 August story </a>about Melania Trump\u2019s immigration status when she first came to the United States. For other publications, Harder did not specify which articles Melania Trump considered defamatory.</p> <p><em>Additional reporting by Sam Thielman</em></p>",

In a speech in Florida in August, Trump <a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2016-election/donald-trump-challenging-criminal-justice-reform-efforts-n632091\">condemned</a> Obama for commuting the sentences of non-violent drug offenders. </p> <p>\u201cSome of these people are bad dudes. These are people out walking the streets. Sleep tight, folks,\u201d Trump warned. In a tweet in July, Trump <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/754789482621243392\">compared</a> the US to \u201ca divided crime scene\u201d.<br><br>The New York real estate developer has long taken a draconian view of law and order. In 1989, Trump<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/feb/17/central-park-five-donald-trump-jogger-rape-case-new-york\"> ran newspaper advertisements</a> relating to the infamous Central Park Five case, in which five teenagers were wrongfully convicted of rape. The ads blared: \u201cBRING BACK THE DEATH PENALTY\u201d.<br></p> <p>In December 2015, Trump <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2015/dec/11/donald-trump-police-killers-death-penalty-video\">promised that</a>, if elected, he would change the law to make the death penalty mandatory for those convicted of killing a police officer. Any laws imposing a mandatory death penalty would, however, be unconstitutional under the supreme court\u2019s 1976 decision in <a href=\"http://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-supreme-court/428/153.html\">Gregg v Georgia.</a><br></p> <p>Trump <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/oct/13/donald-trump-police-body-cameras-federal-funding\">did, however, tell the Guardian </a>in an interview last year that he supported federal funding for police body cameras.<br></p>",
  "<p>Donald Trump\u2019s pivot is a tale of two hirings, and which one he gives more weight to will have a dramatic impact on the outcome of his campaign.</p> <p>Most analysis thus far has revolved around Breitbart News chairman Stephen K Brannon, who last week was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/17/donald-trump-stephen-bannon-breitbart-news-kellyanne-conway\">named</a> the campaign\u2019s chief executive. It was a move widely seen as a rebuke to the more traditional presidential campaign that the recently ousted Paul Manafort sought to implement.</p> <p>But the hiring of Manafort\u2019s actual replacement, seasoned GOP operative Kellyanne Conway, tells a very different story. Namely, that Trump is going to remain true to himself, only this time in a winning way.</p> <p>Conway, who started with the Trump campaign in July as an adviser to Manafort, has promised to do what Manafort could not: to \u201csharpen the message\u201d put forward by Trump, rather than try to rebuild his personality from scratch with a teleprompter \u2013 something she\u2019s previously described as being less about changing Trump than giving him choices. (In a July interview with the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/07/20/meet-the-woman-trying-to-fix-donald-trumps-image-with-women/\">Washington Post</a>, Conway compared her approach to the time she persuaded her daughter to swap out a turquoise Memorial Day outfit for a more flattering blue alternative.)</p> <p>That means Conway listening to Trump as much as he listens to her. And unlike a lot of women, conservative and otherwise, she\u2019s been willing to give him the benefit of the doubt, <a href=\"http://www.msnbc.com/hardball/watch/conway-all-issues-are-women-s-issues-746954819988\">recently telling MSNBC</a> \u201cI think you should judge people by their actions, not just their words on a political campaign trail\u201d. Whether Trump will be able to listen to and learn from Conway\u2019s guidance, however, remains to be seen.</p> <p>Listening to women has never exactly been Trump\u2019s strong suit, but now his entire campaign may hang in the balance of his ability \u2013 or more likely, lack of ability \u2013 to do just that.</p> <p>He started out strong in Charlotte last Thursday with a speech owning up to the \u201cpersonal pain\u201d caused by his past words. In <a href=\"https://www.donaldjtrump.com/press-releases/donald-j.-trump-remarks-in-charlotte-nc\">that speech</a>, he cast himself as the truthteller for forgotten Americans and a champion of those who feel the best is behind them. \u201cI am running to be the voice for every forgotten part of this country that has been waiting and hoping for a better future,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s the powerful protecting the powerful. The insiders fighting for the insiders,\u201d he said. \u201cI am fighting for you.\u201d</p> <p>Of course the pivot is about more than just rhetoric. In the weeks ahead, Trump has promised to follow the messaging up with a series of ads targeting the central themes of his campaign, like immigration, along with regularly scheduled policy addresses ahead of the upcoming debates.</p> <p>But Trump\u2019s campaign has always been longer on talk than substance, and this is a strategically wise picture for Trump to be painting: that he may be brash and uncouth from time to time, but he\u2019s fundamentally a guy who calls it as he sees it. In contrast, so the picture goes, to Clinton\u2019s politically correct doublespeak.</p> <p>In interviews following Trump\u2019s big speech, Conway drove home that messaging.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/08/19/donald-trump-maybe-finally-pivots-it-probably-wont-work/\">Speaking on CNBC Monday</a>, Conway sought to cast Clinton\u2019s reserved style as a measure of her supposed \u201cuntrustworthiness,\u201d contrasting it with Trump\u2019s energetic approach to rallies. Conway called Trump a man who \u201cenjoys himself on the trail,\u201d adding: \u201cHe gets oxygen from at being at these rallies [and] from giving these speeches\u201d. Meanwhile Clinton, she said, \u201clooks like she\u2019s not happy to be out there\u201d campaigning.</p> <p>Conway has a long list of success stories when it comes to this kind of retooling, from helping GOP lawmakers change the way they talk about rape to helping Trump\u2019s running mate Mike Pence polish his personality in ways that \u201ckept him comfortable in his own skin\u201d ahead of a gubernatorial reelection campaign, as Pence\u2019s communications director <a href=\"http://talkingpointsmemo.com/dc/can-kellyanne-conway-save-trump-from-himself\">recently told TPM</a>. </p> <p>In both cases, her coaching seems to have paid off, at least for a time: those GOP lawmakers walked into decidedly fewer self-sabotaging boobytraps in the <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2015/01/gop-rape-controversy-114524\">election cycle</a> following <a href=\"http://www.nationalreview.com/article/338042/ten-takeaways-gop-retreat-robert-costa-andrew-stiles\">the 2013 retreat</a> at which she spoke, and Pence\u2019s strong performance at the RNC last month was a bright spot in an otherwise blighted convention.</p> <p>But, in the words of Trump\u2019s old campaign manager Corey Lewandowski, to just \u201cLet Trump be Trump!\u201d is a somewhat fraught proposition.</p> <p>We\u2019re talking about a man who\u2019s called Rosie O\u2019Donnell a \u201cfat pig,\u201d Mexican immigrants \u201crapists,\u201d and dismissed a difficult line of questioning from a female moderator as being linked to \u201cblood coming out of her \u2026 wherever\u201d.</p> <p>Those are the kinds of lines Conway is hoping to help Trump steer clear of, much as she coached Congressional Republicans to stop uttering such politically suicidal lines as Todd Akin\u2019s comment about \u201clegitimate rape\u201d.</p> <p>With Trump, such lofty goals may be hopeless. No sooner had Conway begun to insist in interviews that \u201c<a href=\"http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2016/08/priebus-trump-tied-clinton.html\">the pivot that he\u2019s made is on substance</a>\u201d, than he proceeded to make a mockery of her claims.</p> <p>After she declared on ABC News\u2019 This Week With George Stephanopoulos, that Trump <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2016/08/trump-kellyanne-conway-insults-227239#ixzz4I4y\">\u201cdoesn\u2019t hurl personal insults</a>,\u201d for instance, he went out the next morning and cattily attacked the hosts of MSNBC\u2019s Morning Joe program, Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski, doubling down on the sexist rhetoric that\u2019s come to characterize his campaign. \u201cTried watching low-rated @Morning_Joe this morning, unwatchable!\u201d Trump <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/767685048703279104\">tweeted</a>. \u201c@morningmika is off the wall, a neurotic and not very bright mess!\u201d In a follow-up tweet he referred to Brzezinski as her cohost\u2019s \u201c<a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/767683204039974912\">very insecure longtime girlfriend</a>\u201d.</p> <p>With only two months left before the election and with Trump trailing Clinton significantly in the polls, one thing is certain: this is his last best chance to have any shot whatsoever at winning.</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/finland\">Finland</a> says it is close to concluding a defence cooperation agreement with the US, the latest in a series of steps the formally neutral Nordic country has taken to bolster its security in the face of heightened Russian military activity.</p> <p>The country\u2019s defence minister, Jussi Niinist\u00f6, <a href=\"http://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-finland-usa-defence-idUKKCN10X19Z\">said he hoped the deal</a> \u2013 incorporating joint military training, information sharing and research \u2013 would be signed before the US presidential election in November. </p> <p> \u201cIt\u2019s one of the reasons to have it done this autumn. But I\u2019m certain we will continue to work together with either one of main candidates winning,\u201d Niinisto told Reuters news agency. There was no immediate response from the Pentagon on a potential agreement.</p> <p> The deal would provide a framework for increased cooperation between the armed forces of the two nations but would not involve any binding commitment for either country to come to the defence of the other. Finland <a href=\"http://www.finlandtimes.fi/national/2016/07/10/28461/Finland,-Britain-sign-defense-protocol\">signed a similar agreement</a> with the UK in July. </p> <p> Sweden, the other Nordic country to have remained outside Nato, signed a defence cooperation agreement with the US in June. Leaders from both Sweden and Finland also <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-nato-summit-nordics-idUSKCN0ZO1EO\">took part in a Nato summit</a> last month in Warsaw, and their armed forces have taken part in Nato military exercises in the region as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/apr/13/russian-attack-planes-buzz-uss-donald-cook-baltic-sea\">nervousness has grown</a> around the Baltic over an increasing number of Russian military drills in the air and sea following Moscow\u2019s annexation of Crimea in 2014. Both Nordic states have already signed agreements that would make it easier for them to host Nato troops in a crisis, and they contributed troops to the Nato mission in Afghanistan. </p> <p> Russia has warned it would respond to any move by Finland or Sweden to join Nato. In a meeting with his Finnish counterpart in early July, Vladimir Putin claimed (wrongly) that Russian troops <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://en.special.kremlin.ru/events/president/transcripts/52312\">had been withdrawn</a> 1500km from the Finnish border, but suggested that decision would be reviewed if Finland moved towards Nato membership. Russia\u2019s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.newsweek.com/russias-lavrov-warns-sweden-nato-membership-453890\">said in April</a> that Russia would reassess its troop deployments along its northern flank if Sweden joined the alliance. </p> <p> In a recent defence policy review, Finland, which has a 800-mile border with Russia, said it would leave open the option of joining Nato, but a panel of experts warned that any such move would trigger a \u201charsh\u201d Russian reaction, and opinion polls show that a majority of Finns oppose Nato membership. </p> <p>Dmitri Trenin, the director of the Moscow Centre of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace described the proposed Finnish-US agreement as \u201ca significant \u2013if at this point largely symbolic \u2013 step.\u201d<br></p> <p>\u201cUnlike in the days of the Cold War, Finland is no longer \u201cneutral\u201d between Russia and the West,\u201d Trenin added. \u201cThey know which side they are on, and are not shy to demonstrate it. However, they are careful not to create more problems for themselves even as they move closer to the US/NATO. Their position from now on can be compared to that of Sweden during the Cold War: an undeclared member of the Western alliance.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>The director of the Cincinnati zoo has pleaded with people to stop making memes and humorous online comments about Harambe, the gorilla that was shot and killed after a child fell into its enclosure, because of the effect upon grieving staff.<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/30/gorilla-shot-cincinnati-zoo-child\">Cincinnati zoo director: shooting gorilla to protect child was 'right decision'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cOur zoo family is still healing,\u201d Thane Maynard said on Monday.</p> <p>Online interest in Harambe has flowered since May, when the 17-year-old male western lowland gorilla <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/30/gorilla-shot-cincinnati-zoo-child\">was shot</a> after a three-year-old boy fell into his enclosure after climbing over a barrier that has since been heightened.

Firstly the recent economic news from the world\u2019s biggest economy has been pretty good. Secondly Yellen\u2019s No 2 at the Fed, <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-08-21/fischer-signals-2016-rate-hike-with-economy-nearing-fed-goals\">Stanley Fischer, made some hawkish comments at the weekend</a> which left a clear impression that an increase in borrowing costs this year remained on the agenda.</p> \n<p>Predictably the idea that the Fed is contemplating a rate rise while all the other major central banks are looking to provide more stimulus led to a stronger US dollar and weaker commodity prices.</p> \n<p>But, as Wall Street should not need to be reminded, we have been here before. At the start of the year there was speculation that there would be four increases in interest rates during the course of 2016. So far there have been none. The Fed has given strong signals that interest rates are going up only to back away again in the face of downbeat economic data.</p> \n<p>Three possible dates have been pencilled in by the markets for a Fed move: September, December and March next year. September will be a non-starter unless Yellen comes up with some uncharacteristically tough and unequivocal words in Jackson Hole. She is is an instinctive dove, doesn\u2019t especially want to see the dollar appreciate rapidly is and politically smart to boot. A September rate rise would come smack in the middle of the presidential election race.</p> \n<p>It is more probable that the choice is between December and March. The recent data points to December.

That is a major addition to the 30,000 emails that Clinton\u2019s lawyers considered work-related and returned to the department in December 2014.</p> <p>The FBI cleared Clinton of criminal conduct but found her to have have been \u201cextremely careless\u201d, and the saga continues to dog her. On 5 August the FBI completed a transfer of several thousand previously undisclosed work-related emails for the state department to review and publish.<br></p> <p>Responding to the news, the Republican National Committee chairman, Reince Priebus, said Clinton \u201cseems incapable of telling the truth\u201d.</p> <p>State lawyers told federal judge James Boasberg on Monday they expected to release the emails in batches on 14, 21 and 28 October and 4 November. The election, against Republican nominee Donald Trump, takes place on 8 November.</p> <p>Boasberg ordered that the department should aim for a more ambitious deadline. The judge set another hearing for 22 September, so progress can be reviewed.</p> <p>Tom Fitton, president of the conservative legal group <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/20/hillary-clinton-email-server-judge-order-judicial-watch\">Judicial Watch</a>, which brought the case under a Freedom of Information Act (Foia) request, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TomFitton/status/767698374124572672\">tweeted</a>: \u201cFBI found almost 15,000 new Clinton documents. When will state release them?\u201d </p> <p>Another federal judge, Emmet Sullivan, last week <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/20/hillary-clinton-email-server-judge-order-judicial-watch\">ordered Clinton</a> to answer written questions from Judicial Watch. Her answers are not due until after the presidential election.</p> <p>The state department claims it is \u201cprioritizing\u201d the appraisal of the new batch of emails while assessing how many are related to government business and how many are personal. Lawyer Lisa Olson told the court: \u201cWe are aiming to complete the appraisal by the first week of October.\u201d She described the target as \u201cextraordinarily ambitious\u201d.</p> <p>The 14,900 documents are contained on the first of seven computer disks. The number of documents on all such disks is unknown but according to Olson it runs to \u201ctens of thousands\u201d. Boasberg ordered that the department should concentrate on the first disk for now.</p> <p>Judicial Watch filed the lawsuit in May 2015, after disclosures that Clinton had exclusively used a personal email server while secretary from 2009 to 2013.</p> <p>Following the court hearing, Priebus said: \u201cHillary Clinton seems incapable of telling the truth. Clinton\u2019s pattern of serial dishonesty is completely unacceptable for a candidate seeking the nation\u2019s highest office, and her refusal to tell the truth and own up to her poor judgment is a preview of how she would conduct herself if elected president.</p> <p>\u201cEven worse, this news comes on the heels of the Clinton camp falsely trying to pin her email woes on Colin Powell, raising serious questions about whether she lied to the FBI.\u201d</p> <p>Former secretary of state Colin Powell has pushed back against Clinton\u2019s claim, first <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/19/us/politics/hillary-clinton-told-fbi-colin-powell-advised-her-to-use-private-email.html?_r=0\">reported in the New York Times</a>, that he advised her to use a private email account.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.people.com/article/colin-powell-hillary-clinton-pinning-email-scandal-on-him\">He told People magazine</a>: \u201cHer people have been trying to pin it on me. The truth is, she was using [the private email server] for a year before I sent her a memo telling her what I did.\u201d</p> <p>Powell told NBC News <a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/clinton-told-fbi-colin-powell-recommended-private-email-sources-n634136\">last week</a> he sent a memo to Clinton \u201cdescribing his use of his personal AOL email account for unclassified messages and how it vastly improved communications within the state department\u201d.</p> <p>The Times said its report was based on a leak by Congress of notes from a classified interview.</p> <p>At a White House press briefing, press secretary Josh Earnest said: \u201cLike the president, I don\u2019t have any insight into any conversations that may have taken place between Secretary Clinton and General Powell, so I\u2019m afraid I can\u2019t shed any light on that for you.\u201d</p> <p>Priebus added: \u201cThe process for reviewing these emails needs to be expedited, public disclosure should begin before early voting starts, and the emails in question should be released in full before election day.\u201d</p> <p>A Clinton spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment.</p>",
  "<p>JK Rowling has sung the praises of a recent study which found that reading the Harry Potter books lowers Americans\u2019 opinions of Donald Trump.</p> <p>The bestselling novelist has already made her feelings on Trump clear, <a href=\"http://www.jkrowling.com/en_GB/#/timeline/on-monsters-villains-and-the-EU-referendum\">writing in an open letter in June</a> that the presidential candidate is \u201cfascist in all but name\u201d. \u201cHis stubby fingers are currently within horrifyingly close reach of [the US\u2019s] nuclear codes. He achieved this pre-eminence by proposing crude, unworkable solutions to complex threats. Terrorism? \u2018Ban all Muslims!\u2019 Immigration? \u2018Build a wall!\u2019,\u201d wrote Rowling. \u201cHe has the temperament of an unstable nightclub bouncer, jeers at violence when it breaks out at his rallies and wears his disdain for women and minorities with pride. God help America. God help us all.\u201d</p> <p>This weekend, Rowling pointed on Twitter <a href=\"http://iscap.upenn.edu/studies/harry-potter-and-deathly-donald\">to a study</a> into whether reading the Harry Potter books influences Americans\u2019 attitudes to Trump. Harry Potter and the Deathly Donald was recently published in <a href=\"http://www.apsanet.org/ps\">PS: Political Science and Politics</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/jk_rowling/status/766683212810690560\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">So anyway, this has made my day.<a href=\"https://t.co/mJSCdHLVPz\">https://t.co/mJSCdHLVPz</a></p>&mdash; J.K.

She also discovered that each Potter book that her respondents had read lowered their feelings about Trump by two to three points on the 100-point scale.</p> <p>\u201cThis may seem small,\u201d she said. \u201cBut for someone who has read all seven books, the total impact could lower their estimation of Trump by 18 points out of 100.\u201d</p> <p>Mutz said that even when she controlled for issues including gender, education and age, all of which predict Americans\u2019 attitudes to Trump, the \u201cHarry Potter effect\u201d remained.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/dec/08/jk-rowling-on-donald-trump-voldemort-was-nowhere-as-bad\">JK Rowling on Donald Trump: 'Voldemort was nowhere as bad'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Mutz writes in the study that similarities between Trump and Potter\u2019s nemesis Voldemort \u201chave not gone without notice during the 2016 campaign\u201d, with the term Trumpdemort gaining traction, and \u201ceven Trump supporters \u2026 buying into the analogy, purchasing Trump posters featuring their candidate in front of an American flag as backdrop, with a quote from the Dark Lord himself: \u2018There is no good and evil, there is only power, and those too weak to seek it.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>She points out similarities between the fictional wizard and the Republican candidate for president, including how Voldemort \u201csupports the eradication of mixed blood wizards\u201d, and how \u201cin comparison, Donald Trump has called for a temporary moratorium on Muslim immigration\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIt may simply be too difficult for Harry Potter readers to ignore the similarities between Trump and the power-hungry Voldemort,\u201d she writes in the study.</p> <p>Mutz found that the Potter films, by contrast, did not lead to Trump opposition \u2013 possibly, she believes, because \u201creading inherently requires much higher levels of attention and allows for greater nuance in characters, many of whom are neither wholly good nor wholly bad\u201d, and \u201cdue to length, movies must leave out material from the full books, and they are more likely to emphasise action over the characters\u2019 internal dilemmas and introspection\u201d. </p> <p>Mutz ends her study by speculating that \u201cthese findings raise the hope that Harry Potter can stop the Deathly Donald and make America great again in the eyes of the world, just as Harry did by ridding the wizard world of Voldemort\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThroughout the series, love and kindness consistently triumph over aggression and prejudice,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a powerful, positive theme, and thus not surprising that readers understand the underlying message of this storyline, and are moved by it. These pro-unity views come through loud and clear in the storyline and have also been publicly voiced by the author of the series, JK Rowling, who has \u2026 espoused anti-Brexit and anti-Trump political views. Harry Potter\u2019s popularity worldwide stands to make a difference not just in the US election, but in elections across Europe that involve aggressive and domineering candidates worldwide.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/video/2016/may/17/jk-rowling-donald-trump-freedom-pen-america-gala-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/4ja6v\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2507193\"            data-video-name=\"JK Rowling defends 'objectionable' Donald Trump\u2019s freedom to speak \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"PEN American Center\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-573b09b4e4b05be498d5fba5\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/05/17/160517JKRowling_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/05/17/160517JKRowling_synd_768k_vp8.webm\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2016/05/17/160517JKRowling_small.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/05/17/160517JKRowling.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2016/05/17/160517JKRowling_large.3gp\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/video/2016/may/17/jk-rowling-donald-trump-freedom-pen-america-gala-video\">JK Rowling defends \u2018objectionable\u2019 Donald Trump\u2019s freedom to speak</a></figcaption> </figure>",
  "<p>In a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/02/hillary-clinton-donald-trump-speech-foreign-policy-security\">speech in San Diego recently</a>, Hillary Clinton asked: \u201cDo we want his [Donald Trump\u2019s] finger anywhere near the button?\u201d She was doubtful that her Republican rival was really the guy you wanted to unleash <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_weapons_and_the_United_States\">America\u2019s arsenal of nuclear warheads</a> which has thousands of times the destructive force of the weapons that obliterated Hiroshima and Nagasaki 71 years ago this month.</p> <p>Certainly, her opponent\u2019s nuclear strategy, if that\u2019s not too strong a word, is nothing if not maverick. \u201cSomebody hits us within Isis, you wouldn\u2019t fight back with a nuke?\u201d <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/04/world/donald-trump-nuclear-weapons.html?_r=0\">Trump asked in March</a>. He was also <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2016/aug/03/trump-clinton-campaign-election-2016-live?page=with:block-57a202c9e4b031196bf5bc88#block-57a202c9e4b031196bf5bc88\">reported</a> as saying of nuclear weapons: \u201cIf we have them, why can\u2019t we use them?\u201d On an interview with MSNBC in March, his interviewer told Trump that nobody wanted to hear that \u201ca guy running for president of the United States talking of maybe using nuclear weapons\u201d. To which <a href=\"http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2016/08/donald-trump-nuclear-weapons\">Trump replied</a>: \u201cThen why are we making them? Why do we make them?\u201d</p> <p>This sort of stuff has been too much, for some Republicans. One of them is John Noonan, who worked for many years as a Minuteman III nuclear launch officer under the Wyoming tundra, hoping never to receive a particularly urgent call from presidents Bush or Obama. He is not voting for Trump because he thinks the Republican is too irrational and doesn\u2019t understand nuclear deterrence strategy that, in his view, has spared the world from destruction since 1945. \u201cThe very point of nuclear weapons is that they are never used,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-noonan-trump-nuclear-20160809-snap-story.html\">wrote Noonan in the LA Times earlier this month</a>. \u201cWe have them to dissuade hostile powers from attacking us, and vice versa.</p> <p>\u201cI sat at my post believing, through both the Bush and Obama administrations, that the president was fundamentally rational and would never ask me to do my terrible duty. Not unless the country was in the direst of national emergencies. With Trump as president, the young men and women who are assigned to our nuclear forces will have no such assurances.\u201d</p> <p>To be fair, maybe Trump does understand something of the mind-boggling, games-theory-based logic underpinning deterrence strategy. He was <a href=\"https://thinkprogress.org/9-terrifying-things-donald-trump-has-publicly-said-about-nuclear-weapons-99f6290bc32a#.7d54x6q0i\">asked on CBS in March</a> when should the US use nuclear weapons. \u201cWell, it is an absolute last stance. And, you know, I use the word unpredictable. You want to be unpredictable.\u201d The corollary? If you\u2019re too predictable, then the enemy can get the nuclear jump on you.</p> <p>In another interview, Trump was asked if he would nuke Europe. \u201cEurope is a big place,\u201d he replied airily. \u201cI\u2019m not going to take cards off the table.\u201d</p> <p>What Clinton must have known better than most when she made her San Diego speech is that Donald Trump will never get his fingers on the nuclear button. Not because the polls suggest she will trounce him in November, but rather because it is merely a figure of speech. In a 1980s Spitting Image sketch, Ronald Reagan had two buttons at his bedside. One was labelled \u201cnurse\u201d, the other \u2013 inadvertently pressed \u2013 labelled \u201cnukes\u201d. In reality, there is no such thing as the president\u2019s nuclear button.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/aug/19/donald-trump-bit-like-us-oliver-burkeman\">Is there a bit of Donald Trump in all of us? | Oliver Burkeman</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Every US president since John F Kennedy has been equipped with a nuclear biscuit and a nuclear football. It\u2019s what the US president does with them that decides whether the rest of us should plan for tea or armageddon.</p> <p>The so-called nuclear biscuit is a credit-card-sized piece of plastic containing the codes the president needs to order the launch nuclear weapons. The president is supposed to carry the biscuit at all times, though there are reports that in the 1970s Jimmy Carter <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/8077326/Bill-Clinton-lost-vital-White-House-nuclear-codes.html\">inadvertently lost his when a suit was sent to the dry cleaners</a>.</p> <p>Worse was to happen 20 years later under Bill Clinton\u2019s presidency when, according to General Hugh Shelton, who was chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff at the time, \u201cthe codes were actually missing for months\u201d. Shelton wrote in his memoir Without Hesitation: \u201cThat\u2019s a big deal \u2013 a gargantuan deal.\u201d You think? Indeed, one of Clinton\u2019s former military aides, Lt Col Robert \u201cBuzz\u201d Patterson, recalled that the morning after the Monica Lewinsky sex scandal broke, he asked the president for the card so that he could supply an updated version.

We called upstairs, we started a search around the White House for the codes, and he finally confessed that he in fact misplaced them. He couldn\u2019t recall when he had last seen them.\u201d These were, we realise in hindsight, perturbing hours for humanity, since it is only when the Pentagon and nuclear launch officers hear these codes that will they know for certain that the person on the line is really the president rather than, say, an Obama impersonator working for Kim Jong-un.</p> <p>There may be some of you already suspecting that humanity\u2019s best hopes for surviving a Trump presidency is to send his suits for dry cleaning before he gets to empty the pockets, or tuck the nuclear biscuit down the back of an Oval Office sofa while the president is distracted arranging his hair.</p> <p>As for the nuclear football, it comes into active service when the president leaves the White House. It is the nickname for a large leather, aluminium-framed briefcase weighing 20kg which is hefted by a military aide who shadows the US commander in chief.</p> <p>It is, <a href=\"http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/real-story-football-follows-president-everywhere-180952779/\">as former Washington Post reporter Michael Dobbs calls it</a>, \u201cthe ultimate power accessory, a doomsday machine that could destroy the entire world\u201d. The late Bill Gulley, a former director of the White House Military Office, described what\u2019s inside the nuclear football in his 1980 memoir Breaking Cover. \u201cThere are four things in the football. The Black Book containing the retaliatory options, a book listing classified site locations, a manila folder with eight or 10 pages stapled together giving a description of procedures for the Emergency Broadcast System, and a three-by-five inch card with authentication codes.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"bd7898de1e0bd71f8798438414c382eedc91aba7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bd7898de1e0bd71f8798438414c382eedc91aba7/0_683_2953_3691/800.jpg\" alt=\"The nuclear football in Red Square during Reagan\u2019s visit.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The nuclear football in Red Square during Reagan\u2019s visit.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bettmann/Bettmann Archive</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The nuclear football has an antenna protruding from it, likely indicating that inside there is a communication system with which the president can maintain contact the Pentagon\u2019s National Military Command Centre which monitors worldwide nuclear threats and can order an instant nuclear response. \u201cThe football,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/real-story-football-follows-president-everywhere-180952779/\">says Dobbs</a>, \u201calso provides the commander-in-chief with a simplified menu of nuclear strike options \u2013 allowing him to decide, for example, whether to destroy all of America\u2019s enemies in one fell swoop or to limit himself to obliterating only Moscow or Pyongyang or Beijing.\u201d Or, presumably, Milton Keynes.</p> <p>One of Ronald Reagan\u2019s aides even carried the nuclear football across Red Square during a presidential visit to Moscow. In principle, Reagan could have ordered a first strike on the Soviet Union at that moment. In any case, Reagan\u2019s Soviet counterpart, Mikhail Gorbachev, was also accompanied during the visit by a military aide holding a very similar bag, known in Russian as the chemodanchik, or \u201clittle briefcase.\u201d</p> <p>Over the years there have been several nuclear footballs, all manufactured for the White House by <a href=\"http://zerohalliburton.com/#\">Zero Halliburton</a>, the Utah firm that also supplied aluminium briefcases <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20120314205312/http://www.zerohalliburton.com/index.php?dispatch=pages.view&amp;page_id=17\">for movies</a> like Men in Black II, Air Force One and perhaps less reassuringly, Dude, Where\u2019s My Car? and Spy Kids. Today, visitors to the Smithsonian\u2019s National Museum of American History in Washington can see a retired nuclear football and, if so minded, salute its gallant contribution to global security.</p> <p>The nuclear football came into active service after the 1962 Cuban missile crisis when President Kennedy worried how the Pentagon and nuclear launch officers would be sure that it was really the president ordering a strike. Declassified documents <a href=\"https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=2pEQpx8CB7oC&amp;pg=PA294&amp;lpg=PA294&amp;dq=%E2%80%9CWhat+would+I+say+to+the+Joint+War+Room+to+launch+an+immediate+nuclear+strike?%E2%80%9D&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=jfksuHVMEc&amp;sig=PBJ_MNOo84HEPyBBVN1PAw1C-pA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjbuaP8lrfOAhXIShQKHXF1CNQQ6AEIKjAC#v=onepage&amp;q=%E2%80%9CWhat%20would%20I%20say%20to%20the%20Joint%20War%20Room%20to%20launch%20an%20immediate%20nuclear%20strike%3F%E2%80%9D&amp;f=false\">reveal his concerns</a>: \u201cWhat would I say to the Joint War Room to launch an immediate nuclear strike?\u201d Kennedy asked. \u201cHow would the person who received my instructions verify them?\u201d</p> <p>Now, long after the end of the cold war, the man bag still shadows the president on his or her travels. There are in fact three nuclear footballs \u2013 one kept near the president when they leave the White House, another for the vice-president and a third kept in storage in the White House. The nuclear football is not handcuffed to aides, as some have claimed, but has a leather cinch strap <a href=\"https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/138042614/\">that can be looped around the wrist</a>.</p> <p>Why is the briefcase nicknamed the nuclear football? According to former US secretary of defence Robert McNamara, it was so-named because it was part of an early nuclear war plan code-named Operation Drop Kick.</p> <p>In Stanley Kubrick\u2019s 1964 nuclear black comedy Dr Strangelove, there is also an Operation Drop Kick. It denoted a nuclear exercise that goes wrong when the unhinged US general played by Sterling Hayden orders a first strike on the Soviet Union. All the president\u2019s men strive to recall the bombers to prevent nuclear politics. As you know (spoiler alert!), they fail and the film concludes with Major TJ \u201cKing\u201d Kong played by Slim Pickens, dropping from Russian skies astride a nuclear weapon.</p> <p>In reality, happily, Operation Drop Kick hasn\u2019t resulted in nuclear catastrophe. That said, there have been nuclear-football fumbles. Peter Metzger, a former marine who was one of five military aides charged with carrying the nuclear football for Reagan, recently recalled that once a colleague steered him into a different lift from the president and tricked him into thinking he had missed the motorcade. Metzger said his heart was racing \u201clike a gerbil in a cage\u201d until he realised his colleague was playing a practical joke.</p> <p>Metzger said that carrying the nuclear football is a worrisome responsibility. \u201cThe result of a decision the president would make is so grotesquely horrible \u2013 it would change the face of the earth, it would change humanity, it would change mankind,\u201d <a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/2016/08/06/politics/nuclear-football-president-button/\">he said</a>. \u201cI guess when you\u2019re on duty, you try not to think of the import of that. But you are fully prepared to do so if you have to.\u201d</p> <p>Robert Patterson, who carried the football for Clinton, said: \u201cYou\u2019re always kind of on edge. I opened it up constantly just to refresh myself, to always be aware of what was in it, all the potential decisions the president could possibly make.\u201d</p> <p>Last year, one of the nuclear football\u2019s trusty carriers, ex-marine John Kline, even used footage of the bag in a TV ad to help his campaign for re-election to Congress. \u201cIn this briefcase lies the fate of the world,\u201d <a href=\"http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/washington/2005-05-05-nuclear-football_x.htm\">went the voiceover</a>. \u201cIt contains top-secret codes to launch a nuclear strike.

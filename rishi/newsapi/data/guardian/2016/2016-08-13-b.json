  "<p>Gary Johnson \u2013 the Republican-leaning, marijuana-smoking, Everest-climbing presidential nominee of the Libertarian party \u2013 has a problem: he will be barred from crucial election TV debates this autumn unless he can boost his polling numbers to 15%, from around 10% now.</p> <p>Without the blockbuster ratings that the three scheduled Clinton-Trump dust-ups are likely to produce, many say it\u2019s hard to see how Johnson, 63, or either of the two other third-party candidates \u2013 Jill Stein of the Green party and Evan McMullin, a former CIA officer and policy director for the House Republican Conference \u2013 can ever be anything more than electoral curiosities.</p> <p>But other commentators suggest that the emergence of three independent candidates could still provide an unpredictable twist. Polling data suggests libertarians on both sides of the political divide are giving independent candidates a second look.</p> <p>In Las Vegas on Friday, Johnson and Stein spoke before a gathering of Asian-American and Pacific islander voters to press their case. Johnson, a former governor of New Mexico who presents a platform of social libertarianism, fiscal conservatism and non-interventionism in foreign affairs, reasoned at the gathering that in this, \u201cthe craziest election of all time\u201d, one indication of the craziness was that \u201cI might be the next president of the United States\u201d.</p> <p>A just-released <em>Wall Street Journal</em>-NBC poll gives Johnson 15% in the crucial swing state of Colorado, and Stein 6%. Johnson said he had been asked repeatedly if a vote for him, or any third-party candidate, was a wasted vote. \u201cA wasted vote is voting for somebody you don\u2019t believe in. That\u2019s a wasted vote,\u201d Johnson said in Vegas. \u201cVote for the person you believe in \u2013 that\u2019s how you bring about change.\u201d</p> <p>Stein, who also spoke at the event, similarly argued that many Americans were looking for an alternative to Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton, whom she described as \u201cthe most disliked and untrusted\u201d major-party nominee in US history. \u201cDemocracy needs a moral compass,\u201d she told the meeting. \u201cIt\u2019s not just about who you don\u2019t like the most or who you are most afraid of.\u201d</p> <p>Stein, who was also the Green party candidate in 2012, has outlined policy positions that include a \u201cgreen new deal\u201d focused on renewable energy jobs and on completing America\u2019s transition to renewable energy by 2030. She also proposes to cut the military budget by a third and the creation of regional food systems based on sustainable organic agriculture.</p> <p>On the Republican side, McMullin, a beneficiary of the #Never Trump movement, missed getting on the ballot in 26 states before he had even sent out his first campaign release.</p> <p>Despite this, he gives disaffected conservatives an alternative to the Republican nominee, who, he says, has tapped into \u201cpeople\u2019s darkest prejudices and deepest fears\u201d.</p> <p>McMullin\u2019s best chance would be if Trump were to drop out of the race for some as-yet-unanticipated reason. \u201cLike millions of Americans, I had hoped this year would bring us better nominees who, despite party differences, could offer compelling visions of a better future,\u201d McMullin said. \u201cInstead, we have been left with two candidates who are fundamentally unfit for the profound responsibilities they seek.\u201d</p> <p>But can they begin to make a difference? Only once in recent election cycles has a third party candidate had any influence: that was in 1992, when Texan businessman Ross Perot took almost 18.9% of the vote and helped to hand the election to Arkansas governor Bill Clinton over what could have been a straightforward re-election for George HW Bush.</p> <p>Johnson\u2019s running mate, former Massachusetts governor William Weld, said he had seen interest and fundraising pick up as Trump\u2019s campaign has floundered. Johnson\u2019s campaign recently reported a $1m one-week fundraising haul and has said that more than 40,000 people have pledged to donate at least $15 to his campaign on 15 August.</p> <p>With Clinton now leading Trump by double digits in some key battleground states, the impact of any third party candidate could be limited. But given the unpredictability of the race so far, and the probability that Johnson and Stein will pull more voters from Clinton than Trump, all that could change. \u201cAt the moment it doesn\u2019t look like they can have much impact at all,\u201d says veteran Democratic adviser Hank Sheinkopf. \u201cBut if the race gets closer, they could throw it either way.\u201d</p> <p>Sheinkopf believes the election has become more about personalities and less about what party leaders want. The long-term impact may be a significant shift in how people view Democrats and Republicans. As it now stands, Stein, Johnson and McMullin could act as a convenient parking spot for voters disgusted with both candidates.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"63dbf15c211ee27d4c60466f991c563d9f98c8e1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/63dbf15c211ee27d4c60466f991c563d9f98c8e1/0_62_3010_1806/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ross Perot in 1992\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The last third-party candidate to significantly affect a US presidential election was businessman Ross Perot in 1992.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Earlier this month, federal judge Rosemary Collyer rejected a challenge brought by Johnson and Stein arguing that the bar for inclusion in debates is set artificially high. Yet there are signs that the ground could be shifting. Former Clinton press secretary Mike McCurry, now co-chair of the Commission on Presidential Debates, hinted that a third podium might be needed. \u201cSome of our production people may have said: \u2018<a href=\"http://\" title=\"\">Just in case, you need to plan out what that might look like\u2019</a>,\u2019\u2019 McCurry told Politico. \u201cWe won\u2019t know the number of invitations we extend until mid-September.\u201d</p> <p>Ron Faucheux, president of Clarus Research Group, a non-partisan polling firm, said: \u201cPolls show that voters think third party candidates should be included, and in an election like this where polls show a majority of voters dislike both main party candidates, there is a good reason to give them the opportunity to at least look at other options.\u201d</p> <p>But even Johnson and Stein remain somewhat wistful about their prospects, casting themselves as agents of change who, at best, could represent the beginning of a political realignment among voters dissatisfied with a two-party system.</p> <p>\u201cThe biggest message is \u2018consider us\u2019, as a very, very viable alternative to this two-party system that has become so polarised that they\u2019re not able to do anything,\u201d Johnson has said.</p> <p>In Vegas, Stein advanced a similar position: \u201cWe\u2019re having a political reorganisation in this election because the Republicans are kind of falling apart, and the Democrats have kind of split, with a lot of the Bernie Sanders supporters just not happy with the alternative.\u201d She noted that it was by voting for the \u201clesser of two evils\u201d that the country had inherited many of its problems.</p> <p>When recent polls are expanded to include all four candidates, rather than just the main two, most show a smaller lead for Clinton over Trump and in the others the margins remain similar.</p> <p>Johnson accepted that his polling was thus far insufficient to qualify for the debates and his chances of making an impact were remote unless he could take part in the debates.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s no way I\u2019m going to win the presidency if I\u2019m not in the presidential debates,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cI do believe anything is possible given that, right now, arguably the two most polarising figures in American politics today are running for office.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Donald Trump announced last week that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/12/donald-trump-obama-isis-founder-sarcasm\" title=\"\">Barack Obama was the \u201cfounder of Isis\u201d</a> and its \u201cmost valuable player\u201d. Earlier he had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2016/aug/10/trump-clinton-second-amendment-2016-campaign-live\" title=\"\">hinted</a> that gun activists might want to assassinate Hillary Clinton to prevent her appointing liberal justices to the Supreme Court. In Britain, meanwhile, calls for the moderation of violent political language after the death of Jo Cox have not resulted in much reduction of the gleeful talk of \u201cstabbings\u201d and \u201ctraitors\u201d, and did not discourage Nigel Farage from exulting that the Brexit vote had been won \u201cwithout a shot being fired\u201d. In what some call an era of \u201cpost-truth politics\u201d, public discourse seems more abusive and angry, and further from the ideal of reasoned conversation about social goods, than ever before. Is our political language broken?</p> <p>Well, people have been complaining about the corruption of political language since political language existed. Confucius warned that a ruler should use the correct names for things, or social catastrophe would result. <a href=\"https://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/orwell46.htm\" title=\"\">Orwell lamented</a> that political language in his time was \u201cdesigned to make lies sound truthful and murder respectable, and to give an appearance of solidity to pure wind\u201d. And the era of the \u201cwar on terror\u201d gave rise to a whole new constellation of what I call Unspeak: carefully engineered phrases designed to smuggle in a biased point of view and shut down thought and argument \u2013&#xa0;like \u201cwar on terror\u201d itself.</p> <p>Nor is flat-out lying in politics anything new. There is a marvellous 18th-century pamphlet usually attributed to John Arbuthnot, friend of Swift and Pope and founder of the Scriblerus club. It describes a yet-to-be-written book, <em>The Art of Political Lying</em>, in which the author will show \u201cthat the People have a Right to private Truth from their Neighbours ... but that they have no Right at all to Political Truth\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Perhaps what feels new to us now is the shamelessness of the lying, and the barefaced repeating of a lie</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The coinage \u201cpost-truth politics\u201d, indeed, implies that there was once a golden age of politics in which its elevated practitioners spoke nothing but perfect truth. The sun never dawned on such a day. But perhaps what feels new to us now is the shamelessness of the lying, and the barefaced repeating of a lie repeatedly debunked. Arbuthnot cautioned that the same lie should not be \u201cobstinately insisted upon\u201d, but he did not live to see this strategy work so brilliantly during the EU referendum, with the Leave campaign\u2019s claim that we sent <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/reality-check/2016/may/23/does-the-eu-really-cost-the-uk-350m-a-week\" title=\"\">\u00a3350m a week to the EU</a>.</p> <p>Shameless, too, was the haste with which this lie, having done its work, was disowned on the morning of the referendum result. It was a \u201cmistake\u201d, muttered Nigel Farage, before carefully lowering his snout back into the EU trough that continues to pay his MEP\u2019s salary. This rather called to mind Paul Wolfowitz\u2019s candid admission that the issue of Saddam\u2019s alleged WMD was chosen as the justification for the Iraq war <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/2945750.stm\" title=\"\">\u201cfor bureaucratic reasons\u201d</a>. The surprise, perhaps, is that you can show how the magic trick works, and people still believe it next time.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"35de0fbde6281d92567dd055e117cd8a77b46c70\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/35de0fbde6281d92567dd055e117cd8a77b46c70/0_7_5173_3103/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Champion of \u2018free speech\u2019: Donald Trump at a campaign rally last week.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Champion of \u2018free speech\u2019: Donald Trump at a campaign rally last week.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Evan Vucci/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Not so long ago it was \u201csoundbites\u201d that were thought to be corrupting political debate by reducing complex ideas to slogans. The 1988 US presidential election was called the \u201csoundbite election\u201d by some commentators, the most famous example being George HW Bush\u2019s promise: \u201cRead my lips: No new taxes.\u201d (Two years later Bush agreed to a bipartisan budget that did increase taxes.) It was a mysteriously brilliant piece of verbal engineering. Why would you have to read Bush\u2019s lips when you could hear what he was saying on the TV? But the surprising image and arresting rhythm made it stick.</p> <p>Soundbites and slogans (\u201cTake Back Control\u201d) still work. Trump, too, has a conventional campaign slogan: \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d. (Great how, exactly? By doing what? Don\u2019t ask.) But he gets most publicity for his antic, apparently off-the-cuff remarks that rhetorically perform an absence of rhetoric. His real genius might be read as a satirical absolutism about the first amendment. If speech is genuinely free, there should be no consequences to speech whatsoever. And, to the mystification of the commenting class, this is what Trump repeatedly finds to be the case.</p> <p>After the media furore surrounding Trump\u2019s claim that Obama founded Isis, he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/12/sarcasm-trump-obama-isis-cnn\" title=\"\">tweeted</a>: \u201cTHEY DON\u2019T GET SARCASM?\u201d Thus he rows back from any outrageous claim dreamed up by a brain that works like a cleverly programmed internet meme-generator. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he says, all innocence, \u201cthat\u2019s what some people are saying.\u201d (No one was before he did.) Yet the idea Obama is the founder of Isis will stick in at least some voters\u2019 minds come polling day, as will the imaginary Mexican wall (though they will probably have forgotten its \u201cbig beautiful door\u201d) \u2013 just as the \u201c\u00a3350m a week for the NHS\u201d promise did for many Leave voters.</p> <p>Trump is not a perversion of the tradition of political campaigning; he is the logical culmination of it. It doesn\u2019t matter what you say, if it helps you get elected. Trump is not a liar, exactly, but a bullshitter. According to the <a href=\"https://philosophynow.org/issues/53/On_Bullshit_by_Harry_Frankfurt\" title=\"\">canonical definition by the philosopher Harry Frankfurt</a>, a liar still cares about the truth because he wants to conceal it from you. A bullshitter, on the other hand, simply doesn\u2019t care what is true at all.</p> <p>Trump is merely the most energetic current exploiter of a fact that modern politicians have long known: the media is broken, and you can mercilessly exploit its flaws to your own benefit. (That, after all, is what \u201cspin doctors\u201d are for.) If you repeat a lie often enough, then that claim becomes the story, and it\u2019s what most people remember. And a structural confusion between \u201cimpartiality\u201d and \u201cbalance\u201d undermines the mission to inform of institutions such as the BBC. To be impartial would be to point out untruths wherever they come from. But to be \u201cbalanced\u201d is to have a three-way between a presenter and two economists on opposite sides of some question. Never mind that one economist represents the views of 95% of the profession and the other is an ideologically blinkered outlier: the structure of the interview itself implies to the audience that the arguments are evenly divided.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Social media is less a conversation than it is a virtually distributed riot of 'happy firing'</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In the age of social media, moreover, dubious political claims are packed into atomised fragments and attract thousands of enthusiastic retweets, while the people who help to redistribute them are unlikely ever to see a rebuttal that comes later or in someone else\u2019s timeline. We\u2019ve all moved on.</p> <p>Social media is less a conversation than it is a virtually distributed riot of \u201chappy firing\u201d (a term for the celebratory shooting of assault rifles into the sky). That lies can go viral more quickly than the truth is another old observation. In 1710 Jonathan Swift wrote: \u201cFalsehood flies, and the Truth comes limping after it.\u201d But what is certain is that Twitter and Facebook now help it fly faster and further than ever before.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"75adb12b31b1064ef306f24b5dbfd6386d3bde7d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/75adb12b31b1064ef306f24b5dbfd6386d3bde7d/0_0_3500_2320/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nigel Farage proved the power of powerful slogans and images during the EU referendum campaign.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"663\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nigel Farage proved the power of powerful slogans and images during the EU referendum campaign.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Philip Toscano/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Because attention is the currency of social media, public figures are incentivised to use outrage to vie for visibility, which further coarsens the public discourse \u2013 as when the American shock-journo <a href=\"http://www.anncoulter.com/columns/2016-08-10.html\" title=\"\">Ann Coulter lately defended Trump</a> by calling him a \u201cvictim of media rape\u201d who is being blamed for \u201cwearing a short skirt\u201d. Any such outburst these days, along with the wave of overt post-Brexit racism in Britain, may be defended as a healthy refusal to kowtow to \u201cpolitical correctness\u201d, a term that originally denoted the careful use of language so as not to needlessly upset people, and now just means common decency.</p> <p>What, then, is to be done? The modern bullshitting demagogue succeeds because he says arresting and often amusing things that cut through the anomie of those who feel left behind by politics as usual. Exquisitely reasoned liberal conversation is exactly what turns those voters off. Lately it has been notable that Hillary Clinton, not previously considered the wittiest person in US politics, has used an impressive array of scripted zingers to put down her opponent. What the bullshitters do so well is define the rules of the game, so perhaps their opponents will have to play it at least to this extent, while trying to keep the moral high ground by still caring about what is true and what isn\u2019t.</p> <p>It\u2019s not an edifying thought, but if the insurgent right is to have its Trumps and its Farages, maybe the centre and the left need their own versions too.</p> <p><em>Steven Poole is the author of </em><a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/rethink-385383.html\" title=\"\"><em>Rethink: The Surprising History of New Ideas</em></a><em> (Random House Books)</em></p>",

A concourse divides the 445-acre grounds. There are the Grandstand shows (Kiss, Joan Jett and the Blackhearts, Dierks Bently, Lady Antebellum), candy-colored midway rides, livestock competitions, livestock venues, obscure contests for cash prizes (eg the \u201ccow chip throwing contest\u201d and the twins and triplets lookalike contest), agricultural lessons (how to milk a cow) and vendors who hawk everything from John Deere tractors to cowhide lampshades. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/aug/18/donald-trump-reality-tv-and-politics\">The Donald Trump show: 24 hours with the Republican frontrunner</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But perhaps the fair\u2019s biggest draw is the local fare, mostly deep fried.

She wore a festive gingham blouse, chatted with fairgoers and gesticulated with full hands \u2013 in one she held a pork chop on a stick and in the other a plastic bottle of fresh-squeezed lemonade.</p> <p>Suddenly, the crowd\u2019s gaze shifted upward. It was Trump zipping by in a helicopter, his name on its side. He wore a dark blazer \u2013 a bold choice in 90-degree heat \u2013 and his trademark Make America Great Again cap. From his entrance to his appearance, Trump upended, or perhaps ended altogether, a tradition of modern presidential politics. </p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve never seen anything like it,\u201d said Mike Nuttal, recalling the crowd\u2019s manic response to Trump\u2019s arrival. Nuttal and his wife, Theresa, had hoped to glimpse the businessman, their choice for president, but they never got close enough. </p> <p>The scene foretold a great deal: a humbled Clinton, in the midst of a meticulously laid plan that was torpedoed by Trump, making a flamboyant landing from thin air to Earth. Yet on that summer\u2019s day in 2015, when given the chance, Clinton went after Jeb Bush. Trump was a celebrity sideshow.</p> <p>Trump <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2016/feb/01/iowa-caucus-results-live-county-by-county-interactive-map\">would lose Iowa</a>, an embarrassing defeat for a man who despises losers. Clinton would declare herself the winner of the caucuses well before it was clear she\u2019d won. (The Associated Press called it the next morning: <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2016/feb/01/iowa-caucus-results-live-county-by-county-interactive-map\">she won by a fraction of a point</a>.)</p> <p>Now the candidates are back in Iowa, steadying for a bruising battle for the state\u2019s six electoral votes. </p> <p>\u201cIowa is the center of the political universe during the caucus period and then the morning after, we fall off the face of the Earth,\u201d said Dennis Goldford, a political science professor at Drake University. \u201cNormally our electoral votes don\u2019t matter.\u201d</p> <p>But this year is different, as Trump\u2019s path to the White House may depend on winning the state. And with less than 90 days before the election,<a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/ia/iowa_trump_vs_clinton-5597.html\"> opinion polls show</a> voters here are evenly divided between and <a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/first-read/polls-clinton-ahead-trump-midwest-battlegrounds-n626541\">almost equally displeased with</a><strong><br></strong><strong> </strong>both candidates. </p> <p>\u201cIowa is the swingiest swing state,\u201d said Tim Albrecht, GOP strategist in Iowa. \u201cBut ultimately I think it\u2019s Trump\u2019s to lose.\u201d</p> <p>Trump and his vice-presidential candidate, Indiana governor Mike Pence, have visited the state a number of times in past weeks.

She added that her family felt discriminated against by some of Trump\u2019s remarks about Mexicans and immigrants. </p> <p>And a vital minority, still pursued by these un-Iowan politicians a year later, could again sway an election: the men and women who are undecided between the Washington fixture and the tabloid star of reality TV.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know who I\u2019m going to vote for yet,\u201d Collins, the grandstand worker, said. \u201cI may go third party.

Some great leaders here of the Republican Party, and they\u2019re very concerned about that, and that\u2019s the way we can lose the state, and we have to call up law enforcement, and we have to have the sheriffs and the police chiefs and everybody watching.</p> <p>\u201cBecause if we get cheated out of this election, if we get cheated out of a win in Pennsylvania, which is such a vital state, especially when I know what\u2019s happening here, folks. I know. She can\u2019t beat what\u2019s happening here.\u201d</p> <p>In 2014, a Pennsylvania judge struck down a law requiring people to produce state-approved photo ID in order to vote. The last Republican presidential candidate to win the state was George H W Bush in 1988, but Trump hopes to defeat Clinton because of its significant blue collar population.</p> <p>The Republican nominee added: \u201cThe only way they can beat it in my opinion \u2013 and I mean this 100% \u2013 if in certain sections of the state they cheat, OK? So I hope you people can sort of not just vote on the 8th, go around and look and watch other polling places and make sure that it\u2019s 100% fine, because without voter identification \u2013 which is shocking, shocking that you don\u2019t have it.\u201d</p> <p>Trump is trailing by 52% to 42% in Pennsylvania, according to a Quinnipiac survey of likely voters published on Tuesday.

The federal government doesn\u2019t run the election process. States and cities and communities all across the country, they are the ones who set up the voting systems and the voting booths.</p> <p>\u201cAnd if Mr Trump is suggesting that there is a conspiracy theory that is being propagated across the country, including in places like Texas, where typically it\u2019s not Democrats who are in charge of voting booths, that\u2019s ridiculous. That doesn\u2019t make any sense. And I don\u2019t think anybody would take that seriously.</p> <p>The president added: \u201cThis will be an election like every other election. And I think all of us at some points in our lives have played sports or maybe just played in a schoolyard or a sandbox. And sometimes folks, if they lose, they start complaining that they got cheated. But I\u2019ve never heard of somebody complaining about being cheated before the game was over, or before the score is even tallied. So my suggestion would be go out there and try to win the election. </p> <p>\u201cIf Mr Trump is up 10 or 15 points on Election Day and ends up losing, then maybe he can raise some questions. That doesn\u2019t seem to be the case at the moment.\u201d</p> <p>During the rally in Altoona, Trump also claimed that the National Security Agency has Clinton\u2019s missing emails and called on the agency to release them publicly. He was joined in Pennsylvania on Friday by Republican national committee chairman <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMjhkG60ogk\">Reince Priebus</a> amid speculation of friction between the camps.</p> <p>Meanwhile Clinton\u2019s husband Bill was campaigning in Las Vegas, Nevada. Addressing a forum of Asian American voters, the former president framed the election as a choice not simply of policy but of America\u2019s identity as a nation of immigrants. </p> <p>Looking around the room at the thousands who packed an auditorium at the Caesars Palace casino hotel, just down the Las Vegas strip from Trump\u2019s eponymous tower, Clinton said \u201cthe metaphor of this election may be walls or bridges.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAre we stronger together or stronger apart?\u201d he asked the crowd, comprising mostly of voters representing the nation\u2019s fastest-growing racial group. \u201cYou remind people that e pluribus unum -- out of many, one -- is not just a slogan, it\u2019s a way of life.</p> <p>\u201cYou remind people that the eternal effort of making our union more perfect means expanding our definition of us and shrinking our definition of them, not the other way around.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>It seems increasingly obvious to me that the only sensible way to look at the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-elections-2016\">US election</a> is through the prism of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/parks-and-recreation\">Parks And Recreation</a>. This American sitcom, which sadly came to the end of its six-year run last year, starred <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/amy-poehler\">Amy Poehler</a> as local government official Leslie Knope, and once you start seeing the parallels between the lovely fictional show and the horrible reality shitshow, it makes the latter feel more bearable. Obviously <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton\">Hillary Clinton</a> is Leslie, the blond politico, ambitious to her bones, who, whatever you think of her politics, is undeniably devoted to public service. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\">Donald Trump</a> is an amalgam of Leslie\u2019s two worst male rivals: first, <a href=\"http://parksandrecreation.wikia.com/wiki/Bobby_Newport\">Bobby Newport</a>, the spoilt manboy as rich in money as he is poor in self-awareness; second, the proudly offensive Jeremy Jamm, with a fondness for saying things like, \u201cI love Chinese crap. Lucy Liu, Gangnam Style, sushi, etcetera etcetera.\u201d That could so easily be a Trump quote, given that he semi-apologised for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jun/16/donald-trump-mexico-presidential-speech-latino-hispanic\">referring to Mexicans as drug dealers and rapists</a> by tweeting <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/05/donald-trump-taco-bowl-i-love-hispanics-picture\">a photo of himself eating a taco bowl</a>, that I honestly had to check he hadn\u2019t said it in a CNN interview.</p> <p>It also seems increasingly obvious to me that the Clinton campaign needs to start screening Parks And Recreation at their events to solve what&#xa0;the media calls <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/shortcuts/2016/jun/08/hillary-clinton-wardrobe-matters-but-not-fashion-perspective\">Clinton\u2019s \u201clikability problem\u201d</a>. This doesn\u2019t refer to whether the electorate likes Clinton\u2019s policies, but how they imagine her to be as a person. For the past three decades the answer to that has been, by and large, no, they don\u2019t like her, with people hating her in the 1990s for being (if I remember correctly) an overly moralistic feminist who spat in housewives\u2019 cookie dough, and people hating her now because they think she\u2019s not moral enough, and that she will say anything to get elected. Clinton has generally seemed not to care about her personal unpopularity, which only made me like her more. But now she is running for the presidency against <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/dec/08/jk-rowling-on-donald-trump-voldemort-was-nowhere-as-bad\">a tiny-handed Voldemort</a> and so she is gritting her teeth and dealing with the issue. Last week she was asked, for the 10 billionth time, about her \u201clikability issues\u201d. Clinton replied that people like her once she\u2019s allowed to get on with the job, which is true, given her popularity when she was secretary of state and New York senator. It was a more dignified statement than the one she gave at the Democratic national convention last month: \u201cThrough all my years of public service, the \u2018service\u2019 part has always come easier to me than the \u2018public\u2019 part,\u201d she said, as though she were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/may/14/fiction-charlesdickens\">Boo Radley</a>, who could help people only under the cover of night and then scurry into the shadows, so as not to offend anyone with her antisocial weirdness.</p> <p>Yes, male politicians have to pass the \u201cWould you have a beer with me?\u201d test. But given that Clinton has been a successful politician for 15 years, the issue of her likability is clearly about more than mere appeal. The real problem is that, while she needs to be ambitious to get as far as she has, ambitious women are seen, still, as inherently unlikable. She\u2019s supposed to pretend that she doesn\u2019t actually want to be commander in chief, in the way female celebrities are supposed to pretend they don\u2019t have to starve themselves to be thin. Such things are passively attained without any unfeminine effort. <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2016/06/hillary-clinton-tracy-flick-and-the-reclaiming-of-ambition/486389/\">As Megan Garber recently wrote</a>, the female presidents now seen in US TV shows (Selina Meyer in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/veep\">Veep</a>, <a href=\"http://scandal.wikia.com/wiki/Sally_Langston\">Sally Langston in Scandal</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2005/sep/29/usnews.broadcasting\">Mackenzie Allen in Commander In Chief</a>) attain their powerful positions by fluke, not conscious ambition. In fact, when Veep\u2019s Selina Meyer had to campaign for the presidency in the last season, she became absurd and duly lost the election. Women who strive for political power are evil, summed up by the character of Tracy Flick in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/1999/sep/24/4\">the 1999 film Election</a>, still cited as the embodiment of monstrous female ambition, even though Tracy never does much wrong besides tear down some banners in frustration.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/commentisfree/2016/jul/23/theresa-may-margaret-thatcher-spot-the-difference-uk-politics-hadley-freeman\">Theresa May, Margaret Thatcher: spot the difference \u2013 and the sexism | Hadley Freeman</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The one glorious exception to this rule is Leslie Knope, a woman who fights like hell for political promotion, and is applauded for it. There is no contradiction between her political drive and her&#xa0;personal appeal. Through the plotlines involving Knope, Newport and Jamm, the show\u2019s point is that likability is nothing compared with capability. While sitcoms with cynical male characters are the cutting edge of current cool (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/louis-ck\">Louie</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/jul/21/bojack-horseman-season-three-netflix\">BoJack Horseman</a>), I\u2019m hoping that Parks And Rec will be the one that foresaw the zeitgeist. Because given the number of female politicians currently in high positions, its depiction of political women should not be an outlier, but the harbinger of a sea change.</p>",

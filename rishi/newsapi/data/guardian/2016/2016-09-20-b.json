  "<p>The stage has been set for the most politically charged court case in Brazil\u2019s modern history after a judge ruled that former president <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/luiz-inacio-lula-da-silva\">Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva</a> must stand trial on charges of corruption. </p> <p>Judge Sergio Moro \u2013 who has overseen the Lava Jato (Car Wash) investigation into bribery and kickbacks at Petrobras and other major corporations \u2013 must now assess allegations that the Workers\u2019 party figurehead accepted 3.7m reais ($1.1m) in bribes.<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/04/brazil-ex-president-luiz-ignacio-lula-da-silva-interview\">'There is no crime': Brazil's ex-president keeps faith in party and justice system</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Lula denies the accusations, which he claims are an attempt to prevent him from running in the next presidential election in 2018.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>The decision to go ahead with the trial \u2013 which will take place in the city of Curitiba \u2013 comes amid a period of intense political and economic turmoil, which has been exacerbated by the two-year Lava Jato investigation and a conspiracy to end 13 years of Workers\u2019 party rule.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Last month, Lula\u2019s successor president <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/31/dilma-rousseff-impeached-president-brazilian-senate-michel-temer\">Dilma Rousseff was impeached and ejected</a> from office less than halfway through her mandate on relatively minor charges of window-dressing state accounts ahead of the 2014 election.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Last week, Brazil\u2019s congress <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/13/eduardo-cunha-brazilian-politician-impeachment-dilma-rousseff-expelled\">expelled the politician who orchestrated that campaign</a>, former speaker Eduardo Cunha, who is accused of accepting millions in bribes and stashing them in secret Swiss bank accounts. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>New president Michel Temer has also been implicated in the scandal, three of his ministers have been forced to resign, and other senior figures in his ruling Brazilian Democratic Movement party (PMDB) are expected to come under more pressure in the weeks ahead.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Brazil\u2019s major cities have witnessed sporadic, large and sometimes violent street protests for much of the past year, most recently focussed on a Fora Temer (Temer Out) campaign. The president is booed whenever he appears in public and has also divided the region. When he spoke at the United Nations on Tuesday, delegates from Cuba, Venezuela, Bolivia, Nicaragua and Costa Rica walked out in a sign that they refuse to recognise his legitimacy.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>The trial of Lula could raise temperatures further. The former union leader has dominated the political landscape since he led the Workers\u2019 party to its first presidential victory in 2002.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Prosecutors allege that he kept his party \u2013 and its allies, including Temer\u2019s PMDB \u2013 in power with funds illegally obtained from over-inflated contracts from government-run companies, such as Petrobras. <br></p> <p>Last week, public prosecutor Deltan Dallagnol, said Lula was the \u201ckingpin\u201d in the Petrobras scheme, which caused an estimated 42bn reais ($12.6bn) in losses.</p> <p>\u201cHe was the conductor of this criminal orchestra,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/14/brazil-petrobras-oil-kickback-scandal-luiz-inacio-lula-da-silva\">Dallagnol said</a>. \u201cThe Petrobras graft scheme aimed at keeping the Workers\u2019 party in power by criminal means.\u201d<br></p> <p>Prosecutors also allege that Lula benefited through refurbishments carried out by construction companies at two properties. This is denied by the former president and his lawyers, who say he does not own the properties in question and has not even visited one of them. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Workers\u2019 party supporters claim the Lava Jato investigation is politically biased and that most of those accused in other parties will not be held to justice. Underlining their fears, congressmen last night attempted to push through legislation that would grant sitting lawmakers amnesty.</p> <p>The implications go far beyond the trial itself. Ana Claudia Farranha, a law professor at the University of Brasilia, said the legal case \u2013 although contentious \u2013 will distract Da Silva and complicate the next presidential election in which he is the frontrunner. </p> <p>Ultimately, she said, it could lead to a realignment of political parties.<br>\u201cThe fence is closing around Lula,\u201d said Farranha. </p> <p>\u201cAs the investigations progress, Lula weakens. I think we will see big surprises for 2018 \u2026 I don\u2019t think the PT (Workers Party) will disappear, but there will be a redefinition of party blocs.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>Fox News host Megyn Kelly has lent her name to a new show that will follow reporters embedded on the presidential campaign trail, inspired by 2016\u2019s bizarre election cycle. </p> <p><a href=\"http://variety.com/2016/digital/news/megyn-kelly-michael-de-luca-go90-1201865094/\">According to Variety</a>, the show, titled Embeds, will be a political comedy following five young reporters on the campaign trail, and will feature cameos from prominent politicians. An insider said it will appeal to political junkies as well as people who don\u2019t keep tabs on politics.</p> <p>It was co-created and will be scripted by two former political journalists, Scott Conroy and Peter Hamby. Conroy, who co-wrote the Sarah Palin biography Sarah from Alaska, and worked for Huffington Post, will leave Vice on HBO to work on the show, while Hamby, a former CNN correspondent, will continue his role as head of Snapchat\u2019s news and host of Good Luck America.</p> <p>The Fox News host joins Fifty Shades of Grey producer Michael De Luca in producing the show. </p> <p>Kelly is one of Fox\u2019s leading personalities and came into the spotlight during this year\u2019s campaign when Donald Trump <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2015/aug/08/donald-trump-menstruation-fox-news-megyn-kelly-audio\">implied she was on her period</a> after she asked tough questions during a debate. She later <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/may/20/megyn-kelly-donald-trump-fox-news-truce\">came under scrutiny</a> for conducting a soft interview with the Republican presidential nominee during a special primetime interview on Fox. </p> <p>Embeds will add to the continually growing number of shows about DC politics that have enjoyed success over the past few years. Shows such as House of Cards, Scandal and Veep have managed to draw viewers as well as accolades. </p> <p>It will appear on Verizon\u2019s millennial-targeted streaming channel, Go90. The now almost one-year-old streaming service provides subscribers with original content but has yet to have a hit show. </p> <p>Verizon has purchased six episodes of the show and is hoping the first will air by election day. </p>",
  "<p>It wouldn\u2019t be surprising if, as one recent visitor to the Bush compound in Kennebunkport reports, former president George HW Bush <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/20/george-h-w-bush-voting-for-hillary-claims-member-of-kennedy-family\">will be voting for Hillary Clinton</a> over Donald Trump this fall.</p> <p>After all, the elder Bush president is a moderate from the north-east who has in recent years developed a close relationship with the Clintons. His old patrician sensibility is <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/25/us/politics/watching-gop-race-bush-41-is-glad-to-be-old.html\">reportedly offended</a> by Trump\u2019s vulgar style. And let\u2019s not forget Bush witnessed Trump ruthlessly and gleefully eviscerate his son Jeb during the Republican primary, often in the most personal of ways, and delve into conspiracy theories to attack the presidential legacy of another son, George W.</p> <p>This is not to say that Bush voting for Clinton is a non-story altogether. When is the last time a former Republican president not only refused to endorse the presidential nominee of their own party but allowed it to get out they were actually voting for the opposition party\u2019s presidential candidate? Off the top of my head, I can\u2019t think of any parallel in recent American history. </p> <p>But if you forget for a moment that George HW Bush was once was a Republican president, he is not all that different from the type of Republicans who have crossed party lines in past elections to endorse the Democratic nominee. (Think Colin Powell in 2008 and 2012.)</p> <p>To understand why this story is more remarkable than notable Republicans crossing party lines to support, say, Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012, you have to take a look of the full scope of top-tier Republicans who have refused to endorse Trump, if not declared they will be voting for Clinton. </p> <p>Yes, you have the squishy north-eastern Republicans such as Bush, Maine senator Susan Collins and former New Jersey governor Christine Todd Whitman. But you also have staunch movement conservatives like Nebraska senator Ben Sasse, Washington Post columnist George Will and radio host Erick Erickson not getting aboard the Trump train.</p> <p>Now, unlike Bush Sr, this latter group is probably far less likely to let it be known they support Clinton over Trump. But unlike in 2008 and 2012, there are bulwarks of the conservative movement refusing to get behind the Republican presidential nominee, not just those easily dismissed as Rinos (Republicans-In-Name-Only). That\u2019s no small thing.</p> <p>It is true that as the election draws nearer, some so-called Never Trump conservatives have come around to supporting Trump. Conservative talkshow host Mark Levin is perhaps the most famous example. But many more Never Trumpers seem to be in it for the long haul, even in the face of conservatives who argue that they have to vote for Trump at the very least to prevent Clinton\u2019s supreme court nominees.</p> <p>But it\u2019s not only significant right-leaning politicians, activists and opinion columnists who are refusing to support Trump. The most famous conservative academics are refusing to get behind him as well, including <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/conservative-legal-scholars-prefer-a-liberal-supreme-court-to-a-president-trump_us_57ade55fe4b069e7e504d4d3\">conservative and libertarian legal scholars</a> \u2013 exactly the kind of people who understand how important the supreme court is.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/20/george-h-w-bush-voting-for-hillary-claims-member-of-kennedy-family\">George HW Bush 'voting for Hillary', claims member of Kennedy family</a> </p> </aside>  <p>For instance, you have Princeton professor Robert P George, perhaps the most noted intellectual defender of social conservatism in the country, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mccormickprof/status/757265456210309121\">refusing to back Trump</a>, even as he says he can\u2019t back Clinton either. The same goes with some of the top conservative economists, <a href=\"http://gregmankiw.blogspot.com/2016/08/my-take-on-mr-trump.html\">such as Harvard\u2019s Greg Mankiw</a>. In fact, <a href=\"http://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2016/08/25/what-former-white-house-economists-say-about-donald-trump-and-hillary-clinton/\">the Wall Street Journal reached out to 45 past economists</a> who served on the White House Council of Economic Advisers under both Republican and Democratic administrations and not one responded to say they were supporting Trump.</p> <p>You can make fun of these people as egghead elitists, but the reality is most have fought the intellectual conservative fight in the most liberal of environments their entire lives. These are are not squishy moderates. They are true believers in conservative principles.</p> <p>So it may be easy to dismiss George HW Bush\u2019s putative decision to vote for Clinton (his spokesman <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2016/09/exclusive-george-hw-bush-to-vote-for-hillary-228395\">refuses</a> to confirm or deny the report). But when you look at the scope of figures \u2013 from Republican establishment politicians to leaders of the conservative movement to members of the conservative intelligentsia \u2013 who still refuse to get on the Trump train and likely never will, it is hard to conclude anything other than there is something truly repellent about the current Republican presidential nominee \u2013 and something deeply awry with a conservative movement that could nominate him. </p>",
  "<p>The European commission will launch a further crackdown on tax avoidance by reviving a long-stalled plan to overhaul how companies report their profits, according to Europe\u2019s most senior tax policy official.</p> <p>Under the plans, companies would have to calculate their profits under common European rules rather than national ones, closing down options for creative cross-border accountancy. The draft law, known as the common consolidated corporate tax base, will be published in late October or early November.<br></p> <p>The idea has failed in the past, partly because of opposition from the UK and Ireland. But Pierre Moscovici, the European commissioner for economic and financial affairs, said that public outrage about companies paying very low rates of tax was helping the idea gain traction.<br></p> <p>\u201cWe have a strong asset that was not present five years ago \u2013 it is the mood in the public and the scandals, which give us some strength. Clearly today the public cannot stand that multinationals do not pay their fair share of taxes, while ordinary citizens did in order to reduce deficits.\u201d</p> <p>The UK Treasury, under both Gordon Brown and George Osborne, opposed previous attempts to draw up common EU tax rules because it wanted to preserve national competence in this area. Moscovici, who met the chancellor, Philip Hammond, in Bratislava earlier this month, said he did not consider \u201cthe UK as an obstacle \u2026 when we speak on the fight against tax avoidance\u201d, though he expects \u201cvery difficult debates\u201d on the plans.</p> <p>Speaking in a wide-ranging interview with the Guardian and other European newspapers including <em>Le Figaro</em> and <em>S\u00fcddeutsche Zeiting</em>, Moscovici also said the commission was not seeking to punish the UK over Brexit but would uphold the integrity of the single market.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1d622530339aea53d50024dc7159abe96ae733a1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1d622530339aea53d50024dc7159abe96ae733a1/0_280_5184_3110/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pierre Moscovici\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pierre Moscovici, EC commissioner for economic and financial affairs, on Brexit talks: \u2018We are ready to negotiate tomorrow and that is not a joke.\u2019<br></span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bundas Engler/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThis commission is not organising a dirty fight, our goal is not to punish.

But it is hard for pro-Europeans to denounce that game while drenched in nostalgia, when the argument sounds like a plan to build a time-machine and return to the late 90s, back to the days when Brussels-phobia was but a yolk-stain on the tie of unelectable Tory reaction.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/20/brexit-weekly-briefing-buckle-up-a-nasty-divorce-looks-inevitable\">Brexit weekly briefing: buckle up \u2013 a nasty divorce looks inevitable</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Lib Dems insist that their position is more nuanced than that, but nuance hasn\u2019t exactly been flying off the shelves in the retail end of British politics recently.

  "<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/barack-obama\">Barack Obama</a> warned on Tuesday that the world faced a stark and urgent choice between striving for fairer open markets and democracies or falling prey to the lure of populist demagogues, xenophobia and division.<br></p> <p>In his final address to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2016/sep/20/un-general-assembly-obama-final-address-syria-ceasefire-refugees-live-updates\">the UN general assembly</a>, the outgoing US president sought to rally the morale of embattled liberal democracies stumbling under the strains of globalisation, inequality and migration. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/20/theresa-may-calls-on-un-to-meet-challenges-of-globalisation\">Theresa May calls on UN to meet challenges of globalisation</a> </p> </aside>  <p> \u201cThere appears to be a growing contest between authoritarianism and liberalism right now,\u201d Obama said. \u201cGiven the difficulty in forging true democracy in the face of these pressures, it\u2019s no surprise that some argue the future favours the strongman, a top-down model, rather than strong, democratic institutions.\u201d </p> <p> The UN summit this year is labouring under the shadow of resurgent east-west tensions and an apparently intractable conflict in Syria, where those divisions have proved a daunting obstacle to resolution. </p> <p> In his own farewell address, the UN secretary-general Ban Ki-moon, who also has only a few months left in office, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/20/un-suspends-all-aid-convoy-movements-in-syria-after-airstrike\">vented his anger at the international community\u2019s failure to halt the Syrian conflict</a>. He accused \u201cpowerful patrons\u201d of warring parties on all sides in the five-year war of having \u201cblood on their hands\u201d.</p> <p> \u201cPresent in this hall today are representatives of governments that have ignored, facilitated, funded, participated in or even planned and carried out atrocities inflicted by all sides of the Syria conflict against Syrian civilians,\u201d the normally soft-spoken Korean secretary general said. \u201cMany groups have killed innocent civilians, none more so than the government of Syria, which continues to barrel-bomb neighborhoods and systematically torture thousands of detainees.\u201d</p> <p> By contrast, Obama \u2013 normally the more passionate of the two statesmen \u2013 was dispassionate and more general in his remarks. He mentioned Russia only fleetingly, suggesting that in a post-imperial era, Moscow was \u201cattempting to recover lost glory through force\u201d. </p> <p> He did not name his Russian counterpart and one of the world\u2019s \u201cstrongmen\u201d, Vladimir Putin, nor did he mention Donald Trump, the Republican presidential nominee who has spoken in favour of Putin\u2019s style of leadership. But several of Obama\u2019s allusions to domestic political divides were clear references to Trump and his electoral appeal. </p> <p> He talked about \u201ca crude populism \u2013 sometimes from the far left, but more often from the far right \u2013 which seeks to restore what they believe was a better, simpler age free of outside contamination\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWe cannot dismiss these visions,\u201d Obama said. \u201cThey are powerful. They reflect dissatisfaction among too many of our citizens.\u201d<br></p> <p>He made clear he was talking about both the strategic decisions faced by emerging powers and the looming, hard-fought presidential election at home, when he said: \u201cI believe that at this moment we all face a choice.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe can choose to press forward with a better model of cooperation and integration. Or we can retreat into a world sharply divided, and ultimately in conflict, along age-old lines of nation and tribe and race and religion,\u201d Obama said.</p> <p>For his final appearance, Obama arrived late at the general assembly. When he was due on the assembly\u2019s green marble podium, by tradition the second national leader to speak after Brazil, he was just getting into his limousine at a central New York hotel for the short journey across town. In a rare break with tradition, his slot was given to another leader, Chadian president Idriss Deby. </p> <p>When his turn came, Obama recognised that it was his last time to address the general assembly and reviewed what he portrayed as the achievements in international diplomacy during his eight years in office: financial recovery in western markets, the denial of safe havens to terrorists and last year\u2019s nuclear agreement with Iran.</p> <p> \u201cWe <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/dec/17/us-cuba-diplomatic-relations-obama-raul-castro\">opened relations with Cuba</a>, helped Colombia <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/23/colombia-farc-rebel-ceasefire-agreement-havana\">end Latin America\u2019s longest war</a>, and we welcome a democratically elected leader of Myanmar to this assembly,\u201d he said. </p> <p> Despite the fact that world was more peaceful and prosperous than ever, \u201cour societies are filled with uncertainty, and unease, and strife\u201d.</p> <p> He called it \u201cthe paradox that defines our world today\u201d.</p> <p> He explained much of the malaise by inequality, observing that a society in which 1% of the population hold as much wealth as the other 99% could never be stable. </p> <p> Safeguarding free societies and markets, and the path to global integration \u201crequires a course correction\u201d that involved addressing inequality and the weakness of international institutions in the face of global threats. Failing to do so would lead down the path towards \u201cstrongman\u201d leadership, who can never live up to the expectations they stir up. </p> <p>Obama said: \u201cHistory shows that strongmen are then left with two paths \u2013 permanent crackdown, which sparks strife at home, or scapegoating enemies abroad, which can lead to war.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Brian Tyree Henry has a question. \u201cHave you heard of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/feb/14/canadian-companys-genetically-modified-apples-win-us-approval\">the Arctic Apple</a>?\u201d he asks in the restaurant of the Ace Hotel in midtown Manhattan.

Fans of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/sep/06/better-things-atlanta-fx-comedy-donald-glover-pamela-adlon\">Atlanta</a> \u2013 Donald Glover\u2019s auteur drama on FX, <a href=\"http://www.vulture.com/2016/09/fx-atlanta-premiere-ratings-strong.html\">which drew three million viewers with its season premiere</a> \u2013 will recognise him as Alfred Miles aka Paper Boi, the laconic would-be rapper around whom much of the action revolves. But there\u2019s nothing laconic about Henry, who seems determined to put the world to rights \u2013 one genetically modified piece of fruit at a time.</p> <p>\u201cYou can put Trump in the White House, but you need to prepare for a revolt because I\u2019m going nuts,\u201d says Henry, as he waits for his English breakfast \u2013 a deconstructed version including black pudding \u2013 to arrive. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/sep/08/escapefromnewyork.kurtrussell\"> Escape From New York</a> in here and you might as well call me Kurt Russell because I\u2019m going to be fucking people up. It\u2019s going to be Mad Max.\u201d</p> <p>From the coldly seething anger to the apocalyptic references, Henry\u2019s takedown of the Republican presidential candidate and his possibly cataclysmic consequences could come straight from the script of Atlanta. It has been the most popular of FX\u2019s offerings this autumn and one of the most critically lauded of the TV fall debutants. It\u2019s been called genre defying, earned comparisons to fellow FX show Louie and The Wire, and was dubbed \u201c<a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/09/19/the-slo-mo-specificity-of-atlanta\">shrewd, emotional, and impolite</a>\u201d by the New Yorker\u2019s Emily Nussbaum.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>It\u2019s also black. Brazenly so \u2013 from its cast and crew to its subject matter, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/feb/25/the-new-south-atlanta-georgia-city-of-black-power\">to the city in which it\u2019s set</a>. Atlanta has managed to stand out during a season that\u2019s been heralded for embracing diversity. But where other shows such as Luke Cage, Pitch or Queen Sugar may exist in alternate universes or times, Atlanta is set in the here and now, in contemporary America. And that setting, slap bang in the middle of the most divisive election race in recent history, feels apt.</p> <p>\u201cWe should be over this by now but we\u2019re not,\u201d says Henry of race relations in the US. \u201cWhich is why I\u2019m glad we\u2019re doing our show because we\u2019re going to be telling you exactly how we feel and exactly where we\u2019re coming from, and exactly how it feels to be a black American in this country right now.\u201d</p> <p>Variations on that line have been used by a lot of the cast while promoting the show \u2013 Donald Glover said he \u201cwanted to show white people, you don\u2019t know everything about black culture\u201d. During the show\u2019s first episode, which focuses around a shooting in a car park, the standout moment is when a white friend casually throws around the N-word. It\u2019s a scene which finishes on Glover and Henry staring down the camera at their acquaintance, and it feels like they\u2019re also looking at the viewer and America at large. It\u2019s as if those scenes are supposed to elicit a knowing nod from African Americans and a wince from white America.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"cac0cba26db1ea7df483e93ca404fe679dab3ef4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cac0cba26db1ea7df483e93ca404fe679dab3ef4/199_126_2603_1563/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jumping the couch: Keith Standfield as Darius, Donald Glover as Earnest Marks and Brian Tyree Henry as Alfred Miles.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jumping the couch: Keith Standfield as Darius, Donald Glover as Earnest Marks and Brian Tyree Henry as Alfred Miles.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: FX</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cNo one seems give a shit about what they say about any race in this country,\u201d says Henry. \u201cWhich is funny because the last time I checked isn\u2019t this the land of immigration? Isn\u2019t this where you\u2019re supposed to come and be what you want to be? It\u2019s like, yeah, but only if we say so, though.\u201d</p> <p>His words are shrewd, emotional and a little impolite, at least by conservative America\u2019s standards, but his tell-it-how-you-see-it approach began early. Henry was the youngest in a house with four older sisters in Washington DC. Acting was a survival mechanism as much as a hobby. \u201cMy sisters were teenagers when I was born so the last thing they wanted was a little nappy-headed boy running around,\u201d he recalls. \u201cI would imitate them or copy things off TV. I would leave the house and be these people.\u201d </p> <p>That early play turned into something more when Henry started acting at Morehouse College, the most famous of the historically black colleges and the same place <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jun/30/amuel--ackson--was-a-drug-addict-out-of-my-mind-but-showed-up-on-time-and-hit-my-marks\">Samuel L Jackson caught the acting bug</a>. The first play he auditioned for was August Wilson\u2019s classic tale of newly freed slaves, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2010/jun/04/jow-turners-come-and-gone-review\">Joe Turner\u2019s Come and Gone</a> and he landed the lead role of <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/theatreblog/2010/jun/15/august-wilson-joe-turners-come-gone\">Herald Loomis</a>. Henry still calls theater his first love and after Morehouse he moved to Yale to take part in the acting programme. Uprooting from one of the blackest campuses in the US to one which is <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jun/01/yale-english-students-call-for-end-of-focus-on-white-male-writers\">notoriously monocultural</a> was a wakeup call.</p> <p>\u201cAt Morehouse I found myself and my voice and I didn\u2019t want to lose that at Yale,\u201d he says. \u201c[At Yale] you\u2019re learning Ibsen and Chekhov and you need to learn the Alexander technique, and I was like yeah, but I want to be Brian when I leave.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"f49ef646baa2ab131bd9dfbe38b326dd71d2b8aa\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f49ef646baa2ab131bd9dfbe38b326dd71d2b8aa/514_231_2214_1328/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Into the woods: Brian Tyree Henry as Alfred Miles, Keith Stanfield as Darius.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Into the woods: Brian Tyree Henry as Alfred Miles, Keith Stanfield as Darius.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Guy D'Alema/FX</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>That theater background gave Henry connections.

It also saw him land the role of the General in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2013/mar/21/the-book-of-mormon-review\">the original lineup of the Book of Mormon</a> (\u201cI was like, \u2018OK, I\u2019m playing a warlord and I get to say fuck and shit on Broadway. Let\u2019s do it\u201d). He made the transfer from stage to screen with bit parts in The Good Wife, The Knick and Boardwalk Empire, alongside <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jan/13/michael-k-williams-interview-omar-the-wire-the-gambler\">Michael K Williams</a>. He\u2019s in HBO\u2019s Vice Principals, but Atlanta is where Henry looks most at home, which isn\u2019t surprising considering it\u2019s where (at Morehouse) he matured. </p> <p>But the city itself is important to Henry for another reason: \u201cWe went there, we created it, we made it a metropolitan,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s the place where a lot of black history happened: Martin Luther King was there, Jim Crow was there, even the Olympics were there.</p> <p>\u201cAtlanta has become and has always been a place where you create your own universe. That\u2019s what our show is trying to do; create our own universe with these two young men trying to make it in this universe which is still part of this bigger picture. It\u2019s still part of America, it\u2019s still part of Georgia, it\u2019s still part of the south, but it\u2019s created it\u2019s own entity and I love that.\u201d</p> <p>Talking to Henry, that idea of identity and defining yourself comes up frequently. Whether it\u2019s talking about his favourite book as a kid, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/antoine-de-saint-exupery\">Antoine de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry</a>\u2019s The Little Prince (\u201c[it\u2019s about] opening your mind and not letting people limit you\u201d), his dress sense (\u201cI love wearing a fitted hat because as soon as I put it on people go \u2018oh wait, he went to Yale?\u2019\u201d) or his love of rap (\u201cIt\u2019s the place I feel like black artists have the most room to be who they want to be\u201d), it\u2019s there in the background.</p> <p>Questioning, teasing and often provoking, there\u2019s an obvious link between the world Henry and Glover have created and the real one they inhabit. So what about the world of Atlanta hip-hop? It\u2019s often presented as an out of control, drug-laced trap house where debauchery is next to godliness. For Henry it\u2019s much more complicated than that.</p> <p>\u201cIn hip-hop you can be anything. What you look like is the least of it: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/may/19/fetty-wap-i-didnt-even-get-to-use-no-bed\">Fetty Wap</a> has one eye. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/jul/28/gucci-mane-everybody-looking-review-trap-stars-quickfire-post-prison-set\">Gucci Mane</a> has an ice cream cone tattooed on his face, and they\u2019re both still great,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s what I love about hip-hop: it challenges the norms of what we, especially as black men should be and look like. It welcomes the freaks and the ones who haven\u2019t been heard.\u201d</p> <p>Is that what Atlanta is doing? \u201cI don\u2019t want to say it\u2019s necessary, but it is absolutely necessary,\u201d he says. Welcome to the future.</p> <p><em>Atlanta continues on FX tonight at 10pm ET</em></p>",

I should be a newscaster because I called it before the news,\u201d the Republican nominee later boasted to Fox News.</p> <p>\u201cImmigration security is national security,\u201d added Trump in a speech on Monday, as he seized on the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/20/nyregion/ahmad-khan-rahami-bombing-suspect.html?hp&amp;action=click&amp;pgtype=Homepage&amp;clickSource=story-heading&amp;module=a-lede-package-region&amp;region=top-news&amp;WT.nav=top-news\">bombing suspect\u2019s background</a> to bash Hillary Clinton for wanting what he claimed were \u201cthe most open borders of anyone ever to seek the presidency\u201d.</p> <p>But Clinton also has wasted little time making clear she viewed the unfolding drama as a clear act of terror and a sign of why her foreign policy hawkishness is so important.<br></p> <p>\u201cThis threat is real, but so is our resolve. Americans will not cower, we will prevail.

The <a href=\"http://constitutioncenter.org/interactive-constitution/amendments/amendment-xii\">12th amendment</a> says that if no candidate receives 270 electoral votes, the House of Representatives chooses, with one vote for each state, from among the top three candidates who received electoral votes. McMullin is hoping to win such votes from at least one state in the Mountain West. In Utah, strongly conservative but also strongly anti-Trump, he is polling at 9%.</p> <p>Should deadlock be reached, McMullin imagines a whole new campaign in which he, Trump and Clinton would compete in the Republican-dominated House, a chamber where, he thinks, Clinton would never stand a chance. At that point, he thinks Republicans in the House would realize \u201cI am more aligned with them on issues than Trump\u201d and Democrats would support him too. </p> <p>\u201cI am not a racist and most Democrats aren\u2019t racists either,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Of course, McMullin acknowledges that such goals will be very difficult to achieve, depending as they do \u201con variables that we don\u2019t control and very few that we do\u201d. </p> <p>\u201cBut it is what it is,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are realistic about it.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>\u2018It\u2019s about trust more than issues\u2019</strong></h2> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/17/american-dream-divided-nation-equal-opportunity-trump-clinton-campaign\">Two American Dreams: how a dumbed-down nation lost sight of a great idea</a> </p> </aside>  <p>While his ambition relies on draining votes from Democrats as well as Republicans, McMullin did not have an immediate answer for why Democrats unhappy with Hillary Clinton, especially those who supported Bernie Sanders in the primary, should support him. </p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s a good question and I don\u2019t exactly know the answer to it,\u201d he said. \u201cI do have a theory based on some comments because we do have Bernie Sanders people coming to us saying we\u2019re going to support you and people who have supported Hillary Clinton but have grown concerned about the stories that have come out about Clinton Foundation and other things.\u201d </p> <p>Such people, he said, knew they didn\u2019t agree with him on many issues, particularly social concerns, but viewed him as trustworthy in a way Clinton is not. \u201cIt\u2019s about trust more than issues,\u201d he said.</p> <p>McMullin has taken some stances that do not accord with mainstream conservative thought.

If the GOP sticks with Trump, he worries, \u201cas his bigotry becomes more front and center, even as the alt-right becomes more vocal and it\u2019s more and more clear that they contribute heavily to the empowerment of his campaign\u201d, the party will sign its own death warrant. </p> <p>He doubts whether the Republican party \u201cwill be able to make the kinds of reforms they need to make to be a competitive party on a national level,\u201d he said.</p> <p>He hopes to build something for the conservative movement, \u201csomething that will be a place for [conservatives] \u2026 something that has real traction and real influence and it will be either to influence the Republican party or potentially start our own\u201d.</p>",

I am grateful for the quick action of law enforcement in capturing the terrorist responsible for Saturday\u2019s bombings, and the off-duty police officer for stopping the terrorist in Minnesota. This weekend\u2019s attacks, from Minnesota to Manhattan, are just the latest to be carried out on US soil under President Obama. These should be a wake-up call for every American.</p> <p>Today, Hillary Clinton showed again that she will say anything - and blame anyone - to shift attention away from the weakness she showed as Secretary of State. The Obama-Clinton doctrine of not taking Isis seriously enough has emboldened terrorists all over the world. They are hoping and praying that Hillary Clinton becomes President so that they can continue their savagery and murder.</p> <p>While our President has referred to them as the \u2018J.V. Team\u2019 and Hillary Clinton calls them our \u2018determined enemies,\u2019 I have been willing to call them exactly what they are: radical Islamist terrorists.</p> <p>I will bring an end to these senseless acts of violence. They are wrong to say that we\u2019re in a fight about \u2018narratives.\u2019 These terrorists pose an existential threat to our country, our values, and our way of life.</p> <p>When I am President, terrorists like today\u2019s suspect in the New York and New Jersey bombings, Ahmad Khan Rahami, and yesterday\u2019s knife-wielding ISIS sympathizer in Minnesota, Dahir Adan, will be stopped. We will not look the other way. We will not allow political correctness and soft-on-terror, soft-on-crime policies to threaten our security and our lives.</p> <p>Revelations that the Obama Administration wrongly granted citizenship to over 800 immigrants awaiting deportation from countries of concern to national security or high rates of immigration fraud puts this weekend\u2019s attacks in a broader perspective. The safety and security of the homeland must be the overriding objective of our leaders when it comes to our immigration policy.</p> <p>That\u2019s why I\u2019ve proposed extreme vetting for immigrants from troubled parts of the world where terrorists live and train, and oppose Hillary Clinton\u2019s 550% increase in the number of refugees from the conflict in Syria. These are tough problems that require tough leadership. We need to get smart and get tough fast so that this weekend\u2019s attacks do not become the new normal here as it has in Europe and other parts of the world.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57e03907e4b051672d9f7e2c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-19T19:14:52.227Z\">8.14pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Fox News Channel host and future press secretary Sean Hannity will host a town-hall meeting with Donald Trump in Ohio on Wednesday, according to Politico:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Hadas_Gold/status/777948042859257856\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Hannity will do a Town Hall with Trump this Wednesday in Ohio</p>&mdash; Hadas Gold (@Hadas_Gold) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Hadas_Gold/status/777948042859257856\">September 19, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57e03541e4b0ef60eaef0f33\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-19T18:58:18.398Z\">7.58pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Bernie Sanders is feeling the...

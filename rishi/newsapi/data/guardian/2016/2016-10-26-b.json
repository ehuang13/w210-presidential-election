During a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/13/trump-international-hotel-washington-opening-protests\">soft launch</a> in September, Trump ensured wall-to-wall media coverage by using the occasion to finally admit he had been wrong to doubt Barack Obama\u2019s right to American citizenship.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-money-blog/2015/jul/22/donald-trump-net-worth-political-brand\">Donald Trump: a brand in danger or a daring re-invention?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But weeks of political scandal appear to have taken their toll on the brand. During the recent IMF meetings in Washington, usually the busiest week of the year for luxury hotels in the city, rooms could be <a href=\"http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2016/10/trumps-d-c-hotel-shows-as-poll-sink-so-does-his-brand.html\">found online at a significant discount</a> compared to its sold-out rivals.</p> <p>While Trump was boasting of the building\u2019s 5ft-thick walls during Wednesday\u2019s ribbon-cutting ceremony, the sound of political protest out on the street could be heard from inside the lobby. Overnight, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/26/donald-trump-hollywood-walk-of-fame-star-damaged\">Trump\u2019s star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame</a> was destroyed by a vandal with a sledgehammer and pickaxe.</p> <p>The candidate sounded wistful and unusually subdued as he took a break from the campaign trail to attend the launch. \u201cWith the notable exception of 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, this is the most coveted location in DC. The best location,\u201d said Trump. </p> <p>Even the struggling campaign\u2019s slogan, \u201cMake America great again\u201d, was watered down, perhaps succumbing to criticism that it implies the country is no longer at its best. \u2018The United States is great. Its people are great,\u201d said Trump, during brief political remarks that followed the launch.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6890c7cbf84098146c141c4526eefc3278754933\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6890c7cbf84098146c141c4526eefc3278754933/269_0_3020_1812/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Donald Trump Jr, Eric Trump, Donald Trump, Melania Trump, Tiffany Trump and Ivanka Trump cut the ribbon at the new Trump International Hotel.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Donald Trump Jr, Eric Trump, Donald Trump, Melania Trump, Tiffany Trump and Ivanka Trump cut the ribbon at the new Trump International hotel.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gary Cameron/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cMy theme today is five [sic] words: \u2018under budget and ahead of schedule\u2019,\u201d added Trump. \u201cYou don\u2019t hear those words too much within government, but you will. This is what I want to do for our country.\u201d</p> <p> Ivanka Trump, whose name has been attached to both the hotel\u2019s spa and its flagship suite over two floors of the bell tower, also sounded worn down by the steady stream of attacks. \u201cThis political season has been one of the most interesting journeys of my life,\u201d said Trump\u2019s daughter. \u201cEach day I have heard critics attempt to deride my father\u2019s business. But one of the most telling things is the thousands of people who have worked with him who continue stand by his side.\u201d</p> <p> Eric Danziger, chief executive of the family\u2019s hotel business, insisted the group was still meeting internal projections. \u201cThis has been a very rewarding year for Trump hotels. Our business continues to exceed our targets,\u201d he said. But he somewhat spoiled the attempt to put a brave face on signs of commercial backlash by confirming <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/25/travel/donald-trump-hotels-new-name-scion.html\">recent reports</a> that the next hotel venture would not bear the family name and would instead be called \u201cScion hotels\u201d. </p> <p>In Manhattan, the many buildings that bear Trump\u2019s name have become a magnet for middle fingers from passing motorists, with <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-na-pol-trump-name-snap-story.html\">reports of dumped dog excrement and hurled eggs</a>. Management of one apartment complex has refused requests from residents for Trump\u2019s name to be removed, citing cost and the risk of being sued.</p> <p>The election had already been costly for the Trump brand. Early on, <a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2016-election/nbc-cuts-business-ties-donald-trump-over-immigration-remarks-n383856\">NBC severed ties</a> over Trump\u2019s immigration remarks. Macy\u2019s dumped his menswear line. There have been attempts to remove his name from hotel projects from the Middle East to Canada. </p> <p>But the combination of weeks of sexual assault allegations \u2013 all vigorously denied by Trump \u2013 and plummeting poll numbers mean the hotel launch comes at a particularly bad time.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ll build a wall against racism and bigotry,\u201d read a banner on display outside the main entrance as an army of political reporters descended beforehand. \u201cThis is not really a hotel; this is a symbol of Trump\u2019s political ambition,\u201d claimed Eugene Puryear, a protester with the <a href=\"http://www.answercoalition.org/\">Answer Coalition</a>. \u201cThis is another opportunity for Trump to create this myth about his so-called business prowess.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"95071dba3172b7f022f69e7b2c7fb818c08f9846\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/95071dba3172b7f022f69e7b2c7fb818c08f9846/0_173_5184_3110/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Demonstrators gather outside of the Trump International Hotel in Washington on Wednesday.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Demonstrators gather outside of the Trump International Hotel in Washington on Wednesday.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Zach Gibson/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Washington is not a Republican city. Trump received just 391 votes in the DC primary convention and could come third in the city in November\u2019s general election. The hotel launch was boycotted by the city\u2019s Democratic mayor and local restaurateurs.</p> <p>But hotels are aimed at visitors. A characterful building on a national thoroughfare neglected by commercial developers, the Old Post Office could have provided a bit of harmless glitz to a city where opulence typically tends toward understatement. Instead, the acres of marble, chintzy carpet and gleaming gold taps on the inside feel like any other US luxury hotel, while the giant Trump sign on the outside simply invites uncomfortable associations.</p> <p>How many reporters would have been here for any other hotel launch is hard to tell, but the press pack easily exceeded the 225 seats laid out for invited guests. Several of these were filled by family members: Melania, Donald Jr, Eric and Ivanka. </p> <p>Officially, it was not a campaign event, but two of the handful of prominent Republicans still prepared to be associated with the candidacy were there as well, in the former House speaker Newt Gingrich and Alabama senator Jeff Sessions. Gingrich rejected criticism that the event was a distraction from the campaign: \u201cThat\u2019s because they don\u2019t understand the message,\u201d he said, before echoing Trump: \u201cIt\u2019s under budget and ahead of schedule \u2026 it tells you what a Trump administration would be like.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWashington will never be the same\u201d is the defiant slogan of the hotel\u2019s management, which seems determined to milk the waning political connections. What John F Kennedy would make of the 713 sq ft room in his name is harder to judge.</p>",
  "<p>I get it. Sheryl Crow\u2019s call to shorten our presidential cycle will resonate with just about everyone this year. Who isn\u2019t counting down the days until this is over? Even Hillary Clinton has been winding the months in balls.</p> <p>As Crow points out <a href=\"https://www.change.org/p/democratic-national-committee-shorten-the-us-presidential-election-cycle\">in a petition</a> on Change.org, which, as of Wednesday, had more than 40,000 signatures, this extended political circus is a singularly American phenomenon. \u201cThe 2016 election will have lasted nearly 600 days by the time polls close on Nov. 8. By comparison, Canada had its <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/canadas-election-cycle-has-taken-less-than-three-months-and-canadians-are-tired-of-it/2015/10/18/b57ce852-7419-11e5-8d93-0af317ed58c9_story.html\">longest campaign season</a> in recent history last year, and it lasted just 11 weeks,\u201d she writes. \u201cCountries across the globe have limited campaign seasons to as short as 6 weeks. With an organized system, a successful, informative, professional campaign could be run.\u201d</p> <p>Her suggestion for how we reform our electoral process \u2013 that we ask the DNC and RNC to reform the process \u2013 is less compelling. In a segment on Morning Joe on Wednesday, she threw out five days as the optimal amount of time (was she joking?). And she\u2019s previously floated the notion that all 50 states and the District of Columbia should hold their primaries on the same day, a move that would prove hugely advantageous to the richest candidates by short-circuiting grassroots campaigns.</p> <p>The opening clip for <a href=\"http://www.msnbc.com/morning-joe/watch/sheryl-crow-on-why-she-wants-shorter-elections-793881155772\">Crow\u2019s morning segment</a> certainly felt ironic. In it, former British prime minister David Cameron is seen ribbing President Obama about the stupidly long length of American elections. \u201cYou always look on at the American elections in awe of the scale of the process and the length of the process,\u201d <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPW-wD74Bng\">Cameron says to Obama</a> in a news conference from April of 2016, adding he marvels that anyone is left standing at the end of it. Obama joked back that term limits meant he too would get to sit back and \u201clook in awe\u201d at the process.</p> <p>In retrospect, of course, Cameron might have wanted something different. Two months later he\u2019d be pushed from office over a voter referendum the result of which \u2013 Brexit \u2013 almost nobody saw coming.</p> <p>Crow moved on to how toxic media discourse has become. \u201cThis petition is simply an appeal from a midwestern mom, a single working mom who dives for the remote control before my kids can turn the TV on and see something I\u2019m going to have to explain.\u201d</p> <p>Again the sentiment is relatable but perhaps the problem is less the length of the cycle than the fact our Republican nominee for president actively brags about \u201cgrabbing\u201d women by the \u201cpussy\u201d; a fact which, it\u2019s worth noting, didn\u2019t come out until more than 500 days into the cycle.</p> <p>What Crow deems the \u201cstart\u201d of the election \u2013 Ted Cruz choosing to announce the beginning of his campaign \u2013 is not something the DNC or RNC can actually control. Nor is the fact that campaign reporters often start sourcing up to cover the next campaign the moment the current one ends. Party committees do set the timetable for primaries, but even there they are in a constant tug-of-war with state governments, which battle to move up in the primary calendar so their voters get more attention.</p> <p>As for entreaties to focus more on policy, we may not have gotten as far into the weeds on the tax code or what we need to do to save the environment, but we have furthered the national conversation around racism, xenophobia and, particularly, sexual assault, and those are things that should not be written off as empty identity politics. Since audio leaked of Trump bragging about it on 7 October, a dozen different women have spoken about his alleged sexual misbehavior.</p> <p>That\u2019s not something I want America\u2019s kids watching either. It\u2019s not something I\u2019ve loved covering \u2013 it\u2019s been emotionally and physically exhausting. But it\u2019s more important that voters know who our next president actually is rather than collectively covering their ears.</p> <p>With all due respect, I don\u2019t think Crow understands the value of what journalists have done this cycle. Muting the television won\u2019t protect our kids from our reality. And reducing the amount of time we have to learn about the people running for the most powerful job in the world, particularly when so much of what comes out of their mouths is disinformation, won\u2019t make it harder to fool the American public: it will make it infinitely easier.</p>",

  "<p>Vladislav Surkov was the mysterious Kremlin puppet master who wrote rock lyrics and loved Tupac Shakur yet was simultaneously the chief architect of Vladimir Putin\u2019s system of \u201cmanaged democracy\u201d. </p> <p>Now, after some time on the sidelines, Surkov is well and truly back in the thick of Kremlin intrigue after a cache of emails purporting to show his office coordinating affairs in separatist east Ukraine was leaked online.<br></p> <p>Sanctioned and thus banned from travel to the EU for his role in the Kremlin\u2019s Ukraine policy, the 52-year-old Surkov nevertheless popped up at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/20/ukraine-peace-process-leaders-agree-roadmap-to-revive-talks\">recent four-way negotiations</a> in Berlin over Ukraine, sitting at the round table next to Putin, and just one seat across from Angela Merkel. It was a very visible signal of Surkov\u2019s importance to the Kremlin\u2019s controversial Ukraine policy.</p> <p>Several sources have told the Guardian that Surkov has on occasion made secret trips to Donetsk, technically still part of Ukraine, to bring local separatist politicians into line and tell them what is expected of them if they are to continue to receive Russian funding and support. More regularly, emissaries from east Ukraine come to Moscow to meet with Surkov. <br></p> <p>On Tuesday, a giant cache of emails purporting to be from Surkov\u2019s office, some of which allude to his role in managing Russia\u2019s relations with the separatist entities in east Ukraine, was leaked by a Ukrainian outfit calling themselves the CyberJunta. The Kremlin has suggested the leak is a fake, though at least part of it appears to be real. It is possible that going after Surkov is the first salvo in what <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/19/russian-hacking-us-retaliation-cyberwar-international-treaty\">the CIA promised</a> would be \u201cunprecedented cyber covert action against Russia\u201d in the wake of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/oct/07/us-russia-dnc-hack-interfering-presidential-election\">alleged Russian hacking</a> of the Democratic party\u2019s computer networks.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1d4331e8c3048804170b3f4be9babdd575239ca9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1d4331e8c3048804170b3f4be9babdd575239ca9/0_0_2999_2361/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Vladimir Putin and Vladislav Surkov.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"787\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Vladimir Putin and Vladislav Surkov.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alexei Nikolsky/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Putin\u2019s spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, dismissed the email account as a fake, saying Surkov never used email. The hacked emails, however, do not purport to be from Surkov\u2019s personal account, but from an account run by an aide. It received messages for Surkov which were presumably then passed on. While there is no guarantee some of the mails have not been doctored in some way before release, much of it appears to be genuine. The hackers released photographs of the passports of Surkov and his children, apparently as further proof the hack was real.<br></p> <p>Mark Galeotti, senior researcher at the Institute of International Relations in Prague, said: \u201cIt\u2019s not impossible, but unlikely that Ukrainian hackers would be able to break into Surkov\u2019s government email account and download a huge collection of files from 2014. Given that the Americans have been hinting at a response, I cannot help but wonder if this was a US government shot across Putin\u2019s bows, a warning that it also has the capability to intrude and embarrass and a willingness to use it if Russia persists.\u201d<br></p> <p>Galeotti said it was possible Ukrainian proxies had been used to cover the tracks. This could explain why the 2014 emails were released alongside what looked like a crude forgery, supposedly a current Kremlin plan to destabilise Ukraine.</p> <p>Surkov is a unique character in Putin\u2019s Kremlin. Unlike many of the yes men and former security officials who surround the Russian president, he first came to prominence as a marketing man for Mikhail Khodorkovsky, the oligarch who would later be jailed for a decade. In 1999, he moved to the Kremlin. He almost never gives interviews, and has been shrouded in mystery over the years.</p> <p>During Putin\u2019s first decade, Surkov was known for coordinating the \u201cmatrix\u201d of Russian politics, cultivating fake opposition parties and funding pro-Kremlin youth groups. He personally curated what was allowed on to Russia\u2019s television screens, and was seen as the architect of \u201cpost-truth politics\u201d where facts are relative, a version of which some have suggested has now taken hold in the west.</p> <p>In 2011, a Russian photographer released an <a href=\"http://varlamov.ru/347515.html\">extraordinary photo essay</a> from Surkov\u2019s Kremlin office, revealing that he had portraits of, among others, Che Guevara, Barack Obama and Tupac Shakur. He also had a bank of old-school white telephones with dozens of buttons bearing the surnames of the most powerful people in Russia.</p> <p>He usually wears a faint, knowing smile and there is just a hint of Mr Bean about his appearance. While he wears sharp suits in the Kremlin, he will occasionally appear on his wife\u2019s Instagram feed <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BF_L0XQAKbg/?taken-by=natan_d\">wearing edgy outfits</a> that say \u201ccontemporary artist\u201d more than \u201cKremlin apparatchik\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cHe likes writing and poetry; he thinks in a non-standard way. He has a rounded personality that despite his abstract modes of thinking is very capable of tackling serious state tasks,\u201d said one source who has worked closely with Surkov. </p> <p>Surkov is widely believed to be the real author behind the pen name Natan Dubovitsky, who has written a postmodern novel and a number of short stories. In March 2014, a short story attributed to Dubovitsky called Without Sky was published, set in an imaginary future where the planet was engulfed in \u201cworld war five; the first non-linear war\u201d. </p> <p>One passage read: \u201cThe simple-hearted commanders of the past strove for victory; now, they were not so stupid. Of course, some of them acted like before and tried to retrieve the old worn-out slogans, like \u2018Victory will be ours\u2019. Sometimes it worked. But mostly, they understood war as a process; part of a process, its most acute phase, but maybe not its most important phase.\u201d</p> <p>Less than a week after the story was published, the annexation of Crimea was completed. </p> <p>Surkov\u2019s initial fall from grace came back in 2011, when the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/may/01/medvedev-stay-russian-president\">Russian elite was split</a> between those who wanted to see the relatively liberal Dmitry Medvedev stay in the Kremlin for a second term, and those who wanted Putin to return. In an uncharacteristic misstep, Surkov backed the wrong horse, and let it be known in elite circles that he was firmly in the camp that wanted to see Medvedev given the chance for another term. </p> <p>When Putin came back, Surkov was edged out, and after a period as deputy prime minister, seemed to be a spent force. He later returned, but was put in charge of relations with Abkhazia and South Ossetia, two Russian protectorates essentially annexed from Georgia. It was hardly a glamour job, and was a spectacular step down from directing the entire Russian domestic political scene. </p> <p>But as Russia was drawn into a clandestine war in east Ukraine, Surkov has gradually risen to a position of prominence again; both his experience in managing relations with the Georgian protectorates and his talent for intrigue and subterfuge made him the perfect person to run the Kremlin\u2019s relations with the \u201cpeople\u2019s republics\u201d that sprang up in east Ukraine and were essentially coordinated from Moscow.</p> <p>Surkov has not yet commented on this week\u2019s hack. When he was put on the US sanctions list for his role in the Ukraine events back in 2014, he likened it to \u201cgetting an Oscar for best supporting actor\u201d and said it made him happy. \u201cThe only things that interest me in the US are Tupac Shakur, Allen Ginsberg and Jackson Pollock. I don\u2019t need a visa to access their work. I lose nothing,\u201d he said. <br></p> <p>He was also placed on the EU sanctions list, although Time magazine <a href=\"http://time.com/4476005/vladislav-surkov-putin-athos-greece-sanctions/\">reported</a> he was spotted at an Orthodox monastery in Greece earlier this year, and he then popped up very publicly alongside Putin in Berlin.</p> <p>\u201cI am too odious a person for this brave new world,\u201d said Surkov, with characteristic irony and ambiguity, back in 2011 when he was removed from his post in the presidential administration. <br></p> <p>Now, it seems he fits right in again.</p>",

  "<p><em>The following is an edited version of a speech made by Guardian writer Jessica Valenti to <a href=\"https://www.plannedparenthood.org/planned-parenthood-southern-finger-lakes\">Planned Parenthood of the Southern Finger Lakes</a> last week.</em></p> <p>How is everyone doing? Ready for November 8 yet?<br></p> <p> Tonight, I was asked to speak about a vision for the next hundred years of reproductive choice and justice. It\u2019s such a wonderful frame \u2013 to think about what a feminist future might look like. But I bet like a lot of you, it\u2019s hard to imagine what the next hundred years will look like when so much of that, for women especially, will depend on what happens in just 18 days.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>There is no overstating how important this election is. It\u2019s not just about the next four or eight years. This decision is about sending a message about who we are as a country, and setting a very particular course for the women who live here. We\u2019ll look back on this time as a watershed moment: a moment that could, in fact, shape the next hundred years of women\u2019s rights.</p> <p>But first I want to share a personal story. </p> <p>A little over six years ago, I was pregnant with my daughter, Layla. And when I was 28 weeks pregnant, I got incredibly ill. I developed pre-eclampsia, which some of you might know is dangerously high blood pressure during pregnancy.</p> <p>I was admitted to the hospital and within just a few days, I developed another complication called <a href=\"http://www.preeclampsia.org/health-information/hellp-syndrome\">HELLP syndrome</a>, the short version being my liver was in danger of failing, and I was in danger of dying if my daughter was not born.</p> <p>I had an emergency C-section and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2011/aug/18/baby-pregnancy-premature-birth\">Layla was born</a> weighing 2lb 2oz. She stayed in the neonatal intensive care unit for the first two months of her life, undergoing medical interventions to save and protect her that to this day I try to avoid thinking about. </p> <p>But I was lucky, and she was lucky, and today she\u2019s a wonderful healthy six-year-old. And I feel grateful for that every day.</p> <p>I share this story often, because this was something in my life that changed me forever, that shaped who I am today.</p> <p>And when I think about this moment, what I think about most often is how fortunate I was that I got sick far enough along in my pregnancy that I wasn\u2019t faced with the reality of needing an abortion to save my life.</p> <p>And when I think about those days in the hospital \u2013 the fear, the urgency, the confusion, the stress \u2013 the idea that the government could ever become involved in my life\u2019s most pivotal moment? It horrifies me.</p> <p>So one thing I want for the next hundred years? I want for no person, ever, to fear that their most personal life choices will be made by someone else.</p> <p>I want for no woman, ever, to be afraid that her scariest life moment will be made even more difficult and traumatic by government interference.</p> <p>In the next hundred years, I want to see every woman be free from the fear that her body is not really her own.</p> <p>And that\u2019s why I want to talk about this election tonight. Because that\u2019s what\u2019s at stake.</p> <p>Never before in American politics have women\u2019s bodies been so front and center in the national conversation. And so at risk.</p> <p>We are choosing between a candidate who has spent her political career fighting for reproductive rights, and a candidate who says that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2016/mar/30/donald-trump-punishment-abortion-hillary-clinton-bernie-sanders\">women who have abortions need to be punished</a>. A candidate who said this week in the final debate unequivocally that she will defend Planned Parenthood, and a candidate who promised to defund it.</p> <p>A choice between a person who has spent her life in public service, and a braggadocious businessman who <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2016/06/09/donald-trump-unpaid-bills-republican-president-laswuits/85297274/\">rips off his workers</a>.</p> <p>And, perhaps most tellingly: we\u2019re making a decision between a woman who has said that \u201c<a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXM4E23Efvk\">women\u2019s rights are human rights</a>\u201d and a man who says if you want to, you can just grab women \u201c<a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/07/donald-trump-leaked-recording-women\">by the pussy</a>\u201d.</p> <p>There\u2019s a feminist rallying cry online right now that I like a lot, and it says: November 8, pussy grabs back.</p> <p>Now, I know that so much has been made of that comment, and the ensuing allegations against Trump by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/20/donald-trump-sexual-misconduct-tenth-woman-accuser\">multiple women</a> that he did just what he bragged about doing on that tape.</p> <p>And while some people may not see the link between sexual assault and reproductive rights, those of us here in this room know better.</p> <p>We know that there is a direct connection between those who think they can touch women\u2019s bodies without permission and those who think they can legislate our bodies. </p> <p>Reproductive rights and justice has always been about a fundamental respect \u2013 or in this case, disrespect \u2013 of women\u2019s bodily integrity and autonomy.<br></p> <p>Either our bodies are our own, or they\u2019re not.</p> <p>And make no mistake, the conversation that we\u2019re having right now about \u201cgroping\u201d is not just salacious media fodder. The way we come out of this moment \u2013 the direction our culture shifts because of it \u2013 will absolutely determine women\u2019s rights in the future. </p> <p>We are witnessing a moment where our country could move backwards \u2013 back to a place where \u201cboys will be boys\u201d and men will make decisions for women. Or towards a future where our culture and politics understand and respect women as autonomous full human beings.<br></p> <p>Those are the two paths.</p> <p>Right now, I\u2019m optimistic that we\u2019re on the right one. The one that brings us to the feminist future all of us in this room have been waiting for. </p> <p>When Trump said he wanted to punish women for having abortions, there was outrage and he had to walk back those comments. But more importantly, pro-choice activists and organizations like Planned Parenthood were there to point out that while other politicians may not say they want women to be punished, that\u2019s exactly what would happen if abortion were made illegal.<br></p> <p>And in fact, what has already happened to women like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/apr/02/it-isnt-justice-for-purvi-patel-to-serve-20-years-in-prison-for-an-abortion\">Purvi Patel</a>, who was put in prison for inducing her own abortion in Indiana.</p> <p>Our feminist future has no place for criminalizing women who decide if and when to parent.</p> <p>When Donald Trump claimed that what he said on that Access Hollywood tape was just \u201clocker-room talk\u201d, and later when former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani said that all men talk like this, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/19/donald-trump-sexism-misogyny-men\">men across the country came out to say</a>: no.</p> <p>This is not normal. This is not acceptable. Men are better than this. </p> <p>The feminist future that we\u2019re fighting for has men fighting alongside of us, men who refuse to be insulted by antiquated and sexist ideals about what it means to be a \u201creal man\u201d.<br></p> <p>When Trump claimed that the women who have accused him of sexual assault were not attractive enough to warrant his unwanted attention, when he called women disgusting, when he called women pigs, the media \u2013 who can so often get things wrong \u2013 took him to task.</p> <p>Because our feminist future is not one where misogyny will go unchecked. Women have been disparaged and harassed for too many years, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/25/sexual-assault-tipping-point-elizabeth-warren-trump\">we\u2019re not going to take one more minute of it</a>. We\u2019re done.</p> <p>Of course this feminist future \u2013 the future that we\u2019re so close to getting \u2013 it\u2019s not just being hinted at by the reaction and opposition to Donald Trump.</p> <p>We are getting a sense of what that future could look like when we see the incredible way feminists and women themselves have changed the conversation.</p> <p>This week, for the first time ever, a presidential candidate offered <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/19/abortion-trump-clinton-debate\">a nuanced and empathetic defense</a> of late-term abortions on a national debate stage. This is a third-rail issue that most politicians won\u2019t touch, but Clinton talked about women\u2019s lives and experiences in a way that reminded us that this issue isn\u2019t just about policy \u2013 it\u2019s about us.</p> <p>We\u2019re living in a moment when feminism is wielding more cultural power than it has in decades, maybe ever. People don\u2019t shy away from the word feminism any more, they embrace it.</p> <p>When I started speaking on college campuses 10 years ago, I would ask how many people in the room considered themselves feminists. Back then, just a few people would raise their hands. When I speak at colleges today, nearly everyone does.</p> <p>Feminism has become so popular that the conservative right has tried to appropriate it \u2013 Sarah Palin calls herself a feminist, anti-choice organizations call themselves the \u201creal\u201d feminists. They recognize the power that the word and the movement have, and they want to use it toward their own, very anti-feminist, ends. </p> <p>But our feminist future is a smart one, and it knows that anyone who would legislate women\u2019s bodies, who would interfere in women\u2019s and families\u2019 private medical decisions have no place calling themselves feminists.</p> <p>Of course, being in this incredible feminist moment \u2013 when the first female president is about to win by taking down a man who is as close to a caricature of misogyny as you can get \u2013 being in this moment doesn\u2019t mean that our feminist future is guaranteed.</p> <p>It\u2019s not. Those of us who have been doing this work for years know that every time women make political and cultural strides, there is an intense backlash \u2013 we\u2019re in the midst of it now, and it will only intensify if Hillary Clinton becomes president. </p> <p>Making sure that this backlash doesn\u2019t define us \u2013 that we are not put on the defensive by it \u2013 that is what will truly determine our feminist future. </p> <p>Will we get pushed back on our heels or will we look straight ahead and move forward? Will we rest on our laurels because we have the first woman president or will we take our moment to celebrate and then move on to the hard work that still needs to be done?<br></p> <p>If the people in this room, and the people at Planned Parenthood are any indication \u2013 we know the answer to those questions.</p> <p>This is just the beginning</p> <p>My daughter tells me that she wants children one day. (Though she says she doesn\u2019t want to be pregnant \u2013 her wife will have the kids.) But when she talks about having children, when I think about being a grandmother or a even great-grandmother one day \u2013 that\u2019s when I think about those hundred years that we\u2019ve been talking about.</p> <p>I think about what the world will be like for them. And I have faith, I really do, that it will be a world \u2013 that this will be a country \u2013 where people determine their own destiny.</p> <p>A world where we understand that reproductive rights are not just an issue of women\u2019s bodies \u2013 but an economic issue, a family issue, and a human rights issue. </p> <p>And the reason I have faith that future generations will see this vision of feminism and justice unfold is because of activists like you all here. Because of Planned Parenthood. Every day they are ensuring that the next hundred years will be years where women\u2019s words, lives, bodies and experiences matter. Years where we\u2019re not defending ourselves from attack, but building something progressive and something real.<br></p> <p>All of you in this room are doing what is necessary to ensure that feminist future. I could not be more grateful to you, and I could not be more honored to join that fight with you.</p>",

Moreover, we have <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/mediaaction/publications-and-resources/research/reports/media-and-political-participation\">growing evidence</a> that political debate and discussion shows inspire audiences to participate in their own communities. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>When the ladies ask questions of the officials, I become encouraged and proud of them</p> <footer> <cite>Woman in Afghanistan responds to seeing a woman question the president</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Our recent research reports that those who regularly tune in to BBC Media Action\u2019s governance programmes are more likely to participate in politics than those who don\u2019t, even once other influencing factors such as demographics and interest in politics are taken into account. </p> <p>This is how a woman in rural Afghanistan reacted when she saw a woman from her area ask the then President Hamid Karzai a question on our political debate programme <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/mediaaction/where-we-work/asia/afghanistan/open-jirga\">Open Jirga</a>: \u201cI like her courage for asking. When the ladies ask questions of the officials, I become encouraged and proud of them.\u201d</p> <h2>Put gender on everyone\u2019s agenda</h2> <p>The media can take gender issues out of the private realm and put them on the political agenda. The Tanzanian political discussion programme <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/mediaaction/where-we-work/africa/tanzania/a-national-conversation\">Haba Na Haba</a> (Little by Little) does this by treating women\u2019s health topics, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2016/may/23/why-do-a-million-women-still-suffer-the-treatable-condition-of-fistula\">such as fistula</a>, as political issues. </p> <p>But we need to go beyond this. \u201cApplying a gender lens\u201d is common parlance in women\u2019s rights circles \u2013 but how often does the news use this lens? Rarely. Development practitioners can help the media cover all stories in a way that\u2019s representative of both men and women\u2019s lives and experiences. As the senior producer of political debate programme <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/mediaaction/where-we-work/africa/kenya/sema-kenya\">Sema Kenya</a> says: \u201cWe always made gender part of the programme. If it was on cross-border trade, we\u2019d think about if it affected women in a different way. We didn\u2019t crowbar it in. And gender issues weren\u2019t directed at women, they were just subtly raised.\u201d</p> <h2>Promote inclusion by disrupting norms</h2> <p>Political debate in the media often sends a strong message to women: this is not for you. So it is unsurprising that women are far less likely to watch the news than men. We have been contending with how to make programmes that imagine a new, more inclusive space, rather than recreate an elitist political one. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2016/aug/22/woman-for-a-week-salve-international-gender-inequality\">I decided to be a Ugandan woman for a week \u2013 it was the wig that broke me</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Nepal\u2019s <a href=\"http://bbcsajhasawal.com/en/\">Sajha Sawal</a> (Common Questions) debate show is experimenting with new formats. Instead of bringing people into a potentially intimidating studio environment, they take politicians out to communities to visit communal taps, tea shops and fields \u2013 places where women feel much more confident to ask questions. </p> <p>The media is powerful. It can reach millions of people, challenge rigid gender roles and empower both men and women. However, making programmes that transform how we see men and women is complex; there\u2019s no simple, universal recipe to follow. Presidential debates in the US show that having a woman in the race may represent enormous progress, but does not transform the debate. </p> <p>Whether or not women feel genuinely heard, fully valued and spoken to as equals is certainly no box-ticking exercise. And as the pundits deliver their verdicts on Clinton and Trump\u2019s performances, making programmes in which we not only see women, but actually hear them, will still be a work-in-progress. </p> <p><em>Josephine Casserly is a governance and rights adviser at <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/mediaactioninsight/entries/703ec6e0-e8e1-4891-b614-752d48c678fc\">BBC Media Action</a>. </em></p> <p><strong>Join our community </strong><strong>of development professionals and humanitarians.

  "<p>Chekhov\u2019s The Cherry Orchard casts a long shadow. I\u2019ve seen countless plays about bereft British aristos pining over their lost property. Bonnie Greer, however, goes a step further by transposing the action to a Michigan resort hotel, owned by a once-rich, upper-class black family, on the eve of the presidential election. The result is ingenious but seems torn between distilling the Chekhovian poetry and charting the panic prompted by a possible Trump victory.</p> <p>Greer preserves the structure of Chekhov\u2019s play and finds contemporary equivalents for its characters. Anita is a stylish grandee who cherishes her old house as much for the fact that Bessie Smith and Ella Fitzgerald stayed there as for its cherry orchard. Her brother, Augustus, is a thrice-divorced playboy and round-the-world yachtsman, while her two daughters, Lorraine and Chirlane, seek to break free from their dominant mother. But, as in the original, the crumbling estate is up for grabs: the difference is that this time the entrepreneurial Karim has plans for it to be bought by a consortium who want to exploit the Cerise brand.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c0654f504c563eaba31c858506da9a8981f0c56f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c0654f504c563eaba31c858506da9a8981f0c56f/0_240_3600_2160/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Hotel Cerise by Bonnie Greer Inspired by Chekhov.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/oct/19/bonnie-greer-black-lives-matter-hotel-cerise-interview\">Bonnie Greer: 'Black Lives Matter is a big fail for my generation'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Greer successfully charts the internal dynamics of a divided family: the elders, conscious of their status, cling to a romanticised past, while the young are fiercely radical. In one of the best scenes, Anita also hints at the strain on a black elite of preserving a facade of superiority when she says \u201cwe scream every second and they think it\u2019s singing\u201d.</p> <p>But what is latent in Chekhov \u2013 the sense of a society on the threshold of momentous change \u2013 becomes blatant in Greer. The most obvious example is the way the original\u2019s symbolic use of the sound of a breaking string here becomes an earth-tremor that throws everyone flat on the ground. </p> <p>Greer has, in fact, grafted a modern political play on to a classic source. Toussaint, the equivalent of Chekhov\u2019s wandering student, is a potential revolutionary, working on a book about Obama called Alas, Poor Barack. A local businessman is fine-tuning his assault rifle, in case Trump gets elected. A young servant is forcibly reminded of his debt to his impoverished background, when news comes of another black victim of police violence. All this gives us sufficient insight into the multiple political perspectives of black America to make me wish Greer had written a wholly original play.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5b0f4a57fbc76e0f8e3d3107826c0ea70b177f98\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5b0f4a57fbc76e0f8e3d3107826c0ea70b177f98/0_0_2500_1667/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Hotel Cerise By Bonnie Greer Inspired by Chekhov\u2019s The Cherry Orchard Thu 20th Oct - Sat 12th Nov 2016 Creative Writer Bonnie Greer Director Femi Elufowoju, jr Set Designer Ellen Cairns Costume Designer \u2013 Jessica Curtis Lighting Designer \u2013 Tim Lutkin Sound Designer \u2013 Simon McCorry Cast El Anthony Madeline Appiah Michael Bertenshaw Nicholas Beveney Andrew Dennis Abhin Galeya Lacharne Jolly Corey Montague-Sholay Claire Prempeh Alexis Rodney Ellen Thomas Angela Wynter\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>The production by Femi Elufowoju Jr, with a beautiful art deco set by Ellen Cairns, does however capture the Chekhovian sense of a group composed of warring egos.

Michael Bertenshaw, as an expatriate English hangover from the hotel\u2019s glory days, also fits dapperly into the picture.

But they\u2019re not the worst. The worst thing about Donald Trump is that he\u2019s the man in the mirror.</p> <p>We love to horrify ourselves with his excesses, and to see him as a monstrous outlier, the polar opposite of everything a modern, civilised society represents. But he is nothing of the kind. He is the distillation of all that we have been induced to desire and admire. Trump is so repulsive not because he offends our civilisation\u2019s most basic values, but because he embodies them.</p> <p>Trump personifies the traits promoted by the media and corporate worlds he affects to revile; the worlds that created him. He is the fetishisation of wealth, power and image in a nation where <a href=\"http://valuesandframes.org/\">extrinsic values</a> are championed throughout public discourse. His conspicuous consumption, self-amplification and towering (if fragile) ego are in tune with the dominant narratives of our age.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The entire electoral process is stolen from the American people before they even cast their vote</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>As the recipient of vast inherited wealth who markets himself as solely responsible for his good fortune, he is the man of our times. The US Apprentice TV show which he hosted tells the story of everything he is not: the little guy dragging himself up from the bottom through enterprise and skill. None of this distinguishes him from the majority of the very rich, whose entrepreneurial image, loyally projected by the media, clashes with their histories of huge bequests, government assistance, monopolies and rent-seeking.</p> <p>If his politics differ from those of the rest of the modern Republican party, it is because he is, in some respects, more liberal. Every vice, for the Republican trailblazers such as Ted Cruz and Scott Walker, is now a virtue; every virtue a vice. Encouraged by the corporate media, the Republicans have been waging a full-spectrum assault on empathy, altruism and the decencies we owe to other people. Their gleeful stoving in of faces, their cackling destruction of political safeguards and democratic norms, their stomping on all that is generous and caring and cooperative in human nature, have turned the party into a game of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/apr/23/mortal-kombat-x-review-violent-but-charmingly-hammy\">Mortal Kombat</a> scripted by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/aug/19/reading-breitbart-news-steve-bannon-donald-trump\">Breitbart News</a>.</p> <p>Did Trump invent the xenophobia and racism that infuse his campaign?

Almost all prominent Republicans have been at it. In fact, across the four presidential debates, <a href=\"http://www.vox.com/2016/10/19/13342250/presidential-debates-climate-change\">not one question about climate change was asked</a>. Even when politicians and journalists accept the science, it makes little difference if they avoid the subject like the plague.</p> <p>America\u2019s fourth president, James Madison, envisaged the United States constitution as representation tempered by competition between factions. In the <a href=\"http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/fed10.asp\">10th federalist paper</a>, written in 1787, he argued that large republics were better insulated from corruption than small, or \u201cpure\u201d democracies, as the greater number of citizens would make it \u201cmore difficult for unworthy candidates to practise with success the vicious arts by which elections are too often carried\u201d. A large electorate would protect the system against oppressive interest groups. Politics practised on a grand scale would be more likely to select people of \u201cenlightened views and virtuous sentiments\u201d.</p> <p>Instead, the US \u2013 in common with many other nations \u2013 now suffers the worst of both worlds: a large electorate dominated by a tiny faction. Instead of republics being governed, as Madison feared, by \u201cthe secret wishes of an unjust and interested majority\u201d, they are beholden to the not-so-secret wishes of an unjust and interested minority. What Madison could not have foreseen was the extent to which unconstrained campaign finance and a sophisticated lobbying industry would come to dominate an entire nation, regardless of its size.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/25/elizabeth-warren-us-president-workers-rights-wall-street\">Elizabeth Warren is the US president we need, but can\u2019t have \u2013 this time | Owen Jones</a> </p> </aside>  <p>For every representative, Republican or Democrat, who retains a trace element of independence, there are three sitting in the breast pocket of corporate capital. Since the supreme court decided that there should be no effective limits on campaign finance, and, to a lesser extent, long before, candidates have been reduced to tongue-tied automata, incapable of responding to those in need of help, incapable of regulating those in need of restraint, for fear of upsetting their funders.</p> <p>Democracy in the US is so corrupted by money that it is no longer recognisable as democracy. You can kick individual politicians out of office, but what do you do when the entire structure of politics is corrupt? Turn to the demagogue who rages into this political vacuum, denouncing the forces he exemplifies. The problem is not, as Trump claims, that the election will be stolen by ballot rigging. It is that the entire electoral process is stolen from the American people before they get anywhere near casting their votes. When Trump claims that the little guy is being screwed by the system, he\u2019s right. The only problem is that he is the system.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video element--supporting\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/oct/18/donald-trump-sexual-allegations-nine-women-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/583qb\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2817569\"            data-video-name=\"Eleven women who have accused Trump of sexual misconduct \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"Guardian, Access Hollywood, AP, CNN, Getty Images, NBC, Reuters, Palm Beach Post\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-58066cf1e4b0cd26ff71e6cc\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/10/24/161024women_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/10/24/161024women.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/10/24/161024women_KP-2166838.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/oct/18/donald-trump-sexual-allegations-nine-women-video\">Eleven women who have accused Trump of sexual misconduct</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>The political constitution of the United States is not, as Madison envisaged, representation tempered by competition between factions.

In a year that seems ripe for third-party candidates, Libertarian Gary Johnson and Jill Stein of the Green party are seeking to capitalise but have fallen back in the polls in recent weeks.<br></p> <p>Sixty-one per cent of survey respondents say neither political party reflects their opinions today, while 38% disagree. Nearly eight in 10 (77%) independents and a majority (54%) of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/republicans\">Republicans</a> took this position, while less than half (46%) of Democrats agree. There was virtually no variation across class or race.</p> <p>Both Democratic presidential nominee <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton\">Hillary Clinton</a> and Republican standard bearer Trump continue to suffer historically low favourability ratings, with less than half of the public viewing each candidate positively (41% v 33%). Clinton is viewed less favourably than the Democratic party (49%), but Trump\u2019s low rating is more consistent with the Republican party\u2019s own favourability (36%).</p> <p>The discontent with parties and candidates extends to the electoral process itself, which Trump claims is rigged against him. Less than half the public (43%) say they have a great deal of confidence that their vote will be counted accurately, while 38% have some confidence and 17% have hardly any confidence.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/25/american-political-parties-democrats-republicans-representation-survey\">Most Americans do not feel represented by Democrats or Republicans \u2013 survey</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-580feb1de4b08d944ba4aa23\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-25T23:30:51.560Z\">12.30am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>LeBron James - and Nike - appear to be coming for a certain presidential candidate\u2019s views regarding immigrants, women and inner-city African Americans in a new ad:</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOZxIpy6Gm4\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/dOZxIpy6Gm4?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-580fe799e4b08d944ba4aa11\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-25T23:15:52.392Z\">12.15am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>TrumpTV is back after Donald Trump\u2019s rally in Florida:</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Donald Trump, TV\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.facebook.com/plugins/video.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2FDonaldTrump%2Fvideos%2F10157973074675725%2F&show_text=0&width=560\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" style=\"border:none;overflow:hidden\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowTransparency=\"true\" allowFullScreen=\"true\"></iframe> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-580fe139e4b08d944ba4a9ed\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/spencerackerman\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-25T22:50:02.348Z\">11.50pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Analysis: Hillary Clinton's plans for no-fly zones in Syria could provoke US-Russia conflict</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Retired senior <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-military\">US military</a> pilots<strong> </strong>are increasingly alarmed that Hillary Clinton\u2019s proposal for \u201cno-fly zones\u201d in Syria could lead to a military confrontation with Russia that could escalate to levels that were previously unthinkable in the post-cold war world.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5808ba39e54a90bc64f62b75397b3424d2d45f81\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5808ba39e54a90bc64f62b75397b3424d2d45f81/0_0_2400_1526/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Hillary Clinton.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"636\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hillary Clinton.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Maria Lorenzino/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The former strategists spoke to the Guardian as Clinton\u2019s Republican rival Donald Trump warned that Clinton\u2019s proposal to establish \u201csafe zones\u201d to protect beleaguered Syrian civilians <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/25/donald-trump-hillary-clinton-syria-world-war-three\">would \u201clead to world war three\u201d</a>.<br></p> <p>The proposal of no-fly zones has been fiercely debated in Washington for the past five years, but has never attracted significant enthusiasm from the military because of the risk to pilots from Syrian air defenses and the presence of Russian warplanes.</p> <p>Many in US national security circles consider the risk of an aerial confrontation with the Russians to be severe.<br></p> <p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t put it past them to shoot down an American aircraft,\u201d said James Clapper, the US director of national intelligence, on Tuesday in response to a question from the Guardian at the Council on Foreign Relations.</p> <p>Those who have patrolled no-fly zones over the relatively freer skies of Bosnia and Saddam-era Iraq fear that a President Clinton would oblige the US to what one retired US air force three-star general described as an indefinite \u201cair occupation\u201d.

The Times is using them as the basis for this article and a two-part episode of its election podcast, \u201cThe Run-Up.\u201d<br></p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Here\u2019s a pretty amazing anecdote:</strong></p> <p>\u201cAnd when Mr. Trump feels he has been made a fool of, his response can be volcanic. Ivana Trump told Mr. D\u2019Antonio about a Colorado ski vacation she took with Mr. Trump soon after they began dating. The future Mrs. Trump had not told her boyfriend that she was an accomplished skier. As she recalls it, Mr. Trump went down the hill first and waited for her at the bottom:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>IVANA TRUMP: So he goes and stops, and he says, \u201cCome on, baby. Come on, baby.\u201d I went up. I went two flips up in the air, two flips in front of him. I disappeared. Donald was so angry, he took off his skis, his ski boots, and walked up to the restaurant. ... <strong>He could not take it. He could not take it.</strong></p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5c9c7d2f727ed4e47301fbf193a15304e47e65d5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5c9c7d2f727ed4e47301fbf193a15304e47e65d5/0_306_4985_2993/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u201cI went two flips up in the air.\u201d\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u201cI went two flips up in the air.\u201d</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Robert Sacha/Corbis via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-10-25T15:20:25.696Z\">at 4.20pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-580f75dae4b0219a00d3870f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-25T15:10:34.407Z\">4.10pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Hillary Clinton turns 69 tomorrow. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/dougmillsnyt/status/790929216619548676\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">.<a href=\"https://twitter.com/HillaryClinton\">@HillaryClinton</a> gives a thumbs up when asked about how Stevie Wonder performed last night at her fundraiser/early birthday party. <a href=\"https://t.co/vxKHN3aZn7\">pic.twitter.com/vxKHN3aZn7</a></p>&mdash; Doug Mills (@dougmillsnyt) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dougmillsnyt/status/790929216619548676\">October 25, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-580f72d5e4b01c528432c716\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-25T15:02:36.992Z\">4.02pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Reader challenge: what's your map look like?</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>This is a two-part challenge, actually.

Wasserman imagines a Clinton landslide, a Clinton majority, a 2012 redux, a Clinton squeaker \u2013 and, yes, a Trump upset.</p> <p>The piece rather brilliantly imagines the turnout and loyalties of various demographic groups underlying each imagined result, as well as likely down-ballot effects. </p> <p><strong>In the landslide scenario,</strong> Wasserman imagines Clinton with 413 electoral votes, including victories in Arizona, Texas and Georgia; he gives Utah to independent candidate Evan McMullin. In this scenario, senate candidate Patrick Murphy upsets Marco Rubio in Florida and the Democrats end up with a 54-seat senate majority. But, to underscore just how hard this would be, <em><strong>the Democrats still don\u2019t take the House</strong></em>.</p> <p><strong>What about the Trump upset?</strong> He gets Pennsylvania (where polling averages have Clinton up six points), Wisconsin (ditto) and New Hampshire (five points), in addition to all the Romney states plus Florida, Iowa and Ohio.

Indeed, turnout among whites without a college degree surged from 55 percent in 2012 to 64 percent in 2016, and Trump carried them by 35 percentage points. Validating the \u201c<a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-supporters-probably-arent-lying-to-pollsters/\">shy Trump voter</a>\u201d theory, Trump defied expectations by nearly tying Clinton among whites with a college degree.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/youll-likely-be-reading-one-of-these-5-articles-the-day-after-the-election/\">Read further</a>.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-580f5882e4b01c528432c62b\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-25T13:07:23.477Z\">2.07pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Obamacare premiums set to spike, White House says</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Premiums will go up sharply next year under President Barack Obama\u2019s health care law, and many consumers will be down to just one insurer, the administration confirmed Monday.

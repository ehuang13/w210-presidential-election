Obama cited the potential for the popular bipartisan bill to backfire against the US, its diplomats and military personnel. The bill sailed through both chambers of Congress by voice vote, with final House passage coming just two days before Obama led the country in marking the 15th anniversary of the attacks that killed nearly 3,000 people in New York, Washington and Pennsylvania on 11 September 2001.</li> <li>Billionaire casino owner Sheldon Adelson plans to donate as much as $25m to a Super Pac supporting Donald Trump \u2013 more than five times what he had been expected to contribute.

He writes on his site The Insurgent, <a href=\"http://theresurgent.com/evan-mcmullin-a-sane-alternative/\">calling McMullin the \u201csane alternative\u201d</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The reality is Evan McMullin\u2019s candidacy is a long shot. His best shot is winning a few states to throw the race to the House of Representatives where, though he may not get the Presidency, he might ensure neither Trump nor Hillary get it. To do this he would have to win a few blue states, which though difficult is not impossible. Surprisingly, he is already beginning to register in polls in red states like Utah and purple states like Virginia.</p> <p>Frankly, Evan McMullin may actually serve a more important role in 2016. Though he may not win, he might at least provide disaffected conservatives an excuse to show up and vote down ballot. Saving the Senate and House of Representatives from the Democrats has to be a priority for conservatives, but many are so disgusted by 2016 that they will not even show up in November.</p> <p>McMullin gives people a reason to show up. He gives conservatives someone they can vote for without holding their nose. He gives people someone to vote for instead of reconciling themselves to voting against someone. McMullin\u2019s candidacy is not the lesser of an evil, but an alternative against evil. For many, that will be enough.</p> <p>A lot of people have been writing me, begging me to reconsider Donald Trump. They think this is the last best chance to get this nation right. They think we will turn a corner after which we cannot turn back. In truth, I have concluded we are already past the point of redemption when the best either party can do is offer up Clinton or Trump. We are beyond the point of looking to five black robed masters to save us from ourselves when we put up either a Clinton or a Trump. The seriousness and virtue of the voter is in the grave already and too many yearn for an idolized past that never existed in a future that is not theirs, but God\u2019s, to shape.</p> <p>I am realistic that Evan McMullin has a limited change of winning. But I am idealistic enough to hope for better than Clinton or Trump.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57e56cf1e4b0831a51401a9f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-23T18:08:54.763Z\">7.08pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>More rumors are swirling around that Ted Cruz will shortly endorse Donald Trump for president, with <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2016/09/trump-rival-cruz-to-throw-support-to-gop-nominee-228584\">Politico reporting</a> that \u201cmultiple sources close to Cruz\u201d say it is coming as early as today.</p> <p>Cruz and Trump had a particularly brutal primary fight, with Trump insinuating that Cruz\u2019s father was involved in the assassination of John F Kennedy and that his wife was unattractive.</p> <p>As Politico reports:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It is unclear whether Cruz will say only that he is voting for the Republican nominee, as other lawmakers have done, or offer a more full-throated endorsement, but the idea of throwing any support to Trump is controversial within Cruzworld.</p> <p>\u201cIf he announces he endorses, it destroys his political brand,\u201d said someone who had worked for Cruz\u2019s campaign.</p> </blockquote> <p>A former Cruz backer, conservative radio host Steve Deace, is tweeting his disappointment at news that the Texas Senator may back the party\u2019s controversial nominee.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/SteveDeaceShow/status/779367746874269696\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">I hope I&#39;m wrong, but I think a man I admire will today make the worst political miscalculation I&#39;ve ever witnessed.</p>&mdash; Steve Deace (@SteveDeaceShow) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SteveDeaceShow/status/779367746874269696\">September 23, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/SteveDeaceShow/status/779374466191196161\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">I really hope the Cruz advisers that pressured him for months to do this know their base as well as they seem to think they do.</p>&mdash; Steve Deace (@SteveDeaceShow) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SteveDeaceShow/status/779374466191196161\">September 23, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/SteveDeaceShow/status/779369211860815872\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">People may love Cruz endorsing Trump.

Its challenge, say Clinton campaign advisers, is to match and thwart the way terrorism has transitioned from large-scale attacks directed by established terrorist groups to small-scale assaults by unconnected, self-radicalized perpetrators that are comparatively difficult to detect.</p> <p>Overseas, the Clinton campaign discusses the intelligence surge in terms of accelerating a focus on the Middle East.</p> <p>It seeks to expand intelligence sharing, particularly across European governments hindered by the lack of a continental intelligence infrastructure, concerning flows of jihadists, money and weapons.</p> <p>And it will support an intensified hunt for Baghdadi expending \u201csignificant resources\u201d, reminiscent of Barack Obama\u2019s successful push to find and kill al-Qaida leader Osama bin Laden.</p> <p>\u201cShe really would put a concerted focus on that, really going after him in particular,\u201d said Laura Rosenberger, a senior Clinton foreign policy adviser and former state department and National Security Council official.</p> <p>Read the rest <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/23/hillary-clinton-national-security-plan-isis-baghdadi\">here</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/23/hillary-clinton-national-security-plan-isis-baghdadi\">Hillary Clinton's plan to stop Isis: hunt down leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57e507cae4b0f91912fb0446\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-23T12:35:51.099Z\">1.35pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Hello and welcome to our live-wire coverage of the 2016 race for the White House. </p> <h2>Humbling at Hofstra?</h2> <p>Preparation for Monday\u2019s first presidential debate at Hofstra University in New York means a fairly quiet Friday, with no official events planned for either Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton. </p> <p>Instead, it\u2019s debate prep day.</p> <p>For Clinton that means less mock debate and more conversations about how to handle the different forms of possible Trump attacks, with the motto of prepare, prepare, prepare, <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2016/09/hillary-clinton-debate-prep-228558\">says Politico</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>In the end, it might not be anything Clinton says that matters. Many longtime aides credited the power of her reaction shot \u2013 a comically disapproving maternal glare honed from her years as a first lady enduring another long spiel by somebody else \u2013 as one of her most valuable weapons in communicating gravitas and strength in the face of Trump\u2019s expected insults.</p> </blockquote> <p>Trump\u2019s technique is often to question the validity of the moderators and the event itself, say <a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/2016-presidential-debates/clinton-trump-take-different-approaches-first-debate-prep-n652726?cid=sm_tw\">campaign reporters from NBC News</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The GOP nominee has been fond of describing himself as a \u201ccounter-puncher,\u201d but Trump\u2019s debate strategy during the primary seemed simply to keep punching at rivals while reiterating portions of his stump speech. He sparred with nearly every Republican who he shared the stage with throughout the GOP primary process and mostly stayed away from specific policies in lieu of rhetorical red meat for his supporters. And he was generous with his use of nicknames for his opponents: \u201clow energy\u201d Jeb Bush, \u201clyin\u2019 Ted\u201d Cruz and \u201cliddle Marco\u201d Rubio.\u2019</p> </blockquote> <p>The debate is a hot ticket. NBC\u2019s Today show says Chelsea Clinton will be there, but it is unknown if husband Bill will attend. Team Trump will have wife Melania and all five kids in attendance. And billionaire Mark Cuban, who\u2019s been engaging in Twitter rants against Trump, will also be there:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/mcuban/status/779125122628136962\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Just got a front row seat to watch <a href=\"https://twitter.com/HillaryClinton\">@HillaryClinton</a> overwhelm  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump\">@realDonaldTrump</a> at the &quot;Humbling at Hofstra&quot; on Monday.

But that\u2019s not the chief reason to vote for her. She deserves America\u2019s support because she is the overwhelmingly better candidate. Against a Romney or a McCain, she would almost certainly be our choice. Against Trump? The question answers itself.</p> </blockquote> <h2>Clinton\u2019s new ad: Trump insults women</h2> <p>The Clinton campaign released a new video today, similar to the \u201crole models\u201d ad where children watched TV while Donald Trump\u2019s most heinous comments play. But today\u2019s focus is on females, playing a collection of Trump\u2019s worst quotes about a women\u2019s physical appearance over footage of young women looking at themselves in the mirror.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHGPbl-werw\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/vHGPbl-werw?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>\u201cDoes she have a good body?

First, last year, I promised to support the Republican nominee. And I intend to keep my word.</p> <p>\u201cSecond, even though I have had areas of significant disagreement with our nominee, by any measure Hillary Clinton is wholly unacceptable \u2013 that\u2019s why I have always been <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/neverhillary?source=feed_text&amp;story_id=10154476728267464\">#NeverHillary</a>.\u201d</p> <p>Donald Trump responded to the announcement. \u201cI am greatly honored by the endorsement of Senator Cruz. We have fought the battle and he was a tough and brilliant opponent. I look forward to working with him for many years to come in order to make America great again.\u201d</p> <p>But Cruz and Trump clashed repeatedly in the primary campaign. An ardent conservative who played <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/13/sarah-palin-ted-cruz-veterans-shutdown\">a lead role in the government shutdown of 2013</a>, Cruz warned that Trump was not a conservative but rather a big-government liberal. Riding strong support among evangelical activists, Cruz propelled himself to victory in the Iowa caucuses and in 10 other states. He eventually finished second.</p> <p>Trump repeatedly attacked Cruz, not just politically but personally. In the course of the primary, he criticised Cruz\u2019s wife, Heidi, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/mar/25/ted-cruz-brands-donald-trump-coward-feud-over-wives\">for her looks</a> and implied that the Texas senator\u2019s father was somehow <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/may/03/cruz-attacks-trump-jfk-assassination-philanderer\">involved</a> in the assassination of John F Kennedy.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I am not in the habit of supporting people who attack my wife and attack my father</p> <footer> <cite>Ted Cruz, in July</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/03/donald-trump-ted-cruz-jfk-assassination-indiana-primary-philanderer\">In a dramatic press conference</a> on the eve of the Indiana primary, Cruz called Trump a \u201cserial philanderer\u201d, an \u201camoral pathological liar\u201d and a \u201cbraggadocious, arrogant buffoon\u201d. The senator dropped out less than 12 hours later, after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/03/ted-cruz-suspend-campaign-president-indiana-primary\">a decisive defeat</a>.</p> <p>In Cleveland in July, Cruz addressed the Republican convention but pointedly refused to endorse Trump. He was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/20/ted-cruz-speech-republican-national-convention-trump-endorsement\">booed from the floor</a>. The next day, he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/21/ted-cruz-donald-trump-texas-delegates-no-servile-puppy-dog\">said</a>: \u201cI am not in the habit of supporting people who attack my wife and attack my father.</p> <p>\u201cThat [Republican party] pledge was not a blanket commitment that if you go and slander and attack Heidi, that I\u2019m going to nonetheless come like a servile puppy dog and say, \u2018Thank you very much for maligning my wife and maligning my father.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>In his statement on Friday, Cruz said: \u201cThis election is unlike any other in our nation\u2019s history. Like many other voters, I have struggled to determine the right course of action in this general election.</p> <p>\u201cIn Cleveland, I urged voters, \u201cplease, don\u2019t stay home in November. Stand, and speak, and vote your conscience, vote for candidates up and down the ticket whom you trust to defend our freedom and to be faithful to the constitution.\u201d</p> <p>He then detailed the issues on which he had made his decision, including appointments to the supreme court, healthcare, immigration, energy policy, national security and internet freedom.</p> <p>He concluded: \u201cOur country is in crisis. Hillary Clinton is manifestly unfit to be president, and her policies would harm millions of Americans. And Donald Trump is the only thing standing in her way.</p> <p>\u201cA year ago, I pledged to endorse the Republican nominee, and I am honoring that commitment.

  "<p>I hate to be an alarmist, but Donald Trump could be on course to be elected president of the United States \u2013 and the decisive moment may well come on Monday night. That\u2019s when he faces Hillary Clinton in what is expected to be one of the most watched events in television history. The TV debates are perhaps the last chance for her to persuade the American people that this man is unqualified for, and unworthy of, the presidency and poses a genuine threat to the republic.</p> <p>If that sounds like panic, then I\u2019m not the only one. Sweaty-palmed nausea has become a leading symptom among those who tremble at the prospect of a Trump presidency. The latest Slate Political Gabfest podcast is called <a href=\"https://player.fm/series/slates-political-gabfest/the-time-to-panic-edition\">The Time to Panic Edition</a>. Number cruncher Nate Silver, who gives Trump a <a href=\"http://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2016-election-forecast/?ex_cid=rrpromo\">40% probability</a> of winning, triggered another round of liberal angst this week when he tweeted that he had \u201cNever seen otherwise smart people in so much denial about something as they are about Trump\u2019s chances. Same mistake as primaries, Brexit.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Never seen otherwise smart people in so much denial as they are about Trump\u2019s chances. Same mistake as Brexit</p> <footer> <cite>Nate Silver</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The source of the alarm is not so much the national polls, where Clinton is a few points ahead, but surveys from those battleground states where the presidency will be decided. In the last week, polls have put Trump in front in Ohio, Nevada, North Carolina and, most neuralgic of all, Florida.</p> <p>So low are expectations for his performance on Monday \u2013 where it is assumed that his opponent, a seasoned debater, will wipe the floor with him \u2013 that if Trump manages to speak in vaguely coherent sentences and not deliver a misogynist insult to Clinton\u2019s face, his advocates will declare that he looked \u201cpresidential\u201d and anoint him the winner. If he can somehow persuade wavering voters that he is not so ridiculous as to merit automatic disqualification, he will have cleared a crucial hurdle.</p> <p>And for all her experience, Clinton heads towards this first, and therefore most important, debate facing some serious obstacles. She\u2019s been advised that she mustn\u2019t interrupt too much or talk over Trump: apparently voters react badly to seeing a woman act that way. According to a <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/24/us/politics/presidential-debate-hillary-clinton-donald-trump.html?ref=politics\">New York Times report</a> well sourced from inside Hillary\u2019s debate preparation team, \u201cshe does not want to be seen as pushy and play into gender stereotypes\u201d.

He even milked cash from a 9/11 relief fund.</p> <p>This week he was found to have raided $258,000 from the charitable foundation that bears his name to settle assorted legal problems. Earlier he dipped into that same charity box, filled by others\u2019 donations, to pay for a larger than life <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2016/09/21/how-a-univision-anchor-found-the-missing-10000-portrait-that-trump-bought-with-his-charitys-money/\">$10,000 painting</a> \u2013 of himself.

But on he strides.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f25d5234cdc0433593ffbc7acf34365387d35c99\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f25d5234cdc0433593ffbc7acf34365387d35c99/0_302_5356_3214/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Donald Trump\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u201cBut Trump himself presents her with an unprecedented conundrum.

If she calls him a liar, he\u2019ll hit back over her use of a private email server, calling her Crooked Hillary, knowing that some 60% of Americans believe she\u2019s dishonest. The risk is that he\u2019ll use her experience and expertise against her, casting her as the boring know-it-all against the freewheeling, entertaining guy who relies on good old gut instinct.</p> <p>If that sounds familiar, that\u2019s because it\u2019s a show we\u2019ve already seen. In 2000 Al Gore was clearly the more accomplished, ready-for-office candidate. But he came across as impatient and pompous against the looser, backslapping George W Bush. Never mind that one was a visionary on the issue of climate change while the other would lead the US into the catastrophic invasion of Iraq. On the night, Bush came across better on TV.</p> <p>Which brings us to a core problem facing Hillary Clinton. Polls show there are millions of voters, especially young ones, who agree in big numbers that Trump is a racist and a sexist, unqualified for America\u2019s highest office \u2013 but who are refusing to back Clinton. One survey of 18- to 34-year-olds <a href=\"https://www.qu.edu/news-and-events/quinnipiac-university-poll/national/release-detail?ReleaseID=2378\">recorded dire numbers</a> for Trump, but still found only 31% supporting Clinton, with 29% preferring libertarian Gary Johnson and 15% the Green candidate Jill Stein. If those numbers are replicated on election day, Trump will win.</p> <p>This too stirs queasy memories of 2000. In that year, a small but significant bloc on the left voted for Ralph Nader instead of Gore. More than 90,000 voted for Nader in Florida, a state Gore was eventually deemed to have lost by just 537 votes. Had even a tiny fraction of those Naderites decided to hold their nose and choose Gore instead, there would have been no Bush presidency \u2013 and no Iraq war.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/22/the-guardian-view-on-the-us-presidential-debate-hillary-needs-a-slogan-to-sum-up-what-she-stands-for\">The Guardian view on the US presidential debate: Hillary needs a slogan to sum up what she stands for | Editorial</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I know this is a sore, and contested, point among those who chose Nader, who to this day blame Gore for not doing enough to appeal to the left (forgetting perhaps that he also had to appeal to centrist voters in order to win the election). But the basic case is surely clear. In a two-party system like America\u2019s, if you want to stop Trump, then a vote for Johnson or Stein will not do it. Only a vote for Clinton can prevent a white nationalist bigot becoming the next US president.</p> <p>You might think this is all so obvious that it barely needs stating. But 2000 can seem like ancient history to those who don\u2019t remember it. And here, younger voters are not to blame. Older liberals haven\u2019t seared the Bush calamity into the minds of the next generation. They never turned 2000 into a cautionary tale of the cost of third-party indulgence. As the <a href=\"https://newrepublic.com/article/136976/liberals-failed-teach-millennials-horror-george-w-bush\">New Republic</a> put it this week, \u201cLiberals have failed to teach millennials about the horror of George W Bush.\u201d (Republicans, meanwhile, bang on about the supposedly dismal presidency of Jimmy Carter to this day, just as British Conservatives invoked the 1979 \u201cwinter of discontent\u201d for over three decades. It is the centre-left that is oddly reticent about exploiting its opponents\u2019 history of failure.)</p> <p>So now, even though the hour is late, this is the case Democrats must make. That this is an exceptional election because Donald Trump represents an exceptional menace, to America and to the world. It is indeed a referendum on Trump and the only way to vote no in that referendum is to vote Clinton. She may not be the candidate of your dreams, but she\u2019s all that stands between you and an American nightmare. </p> <p>You don\u2019t have to love her. You don\u2019t even have to like her. You\u2019re not saying she\u2019s flawless (though the current Democratic platform is its most progressive in 30 years, thanks in part to the challenge of Bernie Sanders). As Joe Biden puts it, \u201cDon\u2019t compare her to the Almighty. Compare her to the alternative.\u201d And the alternative is President Trump.</p> <ul> <li>This article was amended on 24 September 2016 to clarify the details of the Slate podcast.<br></li> </ul>",
  "<p>Larry Sanders, the older brother of Democrat politician Bernie Sanders, is hoping to emulate his sibling\u2019s success by standing for the Green party in David Cameron\u2019s Oxfordshire seat.</p> <p>Bernie Sanders gave Hillary Clinton an unexpectedly tough fight in the Democratic presidential primaries, riding a wave of idealism among a predominantly young voter base. </p> <p>Now his brother Larry, 82, a retired social worker and former Green party councillor, plans to attempt a similar feat for the Greens in the byelection for the rock-solid Conservative constituency of Witney.</p> <p>It will be a tall order. \u201cIt hasn\u2019t always been the richest turf for the Green party,\u201d a party spokesman said. To become MP for Witney, he would have to overturn Cameron\u2019s 22,700-vote majority in a seat where the last Green candidate won just 5.1% of the vote. </p> <p>But as Sanders points out, he has branding on his side. \u201cBecause of Bernard, I\u2019ve become famous, and I will get more attention from the media, and that\u2019s to be used to get the Green party\u2019s policies across,\u201d he told the Guardian.</p> <p>Sanders has lived in Oxford since 1968, having moved to Britain after falling in love with \u201ca beautiful Englishwoman\u201d, Margaret, to whom he was married until she died in 1983. </p> <p>He studied social work at Oxford University and worked as a social worker and adviser to people with disabilities and their carers. He also has a law degree from Harvard. </p> <p>Sanders has been the Green party\u2019s health spokesman since last year, and says the NHS and social care are the issues \u201cclosest to my heart\u201d. On a local level, he has campaigned in support of Witney and Horton hospitals, but also wants to highlight the pressure that social care is under nationally, and opposes the privatisation of social care and the NHS.</p> <p>He will also echo his brother\u2019s campaign\u2019s emphasis on social inequality. \u201cIn Britain, as in the US, we have had an increase in inequality in the last 30 years, and that\u2019s having all sorts of consequences,\u201d he said. \u201cMany people can\u2019t afford houses who you would have expected to not long ago.\u201d </p> <p>Neoliberalism, he says, has \u201cshuddered to a close\u201d, and he blames resentment for that for the Brexit vote.</p> <p>The same tides in the US are what propelled his brother\u2019s campaign, he said. \u201cBernard\u2019s campaign in America was a very successful shifting point.\u201d</p> <p>Sanders will face barrister Robert Courts as the Conservative candidate, local councillor Liz Leffman for the Liberal Democrats, and Duncan Enright as the Labour candidate. </p> <p>The Greens point out that Enright has called for Corbyn to stand down, creating the scope for Sanders to pick up support among Corbyn-backing voters. Caroline Lucas, the party\u2019s MP and co-leader, will campaign in the constituency on Saturday.</p> <p>Larry Sanders campaigned for his brother as a member of Democrats Abroad and was filmed telling the Democratic convention through tears that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/jul/26/bernie-sanders-brother-larry-democratic-convention-video\">their parents would be \u201cimmensely proud\u201d</a>.</p> <p>Bernie Sanders will not be officially endorsing Larry, because of the convention against foreign politicians intervening in domestic elections. </p> <p>But in last year\u2019s general election, when Larry Sanders ran for the Greens in the neighbouring constituency of Oxford West and Abingdon, Bernie spoke via Skype at a meeting of Larry\u2019s supporters. Larry Sanders will not rule out a similar intervention in the byelection. </p> <p>\u201cOur similarities in terms of policies are astonishing, partly because we talk all the time,\u201d Larry Sanders said. <br></p> <p>He cannot think of a policy where they have major differences, he added. \u201cWe both have maintained a kind of naivet\u00e9, where we look around and say, why does a rich country have poor people?\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Donald Trump began preparations in earnest on Friday for his first head-to-head debate with presidential rival Hillary Clinton, setting up what <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/trump-and-clinton-get-ready-for-a-ninety-minute-campaign\">\u201cmay turn out to be the most important ninety minutes in America\u2019s political history\u201d</a>.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>The Republican candidate finally broke from his hectic campaign schedule for a day without any public or private events so he could focus on his presentation for the event described in those momentous terms by the New Yorker magazine. </p> <p>Clinton, by contrast, has spent most of this week hunkered down with close aides at her Dutch colonial <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/apr/09/hillary-clinton-new-york-chappaqua-primary-election\">home in Chappaqua</a>, a hamlet north of New York City.</p> <p>Monday\u2019s televised clash is expected to break TV audience records for a political event, possibly exceeding 100 million viewers and almost rivalling the Super Bowl. Hosted by Hofstra University in New York and moderated by NBC news anchor Lester Holt, it promises be an absorbing collision of personalities, philosophies and styles and has taken on added significance as polls show an increasingly tight race. One slip of the tongue could be devastating.</p> <p>Hype worthy of a world heavyweight boxing championship is mounting. Billionaire businessman <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mcuban?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">Mark Cuban</a> tweeted on Thursday: \u201cJust got a front row seat to watch @HillaryClinton overwhelm @realDonaldTrump at the \u2018Humbling at Hofstra\u2019 on Monday. It Is On!\u201d</p> <p>Accused by critics of stooping low and causing offence, Trump has promised a clean fight in which he will treat Clinton with \u201crespect\u201d and not bring up her husband Bill\u2019s past sexual indiscretions. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019m looking to do that,\u201d he told Fox News. \u201cI don\u2019t know what I\u2019m going to do exactly. It depends on what level she hits you with, if she\u2019s fair, if it\u2019s unfair, but certainly I\u2019m not looking to do that.\u201d</p> <p>The Democratic nominee, a seasoned debater, has promised to tackle Trump\u2019s toxic rhetoric. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you I am going to do my very best to communicate as clearly and fearlessly as I can in the face of the insults and the attacks and the bullying and bigotry that we\u2019ve seen coming from my opponent,\u201d she told radio host Steve Harvey on Tuesday. \u201cI can take it, Steve. I can take that kind of stuff. I\u2019ve been at this. And I understand it\u2019s a contact sport. But I\u2019m not going to take what he says about everybody else, his attacks on African Americans and immigrants and Muslims and women and people with disabilities.\u201d</p> <p>The contrast in the candidates\u2019 preparations mirrors the contrast in their campaigns. Trump has been more laissez-faire and, so far, has reportedly eschewed mock debates against someone playing the role of Clinton. He has warned of the dangers of being overprepared. </p> <p>Clinton, a former lawyer, has been characteristically meticulous in readying herself for what her campaign describes as the most important night of the election yet, with just over six weeks to go until polling day.</p> <p>Trump has already offered an insight into his likely talking points in an email sent to supporters. \u201cWhile Hillary is listening to a team of psychologists and advisors to teach her what to say, I\u2019m turning to the very people who got me where I am today \u2026 YOU,\u201d it stated.</p> <p>The \u201cTrump debate preparation survey\u201d consisted of 30 questions for supporters, including: \u201cDo you think Trump should refer to Hillary as \u2018Crooked Hillary\u2019 on stage?\u201d; \u201cShould Trump contrast his tell-it-like-it-is attitude with Hillary\u2019s running list of lies, corruption, and deceit?\u201d; and \u201cShould Trump contrast himself as a tough negotiator with Hillary\u2019s history of waging endless wars that fail miserably?\u201d</p> <p>The billionaire businessman has also been prepping on his campaign plane as he shuttles from rally to rally. Advisers include former Republican rivals Dr Ben Carson and New Jersey governor Chris Christie; retired Gen Michael Flynn, former House speaker Newt Gingrich, ex-New York mayor Rudy Giuliani and economist Peter Navarro have also been in discussions. Roger Ailes, the former Fox News chief executive, ousted after a sexual harassment scandal, has also offered coaching.</p> <p>Trump, a former reality TV star, hopes to bring his experience of the medium to bear and stands to benefit from low expectations \u2013 recent weeks have seen him given credit in the media for simply remaining on script or failing to attack anyone. </p> <p>But perhaps the biggest danger to Trump is that Clinton will get under his skin and goad him to lash out, giving him the appearance of a bully and deepening concerns over whether he has the temperament to be commander-in-chief when compared with her steady hand.</p> <p>He told the Washington Post recently: \u201cDebate skills are something you either have or don\u2019t have. You have to prep. You have to have knowledge. But when people say you have to be nice or not nice, well, I won\u2019t really know until it begins. Because if she treats me with respect, I\u2019ll treat her with respect. If she doesn\u2019t, I\u2019ll reciprocate. If she\u2019s respectful of me, I\u2019ll be that way with her.\u201d</p> <p>While Trump is expected to rehearse at Trump Tower, overlooking Central Park in Manhattan, Clinton is working with advisers behind the fence of her 110-year-old house at the end of a cul-de-sac in Chappaqua. Ed Rendell, former governor of Pennsylvania and a Clinton surrogate, said on Thursday: \u201cShe should continue to talk about the things she wants to do.\u201d</p> <p>Her inner circle includes Karen Dunn, Bob Barnett, Joel Benenson, John Podesta, Jake Sullivan, Jennifer Palmieri and Ron Klain, who has been a debate coach for Democratic presidential candidates since 1992 and was recently the administration\u2019s \u201cEbola czar\u201d. Contacted via Twitter, he said only: \u201cI do not talk to reporters on any basis about debate prep.\u201d</p> <p>Mark Cuban, James Carville \u2013 a veteran of Bill Clinton\u2019s 1992 campaign \u2013 and civil liberties lawyer Alan Dershowitz are all potential stand-ins for Trump in dry-run debates. A few different people are playing the role of Trump to represent his \u201cmultiple personalities\u201d, the Hill website reported.</p> <p>On Monday, it might be the old blustering Trump of the Republican primary debates, who labelled rivals \u2013 \u201clow-energy\u201d Jeb Bush, \u201cLyin\u2019 Ted\u201d Cruz and \u201cLittle Marco\u201d Rubio \u2013 and even made reference to the size of his manhood; or it might be more a measured Trump in an attempt to appear statesmanlike.</p> <p>Jennifer Palmieri, a senior adviser to Clinton, told journalists: \u201cYou\u2019re just not sure who is going to show up. You have to assume he might approach the debate this way or he may approach it that way and he may be aggressive or he may lay back. That\u2019s hard to game out necessarily so I would say most of the focus is on what points does she want to make.\u201d</p> <p>Palmieri also expressed concern that Trump could receive special treatment. \u201cMy biggest concern is not a view of any moderator. But just that people accommodate their questions, and lower the bar of their questions to suit the candidate in front of them and that\u2019s what happened with Trump in the past.\u201d </p> <p>This will be the first of three presidential debates. Tim Kaine and Mike Pence square off in a vice-presidential debate on 4 October.</p>",
  "<p>Older Americans are more likely to vote and, when they do, they vote Republican. That\u2019s how the conventional wisdom goes, anyway. The reality is a little more complex. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/23/donald-trump-lies-this-week-north-carolina-crime-afghanistan\">The lies Trump told this week: drugs are a 'big factor' in North Carolina protests</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In the last presidential election, 72% of Americans age 65 and over voted, compared to just 41% of those age 18 to 24. Though that gap in turnout is huge, the fact that it exists is hardly surprising \u2013 it\u2019s a pretty well-known fact that the older an American is, the more likely they are to vote.</p> <p>But that wasn\u2019t always the case \u2013 as recently as 1990, Americans age 45 to 64 were as likely to vote as those age 65 and over. And in the elections of 1964 and 1968, Americans who were 25 to 44 years old were slightly more likely to cast a ballot than the oldest voters.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/09/age-voting-rates/\" data-alt=\"Chart on aging and voting rates\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/09/age-voting-rates/\">Chart on aging and voting rates</a> </figure>  <p>It\u2019s also overly simplistic to say that older Americans vote Republican, they\u2019re just a lot more likely than younger voters to do so. <a href=\"http://elections.nytimes.com/2012/results/president/exit-polls\">Exit polls</a> show that in 2012, 56% of voters age 65 and over voted for Republican candidate Mitt Romney compared to just 37% of the youngest voting group, those age 18 to 29.</p> <p>That translates to a 19 percentage point lead for Republicans among the oldest Americans. In 2008 it was 21 percentage points, and in 2004 it was just 9 percentage points. In other words, though this trend has long existed, the size of it depends on other factors too \u2013 factors like which candidates are standing for election.</p> <p><a href=\"http://graphics.latimes.com/usc-presidential-poll-dashboard/\">Polling</a> so far suggests that the 2016 candidates\u2019 popularity (or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/04/donald-trump-hillary-clinton-general-election-analysis\">lack thereof</a>) isn\u2019t a huge surprise in terms of these age trends. Voters age 65 and over are the group most likely to vote for Republican nominee Donald Trump; those age 18 to 34 are the least likely to vote for him.</p> <p>Don\u2019t forget though, correlation doesn\u2019t mean causality \u2013 the reasons why older voters lean Republican isn\u2019t necessarily their age per se. Older Americans are more likely to be white and they\u2019re also more likely to be religious (Protestant or Catholic in particular) \u2013 and both of those demographic groups also tend to vote Republican for reasons that are quite separate from pension plans.</p> <p>It\u2019s also a mistake to treat such a loose group as \u201cthe oldest voters\u201d as a single unit. Research from <a href=\"http://www.people-press.org/2015/09/03/the-whys-and-hows-of-generations-research/\">Pew Research Center</a> has found that baby boomers (those age 50 to 68) are less likely to identify with the label Republican than the uncomfortably titled silent generation (who are age 69 to 86).</p> <p>As for turnout, that is sometimes even harder to correctly forecast than voting intention. Will young Democrats who were galvanized by Hillary Clinton\u2019s former Democratic rival Bernie Sanders choose to stay at home now he\u2019s out of the race, making the older voting bloc even more powerful? Will older, more traditional Republicans be put off by Donald Trump\u2019s political style? Both questions demonstrate just how much it\u2019s the youngest and the oldest voters that will be crucial in determining the results of the 2016 election. </p>",

Bin Karubi, the president\u2019s adviser, described his recent trip to Washington as a \u201cpleading mission\u201d to avert sanctions.</p> <p>Bilateral aid cuts are also possible \u2013 though most assistance is humanitarian and thus difficult to reduce without hurting ordinary people.

At first, there were three settlements: Ifo, Dagahaley and Hagadera. Ifo II and Kambioos were later added. They are all generally called Dadaab, named after the nearby town 50 miles (80km) from the Somali border.</p> <p>Half a million people are estimated to live here. My family are among them. They arrived in Ifo in the early 1990s; I was born in 1996. </p> <p>I grew up and completed high school here in 2014, and I hope to start university soon.

In 2012, closing the camp was mooted due to \u201ceconomic concerns\u201d, and last year, the Kenyan deputy president, William Ruto, said Dadaab would be shut within three months, although this never happened.</p> <p>From the attack on the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/04/westgate-mall-attacks-kenya\">Westgate shopping mall</a> to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/apr/02/kenya-attack-survivors-garissa-al-shabaab\">slaughter at Garissa</a> University College, the Kenyan government has long blamed Somali refugees for insecurity, but for people in the camp, the most recent announcement feels like the most serious yet. The government disbanded the department for refugee affairs and politicians are keen to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/28/kenya-seaside-look-peaceful-murderous-war-al-shabaab\">appear in control</a> of national security, with a presidential election coming up next year.</p> <p>It is true that security has become an issue here. There is one main dusty road that runs through Ifo. I used to go there as a child to watch the cars drive past at exactly 8am, every day, etched with UN letters, carrying workers to their field offices. Today, it is almost dormant. </p> <p>Two Spanish aid workers from Doctors Without Borders were <a href=\"http://www.catalannewsagency.com/society-science/item/the-two-spanish-msf-workers-kidnapped-in-kenya-21-months-ago-are-released\">kidnapped in October 2011</a> and there have been multiple explosions over the years. Cars no longer move without a heavy security escort or following a predicable schedule. </p> <p>Other things have also changed. The playground where I played football is now occupied by people living in tents. The narrow path I walked to school is a graveyard and the hospital I attended as a child lies in ruins.</p> <h2><strong>What happens to us?</strong></h2> <p>The government has said we should return to Somalia voluntarily. This week, it <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-kenya-refugees-idUSKCN11R270\">asked the UN</a> for financial support, but has not disclosed many details on how our return can happen quickly and humanely. </p> <p>The UN refugee agency has a plan. UNHCR suggests that refugees awaiting resettlement in a third country, and those not originally from Somalia \u2013 about 30,000 people \u2013 should be rehomed at the Kakuma refugee camp, about 450 miles from Nairobi. </p> <p>It says 42,000 people living in Dadaab are registered Kenyan nationals and should be reintegrated into local communities. The remaining 170,000 refugees must return to Somalia.</p> <p>My family are in the first category. The UN opened a resettlement case for us in 2004 and we were supposed to go to live in the US. We attended the necessary medical examinations 17 times, but our flight never arrived.<br></p> <p>We suspect fraud. Maybe someone sold our slot and a different family went on it. This does happen.</p> <p>\u201cWait, be patient,\u201d is what I was told when I contacted the resettlement support centre, but 12 years is a long time to hold out. My father has given up; he says we should return to Somalia. But I was born here, in Kenya \u2013 a country that doesn\u2019t accept me.</p> <p>People in Dadaab are reacting to the threat of closure differently. Some, such as Hawa Abdi, 23, have gone back to Somalia of their own accord. I spoke to the mother of three children in Ifo II a week before she left in July. She explained that she had fled Sakow in 2011 after the devastating drought in Somalia. </p> <p>Abdi had heard that rainfall was predicted for her home town. \u201cIf Kenya doesn\u2019t want us, why should we stay here?\u201d she asked. </p> <p>But for Fatuma Mohamed, 44, a long-term resident of Ifo, this is home. Mohamed fled Somali in 1991 and has since married and had eight children here. \u201cThe land we had in Somalia has long been taken away and we don\u2019t have a place to return to ... I don\u2019t know what to do,\u201d she said, speaking at her polythene-thatched home with a kitchen made out of twigs.</p> <p>Mohamed Issack, 20, who grew up in Dagahaley, dreams of being accepted by his host country. \u201cI would have loved to be a Kenyan and free to live in any part of this country ... but that is not an option for me,\u201d he said. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/asadhussein_/status/738851697192259588\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Who has the courage to stand at the place where they were born and not cry?

We take the sum of these recent parts, and attempt to drive an important conversation forward, motivated by a simple ambition: that politics work to serve the public interest. We have that indirect power.</p> <p>People inside the system have direct power. They can actually create change. So rather than standing up at the National Press Club complaining about a breach of a gentleman\u2019s agreement during campaigns, or stamping your foot because your opponents had, without keeping you in the loop, developed a slicker way to target and disseminate their exaggerations, you could stop complaining and blame-shifting and butt-covering, and actually do something.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/sep/12/nick-xenophon-team-marshals-crossbench-support-for-political-donations-inquiry\">Nick Xenophon Team marshals crossbench support for political donations inquiry</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Novel I know, but let\u2019s give it a go. </p> <p>So what are the prospects of doing something rather than indulging in peevishness?</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/sep/15/turnbull-government-launches-sweeping-inquiry-into-donations\">joint standing committee on electoral matters (JSCEM) has been given a recent reference</a> wide-ranging enough to provide scope for concrete proposals to emerge that would overhaul the donations and disclosure system.</p> <p>Sticking with Nutt\u2019s specific complaint for a moment, the recent reference to JSCEM also includes a direction that the committee assess the potential application of truth-in-advertising provisions covering communication with voters \u2013 including third-party carriage services.</p> <p>Now why is this there? Partly because the brains trust of Liberal campaign 2016 is still seething about being <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/jul/06/scott-morrison-concedes-coalition-has-lessons-to-learn-over-medicare\">comprehensively done over on Medicare</a> \u2013 cranky enough to briefly contemplate a resort to regulation; and partly because Nick Xenophon \u2013 who controls a critical voting bloc in the new Senate \u2013 wants it there. Xenophon was thumped by negative advertising about penalty rates in South Australia in the closing stages of the recent election \u2013 a campaign which he says was misleading and ultimately depressed the NXT\u2019s vote.</p> <p>Regulating truth in politics is a tough business, because it\u2019s an art form that turns fundamentally on a clash of contestable propositions.

Ryan hasn\u2019t yet taken a public position on this issue.<br></p> <p>An issue Ryan has taken a position on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/sep/22/onations-reform-must-consider-rising-power-of-activist-groups-says-scott-ryan\">is the rise of third-party activist groups</a>. The strength of the progressive field operation in the recent federal election campaign <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/jul/06/election-2016-cory-bernardi-liberals-labor-volunteer-army\">has really rocked the Coalition</a>, which once traded on its dominance in marginal seats campaigning. Default mythology has it that the Liberals are supposed to be masters of marginals \u2013 not Labor, and certainly not actors outside the political process such as the union movement, single-issue campaign groups or GetUp!.</p> <p>The special minister of state says, albeit tentatively, he\u2019ll have a broad-ranging conversation about donations and disclosure \u2013 provided it covers all groups active in political campaigning, not just established political parties.</p> <p>His argument is motivated by concern that constraining political parties while leaving activist groups unconstrained can lead to perverse outcomes \u2013 you can empower groups that are not elected, and not accountable to anyone, at the expense of the people\u2019s representatives in a democracy, who are elected and are accountable to the citizenry.</p> <p>Ryan\u2019s rationale at the level of principle is sound. In a representative democracy, it is better that we strengthen political parties relative to other players in the system, because parliamentarians perform two functions in a democracy. They represent the interests of voters in a direct way, they are our representatives, and we can vote them out if they don\u2019t deliver. Formalising people power through representative democracy also works to constrain the influence of other powerful institutions in the system, because politicians are supposed to make decisions with an eye to the broader public interest. This is the theory, in any case.</p> <p>Nutt was correct this week in pointing to the American system as an example of what we don\u2019t want Australia to become \u2013 a universe where super political action committees are permitted to raise unlimited sums of money from corporations, unions, associations and individuals \u2013 and then spend without constraint in an effort to advocate for or against various candidates.</p> <p>At the philosophical level you could shrug and say that\u2019s free speech, that\u2019s the beauty of living in a democracy, but only if you are comfortable with the practical consequences of some voices being far more equal and influential than others. The peculiarities of the US system create politics written and authorised for the wealthy, or the institutionally powerful, by the wealthy or institutionally powerful \u2013 which is partly why we\u2019ve had the dramatic rupture we\u2019ve seen in this presidential season.</p> <p>Tracking back to Australia, and our own conversation, really important questions remain unanswered.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/sep/22/getup-says-coalition-should-not-blame-activist-groups-for-poor-election-result\">As GetUp! countered entirely reasonably this week in response to Ryan\u2019s signal</a>, what is an activist group for the purpose of this discussion? Just progressive activists? Are some activists more heinous than others? What about the Business Council of Australia or the Minerals Council, if those organisations campaign or advertise in an effort to influence policy outcomes? How about Cory Bernardi\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/jul/06/cory-bernardi-establishes-rightwing-movement-australian-conservatives\">new grassroots movement, Australian Conservatives</a> \u2013 in, or out?</p> <p>Is any regulation being proposed, and if there is, what form would it take, and will it apply to everyone?</p> <p>And what about all the activism we don\u2019t actually see \u2013 the soft power sorties by countries such as China or the United States or Israel, the ones that don\u2019t involve handing out leaflets in marginal seats? How about the hidden activity that goes on between politicians, lobbyists, donors, special interest groups \u2013 the activity that isn\u2019t recorded anywhere, isn\u2019t open to any meaningful scrutiny, unless an integrity body with broad-ranging powers flushes it out into the open \u2013 and Ryan says we don\u2019t need one of those at the federal level because we\u2019ve got the Australian Electoral Commission and the parliamentary press gallery. </p> <p>As a longtime member of the gallery, I can say without any shadow of a doubt I lack the investigative powers of an independent commission against corruption and, quite apart from my lack of investigatory power, often I lack the time to dig as much as I want to.</p> <p>So where have we landed? I know for the first time in a long time we have a process in train that could deliver a better outcome for voters.

We will all be arrested for this movie.\u2019</p> <p>\u201cNow, to be fair, Mel also said, a little more eloquently, that, \u2018Every human being has hundreds of separate people living inside his skin. And the talent of a writer is his ability to give them their separate names, identities, personalities and have them relate to other characters living within him.\u2019\u201d </p> <p>Other medal recipients included poet Louise Gl\u00fcck, composer Philip Glass and historian Isabel Wilkerson, author of The Warmth of Other Suns, and celebrity chef Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s, who pulled out of Trump\u2019s new Washington hotel over his anti-immigrant comments.</p> <p>Obama added: \u201cWe also honour Wynton Marsalis, who unfortunately could not make it here today, and Morgan Freeman, who undoubtedly is off playing a black president again.

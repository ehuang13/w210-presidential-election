Hillary Clinton paid a visit earlier to a health clinic in Miami, the epicenter of the Zika outbreak in the US, and appealed to Republican leaders to convene an emergency session of Congress to pass funding to combat the mosquito-borne virus, <em>reports <strong>Sabrina Siddiqui </strong>in Washington</em>.</p> <p>The Democratic nominee used the bully pulpit of the presidential campaign to voice her frustration with lawmakers in Washington, who left town last month for a summer recess without meeting the federal government\u2019s request for funds to fight the spread of the Zika virus.</p> <p>\u201cI am very disappointed that the Congress went on recess before actually agreeing on what they would do to put the resources into this fight,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cAnd I really am hoping that they will pay attention.\u201d</p> <p>Clinton delivered her remarks following a tour of the Borinquen Health Care Center, a community clinic in Miami\u2019s Wynwood neighborhood, which has borne the brunt of Florida\u2019s Zika outbreak. The state of Florida, a key battleground in November\u2019s presidential race, has been the most severely hit by the virus, which poses the greatest threat to pregnant women due to its cause of birth defects such as microcephaly.</p> <p>Clinton said she first learned of Zika in December through her daughter Chelsea, who was pregnant at the time with her second child. </p> <p>\u201cWe don\u2019t want to wake up in a year and read so many more stories about babies like the little girl who just died in Houston,\u201d Clinton said, citing a fatal case of Zika-related microcephaly reported out of Texas on Tuesday. </p> <p>\u201cThat is just not something we should tolerate in our country.\u201d</p> <p>The Obama administration requested a $1.9bn spending package several months ago, basing its figure on the needs of public health officials at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. </p> <p>The request quickly devolved into partisan politics on Capitol Hill, as House Republicans instead passed a measure that included riders to overturn certain clean water regulations, restricted money for Planned Parenthood and undermined the health care law. Senate Democrats twice filibustered the House-passed proposal, which Barack Obama has also said he would veto.</p> <p>Republicans have in turn accused Democrats of blocking the necessary funding and on Tuesday took aim at Tim Kaine, the Virginia senator and Clinton\u2019s vice presidential running mate, for voting against their Zika bill. Clinton urged lawmakers to put aside politics and advance a separate bipartisan agreement that cleared the Senate in June and would allocate $1.1bn in funding with no strings attached.</p> <p>She also took aim at Republican nominee Donald Trump, who has ignored the Zika virus all together and told a local television station in Florida he did not need to opine on the issue because the state\u2019s governor, Rick Scott, had it \u201cunder control\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cI disagree with those who say that Zika is an insignificant issue,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cThis is something we need to take seriously.\u201d</p> <p>Contrary to Trump\u2019s claims, Scott, a Republican who has endorsed the nominee, has sounded repeated alarms over the Zika outbreak. He, too, implored US lawmakers to return to Washington and address the funding gap.</p> <p>\u201cThe federal government must stop playing politics and Congress needs to immediately come back to session to resolve this,\u201d Scott said on Tuesday, as Florida\u2019s health department identified four more individuals who likely contracted Zika through a mosquito bite.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/09/zika-virus-could-be-linked-with-whole-spectrum-of-disorders\">Zika virus could be linked with 'whole spectrum' of disorders</a> </p> </aside> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-08-10T17:45:41.031Z\">at 6.45pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57aa43e0e4b03b51a99e18f2\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-09T20:58:24.267Z\">9.58pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Salman Rushdie, himself no stranger to threats of assassination, has delivered his verdict on the nature of Donald Trump\u2019s remarks:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/SalmanRushdie/status/763114271039451136\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Of course the Trump flacks are now trying to confuse the issue, but Senator Murphy is clear about what Trump meant. <a href=\"https://t.co/7fDmDyCSjw\">https://t.co/7fDmDyCSjw</a></p>&mdash; Salman Rushdie (@SalmanRushdie) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SalmanRushdie/status/763114271039451136\">August 9, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57aa41c6e4b0f5d064841f0b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-09T20:49:25.772Z\">9.49pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <h2>US Secret Service, on Donald Trump\u2019s comments:</h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The Secret Service is aware of the comment.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57aa40e3e4b0f5d064841f07\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-09T20:49:03.610Z\">9.49pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The NRA might have changed the channel a little early.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/NRA/status/763110521889402880\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">.<a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump\">@RealDonaldTrump</a> is right.

So, in the interest of providing as much information as possible to American readers and voters, here are Trump\u2019s full comments regarding the Second Amendment today:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Hillary wants to abolish, essentially, the Second Amendment. By the way, if she gets to pick, if she gets to pick her judges, nothing you can do, folks. Although the Second Amendment people, maybe there is, I dunno. But I tell you what, that will be a horrible day. If Hillary gets to put her judges in, right now we\u2019re tied. You see what\u2019s going on. We\u2019re tied \u2018cause Scalia, this was not supposed to happen. Justice Scalia was going to be around for ten more years, at least, and this is what happened. That was a horrible thing, So now look at it. So Hillary essentially wants to abolish the second amendment.</p> <p>Now speaking to the NRA folks, who are great: when you, when you, and I tell you, so they endorsed me. They endorsed me very early. My sons are members. I\u2019m a member. If you, we can add, I think the National Rifle Association, we can add the Second Amendment to the justices, they almost go, in a certain way, hand and hand. Now the justices are going to do things that are so important. And we have such great justices. You saw my list of eleven that have been vetted and respected and have gotten great, and they, a little bit, equate.</p> <p>But if you don\u2019t do what\u2019s the right thing, you\u2019re not going to have - either you\u2019re not going to have a Second Amendment or you\u2019re not going to have much of it left. And you\u2019re not going to be able to protect yourselves, which you need. Which you need! When the bad guys burst into your hours, they\u2019re not looking about Second Amendments and \u2018do I have the right to do this.\u2019 The bad guys aren\u2019t going to be giving up their weapons. But the good people will say, \u2018oh, well, that\u2019s the law.\u2019 No, no. Not going to happen. We can\u2019t let it happen. We can\u2019t let it happen.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57aa3d44e4b0f5d064841ef4\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-09T20:30:29.384Z\">9.30pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Video: </strong>Donald Trump implying that the use of firearms might be adequate response to Hillary Clinton\u2019s selection of supreme court justices.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/aug/09/trump-clinton-second-amendment-people-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/4q7nk\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2643266\"            data-video-name=\"Trump suggests 'second amendment people' could stop Clinton \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"Reuters\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57aa3839e4b03b51a99e18bf\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/08/09/080916trumpsecond_KP-28685879_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/08/09/080916trumpsecond_KP-28685879.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/08/09/080916trumpsecond_KP-28685879_V4.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/aug/09/trump-clinton-second-amendment-people-video\">Trump suggests \u2018second amendment people\u2019 could stop Clinton</a></figcaption> </figure>  </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57aa3cf6e4b03b51a99e18d7\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-09T20:29:27.584Z\">9.29pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Roger Stone, an informal adviser to the Trump campaign, <a href=\"http://www.breitbart.com/milo/2016/07/29/roger-stone-milo-show-trump-can-fight-voter-fraud/\">implied last month</a> to internet agitator Milo Yiannopoulos that the notion of discrediting the election as \u201cillegitimate\u201d is part of Trump\u2019s campaign strategy.</p> <p>\u201cI think we have widespread voter fraud, but the first thing that Trump needs to do is begin talking about it constantly,\u201d Stone said. \u201cHe needs to say for example, today would be a perfect example: \u2018I am leading in Florida.

  "<p>Cast shakeups are nothing new at <a href=\"http://www.nbc.com/saturday-night-live\">Saturday Night Live</a>, a show with a revolving door, where comedians can cut their teeth before moving on to bigger things or, well, just moving on and doing their Debbie Downer face when they appear on The $100,000 Pyramid a decade after they\u2019ve left the late night staple. (Sorry, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TheRealDratch?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">Rachel Dratch</a>.) But the departure of <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/tv/2016/08/09/snl-drops-taran-killam-jay-pharoah-cast-shakeup/88441498/\">Taran Killam and Jay Pharoah</a> still seems rather curious.<br></p> <p>The contracts for both men, who joined in 2010, <a href=\"http://variety.com/2016/tv/columns/snl-jay-pharoah-taran-killam-leaving-lorne-michaels-1201833248/\">were not renewed</a>. Killam <a href=\"http://uproxx.com/tv/taran-killam-leaving-snl-interview/2/\">told Uproxx</a> that he expected to return but Lorne Michaels, the longtime executive producer of the show, must have had other ideas. (He seems to be taking it in stride and even <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TaranKillam/status/763009853900124160\">joking about his ouster</a> on Twitter.) Jon Rudnitsky, a featured player for one season, <a href=\"http://deadline.com/2016/08/saturday-night-live-jon-rudnitsky-featured-player-depart-1201800755/\">was also let go</a>. </p> <p>It\u2019s an odd time to be parting ways with both men for several reasons, the biggest of which is that the cast isn\u2019t really full of breakout stars or household names like the Andy Sambergs, Kristen Wiigs and Will Ferrells of old. Along with <a href=\"https://www.nbc.com/saturday-night-live/cast/kate-mckinnon-15056\">Kate McKinnon</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Lesdoggg?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">Leslie Jones</a>, these were two of the only standouts in a cast of relative unknowns. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ft5XUalItuY\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Ft5XUalItuY?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Taran Killam as Donald Trump. </figcaption> </figure>   <p>It makes sense for Killam \u2013 who was often in more sketches than any other player \u2013 to move on, probably to a lucrative movie career. He\u2019s already starred in films as diverse as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/aug/01/the-heat-review\">The Heat</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/jan/09/12-years-a-slave-review\">12 Years a Slave</a> and should have plenty of opportunities ahead of him. Dumping Pharoah, however, is strange for several reasons. First of all he does the resident Barack Obama impersonation, and considering that the show will be covering politics quite a bit between its 1 October premiere and the election in November, it makes sense to have someone who can do the sitting president in the cast. Obama may be a lame duck, but he\u2019s our lame duck until January. </p> <p>Saturday Night Live has been called under fire in recent years for its lack of diversity, especially for having no black women on the cast, something that it very publicly corrected. That\u2019s why it seems odd to dismiss one of the more prominent actors of color on the roster. Pharoah is a master impressionist who can cycle through a <a href=\"http://www.hulu.com/watch/914049\">variety of black comedians</a> or <a href=\"http://www.nbc.com/saturday-night-live/video/weekend-update-jay-pharoah-on-rappers-meeting/3036127\">a whole pack of rappers</a> in one sitting. If the show wants to be more in touch with a world where Kevin Hart and Jay Z are two of the biggest celebrities on the planet, ousting Pharoah seems like a bit of a fumble. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbSuHLaw5g4\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/wbSuHLaw5g4?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Jay Pharoah impersonates black comedians. </figcaption> </figure>   <p>As they do every summer, SNL is scouting for talent and will be sure to hire some replacements by the fall. Picking up a person of color seems like an absolute necessity, maybe even one with an Obama impression is his (or her!) back pocket. Maybe they should rescue <a href=\"http://www.jeremydhoward.com/\">Jeremy D Howard</a>, one of the standouts from the otherwise mediocre reboot of Mad TV on the CW. Here\u2019s an outrageous idea, why not solve their diversity and visibility problems in one fell swoop and hire an underused veteran improv star, like <a href=\"https://twitter.com/waynebrady?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">Wayne Brady</a>? </p> <p>Since we\u2019re talking about diversity, how about adding a gay male to the cast to join <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/entertainthis/2016/08/09/gillian-anderson-48-birthday-kate-mckinnon-throwback-video/88444092/\">Kate McKinnon</a>, the first out lesbian cast member. There hasn\u2019t been a gay man on the program since <a href=\"http://www.nbc.com/saturday-night-live/cast/terry-sweeney-15326\">Terry Sweeney</a> in the mid-80s. Someone like Cole Escola or Drew Droege, whose YouTube impersonations of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-15Afl1Fy9Y\">Bernadette Peters</a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-LRITaHUbI\">Chlo\u00eb Sevigny</a> are excellent successors to Maya Rudolph\u2019s Donatella Versace, would be great additions to the cast. Also, there have still been no Asian cast members on the show ever (though Rob Schneider and Fred Armisen are both part Asian) and it definitely seems time that was rectified.

  "<p>Some Republicans fear Donald Trump is reaching the point of no return as party stalwarts turn against him and his national poll numbers continue to plunge.<br></p> <p>Susan Collins of Maine, the most senior Republican woman in the Senate, on Monday announced her <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/08/susan-collins-donald-trump-washington-post-op-ed-republican\">intention not to vote for her party\u2019s nominee</a>, while 50 of the GOP\u2019s former national security officials signed an open letter calling Trump the most reckless candidate in history.</p> <p>Opinion polls show Hillary Clinton consolidating a significant lead. A Fox News survey shows her up by 10 percentage points; <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/hillary-clintons-lead-over-donald-trump-widens-to-9-points-poll-shows-1470347810?mod=wsj_streaming_latest-headlines\">an NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll</a> puts her nine points ahead; and a Washington Post/ABC News survey gives her a margin of eight points. Real Clear Politics\u2019 current polling average gives Clinton <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/us/general_election_trump_vs_clinton-5491.html\">a lead of 7.5 points</a>.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of writing on the wall,\u201d said <a href=\"http://www.wwsg.com/speakers/rick-tyler/\">Rick Tyler</a>, former spokesman for Trump\u2019s Republican primary rival Ted Cruz. \u201cThree weeks after the conventions, the candidate leading the polls usually wins. There\u2019s still a week to go until we reach that point, but I don\u2019t see what\u2019s going to move 10 points.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Three weeks after the conventions, the candidate leading the polls usually wins</p> <footer> <cite>Rick Tyler, former spokesman for Ted Cruz</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>There are growing signs that Republicans who sense Trump cannot win might move to ostracise him, whether out of principle or self-preservation or both. Tyler added: \u201cThe peeling off is remarkable. You have a conservative, Ted Cruz, and now the most moderate Republican in the Senate, Susan Collins, not endorsing Trump.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s very problematic. You have Republicans on both ends of the spectrum distancing themselves from Trump. It represents an ideological schism; the party is substantially divided.\u201d</p> <p>A generation after the so-called \u201cReagan Democrats\u201d ensured a landslide victory for Ronald Reagan, some commentators now speculate that \u201cClinton Republicans\u201d could produce a similarly one-sided result, putting once safe states such as Arizona and Georgia into play.</p> <p>Collins, who is not seeking re-election this year, is the sixth out of 54 Senate Republicans to say they will not vote for Trump. She explained that the tipping point in her decision was his recent attacks on the family of fallen US army captain <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/07/humayun-khan-donald-trump-military-arlington-national-cemetery\">Humayun Khan</a>. \u201cHe does not have the restraint and the consideration and the judgment and the knowledge to handle those dangerous events with which presidents are inevitably confronted,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/08/09/politics/sen-susan-collins-explains-opposition-to-donald-trump-says-he-will-make-the-world-more-dangerous/index.html\">Collins told CNN</a>.</p> <p>The senator, a close ally of Senate colleague John McCain, added that she would not vote for Clinton but had yet to decide whether to vote for the Libertarian party or write in a name on the ballot paper. \u201cI have always supported my party\u2019s nominee. That\u2019s what made this decision so difficult, but in the end I just cannot support Donald Trump. I do not believe that he is the president that we need at this time in our country\u2019s history and I believe that in many ways he is antithetical to the values of the Republican party.\u201d</p> <p>Following hard upon the joint letter from former national security officials, it was the last thing Trump needed as he tried to get his campaign back on track with a speech in Detroit <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/08/donald-trump-tax-plan-business-income-middle-class\">setting out his economic platform</a>. This followed a wretched run of gaffes following a Republican national convention last month that had been billed as a moment of party unity.</p> <p>Instead, the trickle of defections threatens to turn into a stampede. Meg Whitman, the technology executive and former Republican candidate for governor in California, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/03/meg-whitman-endorses-hillary-clinton-donald-trump\">is backing Clinton</a>. On Tuesday, William Ruckelshaus and William Reilly, former administrators of the Environmental Protection Agency under Republican presidents, also endorsed the Democrat.</p> <p>\u201cRepublicans have a long history of support for the environment dating back to Theodore Roosevelt,\u201d they said in a joint statement. \u201cDonald Trump threatens to destroy that legacy of respect for the environment and protection of public health ... That is why as Republicans, we support Hillary Clinton for president.\u201d</p> <p>Four Republican former secretaries of state \u2013 James Baker, Henry Kissinger, Condoleezza Rice and George Shultz \u2013 have yet to announce their intentions. None responded to requests for comment from the Guardian on Tuesday.</p> <p>And Republicans facing tight congressional races in November are weighing whether to back or sack Trump. <a href=\"http://coffman.house.gov/\">Colorado congressman Mike Coffman</a> has launched a TV advert in which he promises to \u201cstand up\u201d to the nominee. \u201cPeople ask me, \u2018What do you think about Trump?\u2019\u201d the Iraq war veteran says. \u201cHonestly, I don\u2019t care for him much.\u201d</p> <p>But some in the party argue that the divisions cannot be blamed on Trump alone. Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, told the Guardian via email: \u201cThe cracks have been there a long time. If Trump were not the nominee you would still have tensions, they would just manifest differently (as we saw in 2012).</p> <p>\u201cTrump\u2019s strongest argument is, \u2018the ones who are not supporting me are the very ones who created the mess I\u2019m trying to fix\u2019. There will be more defections \u2013 likely by people who didn\u2019t support Trump in the first place. For Trump he now has to figure out how to navigate around those headlines \u2013 not be creating negative ones of his own \u2013 and resecure his base support and grow it with independent voters he may have lost in the past week.\u201d</p> <p>George Ajjan, a Republican strategist, said: \u201cAs bad as the Republican convention was for Trump, he still managed to get a bounce. This suggests that there is a broad constituency for Trump\u2019s anti-establishment brand of politics, which should not be underestimated. </p> <p>\u201cBut the infighting is a major distraction. Normally a candidate seeks endorsements from neutral figures outside of his party. Clinton is doing this successfully but Trump\u2019s energy is wasted on internal rebellion. To be fair, some of these defections on the part of senators in close races reflect their own self-preservation instincts and not necessarily a systemic breakdown of party unity.</p> <p>\u201cA worst-case scenario would be a third party plucking away a prominent former Republican senator or governor as its [presidential] nominee in a bid to steal away disgruntled establishment voters. That would mean open war and a total collapse of party unity.\u201d</p> <p>On Monday, a former CIA agent, Evan McMullin, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/08/republican-evan-mcmullin-presidential-run-trump\">launched an independent run</a> for president in the hope of offering conservatives an alternative to Trump. He has already missed the deadline to get on the ballot in numerous states, but, as a Mormon from Utah, could hurt Trump among Republicans there.</p> <p>Even three months out, some pundits believe it is all over bar the shouting. Stuart Rothenberg, an analyst and publisher of the Rothenberg Political Report newsletter, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2016/08/09/donald-trump-needs-a-miracle-to-win/\">wrote in the Washington Post</a>: \u201cThree months from now, with the 2016 presidential election in the rear-view mirror, we will look back and agree that the presidential election was over on Aug. 9th.</p> <p>\u201cA dispassionate examination of the data, combined with a cold-blooded look at the candidates, the campaigns and presidential elections, produces only one possible conclusion: Hillary Clinton will defeat Donald Trump in November, and the margin isn\u2019t likely to be as close as Barack Obama\u2019s victory over Mitt Romney.\u201d</p> <p>But one recent ray of light for Trump came when he was <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/08/07/politics/george-p-bush-donald-trump-jeb-bush\">endorsed by George P Bush</a>, the Texas land commissioner and son of former candidate Jeb Bush, who clashed bitterly with Trump during the Republican primaries. </p> <p>And Trump\u2019s campaign can still hope that he will be viewed as the lesser of two evils by those who have long been hostile to Clinton. On Tuesday, Sean Spicer, the Republican National Committee\u2019s chief strategist, issued an email headed \u201cWe Can\u2019t Afford The Consequences Of A Clinton Presidency\u201d, which spent 10 paragraphs attacking her record and only mentioned Trump in the final sentence.</p> <p>The nominee himself suggested on Tuesday there would be no major shift of strategy. \u201cI think it\u2019s just, you know, steadiness,\u201d Trump told Fox Business. \u201cAnd it\u2019s just doing what I\u2019m doing.\u201d</p>",

Social conservatives of the pro-life, pro-gun, pro-not-gay marriage variety eventually landed with Ted Cruz. Then there were the unexcitable moderate types who limped along quietly behind John Kasich to the bitter end, hoping for some sort of divine intervention in Cleveland that never happened. </p> <p>Last but not least, there was the remaining pissed off 30 to 40% of the GOP, the angry, white, middle-class Americans who wanted a narcissistic, sociopathic, Mexican-hating, baby-expelling, parents-of-a-dead-war-hero-offending, (I\u2019ll stop there even though there\u2019s so much more) reality TV star. </p> <p>Then after Trump won the Indiana primary, when every other candidate dropped out, GOP \u201cleaders\u201d decided that rather than stand on principle and forever lose the Trumpsters, who make up about a third of the party, they would throw their half-hearted, afraid-to-say-his-name-in-public support to \u201cthe nominee.\u201d </p> <p>They justify their support by saing things like, \u201cWe have to protect the supreme court from Hillary Clinton\u201d and citing a list of potential nominees that some junior Trump staffer lifted off the Heritage Foundation\u2019s website.

And he can thank the freak show that is Donald Trump\u2019s Republican party for restoring his stature as a unifying, national leader with a moderated and mature approach to a complex and unstable world.</p> <p>Eight years ago, Obama represented an existential threat to the Republican party, and not just because he was going to lead the Democratic party to win the White House and Congress by large margins.</p> <p>No, Obama\u2019s biggest threat was that he could realign American politics, shifting it fundamentally towards progressives for a generation. He and his campaign aides talked privately of being the Reagan of the left: a transformative figure who would leave an indelible legislative mark at home and restore America\u2019s position on the world stage.</p> <p>With his appeal to independents and moderate Republicans, Obama could break the Republican party as a national force. With his appeal to minority voters \u2013 a rapidly emerging majority across the country \u2013 he could lock in the fastest growing demographics that could turn red states blue.</p> <p>So the GOP leadership chose to make Obama unacceptable, unpalatable and un-American. On the night of his first inauguration, House Republican leaders met at a Washington steakhouse to plot their path back to power. They would not reform their policies or consider the root cause of their defeat. Instead, they would oppose Obama on everything, well before he tried to pass a giant stimulus bill or healthcare reform.</p> <p>They needed to deny him a reputation for bipartisanship and mainstream politics, and they succeeded. He wasn\u2019t reasonable; he was an ideologue. His vision of healthcare reform wasn\u2019t a free-market system based on Republican plans; it was a socialist takeover that would destroy the American way of life. He was inviting terrorist attacks on the homeland, not hunting down Osama bin Laden. He was acting in unconstitutional ways because he wasn\u2019t really American at all.</p> <p>The party of Sarah Palin, Herman Cain, Michele Bachmann and Roger Ailes had turned him into their own kind of freak.</p> <p>Before he finished his second year in office, Obama was such an object of Republican loathing that the Senate GOP leader Mitch McConnell could say \u2013 with impunity \u2013 that \u201cthe single most important thing we want to achieve is for President Obama to be a one-term president.\u201d</p> <p>If your political priorities are the total defeat of a single politician \u2013 not the advancement of your own policies through debate or legislation \u2013 then you are already in pretty desperate shape.

That\u2019s lower than when Reagan left office in 1988, and it\u2019s lower than when Bill Clinton won re-election in 1996.</p> <p>The rate stood at 8.3% in Obama\u2019s first full month in office, and not much below that when he won re-election. For a president with a job-killing economic plan, that\u2019s not a shabby performance.</p> <p>Sure enough, Obama\u2019s approval ratings (52%) are almost identical to Reagan\u2019s in August 1988 (53%) and a dramatic contrast to those of George W Bush (32%) in 2008. One of these Republican presidents was succeeded by his own vice-president; the other was succeeded by Barack Obama.</p> <p>This should lead to some serious soul-searching inside the Republican party. Not a post-mortem about how to reach out to Latino voters, but a dismantling of the politics of personal destruction, and the creation of a new, hopeful agenda that can appeal to the mainstream.</p> <p>Instead, the only point of unity inside the GOP is its gleeful hatred of Hillary Clinton, and its thinly veiled disdain for a nominee who has yet to find a politician he can\u2019t insult.</p> <p>The Republican party did not entirely fail to destroy Barack Obama. For a few years, aided by the great recession, they almost succeeded. But then they contrived to revive him by nominating a man who would destroy everything Obama stood for, along with much of the free world as we know it.<br></p> <p>The rise of Trump has led, perversely, to the revival of Obama.

Chase that feeling.</p> <p><strong>DON\u2019T </strong>spend more time discussing female athletes\u2019 makeup, hairdos, very small shorts, hijabs, bitchy resting faces, voice pitch, thigh circumference, marital status and age than you spend analysing the incredible feats of strength and skill they have honed over a lifetime of superhuman discipline and restraint.</p> <p><strong>DON\u2019T</strong> refer to women in terms of men they know, are related to, work with or have sex with. Women are fully-formed, autonomous people who do things. We are not pets or gadgets or sex-baubles.</p> <p><strong>DO</strong> write about gender when it\u2019s relevant, such as when you\u2019re discussing gender discrimination \u2013 for instance, the pay gap in women\u2019s basketball and soccer, and the garbage way the media covers (or doesn\u2019t) women\u2019s sports.</p> <p><strong>DON\u2019T</strong> bring your sex feelings into it. And, yes, I am aware that there are more than several women on Twitter with passionate opinions about the shoulder-to-waist ratios of the piles of trapezoids on the men\u2019s swimming roster. But there is not currently a vacuum of serious, well-rounded coverage of men\u2019s sports. There is not a historic precedent of men\u2019s bodies eclipsing their accomplishments, and, in turn, undermining their credibility and hobbling their upward mobility in every major industry. It is OK to have sex feelings. Just watch where you\u2019re spraying them.</p> <p>Of course, there is plenty of smart, nuanced, neutral Olympics coverage out there too, and live TV is hard, and people make mistakes. But the way we talk about women \u2013 particularly women at the top of their fields, women whose power and prowess is undeniable \u2013 has a tangible impact on the way we treat female colleagues, female job interviewees and female presidents. This is not an accident. It is the system working as designed.</p> <p>Athletes are athletes. If you care about sports, write about sports. If you care about gender equality, write about sports.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/08/marathon-promo-full/\" data-alt=\"RioRun\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/08/marathon-promo-full/\">RioRun</a> </figure>",
  "<h2>Doping controversy hits the pool in Rio</h2> <p>The question of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/08/lilly-king-ryan-murphy-swimming-gold-rio-2016\">sports doping</a> was pushed to the forefront of the women\u2019s 100m breaststroke final at the Rio Olympics on Monday night, when US swimmer Lilly King won gold and then called into question her team-mate Justin Gatlin\u2019s place at the Games. \u201cDo I think someone who has been caught for doping should be on the team? No, I don\u2019t,\u201d King said after the race. King beat her Russian rival, Yulia Efimova, who served a 16-month suspension for a pair of positive drug tests before being controversially reinstated, and said her win over the Russian was a \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/09/efimova-and-sun-on-podium-as-king-delivers-victory-for-clean-sport\">victory for clean sport</a>\u201d. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/ng-interactive/2016/aug/05/rio-olympics-2016-medal-table-and-results-in-full?utm_source=esp&amp;utm_medium=Email&amp;utm_campaign=GU+Today+main+NEW+H+categories&amp;utm_term=185218&amp;subid=18388944&amp;CMP=EMCNEWEML6619I2_footer\">Here</a> is the medal table so far (USA has the early edge over China) and Team USA\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/09/rio-viewing-guide-olympics-day-four-team-usa\">day four highlights</a>, while here DJ Gallo wonders if America will ever win a medal in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2016/aug/09/usa-olympic-badminton-medal\">table tennis, trampoline, handball, rhythmic gymnastics or badminton</a>.

Trump said his economic plan would reduce income tax brackets from seven levels to three \u2013 of 12%, 25% and 33% \u2013 and entirely eliminate income taxes for individuals who earn less than $25,000 annually, or $50,000 for a married couple. \u201cWe will make America grow again,\u201d Trump said.

On Saturday, Rigell told the New York Times he would vote for Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson, and earlier last week Hanna said he would vote for the Democratic nominee, Hillary Clinton.</p> <p>Both Rigell and Hanna have said they intend to retire after this term, and Collins does not face re-election this fall. She has consistently criticized Trump\u2019s racially charged and offensive comments throughout the primary and had refused to say whether she would vote for Trump.</p> <p>Other Republican senators put in difficult positions by Trump include John McCain, running for re-election in an increasingly Hispanic Arizona, and Kelly Ayotte, running for re-election in moderate New Hampshire. Trump <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/05/donald-trump-endorses-paul-ryan-wisconsin-rally\">awkwardly endorsed both senators</a> last week after initially refusing to do so.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s \u201cconstant stream of cruel comments\u201d disturbed Collins throughout the primary and through the Republican convention, she wrote, \u201cbut it was his attacks directed at people who could not respond on an equal footing \u2013 either because they do not share his power or stature or because professional responsibility precluded them from engaging at such a level \u2013 that revealed Mr Trump as unworthy of being our president\u201d.</p> <p>In particular, Collins cited Trump\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/nov/26/donald-trump-mock-new-york-times-reporter-disability\">mockery of a disabled reporter</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jul/19/donald-trump-john-mccain-vietnam-prisoner-of-war\">of Senator McCain\u2019s war service</a> last year, his insistence that a federal judge from Indiana <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/05/donald-trump-muslim-judges-face-the-nation\">had racial bias because his parents were from Mexico</a>, and finally his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/30/donald-trump-muslim-father-khizr-khan-democratic-convention-speech\">criticism of two gold star parents</a>, Khizr and Ghazala Khan, whose son Humayun was a US army captain killed in Iraq protecting other soldiers.</p> <p>\u201cRather than honoring their sacrifice and recognizing their pain, Mr Trump disparaged the religion of the family of an American hero,\u201d Collins wrote. \u201cAnd once again, he proved incapable of apologizing, of saying he was wrong.\u201d</p> <p>The senator also described Trump as a threat to world security, saying his \u201clack of self-restraint and his barrage of ill-informed comments would make an already perilous world even more so. It is reckless for a presidential candidate to publicly raise doubts about honoring treaty commitments with our allies.\u201d</p> <p>Collins also responded to assurances from Trump\u2019s campaign and some Republican leaders that Trump would soften his tone in the general election, and cease criticizing party members and minorities. \u201cThere will be no \u2018new\u2019 Donald Trump,\u201d she wrote, \u201cjust the same candidate who will slash and burn and trample anything and anyone he perceives as being in his way or an easy scapegoat.\u201d</p> <p>Maine\u2019s Republican governor, Paul LePage, has <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2016/may/14/who-supports-donald-trump-the-new-republican-center-of-gravity\">endorsed Trump</a>, and the candidate himself <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ft9oujWos64\">held a rally in Portland</a>, Maine, last week, despite the state\u2019s long history of voting Democratic in general elections. Collins is more moderate than some of her peers in the Senate, and penned <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/24/gun-control-bipartisan-bill-congress-senate-house\">a compromise bill on gun control</a> earlier this year that has failed to gain traction. She was also the first Republican senator who <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2014/06/susan-collins-supports-same-sex-marriage-108339\">supports same-sex marriage</a> and won re-election in 2014.</p> <p>She maintained that she will help campaign for other Republicans, but not Trump.</p> <p>\u201cI revere the history of my party, most particularly the value it has always placed on the worth and dignity of the individual,\u201d she wrote, concluding: \u201cIt is because of Mr Trump\u2019s inability and unwillingness to honor that legacy that I am unable to support his candidacy.\u201d</p>",

He even doesn\u2019t resent being knocked down by Erislandy Savon, a Cuban heavyweight in the fine tradition and a nephew of the great Felix. On Monday night Okolie went over again, having been stopped in a round by Savon before the tournament, but got up and gave a decent account of himself to go the distance.<br></p> <p><br>\u201cIt was good and bad,\u201d he said, as a psychology student might. \u201cBad because I didn\u2019t get the decision, good because I\u2019ve progressed since our last fight. This time I went the three rounds. The knockdown took a lot of the momentum that I was trying to build.\u201d<br>His seemingly modest effort has to be put in context: Savon has had more than 250 amateur bouts; Okolie has now had 26 - and he would fight the Cuban again tomorrow if he could. He reckons he could be among the top four amateur heavyweights in the world, and says he is learning new tricks in every fight. Good place to learn them: at the Olympics against a Cuban.<br><br>\u201cIt\u2019s heartbreaking knowing there\u2019s someone better than me out there but it can\u2019t stay that way much longer.\u201d<br><br>Okolie said he took a call before the fight from the world heavyweight champion Anthony Joshua, who took a close decision against Savon in London four years ago. \u201cHe told me to just relax,\u201d Okolie said. But not to the point of going on the canvas, he might have added.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57a91c2ee4b0f5d064841a40\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-08T23:56:33.400Z\">12.56am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>And that\u2019s game, set and match for Serena Williams</strong> as she beats Alize Cornet in two sets (7-6, 6-2.)

It was always a tough draw, with the Frenchwoman ranked world No3 to Davis\u2019s 12, but the 23-year-old from London was determined to dwell on the positives, even in defeat.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m the strongest I\u2019ve ever been. I came prepared today and you can have a hard draw and that\u2019s just judo. You get beaten on the day, that\u2019s just the way it is. You\u2019ve got to come back stronger, fitter. I 100% believe my day will come. I know I will be world champion, European champion and hopefully Olympic champion one day,\u201d she said. Tokyo 2020 will be her time, she vowed.</p> <p>She said she was mentally stronger than any of her opponents, largely because of her background. She was brought up by a single mother on a west London council estate and said the hard knocks toughened her up:</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t have everything as a kid growing up. I didn\u2019t have a lot of materialistic things. My mum didn\u2019t have a lot of money. So dealing with those things, and my mum had quite a tough upbringing in life, she came over here from Jamaica with me to give us a better life. She always taught me not to take things for granted and anything you do get in life you\u2019ve got to work hard for. I think that\u2019s where my mental strength and toughness comes from, my mum being a single mum and how hard she struggled. I knew that I would have to put the work in in life to make something of myself and not be poor. So it really comes from that.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ada8a8d1254c66fa49117500b04b6d022628d8ed\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ada8a8d1254c66fa49117500b04b6d022628d8ed/0_0_3500_1997/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The women\u2019s sabre individual quarter-finals continues at the Carioca Arena.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"571\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The women\u2019s sabre individual quarter-finals continues at the Carioca Arena.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nacho Doce/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-08-08T16:20:58.265Z\">at 5.20pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57a8ade0e4b03b51a99e120c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-08T16:07:05.322Z\">5.07pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Paul Drinkhall is in table tennis action now against Andrej Gacina of Croatia in round four</strong>.

Even more remarkable is that top neoconservatives in the party are all taking the Democrat\u2019s side: Clinton has said Trump \u201cshouldn\u2019t have his finger on the button\u201d of our nuclear arsenal. It looks like even Republican top brass agrees.</p> <p>On Thursday <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/08/08/politics/republican-national-security-letter-donald-trump-election-2016/\">a long list of GOP national security hands wrote a letter</a> saying Trump would be \u201cthe most reckless president in American history\u201d and that electing him in November would but the nation\u2019s security at risk. Some of the 50 signatories said they\u2019d vote for Clinton while others deemed it better to abstain from voting entirely. But all were in fundamental agreement on one main point: \u201cTrump is not qualified and would be dangerous.\u201d</p> <p>This comes after Evan McMullin, a former CIA official who recently worked for the House Republican conference, filed papers to run for president as an independent candidate. He doesn\u2019t support Clinton, and having missed the ballot-access deadlines in most states, the move is expected to have little effect on the race other than to help the former secretary of state by cutting into Trump\u2019s margins.

It was the latest sign of traditional Republicans, usually a fractious group, striking at Trump while the nominee reels under signs of cratering poll numbers and self-inflicted political wounds.</p> <p>Many of the signatories have made their doubts known before. A March letter published at the online national-security salon<a href=\"http://warontherocks.com/2016/03/open-letter-on-donald-trump-from-gop-national-security-leaders/\"> War on The Rocks</a> sounded warnings on Trump\u2019s character, policies and fitness for office. It included many who signed the current letter, including George W Bush\u2019s homeland-security secretary Michael Chertoff; ex-Pentagon undersecretary for policy and ambassador to Turkey Eric Edelman; Condoleezza Rice aide Philip Zelikow; John McCain advisers Richard Fontaine and Kori Schake; and former US ambassador to Iraq Robert Blackwill.</p> <p>But the previous letter was penned in the midst of the Republican primary, when several other candidates remained competitive in the race. For dozens of high-profile intelligence officials to rebuke their own party\u2019s nominee with the general election officially underway is yet another indication of the unprecedented nature of Trump\u2019s candidacy.</p> <p>The new letter also arrives amid heightened concerns over Trump posture toward Russia -- the former reality TV star has lavished unusual praise on Russian President Vladimir Putin, while his campaign manager Paul Manafort has been scrutinized for holding ties to Russian politicians. Former CIA acting director Michael Morrell, who endorsed Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton this weekend, has insinuated that Putin is manipulating an unwitting Trump.</p> <p>Signing the new letter are former CIA and NSA director Michael Hayden, who has let his antipathy to Trump be highly public in recent months, and John Negroponte, a senior official in the Reagan, George HW Bush and Clinton administrations and George W Bush\u2019s first director of national intelligence. So did George W Bush\u2019s White House Iraq and Afghanistan adviser, Meghan O\u2019Sullivan, who is held in high esteem amongst congressional Republican internationalists.</p> <p>The new letter also contains harsher language than the old. While the March letter compared Trump to a \u201cracketeer,\u201d the new one flatly says Trump \u201clacks the temperament to be President.\u201d It also calls into question his fitness to wield \u201ccommand of the US nuclear arsenal.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cUnlike previous Presidents who had limited experience in foreign affairs, Mr. Trump has shown no interest in educating himself,\u201d the letter states. \u201cHe continues to display an alarming ignorance of basic facts of contemporary international politics.\u201d</p> <p>The Clinton campaign has also sought to cast a spotlight on Trump\u2019s competence to be commander-in-chief as voters grow increasingly alarmed over national security. The Democratic National Convention featured a cadre of generals, admirals and former officials from Republican administrations making the case against Trump in primetime, honing in on his erratic behavior and wayward statements on US foreign policy.</p> <p>The Clinton campaign also released a video stringing together clips of both national security officials and former Republican presidential candidates, from Mitt Romney to Marco Rubio, stating that Trump was fundamentally unqualified to be president and should not have access to the nuclear codes.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57a8ed45e4b0f5d06484198a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-08T20:36:39.628Z\">9.36pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Video: </strong>Donald Trump sought to regain momentum with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/08/donald-trump-tax-plan-business-income-middle-class\">an economic speech</a> in which he floated new tax breaks and cuts to regulation, as protesters repeatedly interrupted him.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/aug/08/donald-trump-outlines-economic-plan-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/4q3zq\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2640383\"            data-video-name=\"Donald Trump outlines his economic plan \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"Reuters\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57a8d83ee4b0f5d064841920\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/08/08/160808economy_h264_publish.mp4\"/><source src=\"http://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11400063&amp;format=video/m3u8\"/><source src=\"http://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11400063&amp;format=video/3gp&amp;maxwidth=700\"/><source src=\"http://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11400063&amp;format=video/3gp&amp;minwidth=700\"/><source src=\"http://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11400063&amp;format=video/webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/aug/08/donald-trump-outlines-economic-plan-video\">Donald Trump outlines his economic plan</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>He told the Detroit Economic Club, a traditional venue for political candidates to discuss their economic vision, that his plan would include imposing a temporary moratorium on new federal regulations, and reducing rates for income and corporate taxes.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57a8dbd7e4b03b51a99e12f7\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/amber-jamieson\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-08T20:21:09.058Z\">9.21pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Currently the <a href=\"http://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2016-election-forecast/?ex_cid=mobilebar&amp;v=1#now\">New York Time\u2019s Fiverthirtyeight blog</a> has Clinton\u2019s odds of winning the election - if it was held today - at 94%.

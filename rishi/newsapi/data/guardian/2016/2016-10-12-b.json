Epstein, an associate of the UK\u2019s Prince Andrew, was convicted of underage sex crimes in Florida in 2008 and has also denied the allegations.</p> <p>A <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/07/donald-trump-sexual-assault-lawsuits-norm-lubow\">Guardian investigation</a> this summer found that the lawsuit appeared to have been coordinated by a former producer on the Jerry Springer TV show who has been associated in the past with a range of disputed claims involving celebrities including OJ Simpson and Kurt Cobain. A publicist acting for \u201cJane Doe\u201d also attempted to sell a video in which the woman describes her allegations against Trump to media outlets at a $1m price tag.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.scribd.com/document/326770514/Judge-Status-Conference-Order-Jane-Doe-V-Trump#download&amp;from_embed\">court order</a> gives no details of the legal complaint raised by \u201cJane Doe\u201d. It instructs all parties to the case to set out in advance the nature of the allegations and the \u201cprincipal defenses\u201d, as well as any previous motions and discovery as well as the \u201cestimated length of trial\u201d.</p> <p>The original federal lawsuit, filed in June, alleged that \u201cJane Doe\u201d was sexually assaulted by Trump in 1994 at Epstein\u2019s Manhattan home. Further claims were made that the real estate billionaire raped the then teenager at parties hosted by Epstein on the Upper East Side.</p> <p>The Guardian investigation found that a publicist calling himself \u201cAl Taylor\u201d attempted to sell the videotape of \u201cJane Doe\u201d relating her allegations for $1m. It linked Taylor through a variety of means including shared email addresses and phone numbers to Norm Lubow, who used to work on Springer\u2019s daytime talk show.</p> <p>Lubow was connected to a contentious claim, raised in the 1998 documentary movie Kurt and Courtney, that Courtney Love offered a fellow musician $50,000 to murder her husband, Kurt Cobain of Nirvana. Love denied the charge.</p> <p>According to the New York Post, Lubow was also behind a tabloid newspaper story that OJ Simpson bought illicit drugs on the day his estranged wife Nicole Brown was killed.</p> <p>When the Guardian quizzed \u201cAl Taylor\u201d about his true identity, the publicist replied: \u201cJust be warned, we\u2019ll sue you if we don\u2019t like what you write. We\u2019ll sue your ass, own your ass and own your newspaper\u2019s ass as well, punk.\u201d</p> <p>The Trump presidential campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the forthcoming court proceedings. A lawyer for the Trump Organization told the Guardian in July: \u201cThis is basically a sham lawsuit brought by someone who desires to impact the presidential election.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>The Federal Reserve\u2019s decision not to increase rates in September was a close call, <a href=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomcminutes20160921.htm\">the minutes released</a> on Wednesday show. When the Federal Open Markets Committee (FOMC) <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/21/federal-reserve-interest-rates-unchanged\">met in September</a>, three of the 12 members voted in favor of increasing interest rates as the US labor market continued to improve at a slower rate and the risks from Brexit, the UK\u2019s vote to leave the European Union, eased. Some members indicated that a rate hike might be appropriate \u201crelatively soon\u201d. </p> <p>Up until September, Kansas City Fed president Esther George was the lone voice in favor of raising interest rates. Last month, she was joined by Cleveland Fed president Loretta Mester and Boston Fed president Eric Rosengren in her call to increase the target range to 0.50%-0.75%. The current range is 0.25%-0.50%, after it was increased last December for the first time in nearly a decade.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/04/interest-rates/\" data-alt=\"US interest rates\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/04/interest-rates/\">US interest rates</a> </figure>  <p>The FOMC \u2013 which is the policy setting arm of the US central bank \u2013 noted that the case for increasing interest rates has strengthened recently.

The accounts suggest he may never make a profit on either resort, although the Trump family insist Turnberry will return to profitability in the short to medium term.</p> <p>There is also an apparent discrepancy between the accounts and his filings last year to the US Federal Election Commission (FEC), the regulator which controls election spending. </p> <p>In his attempt to create a global portfolio of world-class golf resorts, the Republican presidential candidate had invested \u00a362.7m in buying and refurbishing the Open championship resort at Turnberry on the coast of south-west Scotland, between acquiring it in April 2014 and the end of 2015. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"072426cdcdc1f813cc59c6a2ddbf9c76deb7c734\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/072426cdcdc1f813cc59c6a2ddbf9c76deb7c734/255_119_693_545/500.png\" alt=\"Location of Donald Trump\u2019s Scottish golf courses\" width=\"500\" height=\"393\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The locations of Donald Trump\u2019s Scottish golf courses.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mapbox, OpenStreetMap</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Meanwhile, his losses at his golf course and boutique hotel at Balmedie, north of Aberdeen, which he once claimed would be \u201cthe world\u2019s greatest golf course\u201d and where he plans to build 2,750 homes and holiday flats, also continue to mushroom. </p> <p>Trump\u2019s personal loans to Trump International Golf Course Ltd (TIGCS), which has owned the Aberdeenshire estate where the resort is being built since 2006, increased by \u00a32.6m last year. <br></p> <p>That took his total investment there to \u00a339.4m \u2013 well above the \u00a331.5m valuation he has given for the course and 19-bed hotel.

But neither set of accounts makes any mention of his bid to become US president and the fate of his investments were he to win the White House in November. Trump <a href=\"http://www.newsweek.com/2016/09/30/donald-trump-blind-trust-foreign-business-deals-500398.html\">has said</a> his children would run his businesses if he is elected.</p> <p>In his filings last year to the US FEC, Trump declared that Turnberry generated income of $20.4m (\u00a316.6m today) in 2014 and the Aberdeenshire course earned him $4.4m (\u00a33.6m today). <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>His UK company accounts showed hefty losses on both resorts in that year, of \u00a31.1m at the Aberdeenshire course and \u00a33.6m at Turnberry. Last year\u2019s operating losses at Turnberry were \u00a38.4m. Trump lost a further \u00a32m in dollar-to-sterling currency exchanges, bringing total losses for Trump to \u00a310.5m last year. In 2014, he reports losing \u00a33.1m in currency transactions at Turnberry, bringing his total losses to \u00a36.7m in 2014. The result was an overall loss of \u00a326m.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>The Turnberry accounts state: \u201cThe group is dependent on continuing finance being made available by its ultimate owner to enable it to continue operating and to meet its liabilities as they fall due.\u201d The Aberdeenshire course accounts use almost identical wording.</p> <p>When he bought Turnberry, a world-famous links course with striking sea views on the coast of Ayrshire, in 2014, Trump boasted he would spend \u00a3200m on refurbishing the resort, to make it one of the world\u2019s most prestigious and attract Open championship tournaments. However, his new company accounts cast doubt on that spending claim.</p> <p>That work appeared to have been completed in June this year, when he officially reopened the 149-room five star hotel, complete with a new opulent ballroom, a \u00a33,500-a-night presidential suite and entrance-way fountain, and the newly extended and reorganised Ailsa golf course.</p> <p>But his company accounts show that by 31 December 2015, he had spent only \u00a362m on buying the resort, its running costs, and the upgrade and course reorganisation. </p> <p>The accounts show that his New York-based trust, the Donald J Trump Revocable Trust, loaned his Turnberry holding company, Golf Recreation Scotland Ltd, \u00a342m in 2014 and \u00a321m in 2015. </p> <p>Of that, he is reported to have spent \u00a335m buying the business, implying that in order to meet his pledged refurbishment investment of \u00a3200m he needed to spend a further \u00a3138m in the first six months of this year. The accounts show that this investment only increased the value of Turnberry\u2019s physical assets by \u00a314.4m by the end of last year.</p> <p>He flew <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/24/donald-trump-hails-eu-referendum-result-as-he-arrives-in-uk\">into Turnberry in June</a> on his own Trump-branded Sikorsky S-76B helicopter, and the accounts show the 12-seater aircraft was put on Turnberry\u2019s books in 2014 after he moved it from Florida to be permanently based in Scotland.</p> <p>His accounts show the aircraft was bought for just over \u00a31m, by transferring shares from Golf Recreation Scotland Ltd to his Delaware-registered firm DT Connect LLC, which had previously operated the Sikorsky from Palm Beach, Florida. However, the accounts also show the Scottish company valued the aircraft at just \u00a3269,000.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Trump\u2019s executives in the UK point out that both courses employ significant numbers of people \u2013 there are 337 on Turnberry\u2019s staff, earning a total of \u00a35.6m last year, and 95 in Aberdeenshire, earning \u00a32m in 2015. Trump has also spent tens of millions of pounds on local contractors. That spending has added to the Scottish economy.</p> <p>Turnover at both resorts rose last year. Despite the resort\u2019s closure for refurbishments in October last year, Turnberry\u2019s turnover increased by \u00a32.2m to \u00a311.4m in 2015 while the Aberdeenshire course turnover rose by a more modest amount, from \u00a32.8m to \u00a33m. Even so, the operating losses for TIGCS were close to \u00a31.1m, just a bit lower than its similar losses in 2014.</p> <p>In addition to using the continuing losses to avoid paying company tax at both resorts, the accounts show that he has other assets which would allow him to defer corporation tax if they became profitable in future. </p> <p>The accounts for Golf Recreation Scotland Ltd state he also has a potential deferred tax asset of \u00a37.9m but that asset is not recognised in the accounts \u201cas there is no certainty of taxable profits in the future\u201d. The Aberdeenshire course has a similar deferred tax asset said to be worth \u00a31.4m.</p> <p>At the second presidential debate in St Louis, Missouri, on Sunday night, Trump <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/10/us/politics/donald-trump-taxes.html\">acknowledged</a> that he used a $916m loss reported on his 1995 income tax returns to <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/02/us/politics/donald-trump-taxes.html?_r=0\">avoid paying personal federal US income taxes for years</a>. \u201cOf course I do.

  "<p>The Republican party\u2019s descent into civil war has revived Democratic hopes of an improbable treble by winning the presidency, House and Senate, allowing Hillary Clinton to pursue an aggressive agenda without the obstacles that have faced Barack Obama.</p> <p>With Donald Trump\u2019s campaign at risk of imploding, there are growing signs that both parties are focusing on the battle for Congress, where Republicans have everything to lose and could find Trump dragging them underwater like a drowning man.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s apparent declaration of war against the House speaker, Paul Ryan, and the Republican establishment on Tuesday will have done little to soothe nerves. Republican members of Congress seeking re-election now face the perilous choice of whether to risk alienating moderates or angering Trump diehards. Some are evidently trying to have their cake and eat it.</p> <p>The Senate consists of 54 Republicans, 44 Democrats and two independents, both of whom caucus with the Democrats. The House breaks down as 246 Republicans and 186 Democrats with three vacancies.</p> <p>This year was always going to be an uphill battle for Republicans in hoping to retain the Senate. Democrats are defending just 10 seats while the GOP has to hold on to 24. Democrats also tend to do better in a presidential election year with higher turnout. <br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/11/paul-ryan-cant-escape-trump-shipwreck-republican-party\">Paul Ryan can't escape from Trump's shipwreck of the Republican party | Richard Wolffe</a> </p> </aside>  <p>If Clinton wins the White House, Democrats need to take only four seats to gain control because the vice-president has the casting vote in the event of a tie. But key Senate races, which include presidential battlegrounds such as New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Nevada, have remained competitive. <br></p> <p>The House also seemed to be safe in Republican hands, due in significant part to the gerrymandering that has made districts more partisan. Despite Democrats\u2019 best efforts to cast their opponents as the \u201cParty of Trump\u201d, few signs have pointed to the brash real estate mogul being as deadly to down-ballot candidates as they once feared.</p> <p>But last Friday\u2019s release of an 11-year-old video in which Trump boasted about sexual assault have again shaken the party to its core. As his poll numbers plunge, there are fears that independent and even some Republican voters will turn against the party, or at least stay at home on election day, potentially handing Democrats a crucial advantage. Suddenly the Senate looks in grave jeopardy and even the House could be in play again.</p> <p>Voters support Democrats over Republicans for Congress by seven percentage points, according to an NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll taken after the release of the tape but before Sunday night\u2019s presidential debate.</p> <p>Democrats have been looking to tie candidates to Trump for some time and are now intensifying their efforts. One TV ad for a House seat in Wisconsin attacks Republican Mike Gallagher by playing the Trump video and stating: \u201cMike Gallagher still says we have to support Donald Trump. No, we don\u2019t.

And I have consistently rejected his offensive rhetoric and behavior,\u201d Rubio said in a statement that captured the awkward contortions of many Republicans.</p> <p>\u201cI disagree with him on many things, but I disagree with his opponent on virtually everything. I wish we had better choices for president. But I do not want Hillary Clinton to be our next president.\u201d</p> <p>Rubio has led his Democratic challenger Patrick Murphy in most polling of the Florida Senate race, the latest being a University of North Florida survey showing the senator up by seven points. But an NBC News/ Wall Street Journal poll also released this week showed Rubio with just a two-point advantage among likely voters, proving the contest is far from over. <br></p> <p>Both polls were also conducted before the controversy over Trump\u2019s tapes, which Murphy has sought to capitalize on. The congressman appeared with Hillary Clinton at a rally in Miami on Tuesday, paraphrasing Michelle Obama\u2019s speech at the Democratic convention: \u201cWhen Donald Trump goes low, Marco Rubio is right there with him.\u201d<br></p> <p>Other Republican senators continued to walk a tightrope, uncertain whether to embrace Trump or denounce him and risk a backlash from his vociferous supporters.</p> <p>In Pennsylvania, Toomey trails Democratic rival Katie McGinty by one point, according to the Huffington Post\u2019s average of publicly available polling. Toomey has made sharp criticisms of Trump but not yet made clear whether he will vote for him. <br></p> <p>The challenge of holding Trump at arm\u2019s length, while acknowledging that victory may elude them without his enthusiastic army of supporters, was apparent as Republicans sought to mitigate the damage from his comments about women. Ryan was jeered at a rally in Wisconsin for criticizing Trump, while Heck and the former Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney faced similar protests at a campaign event in Nevada. <br></p> <p>\u201cThey risk alienating the most loyal Trump supporters if they denounce him. And they\u2019re still going to be criticised by Democrats for supporting him for months,\u201d Eric Herzik, chairman of the political science department at the University of Nevada, Reno, told USA Today.<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/11/obama-trump-groping-remarks-unfit-for-president\">Obama savages Trump's groping boast and urges party to abandon him</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think you can walk back your support for Trump at this point and actually gain voters. The best you can hope for is you might limit the bleeding.\u201d</p> <p>In the House, Democrats can target Republicans in 26 districts that Obama won four years ago. He came close in a further 23 districts. Some of the most vulnerable Republicans have denounced Trump in recent days. Barbara Comstock of northern Virginia has been a longtime critic of him but Democratic challenger LuAnn Bennett has thrown Trump at her on the debate stage and in commercials.</p> <p>For now, the true down-ballot impact of Trump\u2019s recent crash remains unclear. Jennifer Duffy, senior editor of the non-partisan Cook Political Report, who has been closely tracking the races, said: \u201cI understand why Democrats are optimistic but that optimism isn\u2019t based on any meaningful data yet.\u201d</p> <p>Shaun Bowler, professor of political science at the University of California, Riverside, had a similar assessment. <br></p> <p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t clear \u2013 or at least not from the data that are public yet \u2013 just how much damage Trump is doing to the GOP brand,\u201d Bowler said. \u201cYes, there are lots of hardliners sticking by him regardless \u2013 it just isn\u2019t clear though whether that support will translate into a win for candidates lower down the ballot.</p> <p>\u201cIt seems likely that the wave after wave of attacks from fellow Republicans coupled with what seems to be generally regarded as Trump\u2019s poorly run campaign will depress turnout among Republicans. Which means \u2013 for some candidates \u2013 there is a problem. On the one hand they can see the blowback Ryan is experiencing, suggesting there may be costs to bailing on Trump; on the other Trump\u2019s candidacy simply may depress the number of voters who turn out. This is a harder group to talk about since it does depend on district-by-district knowledge.\u201d</p> <p>Whit Ayres, a veteran political consultant and pollster for Rubio\u2019s presidential campaign, agreed: \u201cIt\u2019s really too early to assess until we\u2019ve had time to get some polling data back. I did believe that Republicans have an excellent chance to hold on to the House and a 50-50 chance to retain the Senate, both of which are more optimistic than many people\u2019s view last summer.</p> <p>\u201cThat said, we don\u2019t know the effect of the tape, the debate and Trump\u2019s pledge to essentially take the party down with him.\u201d</p> <p>In 1984, former vice-president Walter Mondale was demolished by Ronald Reagan yet Democrats gained two Senate seats. In 1996, former Kansas senator Bob Dole lost to Bill Clinton by more than 8% but Republicans won two Senate seats. <br></p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It isn\u2019t clear \u2013 or at least not from the data that are public yet \u2013 just how much damage Trump is doing to the GOP</p> <footer> <cite>Professor Shaun Bowler</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing written in the stars that just because the top of the ticket goes down, the members have to lose their seats as well,\u201d Ayres said.<br></p> <p>Ryan\u2019s priorities as the nation\u2019s top Republican, at least, are clear. <br></p> <p>On Monday he told colleagues in a conference call he would no longer defend Trump, nor would he campaign with the nominee, and would instead concentrate on trying to hold on to the party\u2019s majorities in the House and Senate. The goal, Ryan said, was to ensure Clinton did not get a \u201cblank check\u201d with a Democratic-controlled Congress should she win. <br></p> <p>Ryan received both support and criticism from House members, some of whom warned that it was the very strategy of ostracising Trump, rather than backing him, that could cost them the House.</p> <p>On Tuesday, Trump used Twitter to fire off attacks on Ryan. Disloyal Republicans \u201care far more difficult\u201d than Clinton, he posted. \u201cThey come at you from all sides. They don\u2019t know how to win I will teach them!\u201d</p> <p>Forty Republican senators and representatives have revoked their support for Trump, with nearly 30 of those calling on him to quit the race altogether, according to a count by the Associated Press. But Reince Priebus, chairman of the Republican National Committee, insists that the party stands by the nominee.</p> <p>There are also signs of a shift in emphasis in the Clinton campaign, aware that control over House and Senate would present her with a historic opportunity to enact a progressive agenda that includes issues such as gun control and climate change.</p> <p>Last year, Clinton accused the other Republican candidates of maligning Muslims after Trump proposed a ban on Muslims entering the country. \u201cTheir language may be more veiled than Mr Trump\u2019s, but their ideas aren\u2019t so different,\u201d Clinton <a href=\"https://www.hillaryclinton.com/feed/no-donald-trump-were-not-barring-muslims-entering-country/?utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=tw&amp;utm_campaign=20151208feed-trump\">said</a> during a December campaign event in New Hampshire. </p> <p>\u201cDonald Trump didn\u2019t come out of nowhere,\u201d Clinton <a href=\"https://www.hillaryclinton.com/es/post/remarks-supreme-court-and-whats-stake-2016-election/\">said</a> during a March speech at the University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison. \u201cWhat the Republicans have sown with their extremist tactics, they are now reaping with Donald Trump\u2019s candidacy.\u201d</p> <p>By May, when it was clear Clinton would win the Democratic primary, her campaign took a different tack. <br></p> <p>\u201cThe campaign does not want to connect Trump and the Republican party. They want to make Trump look even more extreme than the rank-and-file Republican Member of Congress,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/rubycramer/how-a-decision-in-may-changed-the-general-election\">an internal email exchange</a> between officials at the Democratic National Committee, made public by WikiLeaks as part of a huge cyber-attack, revealed.<br></p> <p>The campaign spent much of the summer months casting Trump as far beyond the pale while touting endorsements from business leaders and influential Republicans. <br></p> <p>But when the tape of Trump boasting about using his fame to prey on women was made public and the long-simmering tensions between factions of the Republican party erupted into a full-fledged civil war over the weekend, Clinton\u2019s campaign gleefully fanned the flames.<br></p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s pretty stunning that right after the debate the speaker of the House has to come and say he\u2019s no longer going to defend Donald Trump and that each Republican member of Congress has to decide for themselves whether they\u2019re going to support the nominee,\u201d Clinton\u2019s campaign spokeswoman, Jennifer Palmieri, told reporters this week.<br></p> <p>\u201cI understand why they\u2019re doing that, but Paul Ryan and leaders of the Republican party \u2013 there was a time when they could have stopped Donald Trump. There was a time where they could\u2019ve spoken out against him. That time was the summer and obviously it\u2019s too late now.\u201d</p> <p>In a signal that the campaign was not abandoning its courtship of Republicans and independent voters, Palmieri noted that the campaign launched ads featuring Republican voters backing Clinton in key battleground states, including Florida, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Nevada and Iowa. </p> <p>\u201cDonald Trump didn\u2019t become the nominee of his party on his own. The leaders helped legitimise him and I think they have a lot to answer for, and I imagine voters will hold them accountable, too,\u201d Palmieri continued, singling out the Senate races in Arizona and New Hampshire, where Republican incumbents McCain and Ayotte had withdrawn their endorsements of Trump.</p> <p>On Monday, McCain, the 2008 Republican presidential nominee, was forced to contend with his decision to disavow Trump. <br></p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not pleasant for me to renounce the nominee of our party,\u201d the Arizona senator said during a debate in Phoenix with his Democratic challenger, Ann Kirkpatrick. \u201cHe won the nomination fair and square. But \u2026 I have daughters. I have friends. I have so many wonderful people on my staff. They cannot be degraded and demeaned in that fashion.\u201d</p> <p>Ian Prior, communications director of Republicans\u2019 Senate Leadership Fund, remained optimistic. <br></p> <p>\u201cFrom day one, Senate Republicans have been running their races focused on the particular issues that are important in their respective states,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause of that, they are well positioned to withstand any cross currents from the top of the ticket and, consequently, this gives Republicans a good chance at retaining the majority in the Senate.\u201d</p> <p>But Obama, arguably still the most effective messenger for Democrats, twisted the knife while campaigning for Clinton on Tuesday. <br></p> <p>\u201cYou can\u2019t have it both ways here!\u201d Obama told voters in North Carolina. \u201cYou can\u2019t repeatedly denounce what is said by someone and then say, \u2018But I\u2019m still gonna endorse \u2019em to be the most powerful person on the planet!\u2019</p> <p>\u201cThe fact that now you\u2019ve got people saying, \u2018Well, we strongly disapprove. We really disagree. We find those comments disgusting, but we\u2019re still endorsing him. We still think he should be president.\u2019 That doesn\u2019t make sense to me!\u201d</p>",
  "<p>They may be seen more on YouTube than conventional television these days, but a presidential campaign advertisement can still scandalise, distill a message like little else, and even swing an election. Donald Trump\u2019s latest, Dangerous, is already stoking outrage with its signature offensive of innuendo and untruth, but he\u2019s hardly the first to court controversy.

The latter tend to play like an intro to his benighted Celebrity Apprentice: stolid, explicit and exhausting. Dangerous lists the external threats to American security (the Middle East, North Korea and Islamic State but no Russia, naturally), then accuses Clinton of lacking fortitude with footage of her recent public faint and of her coughing. Having praised her as a \u201cfighter\u201d in Sunday\u2019s TV debate, Trump neatly encapsulates his contradictory and very loud campaign. </p> <h2><strong>Daisy Girl </strong><strong>(1964)</strong></h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Id_r6pNsus\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/9Id_r6pNsus?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Girl counts petals picked from a flower.

  "<p></p> <p>With Donald Trump\u2019s campaign still reeling from his lascivious comments about groping women on an 11-year-old tape, a growing number of GOP mega-donors and outside groups are fretting about the Republicans losing their congressional majorities, and scrambling to pour tens of millions more into ads and voter mobilization drives in tight races to stave off Democratic challengers.</p> <p>The release of Trump\u2019s remarks about assaulting women on Friday and his slash-and-burn attacks on Hillary Clinton and her husband in the second presidential debate, have fueled growing Republican worries about the Democrats taking one or both houses, say GOP donors and former members. If Clinton wins, meaning Vice-President Tim Kaine would hold the casting vote in the Senate, meaning the Democrats would only need to pick up four seats to control the upper chamber. The Republicans currently have 54 Senate seats, and the Democrats 44, along with two independents who caucus with them. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/29/scott-walker-investigation-wisconsin-lawmakers-john-doe-papers\">Wisconsin lawmakers urge investigation of Scott Walker after 'John Doe' papers</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In two tight Senate contests, Nevada and New Hampshire, GOP candidates on Saturday announced they could no longer stomach Trump, and called on him to withdraw.

The fund has received $20m from casino mogul Sheldon Adelson.</p> <p>\u201cRepublicans are scared to death of what would happen if they lost the Senate and House, regardless of which candidate\u201d wins the presidency, billionaire broadcaster Stan Hubbard told the Guardian.

Koch-backed advocacy groups, Davis added, are now \u201cfocused on turning out 5 million voters in the eight states\u201d.</p> <p>The Koch network\u2019s concerns about the Senate were underscored for donors when they received an email, seen by the Guardian, with new poll results in key races, which painted a worrisome picture.</p> <p>Two other cash-rich outside groups, a Super Pac dubbed the Senate Leadership Fund and an allied non-profit called One Nation, have stepped up their fundraising efforts. </p> <p>As of 1 September the two groups had raised just under $100m this election cycle, including $42.4m in August. And the Leadership Fund expects to spend close to $75m in seven key states in September and October combined, according to a spokesman. Adelson and his wife have has given the Super Pac $20m and chipped in $10m to the allied non-profit, according to records and fundraising sources.</p> <p>Other conservative groups and their big donors are worried about losing the Senate. \u201cVictory for us is keeping the Senate and the latest disgusting episode doesn\u2019t help us,\u201d said Michael Epstein of the Republican Jewish Coalition, a staunchly pro-Israel group heavily backed by Adelson. \u201cTrump is a destructive force \u2026 He\u2019s hurting the country, the GOP and the Trump brand.\u201d</p>",

We have to investigate Hillary Clinton and we have to investigate the investigation.\u201d</p> <p>He called the FBI investigation into her emails \u2013 in which the agency director, James Comey, reprimanded Clinton for being \u201cextremely careless\u201d but ultimately recommended no charges \u2013 a \u201cdisgrace\u201d. </p> <p>The email Trump singled out involves an exchange between Clinton spokesman Brian Fallon and the DoJ concerning a lawsuit pertaining to a freedom of information request about her emails. The exchange between Fallon and the individual at the DoJ occurred two months before the FBI opened its probe into Clinton\u2019s emails, and it pertained to information that was publicly available. </p> <p>There is no evidence that the DoJ communicated with Fallon on the email investigation.</p> <p>Speaking to reporters aboard Clinton\u2019s campaign plane on Tuesday, Podesta blamed Russian intelligence officials intent on undermining the Democratic nominee. </p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve been involved in politics for nearly five decades,\u201d Podesta told reporters. \u201cThis definitely is the first campaign that I\u2019ve been involved with in which I\u2019ve had to tangle with Russian intelligence agencies \u2026 who seem to be doing everything that they can on behalf of our opponent.\u201d Podesta did not confirm the veracity of the leaks. </p> <p>Ahead of the Florida rally, Trump lashed out at the speaker of the House, Paul Ryan, who this week announced he would no longer defend Trump or campaign with him although he <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/10/paul-ryan-ends-support-trump-campaign-endorsement-republicans\">stopped short of formally withdrawing his support for the nominee</a>. </p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019re not giving support \u2013 they don\u2019t give the support that we really need \u2013 but the fact is that I think we should get support and we don\u2019t get the support from guys like Paul Ryan,\u201d Trump told Fox News host Bill O\u2019Reilly on Tuesday. \u201c[Ryan] had a conference call with congressmen, with hundreds of them, and they practically rioted against him on the phone. One person stuck up for him.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd I don\u2019t really want his support,\u201d Trump added of Ryan. </p> <p>O\u2019Reilly asked Trump to elaborate on his earlier tweet in which he wrote that it was \u201cso nice that the shackles have been taken off me\u201d.<strong> </strong></p> <p>Trump said the shackles represented some of \u201cestablishment people, the weak and ineffective people within the party\u201d. When O\u2019Reilly asked if \u201cthrowing off of the shackles\u201d meant that he would become more outspoken, Trump forcefully denied that he was outspoken.</p> <p>He also denied polling that shows him losing support among women, a group he had trouble appealing to even before the release of video in which he boasted about touching women without consequence because of his fame. He has dismissed the remarks as \u201clocker room talk\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cMost people have heard it before, and I\u2019ve had a lot of women come up to me and say I\u2019ve heard that before, and I\u2019ve heard a lot worse,\u201d Trump told O\u2019Reilly. \u201cIf that\u2019s what it takes to lose an election, I think that\u2019d be pretty sad.\u201d</p> <p>With less than one month left until election day, Trump is under pressure from party leadership and his own supporters to hone his attack strategy and stick to it. His campaign has so far proved resilient despite not having a conventional fundraising structure or voter outreach plan. </p> <p>During the speech in Florida\u2019s conservative panhandle, Trump encouraged the crowd to register to vote. He noted that the voter registration deadline in Florida had been extended because of the hurricane, which interrupted the state\u2019s final registration days. </p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a movement. But if we don\u2019t win, all it is a little asterisk in history,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThere\u2019s never been anything like this. So go and register. Make sure you get out and vote.

  "<p>Softly spoken with assertive undertones, Fadumo Dayib is the first woman ever to run for the presidency of Somalia. As a Somali female campaigner, she was a \u201cshero\u201d of mine before I met her.</p> <p>The odds are stacked against Dayib defeating incumbent Hassan Sheikh Mohamud; she isn\u2019t even listed as a candidate in <a href=\"http://allafrica.com/stories/201608180542.html\">analysis in regional media</a> and has said herself that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/08/fadumo-dayib-the-somali-refugee-vying-to-return-home-as-first-female-president\">she has little chance of winning</a>.</p> <p>But Dayib\u2019s courage says something about my home country and how far it\u2019s come. So far, the daily death threats she receives are greatly outweighed by the overwhelming support from fellow Somalis. Dayib believes Somalia is ready for female leaders and the fact that she can run at all is in itself cause for celebration.</p> <p>I ask the most obvious question: \u201cWhy do you want to run for the Somali presidency in such a hostile environment to women?\u201d. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2016/aug/22/woman-for-a-week-salve-international-gender-inequality\">I decided to be a Ugandan woman for a week \u2013 it was the wig that broke me</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Living in Finland, she says, gives her many privileges she wouldn\u2019t have had in her own country, and she wants to extend these to women and girls back home. Dayib wasn\u2019t fully literate until the age of 14 but now has several degrees in international public health, including one from Harvard, and is currently a doctoral candidate at the University of Helsinki. Born in Kenya to Somali parents, as a child Dayib was deported back to Somalia with her family. When civil war broke out shortly thereafter, the family was forced to leave again, ending up in Finland.</p> <p>\u201cAll I want is for my people to reach their full potential and exercise their constitutional rights,\u201d she says, adding that by running for the presidency, she is exercising her rights as a Muslim woman. During our discussion, she frequently expresses sadness at the global wave of Islamophobia and the portrayal of Muslim women as voiceless and weak. Were she to be elected, she would want to ensure Somalia practices the correct Islam, \u201cthe religion of peace\u201d.</p> <p>Dayib has seen first hand the violence of extremists al-Shabaab in Somalia, where she worked for six months setting up maternal health clinics before the UN evacuated her over security concerns. </p> <p>However, the everyday hostility she faced was oddly familiar. \u201cIt was very similar to what my Finnish colleagues were telling me, \u2018you came to our country to take our jobs\u2019. Now I was being told by Somali colleagues, \u2018you came back to Somalia to take our jobs\u2019. So where was I to go? I was stuck in the middle.

Seeing how Liberia had emerged from long-term strife brought Dayib\u2019s thoughts back to her ancestral land. </p> <p>\u201cWhy can\u2019t Somalia be like this? I want to be in an environment where you don\u2019t hear gunfire, girls are going to school, women are working, people feel happy,\u201d she says. Experiencing progress in other African countries gave her hope, but she was under no illusion about the difficult road ahead. The start, however, is always the hardest and that\u2019s what her candidacy is all about: a huge step for Somali women and for Somalia as a whole.</p> <p>Even if Dayib not chosen as next president at the election (<a href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/world/2016/09/27/somalia-delays-its-presidential-election-by-month.html\">currently scheduled for 30 November</a>) she vows to remain in Somalia. Her plan is to set up an independent panel to deal with corruption. She says its her duty to help rebuild the country, and is is adamant that more Somali women should invest back in Somalia whether economically or through their skills as doctors, teachers or social workers. </p> <p>Dayib is under no illusions; she knows Somalia is still very male-dominated, and that when she announced her bid for the presidency, many people struggled to believie it. I was one, but meeting her has extinguished any doubts. Dayib is fierce and her vision for Somalia is clear.</p> <p>\u201cI have a calling and purpose in this world,\u201d she says. \u201cWe must stand and speak up against injustices, my family gets that, it\u2019s not easy but this is who I am.

We agreed that women and girls in Somalia are in desperate need of safe spaces to access resources, support, education and for protection.</p> <p>Our country faces great challenges. The al-Shabaab rebellion is certainly one of the greatest, but it does not scare Dayib. She believes that by creating a stable environment, and reclaiming the Somali identity, she can address the anger and disillusionment of young Somali men that is fanning the rebellion. </p> <p>In the end, however, corruption might prove a greater obstacle. Dayib places ending corruption at the top of her candidacy\u2019s priorities. She recognises, however, that corruption is also the greatest barrier to her own chances of winning, possibly even greater to her being a woman. I hope this will not be the case. I believe that a president like her could take on the great challenges facing our country.</p> <p>Meeting Dayib reignited my own commitment as a campaigner. It helped me believe again that no battle is too big to fight.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://register.theguardian.com/global-development\">Join our community</a> of development professionals and humanitarians.

Bernie is saying we can change the world,\u201d an adviser wrote to Podesta, the campaign chairman, at one point. </p> <p>After Sanders won big in the February New Hampshire primary, the Clinton team discussed its strategy for the upcoming states of South Carolina and Nevada.</p> <p>In Nevada, an adviser <a href=\"https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/4324\">wrote</a>, \u201cOur biggest concern is enthusiasm and caucus knowledge. Sanders supporters are more likely to know the ins and outs of the caucus. To mitigate this, in the upcoming days our field team is focusing on caucus education among our supporters.\u201d</p> <p>In South Carolina, the same adviser, Elan Kriegel, noted: \u201cLike Nevada, our support is particularly high with people of color and we are roughly tied with white voters. The difference between the states is that far more African-American voters will participate in South Carolina than Nevada.\u201d</p> <p>The campaign had <a href=\"https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/5115\">lengthy discussions</a> over how to retract and apologize for Clinton\u2019s assertion at Nancy Reagan\u2019s funeral that the former first lady had \u201cstarted a national conversation\u201d about HIV/Aids \u201cwhen before nobody would talk about it.\u201d The Reagans did not acknowledge the epidemic as it unfolded.</p> <p><a href=\"https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/4433\">On a separate email chain</a>, aides discuss whether the phrase \u201ceveryday Americans\u201d should be in a Clinton speech in New Hampshire about small business. A draft of the speech had Clinton saying:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I\u2019m running for President because you and Americans everywhere need a champion. And I want to be that champion. </p> </blockquote> <p>At which Podesta weighed in:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I know she has begun to hate everyday Americans, but I think we should use it once the first time she says I\u2019m running for president because you and everyday Americans need a champion. I think if she doesn\u2019t say it once, people will notice and say we false started in Iowa.</p> </blockquote> <p>Do you notice how Podesta did not place the phrase \u201ceveryday Americans\u201d in quotes in his email?

The Wisconsin Republican is in an excruciating spot: He feels torn between his own conscience and his obligations as the top Republican in the country, according to multiple sources in leadership familiar with the internal discussions.</p> <p>Not to mention, nearly everyone in House Republican leadership believes there are more embarrassing revelations about Trump to come before Nov. 8.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"25a53ec42e51a014f0a8f99439b2cde397d3f35f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/25a53ec42e51a014f0a8f99439b2cde397d3f35f/0_20_2304_1382/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Chukwudi Iwuji as Hamlet.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Chukwudi Iwuji as Hamlet.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Joan Marcus/2016 Joan Marcus</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For now:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/HillaryClinton/status/785502365130555393\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Ryan is still endorsing Trump. <a href=\"https://t.co/L30EZvUbm0\">https://t.co/L30EZvUbm0</a></p>&mdash; Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/HillaryClinton/status/785502365130555393\">October 10, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/costareports/status/785860056021606401\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Some context: the person closest to Trump right now -- Bannon -- published this story about Ryan in July <a href=\"https://t.co/ktEjVbLV28\">https://t.co/ktEjVbLV28</a></p>&mdash; Robert Costa (@costareports) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/costareports/status/785860056021606401\">October 11, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-10-11T15:16:49.109Z\">at 4.16pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57fcfd29e4b03b22b4fb24bf\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-11T14:55:45.011Z\">3.55pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Instead of embedding each new Trump tweet in its own block, we\u2019ll do periodic roundups (if he keeps going).

In another, Podesta said he was \u201cskeptical\u201d about hitting Sanders on his gun control record, which during the Democratic primary became one of Clinton\u2019s more prominent lines of attack against the Vermont senator. </p> <p>\u201cInterestingly, I am worried about blowback from our supporters,\u201d Podesta wrote, as the campaign mulled criticizing Sanders in an op-ed that ran in Clinton\u2019s name in the New York Daily News.</p> <p>Aides ultimately concluded they would \u201ctone down the contrast\u201d between Clinton and her Democratic opponent.</p> <p>One exchange revealed tensions between Clinton\u2019s longtime aide Doug Band and her daughter Chelsea Clinton in late 2011, when Chelsea cited \u201cserious concerns\u201d about the blurring of lines between the family\u2019s foundation and Band\u2019s consulting company, Teneo. </p> <p>Band, who insisted his company had \u201calmost nothing to do\u201d with the Clintons or its foundation, lashed out at Chelsea in an email to Podesta on the subject.</p> <p>\u201cShe is acting like a spoiled brat who has nothing else to do but create issues to justify what she\u2019s doing because she, as she has said, hasn\u2019t found her way and has a lack of focus in her life,\u201d Band wrote.</p> <p>The fallout from Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server while heading the state department was also a topic of discussion. In an email from August of 2015, campaign spokeswoman Jennifer Palmieri noted Clinton was \u201cnot in the same place\u201d as her team on how to address the controversy.</p> <p>\u201cAs you all know, I had hoped that we could use the \u2018server moment\u2019 as an opportunity for her to be viewed as having take [sic] a big step to deal with the email problem that would best position us for what is ahead,\u201d Palmieri wrote. \u201cIt is clear that she is not in same place (unless John has a convo with her and gets her in a different place).\u201d</p> <p>The Trump campaign pounced on the hacked emails, focusing on one exchange it claimed showed evidence of \u201ccollusion\u201d between Clinton\u2019s campaign and the Department of Justice in the investigation into her private server.

Blumenthal was simply passing along the article to Podesta, in an email that contained the subject line \u201cthe truth\u201d and prompted <a href=\"http://www.newsweek.com/vladimir-putin-sidney-blumenthal-hillary-clinton-donald-trump-benghazi-sputnik-508635\">an essay</a> in Newsweek on Monday evening from Eichenwald himself titled: Dear Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin, I am not Sydney Blumenthal.</p> <p>The source of the false story linking Blumenthal to the passages he never wrote was Sputnik, a government-controlled Russian news agency. The website took its post down after the error became clear, but Eichenwald questioned how a conspiracy went quickly from Russian print to Trump\u2019s podium.</p> <p>The Guardian has contacted the Trump campaign to ask how the Benghazi email came to the candidate\u2019s attention and whether the campaign would acknowledge what the Republican nominee quoted as Blumenthal\u2019s words were, in fact, from Eichenwald\u2019s 2015 Newsweek article.</p>"

And there could hardly be a more urgent or relevant film than this. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/nov/03/youve-been-trumped-too-film-donald-trump\">You\u2019ve Been Trumped Too: it\u2019s the film Donald Trump doesn\u2019t want you to see | Anthony Baxter</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Five years ago, British director Anthony Baxter made <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/jul/05/youve-been-trumped-review\">a Michael Moore-esque documentary</a> about the obnoxious arrogance of Donald J Trump, who was vandalising a coastline of natural beauty near Aberdeen to build a golf course, in so doing making promises on job creation and finding a useful idiot in Alex Salmond, who had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/dec/20/alex-salmond-donald-trump-scotland\">rolled over with the necessary political permissions</a>. In the course of all this, Trump\u2019s building workers had cut off the water supply to an elderly, courageous widow, Mrs Molly Forbes, and her son Michael. The Forbes family had refused to sell up. Now, five years later, Baxter has returned to find this water supply has still not been restored.</p> <p>The point about Trump\u2019s grisly Scottish adventure is that it\u2019s a very real dummy run for what he would be like as an international statesman in the arena of politics and diplomacy. Of course he is a mendacious sociopath, and he has far too easily coerced forelock-tugging UK officials into doing his bidding. When Trump talks about bringing the private business style into politics, this is what he means: corporate lawyers attacking local communities; and breaking promises on jobs, supposedly the cornerstone of what passes for Trump\u2019s political vision. What on earth is Nicola Sturgeon doing about this? Or Scottish Secretary David Mundell? Whatever happens in the US presidential election, it is time for them to stand up for Mrs Molly Forbes.</p>",

As a presidential nominee, Donald Trump has used Twitter to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/621783757532626944\">mock</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/672877439400460290\">degrade</a> his opponent and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/240462265680289792\">women</a> who have criticized him.

His dire standing with women, and especially with white educated women who have been a cornerstone of Republican support, has imperiled his chances of winning key battleground states like Pennsylvania. </p> <p>Hillary Clinton\u2019s lead in Pennsylvania has dropped slightly as the race tightens in the final days of the campaign.

It was a true inspiration for me,\u201d she said, in reference to the memorable line from Reagan\u2019s 1984 campaign. </p> <p>Trump has studiously avoided the spotlight of her husband\u2019s presidential campaign, allowing her step-daughter, Ivanka, to play the role typically filled by the candidate\u2019s spouse. <br></p> <p>Her last public appearance was a speech at the Republican national convention that was initially well-received but ended in calamity after it emerged that key passages had been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/19/melania-trump-republican-convention-plagiarism-michelle-obama\">lifted from a speech delivered by Michelle Obama</a> at the 2008 Democratic convention.</p> <p>Donald Trump recently made light of the incident at a charity dinner in New York, which he attended with his wife.</p> <p>\u201cMichelle Obama gives a speech and everyone loves it. It\u2019s fantastic.

  "<p>On 8 November, US presidential election night 2016, the <a href=\"https://medium.com/the-guardian-mobile-innovation-lab\">Guardian Mobile Innovation Lab</a> and the Guardian mobile apps team will offer an innovative way to get live presidential election results right on the lock screen of the Guardian\u2019s Android and iOS apps.</p> <p><strong>What is it? </strong></p> <p>We\u2019re offering the quickest and most convenient way to get live election night results on mobile without a tap, a search or the opening of an app. We\u2019ll send one mobile alert that will automatically update with the latest data. It is a highly innovative use of alert technology that will give you the up-to-date information whenever you pick up your phone.</p> <p><strong>What will I receive?</strong><br></p> <p>If you sign up, you\u2019ll receive a single continuously updating notification that will sit on your phone\u2019s lock screen as results come in on election night. The notification will show the most up-to-date numbers of electoral votes won and states called, as well as an indication of which swing states have been called, and the breakdown of the popular vote between the two top candidates.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f6a4d4cb0598aa606468d6fd4eada19f1a5df3b9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f6a4d4cb0598aa606468d6fd4eada19f1a5df3b9/0_0_1504_1322/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The notifications as they will appear on Android and iOS devices\" width=\"1000\" height=\"879\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The notifications as they will appear on Android and iOS devices</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Composite: The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>You will also be able to expand the alert to see a data visualization showing the electoral vote and options to tap through to the Guardian live blog or a page of full results. </p> <p><strong>How do I sign up?</strong><br></p> <p>The service is part of the Guardian app. When you open it, if you\u2019re in the US you\u2019ll automatically get an introductory screen that invites you to sign up.

Undeterred by that precedent \u2013 because Sunday\u2019s Premier League trip to Swansea is more important - Jose Mourinho may omit several regular starters today, though he\u2019ll not be so cavalier as to include Memphis Depay, who\u2019s sitting on the naughty step back in Manchester. </p> <p>A win for United would not clinch qualification for the next round but would make it probable, and that is not to be sniffed at given that the Europa League could be their best chance of reaching next season\u2019s Champions League.

In 2016, perhaps for the first time in the history of country music, the risks of merely supporting a presidential candidate firmly outweigh the rewards.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d9114fc06905b1d78a071dff77d185286594eb48\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d9114fc06905b1d78a071dff77d185286594eb48/8_114_2826_1695/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Radney Foster\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Radney Foster.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Beth Gwinn/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Nashville\u2019s long been a Democratic stronghold in deep-red Tennessee, but despite the city\u2019s liberalism many estimate that the country music industry still slightly favors Trump. A recent informal survey conducted by the trade publication Country Aircheck showed that 46% of the industry professionals who participated favored Trump compared to 41% who supported Clinton, with 13% supporting Gary Johnson.</p> <p>\u201cWhat I\u2019m hearing is that even with the reservations about Trump, the male members of the industry still feel that he\u2019s one of us,\u201d says Don Cusic, professor of country music history at Nashville\u2019s Belmont University. </p> <p>Trump presents a specific paradox for country music. On one hand, he represents the genre\u2019s historic party of choice, and has found a unique way to effectively communicate with the country demographic. \u201cTrump sticks to one-to-two-syllable words, like a country song,\u201d says Cusic. \u201cHe speaks the language of the country audience.\u201d</p> <p>On the other hand, Trump, a billionaire New Yorker whose campaign has harshly alienated women \u2013 the majority of country music fans \u2013 presents himself as one of the least country music-friendly presidential candidates of all time. \u201cMost country fans don\u2019t have a billion dollars, and haven\u2019t lost a billion dollars,\u201d says Cusic.</p> <p>Clinton has largely avoided any appeals to the country music world during her campaign. Her tenuous relationship with the genre dates back as far as 1992, when she gave an interview with 60 Minutes in response to her husband\u2019s rumored infidelities.</p> <p>\u201c<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DZyE41T56w\">I\u2019m not sitting here, some little woman standing by my man like Tammy Wynette</a>,\u201d she said, referencing the 1968 classic Stand By Your Man. (\u201cI happen to be a country-western fan,\u201d Clinton said in a subsequent apology to Wynette.)</p> <p>Country legend and former Reaganite, Merle Haggard, endorsed Clinton\u2019s bid for president during the primaries in 2007, releasing a song called Hillary. The chorus went as followed: \u201cThis country needs to be honest/ Changes need to be large/ Something like a big switch of gender/ Let\u2019s put a woman in charge.\u201d</p> <p>One of the only interactions Clinton\u2019s candidacy has had with country music came in late 2014, when a Super Pac called <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L25XKa3YzBk\">Stand With Hillary</a> released a transparently pandering country song meant to highlight Clinton\u2019s working-class appeal. </p> <p>The harshly divisive nature of the current election presents particular problems for an industry that, over the last decade, has worked to mainstream its national image and attract an increasingly younger demographic that expands the genre\u2019s historically rural, southern conservative base. (<a href=\"http://www.billboard.com/biz/articles/country/1177554/new-statistics-about-country-music-fans-revealed-at-billboard-country\">A 2011 study</a> revealed that nearly half of all country music\u2019s estimated 95 million fans in the US are under 44 years old.)</p> <p>\u201cCountry music has become publicly apolitical,\u201d says Braddock. \u201cTen or 12 years ago, you\u2019d hear a lot of super patriotic, rightwing subject material on the radio. You don\u2019t hear that now. There are a lot more young people listening, and I no longer think of the music as conservative or ideological.\u201d</p> <p>When major stars have expressed any degree of political opinion, near immediate blowback has ensued. \u201cWhether you love him or hate him, he says what he thinks, and he has proven that you don\u2019t always have to be so afraid,\u201d Blake Shelton said of Trump in Billboard, before adding: \u201cI probably wish there was another option, but there\u2019s not.\u201d<br></p> <p>\u201cHillary might make as good a president as anybody ever has,\u201d Dolly Parton said to the New York Times in June. By August, her opinion on the candidates had been modified to \u201cI think they\u2019re both nuts\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"96943e69a7c8a605280d92062d8fc4ff81336c54\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/96943e69a7c8a605280d92062d8fc4ff81336c54/0_43_2180_1307/1000.jpg\" alt=\"George W Bush shakes hands with country singer Kenny Chesney\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">George W Bush shakes hands with country singer Kenny Chesney.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nicholas Kamm/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cSometimes an artist\u2019s true feelings might slip out, but most are clarifying their support,\u201d says Moody. \u201cDolly realizes that half of the world doesn\u2019t agree with whichever side she picks. Why would you want to alienate essentially half of your fan base?\u201d </p> <p>With not a single mainstream country star expressing unambiguous support for Clinton, the genre appears to publicly lean slightly towards Trump at first glance. Blake Shelton, Justin Moore, Loretta Lynn, Kenny Rogers, Larry Gatlin and Aaron Lewis have all expressed admiration for the candidate.</p> <p>Country music\u2019s relationship to national politics can be traced to George Wallace\u2019s third-party campaign in 1968. Country mainstays Hank Snow, Tammy Wynette and Minnie Pearl all opened for the Alabama governor throughout his political career. \u201cThey were thrilled to be part of the whole political process. Finally, a politician was paying attention to them,\u201d says Cusic.</p> <p>Although Cusic notes that many country stars quieted down after \u201cfalling on the wrong side of history\u201d with Wallace\u2019s segregationist campaign, Jimmy Carter, George HW Bush and George W Bush enjoyed strong connections to country music throughout the next several decades. </p> <p>During the height of country\u2019s kinship with George W Bush in 2003, the Dixie Chicks stirred controversy when singer Natalie Maines protested the Iraq war by claiming onstage that the group was \u201cashamed that the president of the United States is from Texas\u201d. Before long the group\u2019s music had been pulled from country radio, effectively derailing their mainstream success for good.</p> <p>Nearly everyone interviewed for this article cited the Dixie Chicks as a primary reason so many singers are still scared to speak their minds politically. \u201cThe one thing the Dixie Chicks taught the industry is boy, you go against the prevailing political belief and you\u2019re off the radio,\u201d says Cusic.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/video/2016/nov/03/beyonce-surprise-country-music-awards-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/5ak8c\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2868843\"            data-video-name=\"Surprise Beyonc\u00e9 appearance at Country Music Awards \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"Clips courtesy of the Country Music Association and American Broadcasting Companies, Inc. \u00a9Country Music Association Inc., all rights reserved\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-581b5179e4b07ceadb3a2145\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/11/03/161103beyonce_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/11/03/161103beyonce.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/11/03/161103beyonce_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/video/2016/nov/03/beyonce-surprise-country-music-awards-video\">Surprise Beyonc\u00e9 appearance at Country Music Awards</a>.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>The biggest country star to release socially conscious music during this election season is Eric Church, whose current single, Kill a Word, is a subtle condemnation of hate speech. \u201cWe thought it would be a crime not to put that song out with what\u2019s going on right now,\u201d says Arturo Buenahora, who\u2019s served as executive producer on each of Church\u2019s five albums.</p> <p>The song also features vocals from singer Rhiannon Giddens, a committed activist-musician whose origins are in traditional roots and folk music. \u201cGiven what the song is trying to say and what the climate of the country is right now, having a black female singer on the song is a strong choice, because that\u2019s part of what the song\u2019s trying to do: it\u2019s trying to tear down walls,\u201d says Giddens.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m normally not a very political boy,\u201d says Radney Foster, who recently released All That I Require, a historical critique of fascism that might be country\u2019s most directly political take this election.<br></p> <p>Foster admits that being an independent artist who no longer gets played on country radio makes it much easier to speak out, but he\u2019s also experienced firsthand the consequences of being outspoken in country music. The first single the Dixie Chicks released after their antiwar statement was Foster\u2019s Godspeed, which ended up being one of the least successful singles of the trio\u2019s career.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s very hard, because I\u2019ve got fans who fall in both camps,\u201d he says. \u201cSometimes you\u2019ve got to do stuff that\u2019s more important than your paycheck. This has honestly gotten so far under my skin that it\u2019s more important to me than losing a gig or a fan.\u201d</p>",

He\u2019s here today on a hot October afternoon, back at REM HQ in Athens, Georgia, to talk about the 25th anniversary of the album Out of Time, the one with <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwtdhWltSIg\">Losing My Religion</a> on, the one that sold 18m copies and made them famous around the world. And he seems a lot happier than he did in those final REM interviews before they disbanded in 2011. In fact, he\u2019s a delight.</p> <p>When REM split, he says, he wondered: \u201c\u2018Well, who am I now?\u2019 But it didn\u2019t knock me over. I thought it would. But I was like, \u2018Wow! Now I can read a book! I can listen to other music! I can create a new voice for myself!\u2019 And that\u2019s what I\u2019ve spent the last five years doing. Five years and a few weeks.

Their first album, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2009/feb/05/rem-murmur-deluxe-michael-hann-reissue\">Murmur</a>, was perfect, a misty and mysterious reverie. They followed that with one miraculously good record after another, and while people might disagree on where things started slipping, one could make a case for every album up to and including their 10th, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/mar/16/popandrock.shopping1\">New Adventures in Hi-Fi</a>, being a classic, and for much of their later work being unduly neglected.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"befa3746577a979aa0089c38431f324b3818305f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/befa3746577a979aa0089c38431f324b3818305f/0_250_2000_2000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Michael Stipe \u2013 and beard \u2013 in New York in 2016\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Michael Stipe \u2013 and beard \u2013 in New York in 2016.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mireya Acierto/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Peter Buck, the guitarist who was the onstage rock\u2019n\u2019roller to Stipe\u2019s eccentric performance artist, knew from the minute they formed in 1980 \u2013 drummer Bill Berry making up the quartet \u2013 they had something remarkable in their chemistry. \u201cMichael and I had been writing songs, and Mike and Bill had played together in high school,\u201d he says down the phone \u2013 he didn\u2019t make it back to Athens. \u201cAnd we met and rehearsed, and at the end of the rehearsal we had six songs we\u2019d written. A couple of people came in, and one of them said: \u2018How long have you guys been playing together?\u2019 I said: \u2018About three-and-a-half-hours.\u2019 I\u2019m not saying we were great, but we had something, and it was the interplay of our ideas.\u201d</p> <p>If you look at it coldly, in fact, it is something of a miracle that REM could even exist \u2013 four young men, who happened to be in the same place at the same time, with a gift for combining perfectly: not just in the obvious ways, but also in how Mills\u2019s gift for counterharmony complemented Stipe (listen to the chorus of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0GFRcFm-aY\">It\u2019s the End of the World As We Know It)</a>, how Berry added yet more depth with his own harmonies, how Buck had a gift for guitar lines that sounded both timely and timeless. \u201cA very good band does hold true to the axiom: the whole is greater than the sum of the parts,\u201d Mills says. \u201cThe fact that we all met each other and formed a band is the mindblowing thing. It had to be these people, in that time, in that space, to make this happen.\u201d</p> <p>In another era, Stipe wouldn\u2019t have been a rock singer. Were he young now, he might have become a video artist, or a photographer, or some nonspecific creative type. But when rock\u2019n\u2019roll hit him in 1975, that was the obvious path for an unusual kid with an urge to make art: \u201cThat\u2019s when I thought: \u2018This is what I\u2019m gonna do.\u2019\u201d And even then, where many songwriters write because they have a burning urge to share something with the world, Stipe wrote songs for a less driven reason: \u201cI needed 12 songs for an album. And the guys would push me very hard. And I was the slowest. And I\u2019ll always be the slowest.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2229f5ee3fb55aff4c1fc2e28c4db1cb900ddb1d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2229f5ee3fb55aff4c1fc2e28c4db1cb900ddb1d/0_0_3300_1981/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The band backstage in 1984\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The band backstage in 1984.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Paul Natkin/WireImage</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>You can hear that in Stipe\u2019s writing. Some REM lyrics are terrific. Some are really not very good. But what they had in their favour was Stipe\u2019s unique, oaky voice, one that could imbue pretty much any set of words with emotional force and deep resonance. Take <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rOiW_xY-kc\">Everybody Hurts</a>, a worldwide hit single so potentially platitudinous that it has become an X Factor staple: Stipe makes it sound like the most comforting and profound lyric in pop history.</p> <p>Out of Time, Stipe thinks, is where he started to write well. \u201cI had a pretty clear idea of what I was good at and how I could manifest that, but also the power of the word.\u201d He realised that \u201ca shitty nonsensical lyric\u201d could work in one song, but equally that he could deliver words that \u201cactually fucking resonated on a very deep level. And so <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CYitiDJPTE\">Country Feedback</a> resonated on a very deep level. I knew that instantly. It wrote itself. I began to realise around Document [in 1987] that I had skill and I honed it. In time it went from skill to art and my job was to forget everything and allow the instinct to take over, and that\u2019s when the great songs came. Losing My Religion was instinct, Country Feedback was instinct, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XRyEkOfQSg\">Me in Honey </a>\u2026\u201d At the time, Stipe said Out of Time was their first set of love songs. Not any more. \u201cI think I just said that. I needed a line. But they\u2019re not love songs, are they?\u201d</p> <p>It appears to gall him, still, that a lot of people remember Out of Time not for the great songs, but for the sugar-sweet bubblegum pastiche <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCQ0vDAbF7s\">Shiny Happy People</a> (\u201cI\u2019ve made my excuses over and over again and I\u2019ll go to The Hague with my excuses for that song\u201d), but it\u2019s him who brings it up, not me. And then he tries to rationalise it with an anecdote that involves James Franco making a TV series \u201cabout identical twins and the high jinks that happen\u201d, which reminded him of an Elvis Presley film about identical twins and, yes, their high jinks, about getting the name of that film wrong, but how the soundtrack to that film \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0057227/\">Kissin\u2019 Cousins</a> \u2013 was the first album he bought because he loved <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOF9lzGLz-8\">the title track</a>. \u201cIt\u2019s still a really good song. Anyway, that was Shiny Happy People.\u201d I try my best to look like I have some idea what he\u2019s talking about. \u201cI have great stories, but I\u2019m a terrible storyteller,\u201d he says, accurately.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rOiW_xY-kc\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/5rOiW_xY-kc?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Watch the video for Everybody Hurts.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Out of Time was released just as the first Gulf war got underway.

We need to really seriously look at who we are and where we are and bring things up to speed.\u201d Or, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdC6thlCAlI\">as he sang on Cuyahoga 31 years ago</a>: \u201cLet\u2019s put our heads together / Start a new country up.\u201d</p> <p>REM\u2019s politics was something that defined them at the height of their fame. At the 1991 MTV video music awards, where the band won six awards, Stipe used the group\u2019s appearances to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMbYPDAaIA0\">strip off his T-shirts</a>, revealing a series of slogans \u2013 \u201cWear a condom\u201d, \u201cChoice\u201d, \u201cAlternative energy now\u201d, \u201cThe right to vote\u201d, \u201cHandgun control\u201d, \u201cLove knows no colours\u201d, \u201cRainforest\u201d. That was just the tip of the iceberg: Stipe, especially, always seemed to be talking up his favoured causes; it was something he felt was both a duty and a privilege, but it created pressures. \u201cThe hardest part was being put in the position of being \u2018the voice of a generation\u2019,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s not a pretty place to be. It\u2019s not easy. I tried. I did try to use the platform of being a public figure. But you find yourself sitting at a table, with someone saying: \u2018Describe to me the problems of global warming from a sub-Saharan perspective.\u2019 I\u2019m a pop star. That\u2019s not what I went to school for.\u201d</p> <p>When the group began, Buck had insisted on a series of guidelines \u2013 moral, ethical, personal, financial, aesthetic \u2013 that would steer them throughout their career. Some were fairly trivial \u2013 no leather onstage, so they didn\u2019t look like every other rock band. Some were crucial \u2013 sharing all songwriting credits equally, regardless of who wrote the song, so there would be no arguments about money down the line. Some of those guidelines are still in use \u2013 Buck tells me that earlier in the day we speak the group had turned down a multi-million-dollar offer to have their music soundtrack an advertising campaign (\u201cI don\u2019t want my children to see me being a whore\u201d). And it\u2019s still the case that any one of the members can veto any decision related to REM, as was the case throughout their career.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"eb47a5aae9d57f85ebcf652b3064458abfcdb528\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/eb47a5aae9d57f85ebcf652b3064458abfcdb528/0_125_3032_1819/1000.jpg\" alt=\"REM at the 1991 MTV awards\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">REM, with Stipe in one of the slogan T-shirts he wore at the 1991 MTV awards.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: The LIFE Picture Collection/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>So who used the veto most often?</p> <p>\u201cI think Michael might have done it more, but as the face of the band, things affected him more than us,\u201d Mills says.</p> <p>I put that to Stipe. \u201cOoooh!\u201d His lips form a little moue, and he raps the table twice. \u201cWe had a run-in last week, me and Mike Mills,\u201d he says, and he laughs. \u201cAnd I gave in to his desires. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s the case. If he says it is, then he doesn\u2019t say things like that without a reason.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOff the top of my head, I\u2019d say Michael,\u201d Buck says. \u201cBut it might be me.\u201d</p> <p>I tell Buck that Stipe had seemed surprised when I said Mills had nominated him. \u201cHe shouldn\u2019t be. I would be fairly comfortable saying he and I would be pretty close to tied. I can rant for 10 minutes about why something is morally, ethically, culturally wrong. And Michael might just say: \u2018I don\u2019t wanna do that.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>The different members of REM took to their superstardom after Out of Time in different ways. Mills sounds as if he was utterly untroubled by it: \u201cNothing felt like it came on too fast, nothing felt like it was more than we could handle.\u201d (\u201cOf course he would,\u201d Stipe says. \u201cThat\u2019s his personality.\u201d) Buck professes to having thought \u201cit was all kind of bullshit. We just made a record \u2013 big deal. When we went around to do the next record, Automatic for the People, I just disappeared off the face of the earth. Grew a big beard and drove round in my car and flopped in motels for a year. So I never really had to confront the overwhelming nature of it until 1995 [when REM toured after six years off the road], which was mindblowing for all of us.\u201d</p> <p>Stipe, though, was the frontman, the one who had to stand in the headwind. \u201cThe face. Mike Mills called me Face. I was the recognisable one to the world at large.\u201d He relied on the other three to stop becoming, in his words, a monster. \u201cIf I believed everything that was said about me and all the adulation, anyone in that position would [become one],\u201d he says. And yet Stipe\u2019s insecurities plagued him. If a show wasn\u2019t sold out, he was horrified. \u201cIf I was going to put that much effort into it, and I did, I wanted to know that I had a rapt and captive audience. I would always, always look around and find the one person who was yawning or looking at their watch. You have to believe that what you\u2019re doing is so important that everybody is going to be absolutely and completely captivated and in the moment with you. And when you see that one person putting on their lipstick or checking their watch or talking to their girlfriend \u2026 wow.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYOKMUTTDdA\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/YYOKMUTTDdA?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Watch the video for Shiny Happy People</figcaption> </figure>   <p>He got increasingly fed up, too, with the portrayals of his public persona. He became bored with who he seemed to be, what he was saying. He wearied of being called \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/mar/06/michael-stipe-rem-collapse-interview\">enigmatic</a>\u201d by people trying to boil down his sometimes contrary, sometimes diffident personality into a single word. Recalling that causes him to reflect on his father, who shared similar traits. \u201cHis humour was really dry, and really smart,\u201d he says. \u201cHe reacted to things that he saw, and he reacted to them in a way that was hysterically funny. Most people didn\u2019t understand that. Or would take a day or two before going, \u2018Oh my God, that was really astute and hysterical.\u2019 I got a little bit of that. So the enigmatic thing I understand. But it became hideously close and I became really bored with myself, and I didn\u2019t think I had anything new to say. I\u2019d played that character. I didn\u2019t think I could do it again.\u201d</p> <p>Perhaps the one most affected was Bill Berry. He left the group in 1997, explaining simply that he wasn\u2019t enjoying it any longer. They continued without him for 14 years, in which it sometimes seemed they stumbled more than skipped. \u201cThe three-legged dog went through the meat grinder and ended up in \u2026 where\u2019s the place they grind up the bones and turn them into glue? The rendering factory,\u201d Stipe says.</p> <p>You might expect Mills, Berry\u2019s high-school friend, to have been the one who missed the drummer\u2019s presence most. He says not. \u201cI think it was harder on Peter, because Bill was the balance. Bill and Peter wanted more concision in the songs. Michael and I tended to elaborate and add more things.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe power dynamic shift that occurred between the three of us was so profound as to literally break up the band and put it back together and break it up and put it back together,\u201d Stipe says. </p> <p>\u201cNo one really wanted to listen to me,\u201d says Buck. \u201cWhich was fine. But no one really had a lot of set goals in mind either. Bill was a no-bullshit guy, and with him gone, it feels to me in retrospect that I was more aggressive than I should have been and everyone was pushing back not to have me bully them. We were all pushing in such different directions, and we were feeling such frustration and anger about it. I started backing away from the whole thing: I had to be talked out of the tree a couple of times, when I said: \u2018I don\u2019t want to do this any more.\u2019 After the 2005 tour, I was totally fed up and we just didn\u2019t talk for, I don\u2019t know, a year.\u201d</p> <p>Stipe remembers things being just as bad seven years earlier, when they made <a href=\"http://www.allmusic.com/album/up-mw0000040590\">Up</a>, their first album without Berry. \u201cWe made choices that were not great choices, because we simply weren\u2019t talking. That record really needed an editor, but we could not only not arrive at a decision, we couldn\u2019t be in the same room together. It was bad.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"905f82e6de3fc38fe5fde3d72f5a9a3c667e2fce\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/905f82e6de3fc38fe5fde3d72f5a9a3c667e2fce/0_84_4469_2682/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Live at the Milton Keynes Bowl in 1995\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Live at the Milton Keynes Bowl in 1995.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mick Hutson/Redferns</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>All three agree \u2013 they would, wouldn\u2019t they? \u2013 that REM were back on track by the time they called it a day in 2011. Their final two albums, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2008/mar/21/shopping.popandrock\">Accelerate</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/mar/03/rem-collapse-into-now-review\">Collapse Into Now</a>, seemed more in touch with what had made REM great in the first place than some of their immediate predecessors, and the three were able to part once again reconnected with what Buck describes as \u201ca deep and abiding friendship. It was nice to have nothing but the music and our friendship tying us together, as opposed to the music, the friendship, the contracts, the upcoming tour, the 300 employees we\u2019re hiring \u2013 all the other things that tend to get in the way of interpersonal relationships.\u201d</p> <p>REM gave Stipe something that nothing else ever has: adrenalin. \u201cIt\u2019s a very powerful drug,\u201d he say. \u201cAnd you have to wean yourself off it carefully. I still miss it. But, hopefully, you find other things to get excited about.\u201d Buck, for his part, longs for particular eras of the group\u2019s lifespan. \u201cI miss being in REM in 1983 and 1987. Which is to say, I miss being young and in the centre of my culture.\u201d</p> <p>What REM have left is a legacy, of both music and of how a band should comport itself, one you see replicated whenever a band with principles crosses over to a mass audience: Radiohead, for example, might consider how much they owe to REM. \u201cWe did a remarkable job of maintaining integrity throughout a very difficult period and in a difficult industry,\u201d Stipe says. \u201cWe forged a new path. We created a new way for people to look and approach this and not become an empty puppet or a dog and pony show.\u201d He pauses. \u201cWhat\u2019s the other part I\u2019m proud of?\u201d</p> <p>The records?</p> <p>Stipe looks up and laughs. \u201cYeah!\u201d</p> <p><em>The 25th anniversary deluxe edition of Out of Time is released on Universal on 18 November.

  "<p>Hillary Clinton appears to have rebounded in popularity according to a new ABC/Washington Post poll, which shows her leading 47%-45% against Donald Trump. However, another poll from the LA Times shows Trump ahead by five percentage points, so the overall <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/us/general_election_trump_vs_clinton-5491.html\">average</a> support for each candidate has remained unchanged since yesterday at a 1.7 point lead for Clinton. Clearly, measures of national opinion are poles apart.</p> <p>Those top-line horse-race figures are important, but they ignore two groups of voters: the undecideds and those who plan on voting for a third candidate. Tomorrow, I\u2019ll look at the Americans who are planning to vote for someone other than Clinton or Trump. Today, I\u2019ll take a look at the undecideds.</p> <p>Back in March, in the midst of primary season, there were a lot more Americans who seemed to be still making up their minds \u2013 one in 10 likely voters said they were undecided. Since then, that figure has slowly (but not so steadily) declined to about one in 20 likely voters, according to the Huffington Post\u2019s polling <a href=\"http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/pollster/2016-general-election-trump-vs-clinton/edit#!minpct=0&amp;maxpct=25&amp;mindate=2014-01-01&amp;maxdate=2016-11-03&amp;smoothing=moderate&amp;showpoints=yes&amp;showsplines=yes&amp;hiddenpollsters=&amp;hiddensubpops=A - D,A - R,A - i,RV - D,RV - R,RV - i,LV - D,LV - R,LV - i&amp;partisanship=S,P,N&amp;parties=D,R,I,N&amp;selected=undecided&amp;fudge=1&amp;except_questions_with=johnson\">averages</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/11/undecided-voters/\" data-alt=\"Undecided voters\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/11/undecided-voters/\">Undecided voters</a> <figcaption>Undecided voters</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Nationally, the 5% of voters who claim to be undecided seem capable of swinging the election \u2013 if they all vote for Clinton, she would win the popular vote, according to polls; if they went for Trump, he\u2019d win. Although they won\u2019t all swing in the same direction, it\u2019s worth considering the intentions of these Americans.</p> <p>As a group, undecideds arouse <a href=\"http://www.nbc.com/saturday-night-live/video/undecided-voter/n27698\">cynicism</a> (how could anyone in this election possibly be undecided?) and/or skepticism (are they keeping their <em>real </em>voting<em> </em>intention secret?). The Brexit result, where undecided respondents in the UK seemed to make a last-minute decision to leave the European Union, has only deepened suspicion of these voters.<br></p> <p>Broadly speaking, there are three possibilities here: 1) the undecideds truly don\u2019t know who to vote for; 2) the undecideds don\u2019t know whether to vote at all; and 3) they know exactly who they will vote for but don\u2019t want to disclose it with nosy pollsters. I\u2019ll briefly examine each of these.</p> <p>1) If individuals haven\u2019t made up their own minds, it\u2019s pretty difficult for analysts to anticipate their actions. Some electoral theory suggests that when people aren\u2019t sure, they opt for the safer option of preserving the status quo \u2013 as was the case in the 2014 <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_independence_referendum,_2014#/media/File:Scottish_independence_polls_graphic.svg\">Scottish independence referendum</a>. That would work in Hillary Clinton\u2019s favor as she would preserve her vote share in states like Pennsylvania that have been Democrat for decades but which now appear to be <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/pa/pennsylvania_trump_vs_clinton-5633.html\">leaning</a> increasingly Republican.</p> <p>But voters in 2016 might break with history. A <a href=\"http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/10/18/most-americans-trust-the-military-and-scientists-to-act-in-the-publics-interest/\">majority</a> of US adults don\u2019t trust elected officials (or the media for that matter). The rise of Donald Trump, with his anti-establishment rhetoric, suggests that many Americans may now consider the status quo a worst-case scenario. </p> <p>2) Turnout will be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/01/clinton-trump-polls-election-voter-turnout-suppression\">crucial</a> in this election and there is a real chance that many of these undecideds will simply not show up. In <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2016/08/31/can_undecideds_help_trump_win_the_election_131660.html\">August</a>, survey firm YouGov changed their respondent group to better understand undecideds \u2013 14% of their respondents said they would not vote. </p> <p>Though YouGov did not find a substantial partisan divide among these non-voters, current campaign strategies would seem to suggest that low turnout will work in Trump\u2019s favor. Clinton has been repeatedly <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/nation/politics/trailguide/la-na-trailguide-updates-aiming-to-boost-turnout-clinton-warns-1478129300-htmlstory.html\">trying to boost turnout</a>, particularly among minority voters, whom she will need in several swing states. Meanwhile, Trump\u2019s campaign advisers have <a href=\"http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/presidential-races/303034-trump-aide-we-have-three-major-voter-suppression\">claimed</a> the Republican\u2019s strategy is now to suppress Clinton\u2019s turnout rather than encouraging potential undecideds to vote Trump. </p> <p>3) There\u2019s also mixed evidence when it comes to understanding whether undecideds are actually secret Trump voters who are hiding their intentions from pollsters. In the primary season, polling averages <a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-supporters-probably-arent-lying-to-pollsters/\">matched</a> pretty closely with final results in most states. But voting in the primary season and the national election are <a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/primary-turnout-means-nothing-for-the-general-election/\">pretty different</a> \u2013 partly because the individuals who show up to pick a nominee are more politically engaged voters. </p> <p>In reality, respondents who say they\u2019re undecided are some mix of all of these three groups. For example, early voting <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/01/clinton-trump-polls-election-voter-turnout-suppression\">suggests</a> that some black undecideds might decide not to show up on election day. But the geography of being undecided also matters. That\u2019s why Barack Obama visited North Carolina on Wednesday, where he told a crowd: \u201cThe fate of the republic rests on your shoulders.\u201d</p> <p>North Carolina is worth 15 of the 270 electoral college votes required to win the White House and voters here are deeply split about which way the state should go. Current polling averages show Trump beating Clinton by <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/nc/north_carolina_trump_vs_clinton-5538.html\">0.2 percentage points</a> \u2013 a meaningless lead because these numbers could be wrong by a few percentage points in either direction.</p> <p>Only 2% of 992 likely voters in North Carolina said they were \u201cnot sure\u201d who they would vote for in a YouGov <a href=\"https://www.scribd.com/document/329404956/CBS-News-Battleground-Tracker-North-Carolina-Oct-30-2016#from_embed\">poll</a> conducted on 26-28 October. But that\u2019s a pretty crude measure of intention. Polls often force respondents to pick a side by starting the question with the words \u201cIf the 2016 presidential election were held today \u2026\u201d A later question in the same survey asked voters how certain they were about their choice of candidate; 5% said they might still change their minds and 17% said they \u201cprobably\u201d wouldn\u2019t change their minds. Early ballots in the state have promising news for Clinton though \u2013 they <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/upshot/north-carolina-early-vote-tracker.html\">suggest</a> voters in North Carolina are choosing Clinton over Trump. </p>",

The Court ruling on Article 50 opens the door to a delayed Brexit, which seems a good enough excuse for the foreign exchange market to extend this pound rally further. The increase in the Bank of England\u2019s inflation forecast could also keep upward pressure on UK Gilt yields, which are the building blocks of a stronger pound, in our view.</p> <p>Overall, US election fears weighing on the dollar, and Brexit fears temporarily receding, could trigger a break above 1.25 in the pound/dollar in the near term.

Ahead of the November MPC meeting and Quarterly Inflation Report, we had considered it most likely that interest rates would be taken down to 0.10% but not until the second quarter of 2017 when we expected economic activity to be increasingly pressurised by Brexit uncertainty (following the anticipated triggering of Article 50) and diminishing fundamentals for consumers.</p> <p>We are actually more pessimistic than the Bank of England on growth but see inflation higher. Specifically, we forecast GDP growth to slow from 2.1% in 2016 to 1.1% in 2017, then improve only gradually to 1.3% in 2018 and 1.5% in 2019. We see consumer price inflation moving above3% in late-2017 and peaking around 3.5% around spring 2018.</p> <p>It is also notable that Mr. Carney observed that the UK has an outstanding framework for monetary policy, which works well and does not need to be adjusted.

class=\"quoted\"> <p>The Bank of England abandoned plans for further cuts to interest rates as it conceded the economy had stood up to the shock of June\u2019s Brexit vote without the sharp slowdown Mark Carney and fellow policymakers had predicted.</p> <p>The Bank left rates at 0.25% as expected by investors and revised up forecasts for economic growth in the final months of this year and throughout 2017, compared with their outlook published in August. But they also warned that sterling\u2019s sharp fall would push up inflation more than previously thought. That in turn would squeeze household incomes and coupled with uncertainty about the UK\u2019s longer-term prospects outside the EU would stem economic growth in 2018. Taking the near and long-term forecasts together the economic picture in three years\u2019 time is slightly worse than in August\u2019s outlook.</p> <p>The forecasts accompanied a unanimous decision by the Bank\u2019s nine-strong monetary policy committee (MPC) to leave interest rates at 0.25%, where they had been cut to in August to shore up confidence after June\u2019s vote to leave the EU.</p> <p>In comments likely to be interpreted by financial markets as ruling out any more QE or interest rate cuts any time soon, the Bank also said it could respond \u201cin either direction\u201d to changes in the economic outlook and used minutes from its latest policy meeting to highlight how the weaker pound pushes up inflation. The Bank also said \u201cthere are limits to the extent to which above-target inflation can be tolerated.\u201d</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-581b2bd0e4b029b92ca451d9\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-03T12:23:36.660Z\">12.23pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>The Bank of England</strong> fears that the uncertainty over Brexit will push unemployment higher, from its current rate of 4.9%</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>[There is a ] risk that UK-based firms\u2019 access to EU markets could be materially reduced, which could restrain business activity and supply growth over a protracted period.</p> <p>The unemployment rate is projected to rise to around 5.5% by the middle of 2018 and to stay at around that level throughout 2019.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-581b2a02e4b029b92ca451ce\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-03T12:17:26.217Z\">12.17pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">BoE: UK is doing better than we expected</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>The Bank of England admits that the UK economy has outperformed its expectations in the three months since it slashed rates.</strong></p> <p>It says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>In the three months since then, indicators of activity and business sentiment have recovered from their lows immediately following the referendum and the preliminary estimate of GDP growth in Q3 was above expectations [reminder: it was 0.5%, not 0.1%].</p> <p>These data suggest that the near-term outlook for activity is stronger than expected three months ago.

That\u2019s a tricky calculation, as we don\u2019t know what kind of deal the UK will end up with.</p> <p><strong>The Bank may also hike its inflation forecasts</strong>, as the slump in the pound since June continues to push up the cost of imports. That could show the Consumer Prices Index smashing through the official 2% target next year.

This is the film he doesn\u2019t want you to see. And here\u2019s why we think you should see it \u2026</p> <p>Ten years ago, when several residents whose homes are located on the picturesque sand dunes of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/23/donald-trump-faces-wall-of-opposition-as-he-returns-to-scotland\">Balmedie in Scotland</a> refused to sell their land to Trump for his new luxury golf course resort, the billionaire began a campaign of bullying and intimidation that continues to this day. Most well-known among these residents is farmer Michael Forbes, whose modest croft sits right in the middle of where Trump wanted to build \u201cthe greatest golf course in the world\u201d. Michael\u2019s mother Molly (now aged 92) lives in a caravan across the farmyard from her son. The home has a handmade carved sign on it, reading \u201cParadise\u201d. That was, until Trump arrived.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>In 2010 I interviewed Michael Forbes on his fishing boat, and he mentioned in passing that they had no running water</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Trump\u2019s first attempt at being a great neighbour was to go on national television and slam the state of Michael Forbes\u2019s farm. The farm was \u201ca slum\u201d, and Michael \u201clived like a pig\u201d, fumed Trump. How could he possibly build his hotel for millionaires if the windows were to look out over \u201cthis horrible, horrible slum\u201d?</p> <p>The hotel was part of Trump\u2019s master plan for the Menie estate\u2019s shifting sand dunes that would create \u201c6,000 jobs\u201d, see the building of 1,500 houses and the construction of a skyscraper hotel. Trump promised to get \u201cAberdeen booming\u201d. His claims were lapped up by local politicians, eager to find an economic wand to wave for when North Sea oil runs dry. No problem if the residents refused to sell. Next up was his threat of eminent domain \u2013 or under UK law, compulsory purchase.</p> <p>So concerned was I at the lack of scrutiny of Trump\u2019s plan and the devastating effect it would have on people and the rare sand dunes where he wanted to build his gated golf resort that I began making my film, You\u2019ve Been Trumped.</p> <p>In the summer of 2010 I interviewed Michael Forbes on his salmon-fishing boat, and he mentioned in passing that they had no running water. Trump\u2019s workers had apparently cut through a pipe leading from the spring that serves the Forbes\u2019s well. The result was that Michael, his wife Sheila and Michael\u2019s mother, Molly, were without running water. This had been going on for a week. And what had Trump done about it? Nothing, according to the Forbes.</p> <p>I went immediately to speak to the man in charge of Trump\u2019s building work at the time to get the other side of the story. He confirmed that there was nobody trying to sort the problem out. He explained they had to \u201cassess it first\u201d so that it \u201cwould be a jewel of a system and sustain itself. It\u2019ll be the best water system he\u2019s ever had\u201d.</p> <p>A short time later I was arrested along with my producer Richard Phinney, and we were thrown into an Aberdeen police cell. There we sat for hours while the police \u2013 apparently acting as a private security force for Trump \u2013 dreamed up some ludicrous charge. The charges were eventually dropped, and the police issued an apology. But still the Forbes\u2019s water supply ran dry.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/membership/2016/nov/03/the-view-from-middletown-whoever-wins-election-needs-to-address-the-rage-out-there\">'Whoever wins the US election needs to address the rage out there': the view from Middletown</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In the years that followed I went back to the Forbes\u2019s house. I made another film in 2014 called <a href=\"http://www.adangerousgamemovie.com/#watch-now\">A Dangerous Game</a>, for which Trump granted me an on-camera interview about the residents\u2019 plight. When I filmed that interview in early 2013, I had no idea that Molly was still without a proper working water supply. She is a private person, a former land girl (member of the Women\u2019s Land Army) during the second world war, and used to hardship.</p> <p>Throughout this extraordinary presidential campaign, countless articles have been written about the outrageous things that Donald Trump has said. But lesser known is what he has done. That\u2019s why it\u2019s so important for us to get You\u2019ve Been Trumped Too out to US voters. It is a rare document of the impact on the lives of ordinary people of Trump\u2019s actions.</p> <p>Mexico-style border walls? Check. Mistreatment of women? Check. Failure to deliver on promises? Check. And as for the Forbes\u2019s water? When Trump announced he was running for the presidency in the summer of 2015, I was dumbfounded to discover Molly was still collecting water from a nearby stream because her water supply wasn\u2019t working \u201call because of Trump\u201d.

Another woman came forward to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/13/list-of-donald-trump-sexual-misconduct-allegations\">accuse Trump of sexual assault</a>, and a Texas official <a href=\"http://theslot.jezebel.com/texas-official-goes-ahead-and-calls-hillary-clinton-a-c-1788463701\">called Hillary Clinton a \u201ccunt\u201d.</a></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/nov/03/us-election-projectile-vomiting-barbara-ehrenreich\">Forget fear and loathing. The US election inspires projectile vomiting | Barbara Ehrenreich</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This isn\u2019t a political divide between left and right, Democrats and Republicans; it\u2019s an immeasurable moral chasm. And so I understand why it\u2019s been easier for many horrified by Trump to simply pretend there\u2019s no way that he could actually win the presidency. Imagining the hatred underlying his campaign and politics being emboldened in this way is just too much to bear. </p> <p>If Trump wins \u2013 a possibility, even if it is unlikely \u2013 what will our country look like? What will happen to women\u2019s rights, not just at a policy level, but in schools and in homes? How much more afraid will immigrants and people of color have to become that they\u2019ll be ripped from their homes or killed on the street by the very people tasked to protect them? Part of the problem is that we already know the answers to these questions: we\u2019ve been living them.</p> <p>This election has uncovered something vile about America. That so many people would support a despicable candidate is not news to those hurt every day by racism, sexism and xenophobia; we know it\u2019s alive and well in our country. We\u2019ve been dealing with it our whole lives. But to see this hatred on such flagrant, unapologetic display is something else entirely. </p> <p>Even if Trump loses, this isn\u2019t simply a bad dream that we\u2019ll awaken from on 9 November.<br></p> <p>A common refrain I\u2019ve heard from Clinton supporters is that we\u2019re better than this \u2013 the hatred, the harassment. But if this race has shown us anything, it\u2019s that we\u2019re not better than this. The bigotry and misogyny \u2013 that\u2019s who we are. That\u2019s what this country was built on. And even if Clinton wins next week, that\u2019s who we will remain. </p> <p>As wonderful as it will be to watch the first woman win the presidential election, it can\u2019t undo the truth of who we are. The deplorable people who feel they no longer need to hide their hatred aren\u2019t going anywhere after election day, no matter what happens.</p> <p>So I suppose my panic wasn\u2019t about the possibility of a Trump win, after all. It\u2019s about the reality of the moment we\u2019re in, win or lose. It\u2019s about the slime that\u2019s risen to the top, the stink we can\u2019t wash off with one election or one president. We don\u2019t need to panic about the future, because the present already contains more horror than we can handle.</p>",
  "<p>There has yet to be a more impudent introduction at an awards ceremony than David Letterman\u2019s majestic effort for one former Hollywood couple at the 1995 Oscars. \u201cHere to present the award are Tim Robbins and Susan Sarandon,\u201d the host drawled, \u201cPay attention \u2013 I\u2019m sure they\u2019re pissed about something \u2026\u201d Primarily about that introduction, to see Sarandon and Robbins\u2019s stony faces as they made their way on stage.</p> <p>Back to the present day, then, where Sarandon\u2019s pick for the US presidential election is being treated vastly more reverentially.

  "<p>If you need a distraction ahead of Tuesday\u2019s potentially cataclysmic US election, imagine a world in which all Britons and Americans knew about each other came from popular TV drama imports.</p> <p>US viewers would envisage a place in the iron grip of a monarch with presidential powers over law and war (Victoria and, from tomorrow, The Crown), who rules with the help of the aristocracy (Downton Abbey) and cerebral super-detectives (Sherlock). </p> <p>Brits would imagine over there to be overrun with doctors (ER, House), cops (NYPD Blue), lawyers (The Good Wife, LA Law) and flatmates (Friends) who have a standup\u2019s knack for one-liners. Such savvy chat even comes from the chemistry teachers turned drug barons (Breaking Bad) and the pathologists (Dexter) who are secret serial killers.</p> <p>The TV overview of Britain that Americans are given is nostalgically positive, while the image of Americans transmitted in the UK perhaps exaggerates the sense of humour of the average citizen.</p> <p>But in documentaries made about the other country, a very different picture emerges. American factual TV largely ignores Britain (and most other countries), except for reports on Princess Diana and her sons or profiles of showbiz hit-Brits such as Adele. </p> <p>Failing to return the compliment, British docs about the US tend to represent America as what the novelist Saul Bellow called in 1990 (adopting a phrase from Wyndham Lewis) \u201cthe moronic inferno\u201d. Such films \u2013 representing an attitude that ranges from \u201cOnly in America!\u201d to, at its most extreme, \u201cEven in America!\u201d \u2013 show a nation of morbidly obese racist evangelical Christians, waving a weapon in one hand and voting for Ronald Reagan or George W Bush \u2013 or now Donald Trump \u2013 with the other.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"6fcdbd3b01b1aa5096852fd3b2f6ee1fe08de1a1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6fcdbd3b01b1aa5096852fd3b2f6ee1fe08de1a1/120_0_1800_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Eye-popping \u2026 Jadin, aged 9 fires a gun in a firing range as his mum Courtney films him.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Eye-popping \u2026 Jadin, aged nine, fires a gun in a firing range as his mum Courtney films him.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rogan Product/Channel 4</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>On the eve of what will bring either the Trump presidency, or four years of resentment from his thwarted fans, comes another trio of examples of this. Two of them compete in the 9pm slot tonight \u2013 The Conspiracy Files: The Trump Dossier (BBC2) and The Gun Shop (Channel 4) \u2013 while the third-party candidate is American High School (iPlayer).</p> <p>Although one aim of documentary is to explain a foreign culture to outsiders, The Gun Shop presents an aspect of America that, however good the film, will remain inexplicable to most outsiders. Shot at Freedom Firearms, a weapon-and-ammunition store in Battle Creek, Michigan, it works for a Channel 4 audience as weirdo TV. In the most eye-popping scene, a mother films proudly as her nine-year-old son has his first gun lesson at the shop\u2019s firing range.</p> <p>But far more than most offerings on the topic, this film sometimes twists its pointing finger to scratch its chin. Customers\u2019 backstories show them to be not merely gung-ho, but traumatised. The mum of the son with the gun was the victim of an armed car jacking, while other first-time gun buyers are shown to have been motivated by a random mass shooting nearby or the killing of an African-American driver by police. </p> <p>That man was shot after telling police he had a gun, so tooling up could be seen as a poor insurer of personal safety. But a logic has taken hold that is sharply expressed by a Freedom Firearms client: \u201cIf everyone\u2019s going to carry a weapon, I don\u2019t want to be the one without one.\u201d This logic may ensure more deaths, but the father of one shooting victim acknowledges that there is no possibility of the US becoming \u201canti-gun.\u201d Those who think an armed population is a bad idea will have to settle for \u201canti-carnage.\u201d</p> <p>A similar check to idealism from realism can be found in American High School, a six-part series filmed in South Carolina at Orangeburg-Wilkinson, an academy with a majority African American and \u201chigh poverty index\u201d student body. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"de5b9fafa563fcb2720f7a1170895ce24c1cea3e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/de5b9fafa563fcb2720f7a1170895ce24c1cea3e/120_0_1800_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A bigger test than most \u2026 Dr Stephen Peters, the principal of American High School.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A bigger test than most \u2026 Dr Stephen Peters, the principal of American High School.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BBC/Swan Films</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The conceit of a charismatic headteacher trying to reform a failing school is familiar here from series such as Educating Yorkshire, but Dr Stephen Peters, the new principal at O-W, is sitting a bigger test than most. In a key scene, he is dealing with the use of a weapon in a corridor when news comes that two cars filled with gang-members are heading towards campus to avenge the honour of the suspended student.</p> <p>Liberalism and sentimentality tend to encourage educational documentaries towards the most hopeful case studies and American High School has one of those (the story of a star student raised by a single father), but it doesn\u2019t flinch from the painful fates likely to claim many of her classmates.</p> <p>In both The Gun Shop and American High School, the impending election is a constant subtext \u2013 through the issues of racial and social division \u2013 but it is most directly addressed in The Conspiracy Files: The Trump Dossier, which has been re-edited up to the last minute to reflect the latest twists in Trump\u2019s problems with females and Hillary Clinton\u2019s with emails.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"11de77b575f4b3af221f2ca386e9f1416c105f96\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/11de77b575f4b3af221f2ca386e9f1416c105f96/113_302_3387_2032/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Conspiracy Files: The Trump Dossier reflect the latest twists in Trump\u2019s problems with females and Hillary Clinton\u2019s with emails.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Conspiracy Files: The Trump Dossier reflects the latest twists in Donald Trump\u2019s problems with females \u2013 and Hillary Clinton\u2019s with emails.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Carlo Allegri/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The thrust of John O\u2019Kane\u2019s film is that Trump has shaped his campaign around unproven or disproven conspiracy theories: Republican rival Ted Cruz\u2019s dad may have helped to kill JFK, Barack Obama faked his US birth certificate, the Clintons had White House aide Vince Foster murdered.</p> <p>Carefully presenting evidence from forensic experts and \u201ccitizen investigators\u201d on both sides of such matters as alleged typographical discrepancies on Obama\u2019s paperwork or disparities in Foster\u2019s supposed suicide note, the film will inevitably be seen by anyone who disagrees with its conclusions as part of the conspiracy (BBC-Establishment-pro-Clinton.) But \u2013 more profitably \u2013 it explores the creation of an American political climate in which there is no such thing as facts, and even the democratic process is constantly questioned.</p> <p>An odd omission in an otherwise exhaustive film was the absence of Clinton\u2019s claim, as First Lady, that her husband was the victim of a \u201cvast rightwing conspiracy\u201d to bring him down. This is significant because Hillary\u2019s belief that Washington was not to be trusted seems likely to have played a part in her unwise decision to secrete and delete emails while serving as Secretary of State.</p> <p>What The Conspiracy Files didn\u2019t state \u2013 but may lead many viewers to conclude \u2013 is that, if Clinton does win, she will become the third Democratic President in succession (after her husband and Obama) whose occupancy of the office has been relentlessly contested by conspiracy theorists and other \u201ccitizen investigators\u201d. And, as a Trump presidency would be viewed with horror in half of the US and much of the world, there should be no shortage of material for more \u201cEven in America!\u201d documentaries.</p>",

Though she still considers herself a member of the Republican party and a strong conservative, Milloy is disappointed with her party for not disavowing Trump.</p> <p>\u201cIf the party comes back from this and recognizes that it went crazy this year with Trump and the platform \u2026 then I would certainly stick around and do my best to help them rebuild after this year,\u201d Milloy said. \u201cBut if they double down like Trump has done, then I certainly won\u2019t be a part of that.\u201d</p> <p>Seeking to weaponize Trump\u2019s rhetoric against him, the Clinton campaign has aired a powerful ad <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHGPbl-werw\">in which young girls look at themselves in the mirror</a> against the backdrop of the real estate mogul\u2019s bullying words. The commercial aimed to target, in particular, married women in the suburbs of swing states Colorado, North Carolina, Ohio and Pennsylvania.</p> <p>As the sexual assault tape came to light, Clinton intensified her pitch against her opponent\u2019s treatment of women.</p> <p>Addressing a \u201cWomen for Hillary\u201d a conference call, one week before the election, Clinton appealed to supporters on a personal level.</p> <p>\u201cI know that parts of this election have been painful to many women, especially hearing about Donald Trump\u2019s behavior towards women over the years,\u201d she said. \u201cHe relishes making women feel terrible about themselves in every possible way. He thinks belittling women makes him a bigger man.</p> <p>\u201cWe need to make sure that he and his attitude \u2013 what he says, what he thinks, what he does to women \u2013 never gets him near the White House.\u201d</p> <p>Clinton also appeared with top female surrogates, from Michelle Obama to prominent women\u2019s rights leaders such as the Planned Parenthood Action Fund president, Cecile Richards, and Emily\u2019s List president, Stephanie Schriock, to make a final pitch to women in must-win battlegrounds.</p> <p>\u201cTo be elected as a woman, you have to be 20 times as good as your opponent,\u201d said Richards, whose late mother Ann Richards was herself a pioneer and as state treasurer of Texas became the first woman elected statewide in nearly 50 years in 1982.</p> <p>\u201cWe are not comfortable in this country with women who are powerful. It is extraordinary that this woman, as our own president says, has more experience, more preparation to go into the Oval Office than anyone we can remember, and it was just always going to be hard.\u201d</p> <p>But the gendered circumstances of Clinton\u2019s battle, according to Richards \u2013 from the focus on her clothes to her speaking style to whether she smiles enough \u2013 is what motivates women voters to make their voices heard on 8 November.</p> <p>\u201cWomen feel this is about much more than Hillary, this is about work that has been going on for decades,\u201d she said. \u201cThese women feel an enormous sense of pride and ownership in this election.\u201d</p> <p>Perhaps few moments crystallized that sentiment better than when Trump leaned into his microphone during the final presidential debate and snarled: \u201cSuch a nasty woman.\u201d</p> <p>Women supporting Clinton immediately reclaimed the phrase and turned it into a rallying cry, and it became a recurring theme at campaign events to see women with \u201cNasty Women\u201d shirts. Elizabeth Warren, the Massachusetts senator and influential Clinton surrogate, issued a fiery rebuke of Trump at a campaign rally in New Hampshire late last month: \u201cNasty women vote.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/oct/24/elizabeth-warren-trump-clinton-nasty-women-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/593xf\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2836581\"            data-video-name=\"'Nasty women vote': Elizabeth Warren takes a swipe at Trump \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"Reuters\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-580e6205e4b0219a00d38178\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/10/24/161024warren_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/10/24/161024warren.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/10/24/161024warren_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/oct/24/elizabeth-warren-trump-clinton-nasty-women-video\">\u2018Nasty women vote\u2019: Elizabeth Warren takes a swipe at Trump</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>It is not simply a distaste for Trump driving prospective turnout among women, according to longtime observers of the intersection of gender and politics.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s a policy argument for why unmarried women in particular are more drawn to a Democratic platform,\u201d said Rebecca Traister, author of the book <a href=\"http://www.simonandschuster.com/books/All-the-Single-Ladies/Rebecca-Traister/9781476716565\">All the Single Ladies: Unmarried Women and the Rise of an Independent Nation</a>. </p> <p>\u201cThey are no longer the class of Americans who are living economically, socially or professionally dependent on men in the way that they used to be.\u201d Barack Obama drove the Democratic advantage among unmarried women to historic levels in 2008, with 70% support to John McCain\u2019s 29%, while in 2012 single women preferred the president over Mitt Romney by a whopping margin of 36 percentage points.</p> <p>With women now holding jobs, and serving as breadwinners \u2013 be they unmarried, married, or same-sex partners \u2013 in larger numbers, as an electorate they are increasingly moved by policies that address their concerns, Traister added.</p> <p>This is why unmarried women have especially been drawn toward Clinton\u2019s platform of equal pay for women, easing the burden of student loan debt, paid family leave and protecting reproductive rights, she said. Clinton has emphasized her commitment to such issues since launching her campaign, and also focused on raising the minimum wage, an issue inextricably tied to gender in that women make up two-thirds of minimum wage earners.</p> <p>Jess O\u2019Connell, the executive director of Emily\u2019s List, said Trump was simply vocalizing in politically incorrect terms what Republicans have long advocated in more veiled language.</p> <p>\u201cSingle women are afraid the Republicans are going to turn back the clocks on them,\u201d O\u2019Connell said. \u201cIgnoring the gender gap in wages or wanting to punish women for having an abortion shows a real lack of understanding about women and their lives today.</p> <p>\u201cThis is when women\u2019s voices are going to be heard.\u201d</p> <p><br></p>",
  "<p>DC Pittman reckons he has knocked on more than 1,000 doors in the past two weeks.

But Pittman and others are trying to generate enthusiasm in African American communities with a pitch that is not necessarily focused on the race for the White House.</p> <p>In Harris County \u2013 which, with about 4.4 million residents, is more populous than 24 US states \u2013 a Democrat may be about to oust a Republican in a highly influential position: the county prosecutor.</p> <p>A University of Houston poll last month gave Kim Ogg a lead of seven percentage points over the incumbent district attorney, Devon Anderson. She was appointed by former Texas governor Rick Perry in 2013 to succeed her husband, Mike, who died of cancer, and beat Ogg in an election the following year.</p> <p>But Anderson\u2019s office has been beset by controversies including the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/22/texas-rape-victim-county-jail-bipolar-disorder-lawsuit\">jailing of a rape victim</a> to ensure she would testify against her attacker, accusations that Anderson stoked racial tensions after a white sheriff\u2019s deputy was shot dead by a mentally ill black man, and <a href=\"http://www.houstonchronicle.com/opinion/recommendations/article/For-Kim-Ogg-9202209.php\">complaints</a> that she has not introduced truly transformative reforms to a system that critics say treats low-income, low-level offenders unfairly.</p> <p>\u201cI explain to them how important it is to not just vote presidential but to vote for your locals as well,\u201d said Tarasha Hollis, who oversees a team of 12 canvassers paid $12.50 an hour.

The #VotingWhileBlack initiative is harnessing technology in an effort to increase African American voter engagement in notable contests across the country.</p> <p>In addition to the race for Harris County district attorney, #VotingWhileBlack is focusing on elections of prosecutors in Ohio and Florida in targeted attempts to replace officials they feel have poorly served black communities.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re the most incarcerated country and that didn\u2019t happen overnight or by mistake, it happened by a whole set of decisions that are made every day, and the most powerful actors in the criminal justice space are district attorneys,\u201d said Rashad Robinson, a civil rights activist and spokesman for Color of Change Pac, which is backing the campaign.</p> <p>\u201cThey determine whether or not police are held accountable but they also determine every day whether or not someone gets a misdemeanor or a felony, whether someone gets a second chance, whether someone\u2019s bail is set extremely high.\u201d</p> <p>In Harris County, Robinson argued, the district attorney has failed to institute progressive reforms and maintained old-fashioned tough-on-crime policies that unduly penalize communities of color. A spokesperson for Anderson did not respond to a request for comment.</p> <p>To educate voters and encourage them to head to the ballot box, #VotingWhileBlack has taken inspiration from some of the successful outreach tactics of the Bernie Sanders campaign, including the use of text messaging.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve bought the access to black folks\u2019 cellphones through the voter file and then coordinated that through the voter file to be able to identify registered black voters in Florida, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and also adding in the Harris County district attorney race,\u201d Robinson said.</p> <p>He said the initiative has sent more than 2.2m text messages and attracted nearly 1,500 volunteers for events such as \u201ctext-a-thons\u201d, where attendees try to engage possible voters in text conversations.</p> <p>The ultimate aim is to take a data-driven approach that will harness the kind of energy seen in the Black Lives Matter movement to achieve political change in local communities. Prosecutors in Cleveland and Chicago who drew criticism for their handling of fatal police shootings of African Americans were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/mar/16/black-lives-matter-movement-midwest-elections-victories\">defeated earlier this year</a>.</p> <p>In August, Angela Corey, a state attorney in the Jacksonville area who was behind a number of harsh sentences and <a href=\"https://www.thenation.com/article/is-angela-corey-the-cruelest-prosecutor-in-america/\">did not get a conviction</a> in the George Zimmerman case, lost her GOP primary to a relative unknown.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re gonna win some of these races around the country, we\u2019re gonna lose some. What we will change is that district attorneys will no longer get a free pass. For far too long, district attorneys could go off and do whatever they want, they could decide they were going to serve the police alone and not the community, they were just going to serve moneyed interests and not the wider community,\u201d Robinson said. </p> <p>A study last year found that <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/07/us/a-study-documents-the-paucity-of-black-elected-prosecutors-zero-in-most-states.html\">95% of elected prosecutors</a> in the US were white.</p> <p>Success, Robinson said, will be a shift in the balance of power that makes elected officials \u201cnervous about disappointing black people\u201d.</p>",

They have been sharing the issues they think are important, and suggesting who Gary should meet in the city.<br></p> <p> Collaboration is important for a project like this because the community provides nuance and insight that is difficult to uncover when you\u2019re only in a place for a short time.

The issues that the contributors have discussed in this piece are reflected in the wider community. Many identified everyday challenges such as drug addiction, racism and class divide, however they also spoke of Muncie as a very special place to live. This is a city where there is positive change, new development, a vibrant arts scene \u2013 but it\u2019s also a place where community matters and people like to help each other.</p> <p>This series is about how people in Muncie experience politics during this election \u2013 most striking when I was interviewing them for this piece was a sense of how voters felt let down by both presidential candidates. Nearly everyone I spoke to was trying in some way to unify Muncie, and that gets so much harder when the vicious political discourse fuels divisiveness.

  "<p>Democracy is often on a collision course with economic elites, sometimes in less subtle ways than others. Spain\u2019s current plight is one such example. Last month, the country\u2019s Socialist leader <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/01/pedro-sanchez-resigns-as-leader-of-spains-socialist-party\">Pedro S\u00e1nchez</a> was toppled in a party coup, paving the way for his fellow MPs to abstain in a vote to allow the conservative Mariano Rajoy to resume office. For many traditional Socialist voters, Rajoy\u2019s Popular party is the political wing of a venal, corrupt right-wing establishment: allowing them to form a minority government was an act of betrayal. But S\u00e1nchez\u2019s subsequent revelations exposed the machinations of powerful Spanish interests.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/30/what-happened-spain-socialist-workers-party-like-labour\">What\u2019s happened to Spain\u2019s socialist party? Well, it\u2019s like Britain\u2019s Labour | Miguel-Anxo Murado</a> </p> </aside>  <p>After two elections that marked the collapse of the country\u2019s two-party system but failed to produce a governing majority, S\u00e1nchez had attempted to assemble a leftwing alliance, much like the one that governs in neighbouring Portugal. His ambition had been to form a government alongside <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/podemos\">Podemos</a> \u2013 a recently formed party that emerged from movements protesting against cuts that have devastated Spanish society \u2013 and backed by Catalan nationalists.</p> <p>But this week, S\u00e1nchez revealed that he was blocked by powerful corporations, including banks and Spanish telecoms giant Telef\u00f3nica. These interests run El Pa\u00eds, the country\u2019s largest newspaper. Unless S\u00e1nchez allowed Rajoy to return to power, or accepted a new round of elections, El Pa\u00eds would launch a vicious campaign against S\u00e1nchez. A coalition with Podemos was simply intolerable.</p> <p>Here was direct interference in Spanish democracy by unaccountable vested interests to stop a progressive government taking power. \u201cS\u00e1nchez has recognised the pressure of the oligarchic powers and that it was a mistake not seeking an agreement with us,\u201d says Podemos leader Pablo Iglesias.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"52b5b187bf4c1807ecc28dabdbf8a54e6cede2ce\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/52b5b187bf4c1807ecc28dabdbf8a54e6cede2ce/0_66_4460_2676/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pedro S\u00e1nchez: \u2018A man riven with regret.\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pedro S\u00e1nchez: \u2018A man riven with regret.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Javier Soriano/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Indeed, S\u00e1nchez is a man riven with regret. He had attempted to form an alliance with the centre-right Citizens\u2019 party \u2013 another beneficiary of the implosion of the two-party system. But it was all a ruse: Podemos was asked to back such an alliance, even though it meant signing up to rightwing economic policies that would have been impossible to accept. It was nothing more than an attempt to blame Podemos for preventing Rajoy\u2019s return to power.</p> <p>Spain\u2019s Socialists are now in a terrible situation. Their grassroots are alienated, while the triumphant conservatives know they can coerce the Socialists to back their regressive budgets, threatening a snap election that would decimate their rivals if they refused. The Spanish Socialists were already halfway to suffering the fate of their Greek sister party, Pasok, which so alienated its natural supporters that they defected en masse to Syriza. The Catalan socialists are enraged by the party leadership\u2019s actions, and could even split. Podemos can now position itself as the real opposition. But that is of little comfort to Podemos\u2019 base, who could now endure years more of a conservative government that they had every hope of overturning.</p> <p>What is happening in Spain is revealing about events far beyond the country\u2019s borders. In Britain, Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s internal opponents quite legitimately point to the Labour party\u2019s abysmal poll ratings. It says much about the state of European social democracy that Labour\u2019s polling is higher than almost all of its sister parties across the Channel. When Tony Blair won his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2001/jun/08/uk.electionspast\">landslide 1997 victory</a>, social democrats were on the march across the European continent, including in Germany, France, Italy and Scandinavia.</p> <p>Today\u2019s social democratic parties are haemorrhaging support to the new left, the populist right and civic nationalism. The German social democratic leadership may be committed to the sort of \u201cthird way\u201d politics some would like Labour to adopt, but in the latest poll they languish at 22%. The French Socialists face being beaten by the far-right Front National in the first round of next year\u2019s presidential elections. Sweden\u2019s social democrats hang on to power by their fingernails, while their Nordic allies are exiled from power. Italy\u2019s centre left is a rare exception, but its only hold on power is precarious and challenged by the rise of the populist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/five-star-movement\">Five Star Movement</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"e9811f74123743d410703718916455994252608f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e9811f74123743d410703718916455994252608f/0_0_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"May 2012: demonstrators in Barcelona mark the anniversary of the beginning of the \u2018indignados\u2019 movement in Spain.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">May 2012: demonstrators in Barcelona mark the anniversary of the beginning of the \u2018indignados\u2019 movement in Spain.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Emilio Morenatti/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The core base of European social democratic parties has fragmented: between younger and older voters; university-educated and working-class voters in small towns; between those hostile to immigration and those who are not. The fury exchanged between centre-left and radical left forces across Europe is, all too often, a deflection from an uncomfortable truth: that neither has so far produced a convincing answer to how these multiple divisions can be straddled, and how a viable electoral coalition can be produced that would win power.</p> <p>It is frustration at unaccountable elites that produced Podemos in the first place: its whole narrative has been vindicated. Five years ago, millions of Spaniards who were disillusioned with the political establishment and determined to make it pay for a crisis not of their making mobilised across the country. Without these so-called <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/oct/15/spain-15-m-movement-activism\"><em>indignados</em></a>, Podemos and its allies would never have emerged as mass political forces. Podemos has much to teach other European leftists about how to communicate beyond traditional comfort zones. But Podemos\u2019 results in June\u2019s elections were disappointing: it had expected to eclipse the Socialists as the second party, and was traumatised when it failed to do so. In other local elections it routinely underperforms its opinion poll ratings. The party is now engaged in profound soul-searching, debating how to democratise the party\u2019s own internal structures to re-engage with the mass movements that produced it.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/03/europe-centre-left-spain-socialist-party-leader-coup\">If Europe's centre-left clings to discredited ideas, it will die | Paul Mason</a> </p> </aside>  <p>If Podemos capitalises both on disillusionment with the Socialists and the Popular party, it could provide an example for the left across Europe. If it fails to do so, there could be terrible consequences across the continent. Rightwing populism is on the march, and it is making considerable inroads into working-class communities that traditionally opted for the left. If discontent continues to sweep the western world \u2013 or if there is another crash \u2013 then the populist right will be well placed to gain.</p> <p>The old social democratic model is crumbling, but there is no guarantee that progressive forces will fill the vacuum it leaves. In Poland, the left has effectively ceased to exist: politics is a debate between David Cameron-style liberal conservatives and rightwing populism. If the left fails, Polandisation beckons for European politics. No pressure, Spain: but Europe\u2019s future may depend on you.</p>",

Legal and ethics experts contacted by the Associated Press said the government lobbyist should be subject to the same ethics rules as rank-and-file state employees, which generally prohibit such double-dipping. A separate prohibition against moonlighting bans Indiana state employees from accepting outside employment or undertaking activities that are not compatible with their public duties, would impair their independence or judgment, or pose a likely conflict of interest.</p> <p>The governor\u2019s office said Pitcock is exempt from most such rules because the Pence administration treats Pitcock as an independent contractor. It considers his contract for \u201cprofessional services\u201d different than contracts for \u201cpersonal\u201d services, which treat contractors as employees.</p> <p>Pence defended the arrangement late Wednesday. \u201cThe arrangement that the state of Indiana has with a firm in Washington DC has been a great, great success for our state,\u201d he told television station KDVR in Denver in an interview. \u201cThat individual and his team have worked very effectively advocating Indiana\u2019s interest. But it\u2019s an individual firm, an individual contractor.\u201d</p> <p>Pence said there was no conflict of interest. \u201cHe\u2019s not a state employee and so he\u2019s entitled to have other clients and I\u2019m grateful to have his support and assistance for the state of Indiana,\u201d he said in the interview.</p> <p>Pitcock continues to collect monthly lobbying fees \u2013 a total of nearly $1m since Pence won election in 2012 and took office in 2013. Since August, after Pitcock also began working as Pence\u2019s policy director for the election, Trump\u2019s campaign has paid Pitcock\u2019s firm $32,374 for event consulting, according to the latest financial records from the Federal Election Commission. Pitcock told AP that he refunded to Trump\u2019s campaign $15,612, which he described as an overpayment caused by an accounting error.</p> <p>Pitcock said he was working diligently for both his employers and there was no conflict or violation of state employment rules.<br></p> <p>\u201cMy firm has a contract with the state of Indiana to perform certain duties related to federal affairs, including lobbying,\u201d Pitcock said in a statement. \u201cThose duties have been and continue to be performed fully and completely. I am not a state employee.

But there\u2019s still a lot of variation \u2013 one poll finds that Clinton is three points ahead, another finds that she is six points <em>behind </em>Trump. Both surveys were conducted after news that the justice department had obtained a warrant to investigate an aide to Clinton\u2019s emails, before which her lead was already shrinking.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"81b2cb4ef2ea7948f9e4f887bec8e8776aa309df\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/81b2cb4ef2ea7948f9e4f887bec8e8776aa309df/0_101_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A polling station worker helps a woman as she votes during early voting in Chicago.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A polling station worker helps a woman as she votes during early voting in Chicago.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Joshua Lott/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>That variation between polls isn\u2019t surprising \u2013 it can be explained by the fact that different polls speak to different people. For example, the LA Times poll which has consistently found that Trump has more national support, includes one <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/13/upshot/how-one-19-year-old-illinois-man-is-distorting-national-polling-averages.html\">19-year-old black male</a> respondent who consistently said he\u2019ll vote for the Republican nominee. That one individual has a disproportionate impact because of a statistical process called <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/video/2016/jun/01/political-polls-bad-for-democracy-heres-why-video\">weighting</a> (where one respondent can end up representing hundreds of thousands of voters).</p> <p>So, are current polls a good reflection of what will happen on election day? Historically, the answer is \u201cnot bad\u201d, although they will probably be a much better indicator by the morning of 8 November rather than now. Clinton\u2019s email scandal will probably go down in US political history as an \u201c<a href=\"http://politicaldictionary.com/words/october-surprise/\">October surprise</a>\u201d, a last-minute news event that can cause a shift in public opinion. Those surprises \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/01/us/october-surprises-dont-necessarily-sway-elections-or-occur-in-october.html\">which have included Lyndon Johnson\u2019s announcement of a halt in the bombing of North Vietnam in 1968, and the news of a drunk-driving charge for George W Bush in 2000</a> \u2013 typically don\u2019t affect final outcomes all that much though, as the chart below shows. It compares polling a week before from election day and the morning of with the final voting outcome.</p> <p>The only snag is the electoral college system. In 2000, it wasn\u2019t just ABC and the Washington Post that predicted a Bush win \u2013 polling averages also showed the Republican <a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-much-do-october-surprises-move-the-polls/\">three points</a> ahead of Al Gore. Though both candidates ended up with 48% of the popular vote, that\u2019s only after rounding. The actual result was Gore-Bush, <a href=\"http://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/national.php?f=0&amp;year=2000\">48.4%-47.9%</a>. Bush ultimately became president because the distribution of those votes worked in his favour \u2013 he collected 271 of the 538 electoral college votes (270 are needed to win).</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/02/election-polls-hillary-clinton-donald-trump-october-surprise\">Clinton's 'October surprise' helps Trump in polls \u2013 but will it affect election day?</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-581a672ce4b07ceadb3a1cbb\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/nicky-woolf\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-02T22:23:12.872Z\">10.23pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>A white nationalist has apologized for robocalls in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/utah\">Utah</a> calling independent presidential candidate Evan McMullin a \u201ccloset homosexual\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dbaf826e0a147ea78e74a9ab5880fa57afb67f7c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dbaf826e0a147ea78e74a9ab5880fa57afb67f7c/0_0_4800_2881/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Evan McMullin.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Evan McMullin.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rick Bowmer/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>William Daniel Johnson is a Los Angeles-based lawyer and self-described white nationalist who was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/10/donald-trump-white-nationalist-delegate-database-error\">originally meant to be a delegate for Donald Trump</a> at the Republican national convention.</p> <p>On Monday, Johnson announced that he was putting out an automated call to Utah voters attacking McMullin, an independent conservative candidate who has become the <a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/2016/10/19/independent-presidential-candidate-evan-mcmullin-leads-in-utah--new-poll.html\">unexpected frontrunner</a> in the heavily Mormon state, according to recent polls.</p> <p>\u201cMy name is William Johnson.

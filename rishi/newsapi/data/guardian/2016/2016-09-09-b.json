You\u2019ll have a whole different supreme court structure.\u201d</p> <p></p> <p>Trump has made immigration a central issue of his campaign, promising to build a wall on the southern border, to be paid for by Mexico, although Mexican leaders have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/31/donald-trump-mexico-meeting-president-pena-nieto-immigration\">rejected </a>the idea. His promises to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/aug/27/donald-trump-deport-11-million-migrants-is-that-even-possible\">deport some 11 million </a>undocumented migrants who live in the US have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/04/donald-tump-immigration-mixed-messages-republicans\">recently been thrown into doubt</a>, however.</p> <p>CBN host David Brody asked Trump whether he was referring to \u201cwhat Michele Bachmann was talking about\u201d, which was Clinton providing potential citizenship for \u201cmany of these illegals\u201d, because \u201cthat means Texas and Florida could be gone\u201d.</p> <p>Bachmann, a former congresswoman from Minnesota who made a brief run for the White House in 2012 and is <a href=\"http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/bachmann-boasts-role-trump-adviser-multiple-issues\">an adviser</a> to the Trump campaign, <a href=\"http://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/michele-bachmann-2016-last-election-demographic-change\">last week told CBN</a>: \u201cIf you look at the numbers of people who vote and who live in the country and who Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton want to bring in to the country, this is the last election when we even have a chance to vote for somebody who will stand up for godly moral principles. This is it.\u201d</p> <p>Both Texas and Florida have large populations of undocumented people, relative to other states, and the latter has been tightly contested in recent elections.</p> <p>Trump repeated: \u201cI think this will be the last election if I don\u2019t win. I think this will be the last election that the Republicans have a chance of winning because you\u2019re going to have people flowing across the border, you\u2019re going to have illegal immigrants coming in and they\u2019re going to be legalised and they\u2019re going to be able to vote and once that all happens you can forget it.\u201d</p> <p>Two successive presidents, Democrat Barack Obama and Republican George W Bush, have failed to pass immigration reform plans through Congress that would have created very gradual paths to citizenship. Despite steady support by moderate Republicans for such plans, Trump has consistently rejected citizenship unless migrants leave and return to the US.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going to have one Republican vote,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s already a hard number. Already the path is much more difficult for the Republicans. You just have to look at the maps.\u201d</p> <p>In the Real Clear Politics <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/us/general_election_trump_vs_clinton-5491.html\">head-to-head</a> poll average, Clinton leads Trump 45.6% to 42.9%. The same site\u2019s poll average for <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/fl/florida_trump_vs_clinton-5635.html\">Florida</a> puts the Democrat up by 44.8% to 44.5%. In <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/tx/texas_trump_vs_clinton-5694.html\">Texas</a>, Trump leads by 45.7% to 37.3%.</p> <p>Data journalism site FiveThirtyEight has <a href=\"http://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2016-election-forecast/?ex_cid=rrpromo\">forecast</a> that Clinton has a 71.3% chance of winning the White House. The website makes Florida the state most likely to tip the election, with an 18.7% chance. Solidly Republican Texas, it says, has a 0.7% chance of deciding who makes it to the White House.</p>",

In 2015, Pence made a total of $8,923 in donations to charity, almost equal to the $8,956 he paid in federal income tax.</p> <p>\u201cThe Pence family has been honored to serve their state and their nation for the past 16 years, while raising three great children and putting them through college,\u201d Marc Lotter, Pence\u2019s press secretary, said in a statement.</p> <p>\u201cThese tax returns clearly show that Mike and Karen Pence have paid their taxes, supported worthy causes, and, unlike the Clintons, the Pences have not profited from their years in public service.\u201d</p> <p>Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton has released <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/12/hillary-clinton-tim-kaine-tax-returns\">her 2015 personal tax return</a> in August, as well as that of running mate Tim Kaine and his wife, Anne Holton, who additionally released 10 years of their returns.</p> <p>Those figures showed that Hillary and Bill Clinton earned nearly $11m in 2015, paying an effective federal income tax rate of 34.2%. Adding an effective state and local income tax rate of 9.0%, the couple\u2019s total tax rate totaled 43.2%.

He referred to attendees as \u201cyou people\u201d at one point. Trump also railed against the Obama administration for not admitting Christian refugees from Syria into the United States, a major cause of concern for evangelicals who have long advocated for minority Christian communities in the Middle East. The problem is that Trump\u2019s own refugee policy would be a blanket ban on anyone from the region entering the United States.</p> <p>He did seem cognizant that no one would mistake him for a devout evangelical. At one point in the speech he joked that his support for repealing the Johnson Amendment, which would allow churches to engage in partisan politics while keeping their tax exempt status, was the only way he could get into heaven. But the biggest applause was not for Trump himself but for when he proclaimed \u201cHillary Clinton is unfit to be president.\u201d The room exploded in applause and one attendee could be seen waving his tricorn hat in support.</p> <p>Values Voter Summit is sponsored by the Family Research Council and has a constellation of conservative groups represented. Even the far-right John Birch Society had a table in the group\u2019s exhibition hall.</p> <p>But Trump\u2019s performance seemed to ease the concerns of attendees who represented some of the most ardent cultural warriors in the party, a group that has long been uncomfortable with the nominee and preferred other candidates like Ted Cruz in the primary.</p> <p>Dylan Miller, a rising community college freshman from Northwest Florida said the speech changed his mind about Trump. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t seem maniacal\u201d said the teenager, in contrast to the Republican nominee\u2019s performances on television. Miller had said he had always planned on voting for Trump \u201cbecause he wasn\u2019t Hillary,\u201d but Trump\u2019s performance made him feel far more comfortable with his vote.</p> <p>Another attendee, Sarah Ocker, a student at Tulsa Community College in Oklahoma, said she was \u201cmore there\u201d now than she was before the speech. She \u201cagreed with a lot\u201d of what Trump said, particularly about \u201creligious liberty.\u201d Ocker still had major hesitations about Trump and still couldn\u2019t commit to voting for the Republican nominee though but was \u201choping\u201d she could find a reason to vote for him in November.</p> <p>Vernon Lewis of Marshall, Texas was further along in the process. Lewis had once thought he would have to hold his nose to vote for Trump. But after a private meeting with other Christians with Trump in New York as well as seeing his speech Friday, Lewis was enthusiastic. \u201cHe is a very gentle guy.\u201d</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57d32dcbe4b07ac3d446aa97\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/davidsmith\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-09T21:47:47.931Z\">10.47pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>On Friday, in blazing sunshine, about 200 members of Congress stood on the steps beneath the recently restored Capitol dome and prayed, observed a moment\u2019s silence and, accompanied by a marine band, sang God Bless America to mark the imminent anniversary of the September 11 terrorist attacks.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3567a83b2c12d10d543c893bc846a0414a88ce95\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3567a83b2c12d10d543c893bc846a0414a88ce95/0_0_3500_2249/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Paul Ryan, joined by House members, speaks on Capitol Hill in Washington during a ceremony marking the 15th anniversary of Sept. 11 attacks.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"643\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Paul Ryan, joined by House members, speaks on Capitol Hill in Washington during a ceremony marking the 15th anniversary of Sept. 11 attacks.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Molly Riley/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMKvLqwdD-w&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;Source=GovD\">The remembrance ceremony</a>, with Democrats and Republicans standing side by side, was heartening to <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/author/emanuel-lipscomb\">Emanuel Lipscomb</a>, 57, who was in New York on business that day and narrowly survived the disaster. \u201cIt\u2019s good to see it\u2019s brought a spark of bipartisanship,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s bringing the United States together because we all suffered together as one.\u201d</p> <p>For these crisp nine minutes, at least, the toxic wrangling and inertia of Congress could be put aside, along with its legacy of war in Afghanistan and Iraq.

Will they ever? Can they? They can watch the old footage. They can see clips of the towers falling. They can hear the great roar as a landmark comes crashing down \u2013and with it, an era. But can they actually feel it?</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve had so many conversations with my own kids about this, about the shock, the terror, the outrage. Can they feel the sense of bereavement \u2013 at losing almost 3,000 Americans in a single morning? I don\u2019t think they can. But that makes it our generation\u2019s burden. We lived through that terrible day.

  "<p>British-based financial institutions must be prevented post-Brexit from selling their services in the eurozone, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/07/frances-emmanuel-macron-launches-political-movement\">Emmanuel Macron</a>, the likely progressive left candidate for the French presidency has told the Guardian.</p> <p>He said a ban on so-called <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/25/london-city-eu-passport-brexit\">financial passporting rights</a>, seen as potentially highly damaging to the City of London and one of the most fraught issues in Brexit talks, \u201cshould not be seen as a technical issue but a matter of sovereignty\u201d.</p> <p>Financial services passporting allows banks and other financial companies, like insurers and accountancy firms, to operate across the European Union based on their authorisation in a single member state.</p> <p>Macron, currently the best prospect of preventing a rightwing victory in next year\u2019s presidential election, added he could not see how the UK could be granted a financial passport unless it contributed to the EU budget in the same way as Switzerland and Norway.</p> <p>But Macron insisted: \u201cThe financial passport is part of full access to the EU market and a precondition for that is the contribution to the EU budget. That has been the case in Norway and in Switzerland. That is clear.\u201d The proposal would be rejected outright by British Eurosceptics.</p> <p>He also gave no ground on <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/04/uk-could-access-single-market-suggests-french-presidential-favourite-alain-juppe\">free movement of EU workers</a>, saying any concessions that allowed the UK to exclude some EU citizens would lead to the disintegration of Europe.</p> <p>Macron\u2019s remarks are a fresh sign that leading French politicians jockeying for the presidency are in no mood to offer concessions to the UK.</p> <p>Macron,39, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/30/frances-economy-minister-emmanuel-macron-resigns\">resigned from Hollande\u2019s unpopular government</a> last week, to set up new movement \u201cEn Marche\u201d and assemble his \u201cprogressive diagnosis\u201d of French ills ahead of a decision on a presidential bid in a couple of months. With only two years in mainstream politics, he is seen as an intriguing wild card who could thwart either <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/07/how-nicolas-sarkozys-presidential-days-came-back-to-haunt-him\">Nicholas Sarkozy</a> or the Front National of <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/03/rural-france-pledges-to-vote-for-le-pen-president\">Marine le Pen</a>.</p> <p>He was in London to help build a campaign war chest as large as \u20ac12m (\u00a310m) and claims 75,000 people have joined his movement since it was launched. Describing his position of third in the polls as \u201ca good beginning\u201d, he insists he can be the catalyst to disrupt and break the classical outmoded left-right political blocs.</p> <p>Macron\u2019s remarks on passporting run counter to claims made by both Philip Hammond, the chancellor and Boris Johnson, the foreign secretary, that passporting rights will be preserved. Hammond told MPs this week that any attempt by the EU to split off euro-denominated clearing would not benefit the EU, with business instead drifting to New York.</p> <p>Johnson has insisted the UK\u2019s financial services sector will not be stripped of the passporting rights, which exist within the single market, saying that the City of London will remain a global financial centre.</p> <p>But Macron said: \u201cWe have the eurozone. Could we accept to be cleared, regulated and de facto have inflows and outflows from a country that has decided to leave the EU? For me, definitely not.\u201d</p> <p>He added the EU could not wait months and months for the UK to start Brexit talks. \u201cProcrastination is not the right answer. We have to be extremely strict on the implementation of Brexit so there is a common approach between member states. We must avoid a sector by sector or country by country approach, and ask the UK to be clear.\u201d</p> <p>He also spurned the concessions on free movement as a price for access to the EU single market. \u201cIf you accept such caveats, the more you can damage the EU and it will be an open door for whoever has doubts about Europe, and so reduce the incentive to be pro-European. </p> <p>\u201cI was completely against the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2016/feb/17/four-eu-states-shun-camerons-benefits-plan-politics-live\">agreements signed with the UK in February</a>; it just said \u2018OK if you give me more, then I will stay in the club\u2019. That is the beginning of the dismantlement of Europe. Now just because there is a leave vote, should we rewrite the rules of the club for one country. It\u2019s a very strange defeat for Europe if people accept that.\u201d</p> <p>Macron said he is trying to develop a programme on economic dynamism, married to social protection, equality of opportunity and security: \u201cI am not just a liberal movement. I come from the progressive left. I am trying to refresh and counter the system.\u201d</p> <p>Macron, attacking his rivals on the right on their strongest issue of national identity, described \u201cthe recent shortcut in the debate from the Nice terrorist attack to the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/02/burkini-ban-suspended-nice-court-france\">burkini ban</a> as crazy. A national debate on this was the best way to divide the country\u201d.</p> <p>He said that the middle classes were losing their sense of cultural security, but that issue could not be solved by national laws and bans.</p> <p>\u201cThe guy who killed people in Nice was not a Muslim. Daesh [Islamic State] want civil war in our country. They want to divide the country. But they are not in a position to break our country unless we decide to enter into this game and organise a civil war. It is crazy to think the best way to defeat Daesh is to fight Muslims. We have 5.5 million Muslims in France\u201d.</p> <p>But he said there was a deeper issue about unintegrated Muslims in France, especially Salafists who regarded Islamic law as superior to French secular law. He estimated that between 25\u201330% of French Muslims, close to 2 million, thought in this way, and the answer lay in enforcing French secular law.</p> <p>French Muslims had to become less dependent on preachers from Algiers and Morocco, he said. But he added that measures such as the burkini ban, or <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/apr/11/france-bans-burqa-and-niqab\">wearing the veil</a>, risked disenfranchising Muslims and risking their ability to be fully aligned with the Republic.</p>",
  "<p><br>Donald Trump knows a thing or two about buying politicians. By his own admission, that was his own relationship with the elected official he now calls Crooked Hillary.</p> <p>\u201cAs a businessman and a very substantial donor to very important people, when you give, they do whatever the hell you want them to do,\u201d Trump <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/donald-trump-says-his-past-politics-were-transactional-1438213199\">told the Wall Street Journal</a> last year. \u201cAs a businessman, I need that.\u201d</p> <p>A few days later, on stage at the first debate of the primaries, Trump defended the practice.</p> <p>There was no promise to reform the system; merely a statement of his transactions. That was simply his answer to the difficult question of why this Republican candidate had donated so much money to so many Democrats.</p> <p>\u201cI will tell you that our system is broken,\u201d he <a href=\"http://time.com/3988276/republican-debate-primetime-transcript-full-text/\">explained</a>. \u201cI gave to many people, before this, before two months ago, I was a businessman. I give to everybody. When they call, I give. And do you know what? When I need something from them two years later, three years later, I call them, they are there for me.\u201d</p> <p>The political world according to Trump is much like hiring a lawyer or accountant. He pays up; they follow his orders. The art of this deal is straightforward: the buyer enjoys considerable leverage over the seller.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s explanations of his donations are helpful context for understanding at least two curious payments to state attorneys-general.</p> <p>Both Pam Bondi of Florida and Greg Abbott of Texas (now the Texas governor) were the lucky recipients of Trump donations. Bondi received a $25,000 contribution from Trump a few days after her office <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/06/10/politics/pam-bondi-donald-trump-donation/\">declared</a> it was \u201creviewing the allegations\u201d in a lawsuit filed in New York against Trump University in 2013. Both Abbott and Bondi deny any impropriety.</p> <p>Bondi\u2019s office ended the review without taking any action against the so-called university, that reports suggest was little more than a high-pressure sales opportunity for a worthless investment seminar.</p> <p>Trump also handed over cash <a href=\"http://www.twcnews.com/tx/austin/politics/2016/06/2/ap--greg-abbott-given--35k-gubernatorial-campaign-donation-after-trump-university-probe-in-texas-dropped.html\">to Abbott</a> to support his gubernatorial campaign in Texas. That was three years after Abbott dropped its investigation into the business that the New York attorney general has called \u201cstraight-up fraud\u201d.</p> <p>Proving corruption is notoriously difficult in a court of law, and campaign finance laws are just as notoriously difficult to enforce. So for now, we must be thankful to the Internal Revenue Service \u2013 and the reporting of the Washington Post \u2013 for uncovering the mysterious circumstances of the Bondi payment.</p> <p>Trump paid Bondi\u2019s campaign through his tax-exempt family foundation, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2016/09/01/trump-pays-irs-a-penalty-for-his-foundation-violating-rules-with-gift-to-florida-attorney-general/\">in violation of tax laws</a>. Strangely, the donation was initially listed as going to a Kansas charity with a similar name to Bondi\u2019s political group. \u201cAn honest mistake,\u201d said the Trump Organization.</p> <p>That honest mistake cost Trump a $2,500 penalty to the IRS. It might also cost him his self-proclaimed position as an outsider who can upend the political system; and as a relentless critic of the Clinton Foundation\u2019s approach to donations.</p> <p>Instead, Trump looks more and more like the political insider he professes to disdain.</p> <p>Of course, he doesn\u2019t call Pam Bondi of Florida \u201cCrooked Pam\u201d. That would be a little ungenerous since she spoke so eloquently on his behalf at the Republican convention in Cleveland.</p> <p>\u201cWinning this election means reclaiming something to which I\u2019ve dedicated my entire career: the rule of law. Laws that make our neighborhoods safe. Laws that make our economy strong. Laws that apply equally to everyone,\u201d Bondi explained to the delegates in the hall.</p> <p>Bondi <a href=\"http://www.tampabay.com/news/politics/stateroundup/transcript-of-attorney-general-pam-bondis-speech-to-the-republican/2286207\">accused</a> Clinton of being \u201ca former secretary of state who believes the laws don\u2019t apply to her \u2026 This lawlessness must stop. Right here. Right now. Donald Trump will stop it.\u201d</p> <p>After one passing reference to Clinton\u2019s private email server, the crowd began chanting, and Bondi happily responded in kind.</p> <p>\u201cLock her up,\u201d said the attorney general. \u201cI love that.\u201d</p> <p>This is the rule of law seen through Alice\u2019s looking glass. A wonderland where a state\u2019s chief law enforcement officer loves the notion of locking up an elected official without charge or trial.</p> <p>A topsy-turvy state of affairs where lawlessness will be stopped by a man who is being sued for fraud.</p> <p>It would be too much to say that Trump is a hypocrite. You see, he hasn\u2019t promised to fix the broken system. He only pointed out that he bought other politicians. He only hinted that he has so much money that he can\u2019t be bought by other donors. Reform was never his rallying cry.</p> <p>A real reform candidate could have worked wonders in this presidential cycle. An outsider with unimpeachable credentials and a decent claim to credibility might have ripped through both the primaries and the general election. That was, in part, the appeal of Bernie Sanders.</p> <p>Instead, the Republican party nominated someone who openly admits to buying politicians, and whose relationship with the truth looks like a comb-over.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s pitch to voters isn\u2019t that he\u2019s cleaner than his supposedly crooked opponent. It\u2019s that he\u2019s paid so much for the broken system that he doesn\u2019t need to sell himself.</p> <p>This isn\u2019t your typical pay-to-play scheme. Trump has paid the politicians for years, and now he\u2019s trying to play the voters.</p>",
  "<p>The San Diego Chargers kick off two campaigns this week.</p> <p>The team kick off their NFL season against division rival Kansas City, and conventional wisdom says campaign season started too, as the franchise tries to win voter approval for a downtown stadium. </p> <p>Expert forecasts suggest the chances of winning that vote are even grimmer than the team\u2019s chances of winning the AFC West. </p> <p>The Chargers are <a href=\"http://www.voiceofsandiego.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Final-SD-Initiative-03_30_16_1230am.pdf\">asking voters</a> to increase hotel taxes by 4% to help underwrite a $1.8bn stadium and convention center next door to the Padres\u2019 Petco Park. The league and team pay <a href=\"https://www.sandiego.gov/sites/default/files/16_20_fiscal_impact_statement_measure_c.pdf\">roughly $650m of the cost</a>, with the tourism tax covering the rest.</p> <p>In California, though, tax increases for specific projects \u2013 like a football stadiums \u2013 need two-thirds voter approval, not a simple majority.</p> <p>That\u2019s why virtually everyone involved in San Diego city politics expects it to fail \u2013 including people in charge of getting it passed.</p> <p>\u201cFor the people who say it isn\u2019t going to pass, they\u2019re not exactly going out on a limb and certifying themselves as political geniuses,\u201d said Mark Fabiani, Chargers special counsel and the man in charge of getting the team a new stadium for the last decade. \u201cI don\u2019t know what credit people should get for saying something so obvious.\u201d</p> <p>And he has a point. Not many votes clear a 66% threshold. For instance, when Arlington, Texas, voters agreed to spend $325m on a Cowboys stadium that would nonetheless be called \u201cThe House that Jerry Built\u201d, <a href=\"http://www.arlington-tx.gov/citysecretary/wp-content/uploads/sites/14/2014/05/November-2-2004-Stadium-Election-Results.pdf\">just 55%</a> of voters agreed. Just 53% of Denver-area voters approved a new Broncos stadium.</p> <p>But it isn\u2019t just the high bar that makes the team\u2019s proposal improbable. </p> <p>The Chargers have less support in San Diego than other teams in their home markets said John Nienstedt, a San Diego-based pollster who has tested the public\u2019s view of various Chargers measures since 2004.</p> <p>\u201cAny conversation of this starts with, we\u2019re not Pittsburgh, and the Chargers are not the Steelers, or the Packers, Cowboys or Seahawks,\u201d Nienstedt said. </p> <p>Right now, he said, just 20% of San Diegans consider themselves big Chargers fans, the lowest he\u2019s ever seen and far below the 40% seen in other cities. Fabiani disputes this. He said TV ratings and other measures of popularity don\u2019t support it.</p> <p>And San Diegans have their reasons to be disillusioned.</p> <p>The Chargers spent all last year trying to relocate to Los Angeles with the Raiders, the team\u2019s most hated rival. They even said farewell in their last home game, potentially making this season one of those awkward second goodbyes when you can\u2019t quite leave a party.</p> <p>The bad times aren\u2019t all recent. In 1997, the city agreed to purchase all unsold tickets to Chargers\u2019 games, guaranteeing the team a sellout every week. It cost the city $36.4m <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/news/story?id=1839120\">until the City Council ended</a> it in 2004. And the city\u2019s still on the hook for nearly $5m a year through 2026 from debt payments on a 1990s renovation of a Qualcomm Stadium that could soon be empty. </p> <p>\u201cIf you look at the history, there\u2019s a healthy skepticism of these big projects, and the Chargers have done nothing substantive over the years to alleviate that skepticism,\u201d Nienstedt said.</p> <p>Between the team\u2019s relationship with the city and a quirk of California tax law, the Chargers are starting from farther back, and have longer to go in the first place.</p> <p>Which might not be such a problem, <a href=\"http://www.voiceofsandiego.org/topics/government/san-diego-politicos-pan-chargers-convadium-plan/\">if they had support</a> from city leaders.</p> <p>The city\u2019s business-friendly mayor has gone out of his way not to take a position. The tourism industry with which he\u2019s closely aligned \u2013 and which, as expected in a city known for beaches, Sea World and the zoo, is politically influential \u2013 strongly <a href=\"http://connect.sandiego.org/2016/09/02/sdta-and-hma-statement-on-stadium-ballot-initiatives/\">opposes</a> it. Residents of a nearby, historically Latino community <a href=\"http://www.voiceofsandiego.org/topics/arts/barrio-logan/\">have warned</a> it will gentrify their neighborhood. <a href=\"http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/2016/sep/04/pressure-grows-on-faulconer-over-stadium/\">Business leaders</a> and elected officials from both parties have <a href=\"http://www.nodowntownstadium.com/\">formed a committee</a> to pay for ads against it.</p> <p>Even <a href=\"http://www.voiceofsandiego.org/topics/land-use/exclusive-padres-chairman-outlines-chargers-stadium-concerns/\">the Padres have big problems</a> with the plan. The team insists it wants the Chargers to stay, but has criticized problems the stadium would cause if it was built next door to their ballpark.</p> <p>It\u2019s enough to make you wonder, why are the Chargers even bothering?</p> <p>At the time the team launched the initiative, Fabiani said, the team thought it had a chance to get key interest groups and elected leaders on board. It\u2019s easy now to say it\u2019s doomed, but the team didn\u2019t calculate that it would receive so little support.</p> <p>Yet the team isn\u2019t without allies. The regional Chamber of Commerce and local construction unions are on board, as is a congressman who\u2019s increasingly vocal in his support.</p> <p>And so, Fabiani said, it\u2019s too early to say the Chargers can\u2019t win. Especially given the team\u2019s unique circumstance: the league has already approved its relocation to Los Angeles and to move into Rams owner Stan Kroenke\u2019s new, state-of-the-art facility. If the Chargers don\u2019t exercise the option this year, they can extend it for one more season, before the Raiders get a chance to move in instead.</p> <p>\u201cThis is a one-of-a-kind measure,\u201d Fabiani said. \u201cYou have a team that has a viable option to play someplace else, trying to put together a plan to stay.\u201d</p> <p>He said it\u2019s still possible the presidential election could drive turnout that helps the team, and no one should write off its chances of winning.</p> <p>Fabiani\u2019s framing is consistent with <a href=\"http://www.mighty1090.com/episode/how-does-attacking-chris-cate-help-the-chargers-stadium-bid/\">a recent social media ad the team paid for</a>, targeting a councilman who had emerged as the most outspoken critic of the team\u2019s proposal.</p> <p>\u201cWhy does Chris Cate want the Chargers to leave San Diego? Please call and ask him,\u201d the ad read, listing his office\u2019s phone number.</p> <p>The message seems clear: a vote against the measure is a vote for the Chargers to leave town.</p> <p>But Fabiani insists neither should be seen as a threat. Sort of.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been careful never to say that, and that\u2019s not the case,\u201d Fabiani said. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t want to predict what would happen if we don\u2019t win this election, but I think people understand the obvious fact that if we don\u2019t win we don\u2019t have another clear option.\u201d</p>",

My friend and I were some of the only women in the room.  I was feeling nervous.  I was a senior in college.  I wasn\u2019t sure how well I\u2019d do.  And while we\u2019re waiting for the exam to start, a group of men began to yell things like: \u2018You don\u2019t need to be here.\u2019 And \u2018There\u2019s plenty else you can do.\u2019 It turned into a real \u2018pile on.\u2019 One of them even said: \u2018If you take my spot, I\u2019ll get drafted, and I\u2019ll go to Vietnam, and I&amp;#39;ll die.\u2019 And they weren\u2019t kidding around.  It was intense.  It got very personal.  But I couldn\u2019t respond.  I couldn\u2019t afford to get distracted because I didn\u2019t want to mess up the test.  So I just kept looking down, hoping that the proctor would walk in the room.  I know that I can be perceived as aloof or cold or unemotional.  But I had to learn as a young woman to control my emotions.  And that\u2019s a hard path to walk.  Because you need to protect yourself, you need to keep steady, but at the same time you don\u2019t want to seem \u2018walled off.\u2019 And sometimes I think I come across more in the \u2018walled off\u2019 arena.  And if I create that perception, then I take responsibility.  I don\u2019t view myself as cold or unemotional.  And neither do my friends.  And neither does my family.  But if that sometimes is the perception I create, then I can\u2019t blame people for thinking that.\u201d&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style=&quot; color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;&quot;&gt;A photo posted by Humans of New York (@humansofny) on &lt;time style=&quot; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;&quot; datetime=&quot;2016-09-08T17:08:40+00:00&quot;&gt;Sep 8, 2016 at 10:08am PDT&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;script async defer src=&quot;//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>In the post, Clinton recalled sitting down to take a law school admissions test at Harvard.

In August, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/02/us-jobs-report-august-economy\">US created 151,000 jobs</a> - about 30,000 below expectations. However, on average the US economy added about 230,000 a month over the last three months. August was the 71st consecutive month of overall job creation- longest streak on record. It was also the 77th consecutive month of private sector job growth.</p> <p>The Obama administration insists that the jobs added over the past few months tend to be good, middle class jobs rather than \u201cbad jobs\u201d as Trump described them. According to US labor secretary Tom Perez, education and health sectors have added the most job in the last year, followed by professional and business services.</p> <p>\u201cI use these two examples to highlight what we are seeing in this recovery, which is over the last two to three years, not only do we see a growth in the quantity of jobs but we are seeing a distinct growth in the quality of jobs. More and more middle class and above jobs are being created in the last two to three years,\u201d he told the Guardian on Friday.</p> <p>\u201cAnother sector that is really rebounding - especially in the last few months is government, which during the early stages of the recovery it usually recovers really fast but it didn\u2019t. And now we are seeing some real rebound in government jobs, which tend to be solid middle class jobs. I am heartened not just by the number of jobs we are creating but by the quality of jobs that are being created.\u201d</p> <p>One of the main reasons for the delay in recovery in government sector is the sequester - the automatic budget cuts that were included in the 2011 Budget Control Act. Had it been not for the budget cuts championed by Congress Republicans after the 2008 economic crisis, unemployment rate might have been higher, said Perez.</p> <p>\u201cIf we had the investment rates that we saw during the Reagan administration now, we would have an unemployment rate that would be probably two to three tenths of a percent lower than it currently is,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/05/barack-obama-us-minimum-wage-republicans-tom-perez\">he said</a>. The US unemployment rate is 4.9%. \u201cBut the lingering effect of sequester has a dramatically negative impact on government hiring and it also had on a federal level and on state and local level.\u201d</p> <p>Despite better jobs being created, there are still more than six million Americans who want full time jobs, but are only working part-time at the moment. Additionally, there are 7.5 million Americans who are working more than one jobs to make ends meet.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/11/us-economy-recession-republicans-hillary-clinton-policy\">Republicans have themselves to blame for the slow economy, study says</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57d1c2eee4b013613fffb61f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-08T20:01:40.739Z\">9.01pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Esquire Magazine has added an editor\u2019s note to <a href=\"http://www.esquire.com/news-politics/a37230/donald-trump-esquire-cover-story-august-2004/\">a profile of Donald Trump</a> that the Republican presidential nominee has repeatedly cited as proof that he never supported the invasion of Iraq, calling the characterization inaccurate:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p> The following story was published in the August 2004 issue of Esquire.

My friend and I were some of the only women in the room.  I was feeling nervous.  I was a senior in college.  I wasn\u2019t sure how well I\u2019d do.  And while we\u2019re waiting for the exam to start, a group of men began to yell things like: \u2018You don\u2019t need to be here.\u2019 And \u2018There\u2019s plenty else you can do.\u2019 It turned into a real \u2018pile on.\u2019 One of them even said: \u2018If you take my spot, I\u2019ll get drafted, and I\u2019ll go to Vietnam, and I&amp;#39;ll die.\u2019 And they weren\u2019t kidding around.  It was intense.  It got very personal.  But I couldn\u2019t respond.  I couldn\u2019t afford to get distracted because I didn\u2019t want to mess up the test.  So I just kept looking down, hoping that the proctor would walk in the room.  I know that I can be perceived as aloof or cold or unemotional.  But I had to learn as a young woman to control my emotions.  And that\u2019s a hard path to walk.  Because you need to protect yourself, you need to keep steady, but at the same time you don\u2019t want to seem \u2018walled off.\u2019 And sometimes I think I come across more in the \u2018walled off\u2019 arena.  And if I create that perception, then I take responsibility.  I don\u2019t view myself as cold or unemotional.  And neither do my friends.  And neither does my family.

Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump appeared back-to-back on TV Wednesday night to take questions about foreign policy, veterans\u2019 affairs and, in Clinton\u2019s case, her emails. </p> <p>Clinton was criticized for not getting to her points quickly enough for the tight format. Trump was criticized for not having any points to make, instead ordering \u201coff his familiar campaign menu of word salads\u201d, as Guardian national security editor Spencer Ackerman writes: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>He <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/kyleblaine/donald-trump-lies-that-he-opposed-iraq-war-from-beginning-an?utm_term=.wt2E7Y2rwP\">lied about opposing the Iraq war</a>, criticized Obama\u2019s 2011 withdrawal and repeated his now-boilerplate advocacy of stealing Iraq\u2019s oil \u2013 a measure that he evidently believes would require a minimal force presence, despite the certainty that the well-armed locals might have a problem with their principal source of wealth being plundered by a foreign power.</p> <p>Speaking before an audience of veterans, Trump unexpectedly attacked the current generation of generals and flag officers. The current senior officer corps has been \u201creduced to rubble\u201d, Trump said, and were \u201cembarrassing for our country\u201d. While previously Trump had said he <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/11/13/the-remarkably-unappealling-anger-of-donald-trump/\">knew better than the generals</a> about fighting Isis, this time he intimated that he\u2019d get \u201cdifferent generals\u201d \u2013 a habit more typical of caudillos than American presidents.</p> <p>He followed up by saying his ultimate plan to defeat Isis would be some parts of his still-unspecified plan, and some parts of his unspecified generals\u2019 unspecified plan. He waved away his lack of specifics for a war in which 5,000 US troops are currently serving as not wishing to \u201cbroadcast\u201d his plans to the enemy.</p> </blockquote> <p>Read the full piece here:</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/08/for-clinton-a-skirmish-with-history-from-trump-an-ambush-of-the-facts\">For Clinton, a skirmish with history.

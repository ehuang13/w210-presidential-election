[
  "<p>On Thursday night the US presidential election sparked two remarkable political speeches that in different ways illuminate our times. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\" title=\"\">Donald Trump</a> turned up the ampage on the conspiracy of a \u201ctotally corrupt political establishment\u201d . False, unsubstantiated accusations about his sexual misdemeanours, he said, were being hurled at him by a corporate media \u201cthey\u201d controlled. He was at his most extravagant yet.</p> <p>There was \u201cno lie that they won\u2019t tell, to hold their prestige and power at your expense\u201d. Crooked Hillary, who should be locked up, was at the centre of it. \u201cThe claims are preposterous, ludicrous, and defy truth, common sense and logic.\u201d Yes, these untruths hurt. But he was going to take it and rebut the lies \u201cat an appropriate time\u201d for the \u201cgreat movement\u201d he represented, which was going to take America back from the elite.</p> <p>For all its energy and hyperbole, it was unconvincing. It was a speech whose premise you could only buy if belonging to the same Trump bubble. It was sounding off \u2013 a raging in public that may offer the person raging some relief but does not persuade anybody not in the same bubble. If he found the accusations hurtful, so what? For anybody outside the \u201cmovement\u201d, he has amply deserved the opprobrium.</p> <p>A little later, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/14/michelle-obama-speech-transcript-donald-trump\" title=\"\">Michelle Obama spoke</a>. She too was energetic, passionate and partisan \u2013 but she got beyond her bubble in a way that eludes Trump. Against his litany of accusations she chose to counter his rage by couching hers within a marshalled argument. Her propositions were as value laden, certainly, as Trump\u2019s and intended to be as lethal as anything he has said. But she framed her attack in a way no one could gainsay.</p> <p>There are values, in particular the way women expect to be spoken about by men, that are foundational in a civilised society, she said. What Trump had said about women, and chosen to defend as \u201clocker room\u201d talk, had crossed a line. \u201cThis is not normal. This is not politics as usual. This is disgraceful. It is intolerable.\u201d</p> <p>It had hit her more than she expected, she said. In explaining why, she set out a series of feminist propositions about how the psychic wrong of being objectified as no more than a body gets under a woman\u2019s skin&#xa0;even as she tries to shrug it off. But she did&#xa0;so&#xa0;in language that was measured. Trump had put attitudes that should be stone-dead back at the heart of the national conversation. Her audience was spellbound. And when she said she found it personally hurtful, exposing her vulnerability, she achieved an empathy that Trump\u2019s same admission could never do. She was pained by the betrayal of universal values and hard-won gains; his \u201churt\u201d was because his past words were catching up with him. Different leagues.</p> <p>American conservatism\u2019s morphing from the language of rationality \u2013 presenting traditional conservative concerns about the size of government and its impact on economic incentives and morality \u2013 into a language of rage and conspiracy is one of the defining realities of our age. I profoundly disagree with conservative thinkers such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/mar/05/new-right-ayn-rand-marx\" title=\"\">Ayn Rand</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2006/nov/17/guardianobituaries.politics\" title=\"\">Milton Friedman</a>, Robert Nozick and Leo Strauss, but at least they mounted reasoned arguments based on first principles.</p> <p>You respect them even as you argue back. The issues are never going to be settled conclusively: it is impossible to found a society entirely on libertarian individualism; but equally to overstress the role of the public realm in securing the common good has parallel hazards. You respect your intellectual or political adversary because you know you don\u2019t hold a monopoly on truth \u2013 and if they are any good, they feel the same way. Battle is joined, and if common ground emerges you are ready to acknowledge it .</p> <p>Most politicians of left and right in advanced democracies feel similarly. Conviction and personal life stories have led to a series of decisions that have got them elected as liberals or conservatives. But if they have any self-knowledge they know that their opponents have their own integrity and want outcomes that promote human betterment and merit respect. There may even be issues on which common cause can be made.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Truth no longer matters. What counts is whether a statement feels true</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The right\u2019s collapse into rage makes these ground rules of democratic politics and political argument impossible. What is Donald Trump doing demanding that Hillary Clinton go to jail? Or conniving in his supporters wearing \u201cTrump that bitch\u201d T-shirts at his rallies? Or wildly insisting he is the object of an elite conspiracy that is intent on gerrymandering votes to produce the result it wants? It goes beyond wild disproportionality into fantasy and delusion. It makes the mutual respect on which democratic politics is founded impossible.</p> <p>Rage is absolutist. It wants to eliminate opponents, not argue with them. It justifies the gridlock and close down of government. It refuses to look for democratic compromises. It is narcissistic and wholly self-regarding, fuelled by being part of a closed belief system. It cannot accept any evidence that challenges the view that it is surrounded by conspiracy. Truth no longer matters. What counts is whether a statement <em>feels</em> true.</p> <p>What fuels the rage is in part the stagnation of blue-collar and lower middle-class male earnings. But a politician such as Trump did not have to debase the US\u2019s political coinage by choosing to represent this constituency in the way that he has. His \u201cmovement\u201d does need not to betray American values to the extent he has. The legacy of lashing out at every American institution won\u2019t disappear even if Trump loses \u2013 it will continue to poison the well.</p> <p>There are echoes of this in Britain. The hard Brexiters live in the same delusional hard right bubble as Trump, treating criticism in the same way \u2013 an elite conspiracy to obstruct the popular will. There is no rationality about the EU, just rage. The consequence is analogous to civil war in both countries \u2013 a public realm where evidence-based debate becomes ever harder. The Americans are lucky to have a Michelle Obama to remind them of a different kind of politics where anger is channelled into argument.</p> <p>We need to show in both countries that rage is a political, economic and cultural dead end. Hard Brexit will do that, but it may take years for the calamity to become obvious to all. Americans have a chance to do it more quickly next month. Here is hoping they seize the opportunity.</p>",

  "<p>Boris Johnson\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/13/boris-johnson-military-options-against-syrian-regime-being-considered\" title=\"\">suggestion that Britain, the US and other allies are re-examining \u201cmilitary options\u201d </a>in Syria has sharply focused minds on a phenomenon western politicians have spent the last 15 years trying not to think about: post-Soviet Russia\u2019s determined drive to re-establish itself as a major global power and the willingness of its ruthless and tactically astute leader, Vladimir Putin, to employ almost any means, including use of force, to achieve that end.</p> <p>The foreign secretary\u2019s remarks were condemned by Moscow as an attempt to whip up anti-Russian \u201chysteria\u201d and were swiftly disowned by a nervous Downing Street. Johnson\u2019s call for demonstrations outside Russia\u2019s London embassy <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/12/russia-boris-johnson-syria-aleppo-war-crime-russophobic-hysteria\" title=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/12/russia-boris-johnson-syria-aleppo-war-crime-russophobic-hysteria\">invited similar, retaliatory action</a> against British interests in Moscow. The gaffe underlined his inexperience and lack of judgment.</p> <p>But on Syria\u2019s plight, and particularly on war crimes allegedly committed during the relentless \u201cpulverising\u201d of Aleppo, Johnson had a point. His comments served to highlight the much bigger strategic, security and diplomatic problem: what to do about Russia.</p> <p>Military options are indeed being discussed again in Washington, from where Britain usually takes its cue. The key question is no longer how best to remove the Syrian dictator, Bashar al-Assad. It is how to stop the Russian military, Assad\u2019s main backer, which is held responsible, directly or indirectly, for numerous lethal aerial attacks against civilians, hospitals and schools, including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/19/syria-ceasefire-is-over-says-countrys-military\" title=\"\">last month\u2019s destruction of a UN aid convoy</a>.</p> <p>So furious was John Kerry, the US secretary of state, at what he saw as Moscow\u2019s deliberate sabotage of the latest Syria ceasefire that he broke off bilateral talks with Moscow. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/25/russia-accused-war-crimes-syria-un-security-council-aleppo\" title=\"\">Samantha Power, US ambassador to the UN, accused Russia of \u201cbarbarism\u201d</a>. But repeating a pattern of behaviour familiar in Ukraine, Georgia and other crises, an unabashed Putin refused to back down. On the contrary, he rapidly upped the ante.</p> <p>Within days of Kerry\u2019s move and official leaks that the White House was considering cruise missile strikes on Syrian military airstrips, the Russian defence ministry warned that Russia had deployed advanced S-300 and S-400 ground-to-air missiles in Syria. Any US bombing raids would be deemed threatening to Russian military personnel, who would respond accordingly. Moscow also <a href=\"http://uatoday.tv/news/russia-builds-up-forces-in-syria-reuters-782194.html\" title=\"http://uatoday.tv/news/russia-builds-up-forces-in-syria-reuters-782194.html\">doubled supplies to the Assad</a> regime\u2019s war effort.</p> <p>Almost simultaneously, Putin scrapped a US-Russia agreement to reprocess excess plutonium to prevent its use in nuclear weapons and two other nuclear cooperation agreements. The deployment of short-range, nuclear-capable Iskander-M missiles in Kaliningrad, the Russian enclave in eastern Europe bordering Nato members Poland and Lithuania, was confirmed. And, not coincidentally perhaps, massive civil defence exercises were held inside Russia, in apparent preparation for a nuclear war.</p> <p>Just in case Washington had not understood how serious Russia was, officials also declared Putin was considering reopening military bases in Cuba and Vietnam. It is hard to think of a more defiant, taunting message to the Obama administration than conjuring the spectre of a new Cuban missile crisis.</p> <p>Demonstrating that Moscow has other strategic partnerships that could be turned against Washington, Russian ships joined military exercises with China around the disputed South China Sea islands. It is also busily building up alliances with emerging powers such as South Africa and India, notably at this weekend\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.firstpost.com/business/brics-summit-in-goa-from-defence-to-food-deals-india-and-russia-push-ahead-to-reshape-trade-ties-3050782.html\" title=\"http://www.firstpost.com/business/brics-summit-in-goa-from-defence-to-food-deals-india-and-russia-push-ahead-to-reshape-trade-ties-3050782.html\">Brics summit in Goa</a>, while courting traditional American allies such as Turkey and the Philippines.</p> <p>Sergei Lavrov, Putin\u2019s veteran foreign minister, was blunt. Russia would not be told what to do. Like it or not, it was once again a global force to be reckoned with. \u201c<a href=\"http://www.mid.ru/en/foreign_policy/news/-/asset_publisher/cKNonkJE02Bw/content/id/2485001\" title=\"\">Washington... cannot use the language of force, sanctions and ultimatums</a> with Russia while continuing to selectively cooperate with our country only when it benefits the US,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Last week, Putin himself took to the airwaves to deliver a similar message. Responding to a formal accusation by the US government that Moscow had launched a cyber warfare-style campaign to \u201cinterfere with the US election process\u201d, <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-idUSKCN12C27H\" title=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-idUSKCN12C27H\">Putin denied</a> he was trying to help the Republican presidential candidate, Donald Trump.</p> <p>\u201cThey started this hysteria, saying this [hacking] is in Russia\u2019s interests, but this has nothing to do with Russia\u2019s interests,\u201d Putin said. His government would work with whoever won the election \u201cif, of course, the new US leader wishes to work with our country\u201d.</p> <p>This latter statement was chilling. Putin was plainly saying that Russia, no longer the post-Communist economic and military basket-case it briefly became under his predecessor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/apr/23/russia1\" title=\"\">Boris Yeltsin</a>, does not need or seek American approval or agreement to take action in its own interests in Syria or anywhere else. If Barack Obama or his successor want to do business in future, then Russia must be treated as a global equal, not as an irritant or a spoiler or mere regional actor.</p> <p>Such assertions flatly contradict Washington\u2019s preferred narrative, namely that the west \u201cwon\u201d the cold war and Russia is no longer a great power. Hence, perhaps, American slowness to come to terms with a changed situation. But the grave implications of unravelling US-Russia relations are slowly sinking in across Europe, as always the nervous pig stuck in the middle. The German magazine<em> </em><a href=\"http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/syria-war-became-conflict-between-usa-and-russia-and-iran-a-1115681.html\" title=\"http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/syria-war-became-conflict-between-usa-and-russia-and-iran-a-1115681.html\"><em>Spiegel</em> recently suggested that Syria was the most prominent battlefront</a> in a new global war, more perilous even than the Cold War because the old power structures and rules are no longer in place.</p> <p>Yet any sort of western consensus over what to do about Russia remains elusive. Opinion is divided in Europe, where many countries are dependent on Russian energy supplies. Germany\u2019s Social Democrats, for example, oppose sanctions on Moscow in addition to those imposed after Putin\u2019s 2014 annexation of Crimea. Poland and the Baltic states, threatened by the Kaliningrad deployment and border troop build-ups, demand a more muscular Nato stance. Neutral Finland and Sweden, troubled by Russian air and sea incursions, edge ever closer to the western alliance.</p> <p>The so-called Minsk group is due to make another attempt to advance a Ukraine settlement. But nobody is optimistic; the situation there is steadily deteriorating. Following the bad-tempered <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/11/vladimir-putin-declines-french-offer-of-syria-only-talks-in-paris\" title=\"\">cancellation last week of Putin\u2019s visit to France</a>, EU heads of state are also due to meet on Thursday with Syria-related sanctions against Russia on the agenda. This, too, may prove a non-event.</p> <p>In Britain, meanwhile, as Johnson splutters impotently and contradicts himself over no-fly zones, the Labour party claims against all known facts that there is some kind of equivalence between Russian and US actions in Syria. If opposition fighters vacate Aleppo (handing victory to Assad), <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/12/stop-the-war-coalition-protest-russian-embassy\" title=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/12/stop-the-war-coalition-protest-russian-embassy\">Labour suggests</a>, all will be well. Its script could have been written by the Kremlin.</p> <p>The challenge presented by Russia is one of the biggest facing the next US president. Some analysts say Putin is taking advantage of Obama\u2019s lame duck status to create \u201cfacts on the ground\u201d in Syria. The Russian president is said to anticipate a further deterioration in bilateral relations if Hillary Clinton wins. The two have a history of personal dislike, dating back to Clinton\u2019s time as secretary of state. \u201cShe says she sees in him a cold-blooded, self-enriching KGB agent and a bully; he remembers how she appeared to encourage street protests against him in 2011,\u201d said analyst <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2016-10-11/i-m-an-anti-putin-russian-and-clinton-makes-me-nervous\" title=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2016-10-11/i-m-an-anti-putin-russian-and-clinton-makes-me-nervous\">Leonid Bershidsky</a>. Speaking in August, Clinton described Putin as <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/08/25/hillary-clintons-alt-right-speech-annotated/\" title=\"\">\u201cthe grand godfather of this global brand of extreme nationalism</a>\u201d \u2013 lumping him with Trump, German anti-immigrant xenophobes and hard-right populists such as France\u2019s Marine Le Pen.</p> <p>Assuming Trump loses, a Clinton administration has three possible courses of action. One is to acknowledge Putin has a fair case when he argues that the US, the EU and Nato ignored or trampled on Russia\u2019s interests in the post-Soviet era, accept that Crimea is lost and that Assad stays in power for the time being, and focus in future on pragmatic, one-off \u201ctransactional\u201d deals where interests coincide.</p> <p>A second approach is a longer-term variation on the first, containing Russia wherever possible, maintaining or toughening sanctions, and waiting for the departure of Putin and what some economists say will be Russia\u2019s inevitable economic collapse as its oil and gas runs out and international ostracism, corruption and a declining working-age population take their toll. The plan would be to re-set relations (again) with a post-Putin \u201cnew Russia\u201d.</p> <p>The third possibility, and one that seems most likely at this point given Clinton\u2019s policy positions, is that the US will move on to the front foot and purposefully confront Russia directly, not only in Syria but on a number of other areas, backed up by the possible use of military force.</p> <p>This prospect is fraught with danger, especially since Putin has shown repeatedly that he reacts badly to diktats and threats. When cornered, Putin does not back down. He escalates. He does not have a domestic electorate, critical parliament or independent media scrutiny to worry about. He disdains international opinion and international law. Despite last month\u2019s bust-up, Kerry and Lavrov met again on Saturday to try to agree another Syria ceasefire. But a lasting solution looks as far away as ever. If the past 15 years show anything, it is that Putin, like a marauding Red Army tank, has no reverse gear. Much in the Middle East, Europe and beyond now rides on what an untested Clinton, with an awful lot to prove, decides is the best way forward.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b73adb0e7201111a5beb721979d9c87db20b43f3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b73adb0e7201111a5beb721979d9c87db20b43f3/0_72_4096_2457/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pro-Russian rebel troops withdraw from the front line near Donetsk, Ukraine\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\"><br>Pro-Russian rebel troops withdraw from the front line about 50km from Donetsk, Ukraine, as part of the demilitarisation agreement signed in September.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alexander Ermochenko/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>SYRIA</h2> <p>Barack Obama\u2019s decision not to intervene militarily after Bashar al-Assad used chemical weapons left the door open for Russia. By going to the aid of his long-term ally Assad, Putin saw a chance to expand Russian influence in the Middle East at American expense and secure military bases on Syria\u2019s Mediterranean coast. Fighting Islamic State terrorism was a secondary consideration. The US insists Assad must go, but its limited commitment so far means the non-jihadist opposition continues to struggle while civilians bear the brunt of the violence.</p> <h2>UKRAINE</h2> <p>Despite the US-orchestrated imposition of international sanctions on Russia, Putin shows no sign of reversing his 2014 annexation of Crimea. Moscow\u2019s not-so-secret support for separatists in eastern Ukraine opposing the pro-western government in Kiev continues unabated, with renewed fighting reported last week. Peace efforts led by Germany in the so-called Minsk group have stalled. Given the US believes it is upholding an important principle of international law, a future Clinton administration is unlikely to recognise Russian-made \u201cfacts on</p> <p>the ground\u201d.</p> <h2>THE BALTIC FRONT<br><br></h2> <p>The deployment of Russian nuclear-capable missiles in Kaliningrad, the isolated enclave it controls on Poland\u2019s and Lithuania\u2019s border, is the latest move in a war of nerves along Europe\u2019s eastern flank. The Baltic sea has also become a contested area as Russian submarines and aircraft test western reactions. Nato has beefed up its defences, and Britain has pledged its support. But the uncomfortable question remains: would an American president</p> <p>go to war to defend Estonia?</p> <h2>CYBER <br>WARFARE<br></h2> <p>The US has formally accused Russia of launching a hacking campaign to disrupt the American presidential electoral process. The suspicion is that Putin, who has been praised by Donald Trump, wants Hillary Clinton defeated and the credibility of the election result put in doubt. Trump has already claimed the poll is fixed against him. Putin denies involvement. But the affair resembles previous cyber attacks on countries that were blamed on government-backed Russian hackers.</p> <h2>THE UNITED NATIONS<br></h2> <p>The US and Putin\u2019s Russia have clashed repeatedly in the UN Security Council, most recently over Moscow\u2019s veto of a resolution demanding an immediate halt to the bombing of Aleppo. The standoff has raised wider concerns about the effectiveness of the UN system when permanent members appear permanently at odds and its aid convoys are blown up. Russia is accused by the US of ignoring international law and of possible war crimes, and there are moves to refer it to the International Criminal Court.</p>",

At least one Trump supporter at a rally in Cincinnati on Friday was <a href=\"http://www.bostonglobe.com/news/politics/2016/10/15/donald-trump-warnings-conspiracy-rig-election-are-stoking-anger-among-his-followers/LcCY6e0QOcfH8VdeK9UdsM/story.html?event=event25\">quoted by the Boston Globe</a> as saying that if Clinton is elected, \u201cI hope we can start a coup.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to have a revolution and take them out of office, if that\u2019s what it takes,\u201d the supporter said.</p> <p>At a rally for Republican vice-presidential candidate Mike Pence <a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/card/pence-revolution-rally-goer-dont-say-n664776\">on Thursday</a>, a woman from the audience told the candidate she, too, would rather take action than allow a Democrat to win. \u201cI don\u2019t want this to happen \u2013 but I will tell you for me, personally, if Hillary Clinton gets in,\u201d she warned, \u201cI\u2019m ready for a revolution because we can\u2019t have her in.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want \u2013 don\u2019t say that,\u201d Pence replied. </p> <p>Noting a history of violence at Trump rallies by his supporters, some online observers took Clarke\u2019s call for \u201cpitchforks and torches\u201d seriously, asking whether he was inciting violence and whether his comments constituted sedition against the government. His remarks also raised concerns that it was inappropriate for a law enforcement official famous for his \u201claw and order\u201d political views to be calling for citizens to take to the streets.</p> <p>Robert Post, a first amendment expert and the dean of Yale Law School, said Clarke\u2019s comments were \u201chorrible and despicable\u201d but that \u201can American court would view this as venting, basically.\u201d</p> <p>In 1969, the supreme court overturned a Ku Klux Klan leader\u2019s conviction for inciting violence.</p> <p>The Brandenburg case set a high bar: \u201cIt says that you must intentionally be inciting imminent violence, and it has to be likely that there\u2019s going to be violence.\u201d</p> <p>Clarke\u2019s tweet \u201cwould fall far short of that test\u201d, Post said. </p> <p>Eugene Volokh, a Libertarian second amendment scholar at the University of California Los Angeles school of law, said Clarke\u2019s remarks were clearly intended to be figurative. </p> <p>\u201cWhat do you think Sheriff Clarke is trying to get people to do?

  "<p>They went to Kigali to eliminate hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) and take 0.5C out of future global warming, and the 170 countries that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/oct/15/climate-change-environmentalists-hail-deal-to-limit-use-of-hydrofluorocarbons\" title=\"\">successfully negotiated an amendment to the Montreal protocol treaty</a> agreed to get rid of 90% of them. Not bad for four days and three long nights of hard work.</p> <p>The Kigali deal on HFCs is in fact fiendishly complicated and has taken years to negotiate in various technical and political forums. The final agreement, announced on Saturday morning caps and reduces the use of HFCs in a gradual process beginning in 2019.</p> <p>More than 100 developing countries will start taking action from 2024, a date that has sparked concern from some groups that the changes will be implemented too slowly. A small group of countries, including India, Pakistan and some Gulf states, pushed for and secured a later start \u2013 2028 \u2013 on the grounds that their economies need time to grow. But that is three years earlier than India, the world\u2019s third-worst polluter, had first proposed.</p> <p>The result was achieved thanks to several factors: an ambitious scheme to give countries different time scales in which to phase out HFCs; major chemical and food companies accepting change; the determination of US secretary of state John Kerry to agree a plan before the presidential election; and developing countries agreeing to invest heavily in new technologies.</p> <p>Rich countries, including the US, Japan and Europe, will start phasing out synthetic HFCs in 2019, China in 2024, and India and less ambitious countries in 2028. The deal reflects countries\u2019 differing levels of development. Because nearly all HFCs are made by a handful of giant western chemical companies and are used in air-conditioning units and cooling systems made and sold in rich countries, it was relatively easy for their governments to put pressure on a single global industry. Alternatives such as hydrocarbons, ammonia and CO<sup>2</sup> are widely available, safe, approved and on the market.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"949bb4d70e188b88e38714c31e42e656e9688175\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/949bb4d70e188b88e38714c31e42e656e9688175/0_250_2126_1275/1000.jpg\" alt=\"HFCs are mainly used in air-conditioning systems in rich countries.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">HFCs are mainly used in air-conditioning systems in rich countries.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dimitra Louvrou/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Worldwide use of HFCs has soared in the past decade as rapidly growing countries such as China and India adopted air-conditioning in homes, offices and cars. But HFC gases are thousands of times more destructive to the climate than carbon dioxide, and scientists say their growing use threatens to undermine the Paris accord, agreed last year by 195 countries.</p> <p>The deal will make little difference to rich countries. The EU had already started to phase out HFCs and since 2011 had banned their use in cars. Many global food and drink companies \u2013 Coca Cola, Pepsico and Unilever among them \u2013 have already started to replace fluorinated gases with climate-friendly and natural refrigerants, which are more energy-efficient and can save money.</p> <p>The new agreement is welcomed by many chemical and manufacturing companies because it gives them green kudos and market advantage over inferior products made in poor countries.</p> <p>But it was much harder for India, China and other developing countries to strike a deal. Their companies have relied on old refrigeration and coolant technologies, and will now have to invest in R&amp;D and upgrade or replace factories and equipment.</p> <p>Just as in wider climate talks, they accepted that they are part of the problem and may be on track to become the main HFC users, but insisted that, like climate change itself, this is primarily a western problem foisted on them.</p> <p>The deal keeps the Paris agreement on track and is a vital step towards reducing global emissions. Coming on the heels of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/oct/06/aviation-emissions-agreement-united-nations\" title=\"\">a new deal to cap aviation emissions</a>, and just weeks before the shipping industry sets about cleaning up its act and UN climate talks resume, it is overwhelmingly positive.</p> <p>But the Kigali meeting need never have happened. HFCs were widely recognised as powerful greenhouse gases many years ago, and though governments deliberately missed the chance to eliminate them in 1987, they agreed in the Montreal Protocol to phase out CFCs and protect the ozone layer.</p> <p>The ozone hole is slowly recovering, and HFCs are now seen as just a small part of the climate change problem. If only it took just a few nights of negotiations to eliminate fossil fuels, too.</p>",
  "<p>What if the United States went to war and nobody here even noticed? The question is absurd, isn\u2019t it?

While it\u2019s true that the US has launched drone strikes on al-Qaida targets in Yemen for years, sometimes killing civilians and even US citizens, this particular military engagement has the potential to drag the US straight into a protracted and escalating conflict. And, as everyone knows, America has an uncanny ability to enter protracted and escalating military conflicts.</p> <p>Yet we\u2019ve heard absolutely nothing about this from our presidential candidates.</p> <p>If we investigated, we would find that the Pentagon justified this attack as retaliation. Last week, missiles were fired on two separate occasions at another navy destroyer off of Yemen\u2019s southern coast. Those missiles fell harmlessly into the water, but they were enough of a provocation that the navy responded with its own bombardment.</p> <p>But we would also find that immediately prior to those incidents, on Saturday 8 October, a 500lb laser-guided US-made bomb was dropped on a funeral procession by the US-sponsored Saudi-led coalition fighting the rebels who, the Saudis say, are backed by Iran.

Will she merely continue Obama\u2019s Yemen strategy, which has not only failed to end the war but could also soon escalate it? The prevailing wisdom among many Democrats has been to focus first on defeating Donald Trump before moving on to what\u2019s next, but that\u2019s no longer fair to voters nor, really, to the people of Yemen.

Who can unify the party of Abraham Lincoln? Who can avoid a historic fourth consecutive defeat in the election of 2020? </p> <p>Much depends on whether 2016 has an effect on the Senate, where Democrats stand a strong chance of taking control, and on the House, which may now be in play. The maverick businessman has already threatened to dispute the election\u2019s result, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/14/us/politics/trump-election-rigging.html\">claiming the election is rigged</a>, and already lashed out at moderate Republicans for not backing him.</p> <p>\u201cNo one knows what\u2019s going to be left of the party on November 9,\u201d said <a href=\"http://www.wtmj.com/charlie-sykes\">Charlie Sykes</a>, an influential conservative radio talkshow host. \u201cRepublican officials I\u2019ve talked to have gone beyond anger to a sense of anguish about the future of the party,\u201d he said. </p> <p>\u201cThe damage that Trump has done will not end on November 8. I don\u2019t think any Republicans really know what a post-Trump party looks like.

I think that challenge is one that can be addressed post-election in very short order.\u201d</p> <p>But that shrinking population is not going quietly. The hard core of Trump\u2019s support remains defiant and vociferous and now feels under siege. At a rally in Cincinnati, Ohio, this week, his supporters were fuelled by disdain towards a party establishment that they saw as trying to drag their candidate down.</p> <p>\u201cThey are scared because he is going to stop the bullshit,\u201d said a man who declined to give his last name but said he was called Scott, and had traveled from Aurora, Indiana. He called Ryan \u201ca spineless moron\u201d and defended Trump. \u201cHillary\u2019s pulling shit that people have been put in prison for years for,\u201d he said. \u201cTrump kisses some woman on the cheek 30 years ago and Paul Ryan says, \u2018I\u2019m not going to support him any more. I\u2019m not going to defend him anymore.\u2019 He didn\u2019t want to defend him from day one.\u201d</p> <p>Anna Rigdon, wearing a shirt saying, \u201cTrump Pence: fuck your feelings\u201d, expressed similar thoughts. She thought politicians who had backed away from Trump \u201cshould be ashamed\u201d and singled out Ryan and \u201cthe Bush family\u201d in particular.</p> <p>If Trump loses, Rigdon said, \u201cI think it is Paul Ryan\u2019s fault and the other Republicans who are not standing by Donald Trump.\u201d She added that in Ohio\u2019s contested Senate race, she would not vote for the incumbent Republican, Rob Portman, who recently <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2016-10-13/how-republican-rob-portman-may-derail-the-trump-train-in-ohio\">withdrew his endorsement of Trump</a>.</p> <p>Invariably, Trump supporters rejected surveys that show the Republican nominee facing a catastrophic loss. Linda Hernandez, a middle-aged Hispanic woman wearing a \u201cDeplorables for Trump\u201d shirt, said: \u201cI don\u2019t believe the polls. I believe that the liberal media is controlling everyone\u2019s minds.\u201d</p> <p>The danger for the Republicans is that, should Trump lose, voters who have not believed the polls and the media will conclude that the party itself betrayed them. Instead of learning lessons, party members fear, Trump\u2019s supports will believe they were stabbed in the back, as Trump has insinuated at rallies. </p> <p>At least three factions of the party will struggle for control: ideologues led by Ryan, an establishment embodied by former presidents George HW and George W Bush (neither of whom endorsed Trump), and a so-called \u201cBreitbart wing\u201d, led by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/26/steve-bannon-florida-registered-vote-donald-trump\">Steve Bannon</a> of the rightwing news network, now chief executive of the Trump campaign.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be a war,\u201d said <a href=\"https://twitter.com/rickwtyler?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">Rick Tyler</a>, a political analyst and former spokesperson for the primary runner-up, Ted Cruz. \u201cThe Breitbart wing is going to try to impose its will on the party and its brand of Republicanism, which is win at all costs without a guiding philosophy. The establishment is well funded but represents the status quo. The conservatives are underfunded and underrepresented and lack a leader to convince Americans why it\u2019s a winning strategy and philosophy.\u201d</p> <p>Tyler cited Ryan, <a href=\"http://www.in.gov/gov/2358.htm\">Mike Pence</a>, the Indiana governor who is Trump\u2019s running mate, and Tom Cotton, a senator from Arkansas, as potential leaders. But he noted: \u201cRonald Reagan was not obvious. They emerge. They\u2019re not obvious, so I don\u2019t know who they are. You won\u2019t know who they are until they come forward. As we saw with Winston Churchill, great leaders emerge in times of great turmoil.\u201d</p> <p>He also struck a rare optimistic note. \u201cIt\u2019s an exciting time to be a Republican. With turmoil there\u2019s also opportunity. The party could work on a new brand and a new set of leaders.\u201d</p> <p>Others, however, saw no future in Trump\u2019s destructive wake. Asked where the Republican party should go from here, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ttancredo\">Tom Tancredo</a>, a former Republican congressman from Colorado, replied: \u201cTo hell. At least I hope so. If they do go south, the demise of the Republican party is the only good thing that can come of it. It has no relevance philosophically and so it deserves to go.\u201d</p> <p>Tancredo, the head of the Team America political action committee, likened the scenario to the 2004 disaster movie The Day After Tomorrow. \u201cWe have to think about the day after the election and what should we do as conservatives. The major problem trying to have a movement take hold in America is a lack of leader. You have to have someone who can articulate their concerns and inspire people.</p> <p>\u201cI haven\u2019t the foggiest ideas who that may be. I guess they\u2019re yet to be discovered because I can\u2019t name one. I would have said Cruz but he self-destructed plus he\u2019s not charismatic. You need a Reagan.\u201d</p> <p>For the conservative blogger Erick Erickson, the key is rediscovering the party\u2019s moral compass after many defended the indefensible in Trump. \u201cMost important, the Republican party must recommit to a basic principle \u2013 character counts,\u201d he <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/14/opinion/erick-erickson-the-gop-after-donald-trump.html\">wrote in the New York Times</a> on Friday. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0792704cfd9f04af285b5ab44a90905daff76e94\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0792704cfd9f04af285b5ab44a90905daff76e94/127_381_4738_2844/1000.jpg\" alt=\"trump supporters cheer\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The party will survive \u2013 \u2018they always do,\u2019 says the pollster Frank Luntz.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: ddp USA/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There could be light at the end of the tunnel. Clinton, herself deeply unpopular, will be trying to defy political gravity if she runs for a fourth successive Democratic presidential term in 2020. Republicans could also learn from Democrats in 1992 who, after three losses, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/apr/04/democratic-republican-party-bill-clinton-hillary-us-election-2016\">reinvented themselves</a> and swept back into power with Bill Clinton.<br></p> <p>The Republican pollster <a href=\"https://twitter.com/FrankLuntz?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">Frank Luntz</a> saw another historical parallel. \u201cI am expecting a Republican insurrection similar to what happened to the Democrats after George McGovern lost in 1972,\u201d he said. \u201cEvery component of the GOP will be at war with each other. There will be an attempt to unseat Paul Ryan as speaker. You\u2019ll hear \u2018I told you so\u2019 from Ted Cruz and John Kasich.</p> <p>\u201cThe House, which will still be controlled by Republicans, will be at war with the Senate \u2013 which is truly up for grabs. It will be nasty, ugly and very personal. Far more effort will be spent blaming each other than trying to pull together.\u201d </p> <p>Still, Luntz said that Republicans would survive just as Democrats did in the 1970s. \u201cThey always do.\u201d</p> <p>But part of the reckoning may have to be a realisation that Trump\u2019s hostile takeover did not occur in a vacuum. Critics have argued that he merely said, in a crude and explicit way, what many rightwing Republicans have been saying for years in code resulting in racially charged anger, obstruction in Congress and cancer in the body politic. </p> <p>Barack Obama, now at the end of his term, recently articulated the idea <a href=\"http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2016/10/barack-obama-on-5-days-that-shaped-his-presidency.html\">to New York Magazine</a>. \u201cI see a straight line from the announcement of Sarah Palin as the vice-presidential nominee [in 2008] to what we see today in Donald Trump, the emergence of the Freedom Caucus, the Tea Party, and the shift in the center of gravity for the Republican party,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cWhether that changes, I think, will depend in part on the outcome of this election, but it\u2019s also going to depend on the degree of self-reflection inside the Republican party. There have been at least a couple of other times that I\u2019ve said confidently that the fever is going to have to break, but it just seems to get worse.\u201d<br></p>",

You won\u2019t get that if you dump all that liquid at once.\u201d</p> <p>Podesta\u2019s email is timed at 2.50am. Trump has been criticised for tweeting at 3am, but anyway. Good to know that if President Clinton has to take the 3am call, there will be a risotto chef on standby.</p> <p>***</p> <p>Barack Obama is a tough act to follow as an orator but not impossible to beat as a linguist. The language-learning app <a href=\"http://www.babbel.com/\">Babbel</a> asked foreign embassies and expat organisations to rate the president\u2019s attempts at their native tongue. His Spanish is \u201calmost perfect\u201d, according to the Spanish embassy, which awarded him 4 out of 5. He got the same score from the Indonesian embassy, probably due to his childhood in Indonesia.</p> <p>He was awarded 4.5 for Persian, 4 for Swahili, 3.5 for Arabic, Dutch and Greek, 3 for German, 2.5 for Hindi and only 1 for French. The Arab American Institute in Washington said: \u201cWhen you listen to him, you think, \u2018Boy, he really emphasised that second part, the alaikum.\u2019 It\u2019s interesting that even in another language, the president\u2019s signature voice and mannerisms are still prevalent. It\u2019s hard to explain, but his Arabic comes out sounding very Obama-like, as if an Arabic-speaker were to do an impression of the president in Arabic.\u201d</p> <p>And this from the French-American Foundation: \u201cUnfortunately, we cannot give President Obama high marks for his pronunciation. It was nice that he used the French words, but they may as well have been American.\u201d</p> <p>Clinton, as her campaign constantly reminds us, has visited 112 countries, so probably picked up some phrases along the way. Trump is speaking a language of his own already.</p> <p>***</p> <p>Cat woman. Hillary Clinton in San Francisco on Thursday: \u201cThere\u2019s hardly any part of America that he\u2019s not targeted.

There\u2019s also a section devoted to the 19th amendment which, passed by Congress in 1919, gave women the right to vote. </p> <p>What would the ghosts in this place make of #repealthe19th?

But the one piece that got away was a sample ballot from the Iowa caucuses or the New Hampshire primary that had all the presidential candidates listed. (I have an original 1928 election ballot with my great grandfather A S Luntz on it. He was running for justice of the peace. He won.)\u201d</p> <p>If anyone is still looking for ideas what to get Luntz for Christmas, there\u2019s something else. \u201cBut the item I want the most is an Andrew Johnson impeachment ticket from 1867.

  "<p>Executions in Florida and the fate of prisoners on death row will remain on hold after a resounding ruling on Friday from the state\u2019s highest court that the death penalty there is unconstitutional.</p> <p>Capital punishment has been in limbo in the state since a US supreme court <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jan/12/supreme-court-rules-florida-judge-only-death-penalty-sentencing-unconstitutional-capital-punishment-debate\">decision</a> in January 2016 that Florida\u2019s system was unconstitutional because judges had the final say on the death sentence, whereas that power should be held by juries.</p> <p>Now Florida\u2019s supreme court has ruled that a fix that lawmakers attempted in the spring is also unconstitutional.</p> <p>The Florida justices ruled that death sentences cannot be handed down by a jury deciding in the majority, which was the essence of state lawmakers\u2019 spring fix \u2013 the jury must agree unanimously.</p> <p>The legislature\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.mypalmbeachpost.com/news/news/state-regional-govt-politics/could-sentences-of-all-390-on-florida-death-row-be/nrHnb/\">rewriting </a>of the law in May to allow juries to award the death penalty on the basis of a 10-to-2 decision was ruled unconstitutional by the state\u2019s court.</p> <p>Experts declared the decision a major blow to Florida\u2019s death penalty and a further weakening of America\u2019s fraying ties to the principle of capital punishment.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m happy. This is an important ruling. My first reaction is relief that it\u2019s going to require a unanimous decision from a jury to make the ultimate determination of whether or not someone should die,\u201d said Rob Smith, director of the Fair Punishment Project at Harvard law school.</p> <p>The legislature will now be forced back to the drawing board if it wants to rewrite the law again and keep the death penalty going in Florida.</p> <p>It is believed lawmakers will not go into a session where this can happen until next spring, meaning that death sentences, and probably also executions, will continue to be on hold, Smith said.</p> <p>\u201cThis decision confirms everything that we have known for years about the broken death penalty system in Florida,\u201d said Smith. \u201cWhat hits hard is realizing how many millions of dollars have been wasted across Florida for years and how much suffering has been caused to the families of victims who have to come to court over and over again because of overzealous prosecutors who knew that the statute was probably unconstitutional.\u201d</p> <p>The Florida supreme court issued two rulings at the same time on Friday. One held that the rewriting of the statute to allow a majority jury ruling on death was unconstitutional and the second ordered a new sentencing hearing for Timothy Hurst, the condemned murderer at the center of the legal row. </p> <p>Hurst, who has been on Florida\u2019s death row since 2000, could have his sentence commuted to life in prison. The state supreme court has not yet explained whether its ruling will apply to the almost 400 inmates already on Florida\u2019s death row, or only to future cases.</p> <p>Florida\u2019s governor, Rick Scott, declined to comment while he digested the ruling, a statement from his office said.</p> <p>\u201cAll current death sentences in Florida should be commuted to life in prison and this should have been done immediately after the US Supreme Court ruled that Florida\u2019s death penalty statute was unconstitutional in January, 2016,\u201d Mary Anne Franks, professor of law at the University of Miami school of law, wrote to the Guardian in an email.</p> <p>The ruling will be a blow to the already-embattled Florida attorney general, Pam Bondi \u2013 who is caught up in a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/07/donald-trump-donation-pam-bondi-florida-attorney-general\">scandal</a> over whether her decision not to investigate the now-defunct Trump University was in any way connected to presidential candidate Donald Trump\u2019s donation to her re-election campaign.</p> <p>Rob Smith said he believed many given the death sentence in Florida were among \u201cthe most impaired, most broken and most vulnerable\u201d members of society.</p> <p>\u201cAnd yet Florida declares that the death penalty is supposed to be reserved for the worst of the worst,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Florida had been unusual in its system of allowing a judge to decide the death sentence. The jury could make a recommendation but the judge had the final say. The rewriting of the statute in May to change the decision to one made by a jury \u2013 but allowing a majority decision \u2013 also kept Florida among a small minority of states. Most that still have the death penalty require a unanimous jury decision on death.</p> <p>Alabama has the majority jury system but recently <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.al.com/news/birmingham/index.ssf/2016/06/alabama_appeals_court_death_se.html%27\">declared </a>that it is constitutional. Delaware recently <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/03/us/delaware-supreme-court-rules-states-death-penalty-unconstitutional.html?_r=0\">decided</a> that its majority jury system was unlawful and needs to be changed.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a slow process, but the death penalty is gradually dying itself across this country,\u201d Jeff Kirchmeier, professor of law at City University of New York school of law, said.</p> <p>\u201cFlorida has had the death penalty for decades and they are still having problems getting it right. I would like states like these to realize that there are other punishments that are just as effective as the death penalty,\u201d he added.</p>",

Referring to the second presidential debate in St Louis, he said: \u201cI\u2019m standing at my podium and she walks in front of me, she walks in front of me and when she walks in front of me, believe me, I wasn\u2019t impressed.\u201d Later, in Charlotte, he added of his opponent that \u201cshe was the most corrupt person to ever seek the presidency of the United States and her specialty has been, as you see over the years, it\u2019s character assassination\u201d.</p> <p>The Republican nominee eventually reverted to standard lines from his primary campaign after his teleprompter broke down on Friday night at a rally in Charlotte. Trump laid the devices on the stage before returning to old chestnuts, including his attack on the Obama administration\u2019s concern over climate change. \u201cObama thinks global warming is our biggest threat. I happen to think it\u2019s nuclear warming,\u201d Trump said. He also went to jab at former rival Jeb Bush, using the epithet \u201clow energy\u201d while going on a tirade about primary opponents who signed the RNC pledge to support the eventual nominee but are now not backing Trump.</p> <p>The day after Trump <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/14/look-at-her-i-dont-think-so-trumps-defence-is-to-demean-his-accusers\">spoke in ominous tones</a> about global elites and Hillary Clinton meeting \u201cin secret with international banks,\u201d President Barack Obama <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/14/politics/obama-cleveland-trump-come-on-man/\">bashed those comments</a> in a campaign trip to Cleveland. \u201cThis is a guy who spent all his time hanging around trying to convince everybody he was a global elite,\u201d Obama said, laughing. \u201cTalking about how great his buildings are, how luxurious and how rich he is and flying around everywhere. All he had time for was celebrities and now suddenly he\u2019s acting like he\u2019s a populist out there.

  "<p>Could national populism have reached its high-water mark in western politics. Perhaps globally? It may be too early to say, but some signs point to a pushback against rampant xenophobia, bigotry and the ruinous fascination with strongmen. The indications are fragile, but without doubt they are there.</p> <p>Take the US, Germany and France. Donald Trump has had a more successful bid for the presidency than anyone could have imagined a year ago, but his campaign now seems on the wane, damaged by Republican defections and his ramblings on women. The political death of Angela Merkel has been pronounced many times since the 2015 refugee crisis but the chancellor, arguably Europe\u2019s most forceful voice on inclusiveness, simply has no obvious challenger ahead of Germany\u2019s 2017 election. As France heads towards primaries next month, it\u2019s a centrist figure, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/14/alain-juppe-france-prophet-happiness-presidential-wows-rally-crowd\">Alain Jupp\u00e9</a> (not Nicolas Sarkozy, who has embraced far-right themes) who leads the polls. This makes it more likely that Marine Le Pen will be soundly beaten in the second round of next year\u2019s presidential election (which she is all but guaranteed to reach).</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It might be that populists have over-reached, or that memories of a dark past have come to the fore</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Such signals have global significance. The US remains the single most powerful democracy in the world. A Hillary Clinton victory in November would mean an entirely different global environment to the one that would emerge if the US were to end up with a presidency of the type imagined in the 2004 Philip Roth novel, The Plot Against America, in which the pilot Charles Lindbergh defeats Roosevelt in the 1940 election.</p> <p>Germany and France might form an unbalanced couple, but they stand at the heart of European politics: what happens in their elections will largely define what can be salvaged of the EU project \u2013 arguably much more than Brexit negotiations will do. Britain\u2019s current political travails are a seen as a side show in Europe at the moment.</p> <p>Elsewhere on the continent, there are yet more signs of pushback. In central Europe, often described as a hotbed of parochialism and intolerance, illiberal politicians aren\u2019t entirely having their way. This month Poland\u2019s nationalist, ultraconservative government had to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2016/oct/05/poland-signals-u-turn-total-abortion-ban-protests-video-report\">backtrack on plans to curtail abortion rights</a> after thousands of women protested on the streets. And Hungary\u2019s authoritarian prime minister, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/13/hungary-future-europe-far-right-viktor-orban\">Viktor Orb\u00e1n</a>, suffered a serious setback when his referendum on EU migrant quotas failed because of low voter turnout. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/02/hungarian-vote-on-refugees-will-not-take-place-suggest-first-poll-results\">The electorate snubbed him</a>.</p> <p>This may be dubbed the era of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/13/boris-johnson-donald-trump-post-truth-politician\">post-truth politics</a> and cynical autocrats, but new forms of resistance to bigotry are also emerging. It may be that national populists have overreached (Trump\u2019s racist and misogynist antics); or that memories of a dark past and the need to avert political catastrophe have come to the fore (Germans wanting to counter the far-right Alternative for Germany, French citizens worried about Le Pen). It may be that groups are rekindling the spirit of democratic mobilisation (Polish women and the anti-Jaros\u0142aw Kaczy\u0144ski grassroots, who are such keen demonstrators). It may be that voter apathy also sends a message about policies that stigmatise outsiders (Hungary).</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/04/the-question-was-stupid-hungarians-on-the-refugee-referendum\">'The question was stupid': Hungarians on the refugee referendum</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Does this sound too optimistic? Precisely because there haven\u2019t been many reasons for optimism recently, it\u2019s important not to ignore what is potentially promising. Likewise, it\u2019s important to see how the connections between international affairs and domestic politics may not all play out in the populists\u2019 favour. Authoritarianism has thrown its weight around in recent years, but right now it\u2019s going through a bad patch.</p> <p>Take Russia. Whatever allowances some in the west might have sought to make for Putin in the past, the Syrian tragedy has made this much more difficult. To claim that Russia\u2019s air assault on Aleppo\u2019s population is no different from western interventions against Isis not only flies in the face of documented facts, it smacks of intellectual and moral disorientation.</p> <p>Geopolitics feeds into politics. Which means there is cautious hope to be drawn from the fact that Putin\u2019s Russia currently finds itself more isolated than it ever has been (only Venezuela\u2019s autocratic regime voted alongside Russia in the UN recently). Russia has been an active backer of populists in Europe and in the US. Putin sympathisers now find themselves having to keep awkwardly silent over the scandal unfolding in Syria, or having to repeat a propaganda line that many citizens may find hard to swallow.</p> <p>This is not to say that national populists or their authoritarian backers are about to be defeated or disempowered. The fuel that powers the far right has yet to be exhausted. But from Clinton\u2019s lead to the surprising strength of Europe\u2019s political centre-ground, and with the novelty of Russia being discredited on many fronts, the picture is not just doom and gloom for the democratically minded. If this is an interconnected world, then the pushback against national populism may be stronger than we think.</p>",

The other shows how the US would look if only women voted: almost entirely blue. \u201cIt spawned a hashtag,\u201d says Atwood (who is a frequent poster <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MargaretAtwood\" title=\"\">on Twitter</a>) \u201ccalled #Repealthe19th. The 19th Amendment is what gave women the vote. So there are Trump supporters who want to take&#xa0;the vote away from women.

Second wave, the image. Now it\u2019s about violence and rape and death: we\u2019ve got down to the nitty-gritty.\u201d Earlier this month, when she spoke at&#xa0;the <a href=\"http://www.southbankcentre.co.uk/whatson/festivals-series/london-literature-festival?gclid=CjwKEAjwhILABRDwo8mlqt6ug38SJACNSq_kIM90R5cOL9yG603aGdq-ldofuRvvMooMmaqKp-IJiBoCwW7w_wcB\" title=\"\">Southbank literature festival</a> in London, she talked about \u201cthe most amazingly vicious online abuse\u201d of women. \u201cWhat&#xa0;century are we in?\u201d she&#xa0;asked. \u201cApparently, the 12th.\u201d</p> <p>When The Handmaid\u2019s Tale was published, she says, the novel was reviewed by British critics as an enjoyable fantasy, and by the Canadians with a certain anxiety (\u201cCould it happen here?\u201d). In America, though, there was a sense of: \u201c\u2018How long have we got?\u2019\u201d She sighs. \u201cApparently, not as long as I thought \u2026 With any cultural change there is a push and a pushback. Trump has brought out a huge pushback that was originally against immigrants. Now it has shifted to being very misogynistic, partly because of Hillary Clinton. You have not seen anything like this since the 17th-century witchhunts, quite frankly.\u201d</p> <p>Can you understand the appeal of&#xa0;Trump, I ask? \u201cHe brings out the temper-tantrum-throwing wilful brat in all of us. \u2018Why can\u2019t I do what I want? Why can\u2019t I have what I want? Those other people are stopping me. Those other people have a bigger lollipop that I do, I\u2019m going to take their lollipop away from them.\u2019 But on the other hand, he couples that with the most amazing whining.\u201d She mentions the complaint by Trump that his microphone malfunctioned during the first televised presidential debate. (\u201cRubbish.\u201d)</p> <p>\u201cI tell you this,\u201d she continues. \u201cHillary Clinton is a better man than Trump. She has more connection to the traditional male virtues. She has comported herself in a much more manly fashion. Ask any real alpha males that you\u2019ll know and they\u2019ll say of Trump, \u2018This is the guy we&#xa0;didn\u2019t like at school because he was a&#xa0;bully, but as soon as anyone pushed back at him he started to whine.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>What does she think, then, of Clinton\u2019s campaign? \u201cWell, it\u2019s more of a&#xa0;campaign. Trump has taken about 10 different positions on everything, so there is no way of knowing what he really thinks. You actually just don\u2019t know. He will adopt a position depending on what reaction is mirrored back to him. Basically, it\u2019s very close to being a manifestation of a mob: burn them at the stake, screaming and yelling.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"59cd16e301a7d46db8f812312aa7e5e1e88a3828\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/59cd16e301a7d46db8f812312aa7e5e1e88a3828/0_0_1400_2250/622.jpg\" alt=\"Hag-Seed by Margaret Atwood, a retelling of Shakespeare\u2019s The Tempest\" width=\"622\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hag-Seed by Margaret Atwood, a retelling of Shakespeare\u2019s The Tempest.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Penguin</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/oct/30/salem-witch-trials-american-imagination\" title=\"\">the Salem witch trials</a>, then? She proceeds to talk about them: Atwood likes to take a long historical sweep. Her heroes of this tragic episode, dramatised by Arthur Miller in The Crucible, are Rebecca Nurse, who refused to admit that she was a witch and declined to accuse others, meaning she was hanged; and Giles Corey, who refused to plead at his trial, meaning that he was pressed \u2013 that is, crushed by heavy stones until his lungs collapsed and he died. By sacrificing himself thus, and not allowing his case to be tried, his family inherited his property, which otherwise would have been confiscated.</p> <p>However, she says, after a fairly long disquisition on the legal history of 17th-century Massachusetts, this is not at all what the Trump situation is like. \u201cSalem was much more dignified \u2026 Salem at least had rules for the trials.\u201d She hunts around for a better comparison. It\u2019s like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2011/dec/08/favourite-film-night-of-the-hunter\" title=\"\">Night of the Hunter</a>, she says. \u201cRobert Mitchum. Directed by Charles Laughton. Just a great film. At the end they catch this guy who\u2019s been murdering women and has been trying to get hold of some children to kill them too. He is seen off <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t-konY4cHE\" title=\"\">by Lillian Gish</a> playing an old lady in a rocking chair with a shotgun.\u201d (A sudden vision arrives, unbidden, of Atwood in a&#xa0;rocking chair with a shotgun.) \u201cShe peppers him with shot, he gets caught and put in jail and there\u2019s a mob outside who want to lynch him. So the very same Christian, righteous people who have played the virtuous townspeople are now screaming for his blood. This is what it\u2019s like. Those mob scenes at Trump rallies: burn her, lock her up, kill&#xa0;her. They think they are at the wrestling, but let those people out, and&#xa0;you have a lynchmob.\u201d</p> <p>We turn to the scenarios she sketched in the MaddAddam trilogy: a world of internet insecurity, pig-human hybrids, environmental devastation, oil fetishists and complete corporate takeover of states. Do dystopian novels, I wonder, actually do anything? Can they change behaviour? They are, she says, more like weathervanes than guides on averting disaster. \u201cAll dystopian novels are telling you to do is make sure you\u2019ve got a lot of canned goods and a gun.\u201d Do you have canned goods and a gun in Toronto? \u201cI\u2019m too freaking old. I\u2019m probably not going to make it through the zombie apocalypse anyway.\u201d</p> <p>The literary news, as we speak, has been recently all about the \u201cunmasking\u201d by an Italian investigative journalist of the real identity of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/03/the-guardian-view-on-unmasking-elena-ferrante-an-impoverishing-act\" title=\"\">Elena Ferrante</a>, the pseudonymous author of the hugely popular Neapolitan novels. \u201cShe probably went too far in putting out a fake autobiography. Which is like an invitation: expose me,\u201d says Atwood. (She is referring to Frantumaglia, which is about to be published in English \u2013 not an autobiography as such, but a collection of letters, essays, interviews and the like.) \u201cBut she\u2019s not committed a crime. Nor do I feel that she was a bad person to write under a pseudonym. She did what she wanted to do. It worked spectacularly well, and then there are the books. People will read them a bit differently, that\u2019s inevitable. But it doesn\u2019t make them bad books.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"57906cd966d08edc93eb2266720a9918fdda3df9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/57906cd966d08edc93eb2266720a9918fdda3df9/0_0_4005_3080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Margaret Atwood in 1972.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"769\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I used to go on the Greyhound bus with copies of my books in a cardboard box, and give readings in school gymnasiums\u2019 \u2026 Margaret Atwood in 1972.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ron Bull/Toronto Star via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Atwood herself published pseudonymously a bit, when she was young \u2013 in the student magazine, to fill the pages. And she wrote a comic strip under another name in the 1970s. Then there was a skittish review of one of her own books she wrote once, under the not-very-veiled byline of Margarets Atwood, which referred to certain anagrammatic figures: ethnologist Gwaemot R Dratora, the architect Wode M Gratataro, and the profile-writer Greta Warmodota. Invisibility is&#xa0;not her thing: especially when she, and Canadian fellow writers, worked so&#xa0;hard in the 1970s to improve their own visibility. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019m entitled to whinge too much, because it\u2019s my fault. I used to go on the Greyhound bus&#xa0;with copies of my books in a cardboard box, and give readings in school gymnasiums. I\u2019d sell my own books and collect the money, put it in a brown paper envelope and take it back to the publisher.\u201d She looks at me with wide eyes. \u201cWhat sort of a wimp are you? Have you never tramped through the snow with your books in a cardboard box \u2013 on a sled?\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/oct/12/angel-catbird-young-animal-doom-patrol\">The month in comics: Margaret Atwood unleashes an eco-friendly superhero</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The latest book that she is, metaphorically at least, carrying around with her on a sled is neither dystopian nor utopian, but a story based on The Tempest, called <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/oct/06/hag-seed-the-tempest-retold-by-margaret-atwood\" title=\"\">Hag-Seed</a> \u2013 part of a series of&#xa0;Shakespearean reworkings commissioned from writers including Jeanette Winterson and Anne Tyler. In her deft story, Prospero is a director called Felix, deposed from his position as artistic director of an important theatre. Bent on revenge, he stages a version of The&#xa0;Tempest in a prison, and plots his payback. I worry, though, that Prospero is a part often taken on by actors reaching the end of their careers. I hope there\u2019s to be no talk of Atwood\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.bard.org/study-guides/but-this-rough-magic-i-here-abjure\" title=\"\">abjuring magic</a>, or any nonsense like that. No, she tells me. No need to fear. \u201cThe last part actors usually take is Lear.&#xa0;That really makes people cry.\u201d</p> <p>This is very Atwood: nearly everything she says is delivered precisely, and lightly iced with irony, whether she\u2019s being immensely warm, or plunging her dagger into some unfortunate victim.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Hag-Seed by Margaret Atwood is published by Penguin at \u00a316.99.

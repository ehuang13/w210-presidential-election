In 2004, he received a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/feb/04/france.jonhenley\">14-month suspended sentence</a> and was barred from holding elected office for a year over a corrupt 1980s scheme that illegally put workers for Jacques Chirac\u2019s party on the payroll of the Paris town hall.</p> <p>However, the conviction has not so far come back to haunt him. It is accepted that he did not profit personally and instead he is seen as having taken the flak for Chirac.</p> <p>At his campaign headquarters on Paris\u2019s left bank, he stuck by his promise to lead a diverse France that could live together harmoniously. He said his concept of \u201chappy national identity\u201d was clearly not the current reality in France, but a collective aim. </p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not so naive as to think that France is swimming in happiness \u2013 France today is in great difficulty. Economically our unemployment is still very high, particularly among young people, and politically the current leadership has lost all credibility,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the role of a politician is not to bring a message of pessimism and decline, but to share confidence and optimism.\u201d</p> <p>Jupp\u00e9\u2019s take on positive French community relations is an attack on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/07/how-nicolas-sarkozys-presidential-days-came-back-to-haunt-him\">Sarkozy\u2019s hardline brand</a> of national identity politics, focused on immigration and Islam, which has dominated the headlines.

  "<p>Donald Trump raised new questions about whether he would accept the election result on Thursday, less than 12 hours after he used the final presidential debate to declare that he would <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/19/donald-trump-presidential-debate-election-result\">keep the country \u201cin suspense\u201d</a> over whether he would accept the outcome.</p> <p>At a rally in Delaware, Ohio, the Republican candidate said first: \u201cI will totally accept the results of this great and historic presidential election,\u201d before pausing for effect and then adding to cheers and applause: \u201cIf I win.\u201d </p> <p>Later he told the crowd: \u201cOf course I would accept a clear election result, but I would reserve my right to contend or file a legal challenge, in the case of a questionable result.\u201d He did not define what he meant by a clear result. </p> <p>Trump later went on to warn that his opponent Hillary Clinton would \u201cdo anything, including voter fraud\u201d to win. And he claimed that in being asked to accept the integrity of the American electoral process, \u201cI am being asked to waive centuries of legal precedent designed to protect the voters.\u201d </p> <p>Trump\u2019s refusal to endorse the results of the forthcoming election, unheard of in modern American history, ensured <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/20/donald-trump-refuse-concede-election-electoral-college\">the main talking point</a> after the debate was whether the brash businessman had a suitable temperament for the White House.<br></p> <p>It also prompted a collective cringe from many in the Republican political establishment, which is now facing the prospect of losing control of the Senate and even the House because of the drag faced by down-ballot candidates campaigning into the headwinds of their presidential nominee.</p> <p>\u201cTalking about rigged elections with zero evidence is dangerous because it erodes trust without justification and kindles cynicism that undermines self-government,\u201d Senator Ben Sasse of Nebraska, who is not up for election but is an ardent critic of Trump, said in a statement. \u201cOur elections must have integrity, even if the two major party candidates do not.\u201d</p> <p>Senator John McCain of Arizona, who lost to Barack Obama in 2008, said: \u201cI didn\u2019t like the outcome of the 2008 election. But I had a duty to concede, and I did so without reluctance. A concession isn\u2019t just an exercise in graciousness. It is an act of respect for the will of the American people, a respect that is every American leader\u2019s first responsibility.\u201d</p> <p>The animus between Clinton and Trump was clear throughout the debate \u2013 once again, they did not shake hands \u2013 and in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/20/nasty-woman-donald-trump-hillary-clinton\">some of the more heated exchanges</a>, with Clinton accusing Trump of being a \u201ca puppet\u201d of the Russian president, Vladimir Putin.</p> <p>Trump initially appeared more restrained than he had in the two previous debates, arguing forcefully with Clinton over abortion, gun rights and immigration, but over the course of a 90-minute debate in which Clinton repeatedly needled him he gradually returned to form.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/oct/20/presidential-debate-highlights-clinton-and-trumps-final-face-off-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/58aff\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2822379\"            data-video-name=\"Presidential debate highlights: Clinton and Trump's final face-off \u2013\u00a0video\"            data-video-provider=\"Reuters / AP\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-58086051e4b055209adaf6c9\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/10/20/161020Debatesub_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/10/20/161020Debatesub_V4.webm\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/10/20/161020Debatesub.m3u8\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/oct/20/presidential-debate-highlights-clinton-and-trumps-final-face-off-video\">Presidential debate highlights: Clinton and Trump\u2019s final face-off</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Looking increasingly irritable, he locked horns with the unflappable Fox News moderator, Chris Wallace, and repeatedly cut off his Democratic rival \u2013 including, on one occasion, interrupting her mid-sentence with the line: \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/20/nasty-woman-donald-trump-hillary-clinton\">Such a nasty woman</a>.\u201d</p> <p>However, it was Trump\u2019s refusal to accept the outcome of an election he is currently projected to lose that will stand out from the ill-tempered clash on the debate stage on the University of Nevada campus in Las Vegas.</p> <p>Asked if he would accept the outcome of the election, Trump demurred. \u201cI will look at it at the time.

There were sniggers, for example, when Trump insisted: \u201cNobody has more respect for women than I do, nobody.\u201d</p> <p>Asked about the nine women who have come forward to accuse him of the sexually predatory behavior <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/07/donald-trump-leaked-recording-women\">he bragged about in a 2005 video leaked earlier this month</a>, Trump insisted they were all either seeking \u201c10 minutes of fame\u201d or had been somehow orchestrated by Clinton\u2019s campaign. <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/20/donald-trump-sexual-misconduct-tenth-woman-accuser\">A 10th woman made a new groping claim on Thursday</a>.</p> <p>\u201cThose stories are all totally false \u2013 I have to say that,\u201d Trump said. \u201cAnd I didn\u2019t even apologize to my wife who is sitting right here because I didn\u2019t do anything.\u201d</p> <p>Pointing out how Trump has publicly denigrated his accusers, Clinton said: \u201cDonald thinks belittling women makes him bigger.

Well, he definitely knew me.\u201d</p> <p>The third debate was not as one-sided as the opening televised contest between the two candidates, in which Clinton was by most accounts <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/27/debate-clinton-trump-recap-presidential-election-hofstra\">declared the winner</a>. Neither was it as personal as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/10/debate-donald-trump-threatens-to-jail-hillary-clinton\">the second debate</a>, in which the candidates clashed in some of the most brutal exchanges ever seen on a presidential stage.<br></p> <p>However, there was nothing in the last debate that seemed likely to alter the dynamics of the race. </p> <p>There are 20 days left before election day, but Wednesday\u2019s debate was the last occasion both candidates will share a stage, and marked the final stretch in one of the most wildly unpredictable presidential races of modern times.<br></p> <p>It has been one that has been dominated throughout by the former reality TV star, who opened the first primary debate 14 months ago by brazenly declaring \u201cpoliticians are stupid\u201d and threatening to ditch the GOP and run as an independent.</p> <p>His refusal on the debate stage to accept the outcome of the election was a similarly unprecedented move, and perhaps his last throw of the dice.</p> <p>The response at Trump\u2019s rally in Ohio indicated the move had riled and excited his ardent supporters.</p> <p>Sean Ringert of Maryville, Ohio, who was wearing a shirt that proclaimed \u201ckeep calm and carry guns\u201d thought last night\u2019s debate was Trump\u2019s best yet, judging by the portions he watched.</p> <p>Ringert was comfortable with Trump\u2019s unwillingness to concede the election, saying: \u201cI am perfectly fine with that; it\u2019s a great media tactic.\u201d He added: \u201cI think there is going to be voter fraud no matter what and that it\u2019s good to have it in the air.\u201d </p> <p>Ringert insisted that fraud had affected the results of past elections in the United States. \u201cI can point to one: a senatorial election,\u201d he said. The Trump supporter had heard about it on talk radio earlier on Thursday morning but could not remember more details.</p> <p>It is unclear what the impression will be on the wider electorate.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s crazy,\u201d said Nigel Fleming, a 47-year-old musician who stood on the corner of a casino-lined stretch of Fremont Street, upon hearing about Trump\u2019s refusal to accept the outcome of the election. \u201cWhy would he say that? Does he think he\u2019s lost already?\u201d</p>",

The imagined book reports took on some of Trump\u2019s rhetoric, from his campaign slogan, self-promotional tendencies to his disparaging comments about women.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/BillOnFryer/status/789107867274076160\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">I&#39;ve never had a problem finding Waldo, Never.

  "<p>What was one of the most telling moments from the third and final presidential debate? When Donald Trump said Hillary Clinton was \u201csuch a nasty woman\u201d, Guardian columnist Jessica Valenti said in a panel on Wednesday night. \u201cWomen recognized his tone in that sentence and what he really wanted to say.\u201d</p> <p>At Tumblr\u2019s HQ in New York, the roughly 300 people who had gathered to watch Trump and Clinton face off for the last time at a debate watch party co-hosted by Guardian US and WNYC, seemed to agree, with many shouting \u201cNo\u201d and booing in response to Trump\u2019s comment. </p> <p>After the debate, the crowd stuck around to watch Valenti, the Guardian\u2019s Spencer Ackerman and panelists from CNN and WNYC dissect the night\u2019s events in terms of gender, race and foreign policy.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"778a8c3e1a55e384c6829f59f4775feeb491def1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/778a8c3e1a55e384c6829f59f4775feeb491def1/0_384_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tanzania Vega, CNN\u2019s national reporter on race and inequality, Jessica Valenti, staff writer for The Guardian US and Spencer Ackerman, US national security editor for the Guardian.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tanzina Vega, CNN\u2019s national reporter on race and inequality, Jessica Valenti, staff writer for the Guardian US and Spencer Ackerman, US national security editor for the Guardian.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alex Welsh/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Ackerman and Valenti were joined by Tanzina Vega, a national reporter on race and inequality at CNN, and Kai Wright, host of WNYC\u2019s United States of Anxiety podcast and an editor at the Nation, on the panel. </p> <p>The event marked the kick-off of the Guardian\u2019s membership program in the US.

The candidates turned the discussion of race towards guns or \u201cinner cities\u201d as opposed to addressing issues like voter disenfranchisement, voter intimidation or economics, she said. \u201cI\u2019m very surprised in all three debates the words \u2018black lives matter\u2019 have not come up,\u201d Vega added. \u201cNo one has mentioned that or alt-right.\u201d</p> <p>The crowd that watched the debate alongside the panelists clearly favored Clinton over Trump. Two friends and native Tennesseans, Katherine and Catherine, proudly sported Clinton campaign T-shirts at the event, happy to be away from their conservative Republican families. \u201cThey would disown us if they knew we supported her,\u201d Katherine said. In their chatter ahead of the debate, more than one attendee sarcastically asked if there were any Trump supporters in the room.</p> <p>\u201cI got the sense from the room that it\u2019s generally, slightly pro-Hillary,\u201d joked Nicholas Thompson, the panel\u2019s moderator and the editor of NewYorker.com, before asking what Clinton might have done better during the debate. He thought she stumbled on trade, while Wright thought she stumbled on guns.</p> <p>Clinton\u2019s one-liners saying Trump \u201cchoked\u201d or about the Emmys were chosen by the panelists as the most memorable lines. The ultimate favorite, though, was the Democratic nominee\u2019s jab about the situation room.</p> <p>\u201cAnd on the day when I was in the Situation Room, monitoring the raid that brought Osama bin Laden to justice, he was hosting the Celebrity Apprentice,\u201d Clinton said. </p> <p><em>The Guardian is an independent voice in this year\u2019s election.

  "<p>A 10th woman accused Donald Trump of unwanted sexual contact on Thursday morning, just hours after the presidential candidate angrily renewed his denials of ever having inappropriate contact with women. </p> <p>Karena Virginia claims that Trump groped her breast and made sexual comments toward her at a random encounter outside the 1998 US Open tennis tournament in Flushing, Queens. Virginia was 27 at the time. The two had never previously met, she said.</p> <p>\u201cI was waiting for a car to arrive to take me home,\u201d she said, flanked by famous women\u2019s rights attorney Gloria Allred, and facing a battery of clacking cameras. </p> <p>As she was waiting, she claimed, Trump approached her with a small group of other men. \u201cI was surprised when I overheard him talking to the other men about me. He said: \u2018Hey, look at this one, we haven\u2019t seen her before. Look at those legs,\u2019 as though I were an object rather than a person.</p> <p>\u201cHe then walked up to me and reached out his right arm and grabbed my right arm,\u201d she continued. \u201cThen his hand touched the right side of my breast. I was in shock. I flinched. \u2018Don\u2019t you know who I am? Don\u2019t you know who I am?\u2019 \u2013 that\u2019s what he said to me. I felt intimidated and I felt powerless. When my car pulled up and I got in, after I closed the door, my shock turned to shame.\u201d</p> <p>Virginia, who described herself on Thursday as a yoga instructor and life coach from the tri-state area, spoke in a midtown Manhattan hotel conference room just blocks away from Trump Tower. It was less than one week after Allred held a press conference with another Trump accuser.<br></p> <p>\u201cHer allegations demonstrate how Mr Trump selects his victims at random,\u201d Allred said.</p> <p>Within hours, the Trump campaign released an acid response, claiming Virginia\u2019s press conference was the work of the Clinton campaign.</p> <p>\u201cDiscredited political operative Gloria Allred, in another coordinated, publicity-seeking attack with the Clinton campaign, will stop at nothing to smear Mr Trump,\u201d said Jessica Ditto, the campaign\u2019s deputy communications director. \u201cGive me a break. Voters are tired of these circus-like antics and reject these fictional stories and the clear efforts to benefit Hillary Clinton.\u201d</p> <p>On Thursday, Allred disclosed, not for the first time, that she is an avowed supported of Clinton and served as an elected delegate at this summer\u2019s Democratic national convention. Allred denied that she had had contact with anyone inside the Clinton campaign regarding Virginia\u2019s claims.</p> <p>Asked if Allred and Virginia could produce eyewitnesses of the event, Allred replied that Virginia had told her husband and several friends about the alleged encounter soon after it occurred.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/14/donald-trump-summer-zervos-apprentice-sexual-assault\">Summer Zervos: former Apprentice contestant claims Trump kissed and groped her</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Virginia is the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/15/donald-trump-sexual-misconduct-allegations-cathy-heller\">10th woman to publicly accuse Trump</a> of inappropriate sexual contact \u2013 the seventh since a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/07/donald-trump-leaked-recording-women\">2005 tape revealed Trump bragging that his fame allowed him to grope and kiss women without their consent</a>.

But in the end, I feel that it is my duty as a woman, a mother, a human being and an American citizen to speak out and tell the truth about what happened to me.</p> <p>\u201cMr Trump,\u201d she continued, \u201cyour random moment of sexual pleasure came at my expense and affected me greatly.\u201d</p> <p>Virginia described feeling shame about the alleged encounter and blaming herself for wearing a short dress and heels \u2013 an outfit she avoided for years afterwards \u201cso as not to attract unwanted attention\u201d.</p> <p>Virginia claimed that she met Trump one more time, about five years ago, at a business event. \u201cHe looked me up and down a few times in a lecherous manner. This time, mixed in with the feelings of shame, I felt disgust toward him. I had come to the realization that I was the victim and he had violated me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe has shown tremendous courage in coming forward today, especially in light of Mr Trump\u2019s statements last night in which he called the allegations of the nine women who alleged inappropriate sexual conduct by him \u2018lies and fiction\u2019,\u201d Allred said.</p> <p>\u201cMr Trump, you may have thought that you could violate women without consequences. But there are always consequences. There are consequences for the women that you have hurt and there are consequences for you as well.\u201d</p> <p>Besides Virginia, nine other women have accused Trump, publicly and using their full names, of harassing them or touching them without their consent. A few, such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/20/donald-trump-sexual-assault-allegations-jill-harth-interview\">Jill Harth</a>, who claimed in a 1997 lawsuit Trump tried to sexually assault her, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/20/donald-trump-sexual-assault-allegations-jill-harth-interview\">made their claims long before</a> the Washington Post published the infamous tape.</p> <p>Others came forward just days after the revelation of the tape and Trump\u2019s subsequent denials. Jessica Leeds claimed in a New York Times <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/13/us/politics/donald-trump-women.html?_r=0\">article</a> that Trump groped her on a plane while the two were seated next to each other. In the same article, Rachel Crooks, who worked in Trump Tower as a secretary, alleged that Trump would not let go of her hand after she introduced herself, and began kissing her. The two were in an elevator, she claimed. </p> <p>Virginia is the second woman to tell her story with the assistance of Allred. Last week, Allred held a similar press conference with Summer Zervos, a former contestant on The Apprentice who claimed that Trump used a meeting about a job opportunity <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/14/donald-trump-summer-zervos-apprentice-sexual-assault\">as a pretense to grope her and make sexual advances.</a> Neither woman has announced plans to take legal action against Trump.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p>",
  "<h2><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/lucia-graves\">Lucia Graves</a>: \u2018Hillary Clinton spoke directly to women\u2019<br></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"b72cb7920bd461392b581c8560214d184520edf7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b72cb7920bd461392b581c8560214d184520edf7/0_0_480_480/480.png\" alt=\"Lucia Graves\" width=\"480\" height=\"480\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>On Wednesday night, in the last presidential debate of what has been an emotional tornado of a campaign, Hillary Clinton spoke directly to women.</p> <p>It began with a commitment to upholding the values laid out in Roe v Wade, the landmark 1973 decision legalizing abortion in the United States. Clinton spoke of protecting healthcare centers like Planned Parenthood that make upholding those values possible.</p> <p>Trump proceeded to make a fool of himself: \u201cIf you go with what Hillary is saying,\u201d he began, \u201c ... you can take baby and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/19/abortion-trump-clinton-debate\">rip the baby out of the womb</a> in the ninth month, on the final day. That\u2019s not acceptable.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s also not true. Late term abortions are extremely rare, and Trump\u2019s insistence that a baby can be torn out of its mother moments before childbirth is pure malarkey. Roe v Wade is meant to protect women\u2019s right to abortion up until \u201cfetal viability\u201d, which in Planned Parenthood v Casey, in 1992, was defined as 23 or 24 weeks or earlier. More recently fights in Congress have centered around an abortion ban at 20 weeks \u2013 in other words nowhere near the ninth month.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s obliviousness to these facts underscores his lack of understanding of the abortion debate and women\u2019s issues generally, a trait that was on display earlier this year when he suggested women who have abortions should face \u201csome sort of punishment\u201d. That\u2019s something no one on either side of the aisle wants, and tonight made clear Trump hasn\u2019t done any homework since his earlier blunder. </p> <p>But the evening was also a referendum on Trump\u2019s personal treatment of women. At one point, Clinton more or less said so. \u201cDonald thinks belittling women makes him bigger. He goes after their dignity, their self-worth, and I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a woman anywhere who doesn\u2019t know what that feels like.\u201d</p> <p>And unlike his infinite malleability on policy issues, misogyny is the one philosophy Trump clearly hasn\u2019t changed and seems genuinely unable to. He bristled when Clinton recalled his referring to former Miss Universe Alicia Machado as an \u201ceating machine\u201d, but soon after, he was interrupting to call Clinton not just the usual \u201cliar\u201d, which has by now become banal, but \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/20/nasty-woman-donald-trump-hillary-clinton\">such a nasty woman</a>\u201d, an even more baseless character attack.</p> <p>I\u2019ve spent the election writing about the women who\u2019ve known Trump. But this isn\u2019t just about the women I interviewed \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/27/alicia-machado-miss-universe-weight-shame-trump-speaks-out-clinton\">Machado</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/04/sheena-monnin-donald-trump-miss-usa-lawsuit\">Sheena Monnin</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/20/donald-trump-sexual-assault-allegations-jill-harth-interview\">Jill Harth</a>. As Clinton made clear tonight, it\u2019s about women everywhere. How fitting it would be if she \u2013 another woman he\u2019s insulted \u2013 speeds past him to the most powerful job in the world. </p> <h2><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/steven-w-thrasher\">Steven W Thrasher</a>: \u2018Trump\u2019s biggest grievance is the possibility of losing\u2019<br></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"9d44bc513a5de5dc5db4fa31008abca414e21fe1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9d44bc513a5de5dc5db4fa31008abca414e21fe1/0_0_480_480/480.png\" alt=\"Steven Thrasher\" width=\"480\" height=\"480\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Trump\u2019s campaign has been that of an aggrieved white man, losing his place in the world, who is trying to scare his way back to power with racialized fears of the other.

The comment was ironic, given his admission, on tape, of his own sexually predatory actions, and the claims of his many accusers.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/oct/20/donald-trump-bad-hombres-us-presidential-debate-las-vegas-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/58apd\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2822647\"            data-video-name=\"Donald Trump: deport 'bad hombres' \u2013\u00a0video\"            data-video-provider=\"AP\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-58088131e4b005f21833b5db\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/10/20/161020hombres_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/10/20/161020hombres.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/10/20/161020hombres_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/oct/20/donald-trump-bad-hombres-us-presidential-debate-las-vegas-video\">Trump vows to rid US of \u2018bad hombres\u2019 \u2013 video</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Perhaps Trump\u2019s biggest grievance is the possibility of losing.

But she also fumbled needlessly, at one point answering a question about Syria by saying the US must work with \u201cAmerican Muslim communities who are on the front lines to identify and prevent attacks,\u201d then awkwardly following up with a non-sequitur: \u201cThe killer of the dozens of people at the nightclub in Orlando was born in Queens, the same place Donald was born.\u201d</p> <p>The night was devoid of poetry, and ended as depressingly as the entire campaign has been conducted.</p> <h2><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/jamie-weinstein\">Jamie Weinstein</a>: \u2018The only question is whether he now faces a Mitt Romney-style disaster or a Michael Dukakis-style catastrophe\u2019<br></h2> <p>Donald Trump needed a devastating knockout. At best he narrowly lost on points.</p> <p>He came into the third and final presidential debate far behind in the polls. With tens of millions watching, he did little to change the trajectory of the race.</p> <p>Compared to the first two debates, Trump did do a better job hammering home his message that a vote for Hillary Clinton is a vote for the status quo.</p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s been doing this for 30 years \u2013 why didn\u2019t you do it over the last 15, 20 years,\u201d Trump said of Clinton when talking about negotiating better trade deals.</p> <p>\u201cYou talk but you don\u2019t get anything done Hillary,\u201d he later added.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/us-membership/inclusive.html\" data-alt=\"membership callout\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/us-membership/inclusive.html\">membership callout</a> </figure>  <p>Trump also did a better job at controlling his emotions when Hillary tried to bait him by calling him a choker and a \u201cpuppet\u201d.

The only question that remains is whether Donald Trump faces a Mitt Romney-style disaster or a Michael Dukakis-style catastrophe \u2013 and, in that loss, whether Trump brings the Republican House, Senate, party and even conservative movement down with him.</p> <h2><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/christopher-r-barron\">Christopher R Barron</a>: \u2018Trump stuck to the issues and forced Hillary to talk policy\u2019<br></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"d07b62588db36e5f2f2ad87ddc32e036d46f0263\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d07b62588db36e5f2f2ad87ddc32e036d46f0263/0_0_280_280/280.png\" alt=\"Christopher Barron\" width=\"280\" height=\"280\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Donald Trump came to this behind in the polls and reeling after weeks of negative media coverage. He needed a big night \u2013 and he got one.</p> <p>For a campaign that prides itself on its mastery of policy, Hillary spent much of the night trying to get Trump to take the bait on sideshow issues.</p> <p>In previous debates, Trump took the bait. Tonight, however, we saw a much more disciplined candidate. Trump stuck to the issues and forced Hillary to talk policy and \u2013 quite frankly \u2013 she had her worst debate performance. </p> <p>Unlike previous moderators, Chris Wallace was willing to properly challenge both Trump and Clinton. His line of questioning, particularly when it came to the Clinton Foundation, kept Hillary off balance.</p> <p>Clinton also found herself on the defensive on foreign policy, where she seemed more like a George W Bush Republican than a Democrat.</p> <p>As a result, this ended up being Trump\u2019s best debate. For far too long, the Republican candidate has let the campaign be about the circus and not about policy. If this race is about the circus then Hillary Clinton wins. If its about policy then Trump has a shot.

He played a caricature of himself that contrived to be even more childish and temperamental than Alec Baldwin\u2019s rendition of him on Saturday Night Live.</p> <p>\u201cThere was even a time when he didn\u2019t get an Emmy for his TV program three years in a row and he started tweeting that the Emmys were rigged,\u201d said Hillary Clinton. At which point, Trump leaned into his microphone and said: \u201cShould have gotten it.\u201d </p> <p>It\u2019s one thing to lose your self-control on Twitter. It\u2019s another to thing to lose it while talking about Twitter.</p> <p>Clinton goaded Trump as easily as an older sister drives her brother into a full-blown tantrum. She called him a puppet of Vladimir Putin. His response? \u201cNo, you\u2019re the puppet.\u201d</p> <p>She said the intelligence agencies blamed election-related cyberattacks on Russia. His response? \u201cShe has no idea whether it\u2019s Russia, China or anybody else,\u201d said the puppet. \u201cYou have no idea.\u201d</p> <p>Barely a limo ride away from the Pyramids, the Grand Canal and the Eiffel Tower (the Vegas versions, at least) the GOP nominee explained his foreign policy in remarkable detail. He accused US forces of attacking Isis in Mosul simply to help Clinton get elected, before giving us his Cliffs Notes on the city. \u201cLet me tell you,\u201d he said, \u201cMosul is so sad. We had Mosul. But when she left, she took everybody out. We lost Mosul. Now we\u2019re fighting again to get Mosul.\u201d</p> <p>Like the Hangover series, this Trump debate trilogy has grown wan and tired in its final outing. The scriptwriters have run out of ideas.

This week he went further, claiming that votes cast by undocumented immigrants led to Barack Obama\u2019s victory in 2008 and that 1.8 million dead people would vote in this election for \u201csomebody else\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/19/donald-trump-presidential-debate-election-result\">Donald Trump says he'll keep country 'in 'suspense' on accepting election result</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Trump has specifically called on his supporters to turn out in force on election day to monitor polling stations around the country for instances of voter fraud. He has even set up a website where his supporters can sign up to be a \u201cTrump Election Observer\u201d. </p> <p>The suggestion has alarmed civil rights advocates, <a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2016-election/donald-trump-s-poll-watching-talk-spurs-call-international-monitors-n636136\">raising concerns</a> of voter intimidation and racial bias at the polls this November. The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe <a href=\"http://www.osce.org/odihr/elections/usa/246356\">aims to send </a>500 international observers to monitor the US elections, a 10-fold increase from 2012. </p> <p>With the possibility of more monitors in polling places than ever before, here\u2019s a look at what to expect when voters arrive on 8 November. </p> <h2>What are poll monitors?</h2> <p>The job of poll monitors, also known as poll observers, poll watchers and inspectors, is to ensure that the voting process runs smoothly and according to the law. This volunteer watch force is observing poll workers and voters for any possible violation of election law.</p> <p>Trump has urged his supporters to \u201cwatch and study\u201d voters at polling stations, and has launched a website encouraging supporters to sign up through his <a href=\"https://www.donaldjtrump.com/landing/volunteer-to-be-a-trump-election-observer\">Trump Election Observer</a> program. However, in <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/policies-for-election-observers.aspx#access\">at least 40 states</a>, partisan observers must be accredited or appointed. </p> <p>It\u2019s very possible that Trump\u2019s informal observers will be turned away if they haven\u2019t obtained the proper accreditation.</p> <p>Observers are typically allowed to watch the casting of ballots, testing of voting equipment and the counting of the ballots. States generally specify the number of partisan observers allowed at the polling place, how they are appointed and trained, when and where they are allowed to operate and what their responsibilities entail. </p> <p>Monitors are strictly prohibited from interfering with the electoral process, which includes intimidating voters, election officials and poll workers. If an issue arises, observers are allowed to alert the election officials or the authorities. </p> <p>Yet despite Trump\u2019s repeated calls for supporters to register to be poll watchers, there appears to be no real effort underway for them to do so, according to a <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/19/us/politics/donald-trump-voting-election-rigging.html\">New York Times report</a> from this week. Local officials in battleground states told the Times that the numbers of people seeking to be poll watchers are \u201con par\u201d with years past. </p> <h2>What are poll workers?</h2> <p>Poll workers are civically minded recruits or volunteers who agree to give up their election day to work extremely long hours for very little pay. Because election day is on a Tuesday and is not a federal holiday, the job disproportionately attracts retirees and the marginally employed.</p> <p>Each state has a different set of laws and rules governing the selection and eligibility of a poll worker. But in general, they are eligible voters registered in the state where they are stationed. Training is typically offered or required both online and in-person, and workers in some states receive increased pay for having the extra instruction. Poll workers are not expected to be politically agnostic, but they are deployed to stations in a bipartisan manner. </p> <p>A typical day\u2019s work can be 11 or 12 hours, and includes opening and closing the polling stations, issuing ballots to registered voters, registering voters, monitoring the voting equipment or counting votes. Poll workers are typically paid for working election day and afforded a small stipend for meals and travel. </p> <p>US elections suffer from a dearth of volunteers. The shortage can result in longer lines, which can in turn depress voter turnout.</p> <h2>What are observers watching for?</h2> <p>There are several categories of observers, all of whom have different goals. The types of observers include partisan, nonpartisan, nonpartisan international and academics. Trump is specifically asking his supporters to ensure that election officials do not disadvantage his campaign. </p> <p>Nonpartisan observers are typically focused on ensuring integrity and transparency in the electoral process and should not have a stake in the outcome of the election. If carried out properly, these observers can provide useful feedback to improve election procedures going forward. </p> <p>Many poll watchers consider themselves voter rights activists,<a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/poll-monitors-arent-trump-thinks_us_57bcae40e4b03d51368b46b6\"> there to help prevent</a> instances of disenfranchisement \u2013 intentional and unintentional. In an essay for the Huffington Post, a poll monitor in California said instances of alleged voter fraud are incredibly rare. The most common problems watchers observe are related to a poll worker\u2019s failure to provide proficient translation or requiring a voter show ID that is not required. </p> <h2>What is voter fraud?</h2> <p>Voter fraud is committed when there is a deliberate interference with the election process. Examples of this include casting more than one ballot, voting under the name of a deceased person, casting a ballot by a felon who is not eligible to vote, registering to vote as a fictional person or someone else, impersonating another voter or manipulating the ballots by election officials. </p> <h2>Is voter fraud rampant? </h2> <p>Americans are sharply divided along mostly partisan lines about the extent to which voter fraud is committed. Conservatives have long alleged voter fraud is widespread and that preventing it is paramount to preserving the integrity of the election process. Yet critics note that many of the measures designed to reduce voter fraud and passed by Republican legislatures disproportionately impact poor and minority voters.</p> <p>Furthermore, research indicates that instances of voter fraud are relatively rare, and that claims of widespread voter fraud are greatly exaggerated. A <a href=\"http://votingrights.news21.com/interactive/election-fraud-database/\">News21 investigation</a> found just 2,068 cases of alleged election fraud between the years 2000 and 2011, when the report was published. Similarly, an investigation by Justin Levitt of the Loyola Law School found even fewer instances of voter fraud:<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2014/08/06/a-comprehensive-investigation-of-voter-impersonation-finds-31-credible-incidents-out-of-one-billion-ballots-cast/\"> just 31 \u201ccredible\u201d incidents </a>of voter impersonation out of 1bn votes cast between 2000 and 2014.</p> <p>Recent allegations of widespread voter fraud are often misrepresented.

The allegations stemmed from the fact that 100% of voters in 59 zones voted for Obama over Mitt Romney.</p> <p>While some saw the numbers as evidence of foul play, fact checkers deemed it wholly plausible and mathematically possible. The average number of registered voters in these small divisions within Philadelphia is 616, and the average number of registered Republicans in the divisions is 17,<a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.politifact.com/pennsylvania/statements/2016/aug/12/viral-image/internet-philly-rigged-2012-presidential-election-/\"> according to Politifact</a>.

There is no evidence to support that these cities are particularly beset by voter fraud. </p>",

The shock, outrage and headlines from Las Vegas will focus on Donald Trump\u2019s brazen confirmation that not even the basic rules of the game are ones he accepts.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/19/presidential-debate-trump-clinton-analysis\">Why the final presidential debate highlights the madness of Trump\u2019s ideas</a></p> <h2>So \u2026 who won?

  "<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/19/donald-trump-presidential-debate-election-result\">Last night\u2019s US presidential debate between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump</a> revealed just how polarised American politics has become. But the Republicans are not the only party where the base is in revolt against its own establishment. This year\u2019s primaries saw a significant grassroots challenge to the traditional Democratic leadership too, in the shape of Bernie Sanders \u2013 a self-proclaimed \u201cdemocratic socialist\u201d who at one stage posed a serious threat to Clinton\u2019s nomination.</p> <p>One of the reasons I went to Muncie was because Sanders won both the county and the state in which it resides by a significant margin. I wanted to see what was driving that kind of support in a relatively conservative midwestern area \u2013 who are they, what do they want and why? Having covered the 2008 presidential election, in which Barack Obama was first elected, I also wanted to see what Sanders supporters were going to do now that their candidate was no longer running. Would they build a movement to pursue their agenda or would they dissipate once the campaign was over; would they vote for Clinton or would they embrace a third party candidate?</p> <p>I found some interesting intergenerational family differences, some people doing impressive work in isolation, a general grievance with \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d and a burning desire for something better that people suddenly felt was possible.</p> <p>You can <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/membership/2016/oct/20/middletown-bernie-sanders-hillary-clinton-muncie\">read my story in full here</a>.

  "<p>In the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/20/who-won-the-final-presidential-debate\">last debate</a> of the election, Hillary Clinton emerged the way she hoped she would, as the all-but-certain first female president of the United States.</p> <p>By refusing to pledge that he would accept the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/19/donald-trump-presidential-debate-election-result\">results of the election</a>, Donald Trump all-but-certainly disqualified himself for the position of president. The peaceful transfer of power after a presidential election has been the pillar of our democracy. By refusing to accept the results of the vote, Trump would be flouting the tradition of American politics and the democratic beliefs of almost all voters.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/20/who-won-the-final-presidential-debate\">Who won the final presidential debate?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Like the two earlier debates, this one was contentious and marked by sniping between Trump and Clinton. But Trump\u2019s claims were often far-fetched and lacked a shred of factual evidence. Especially bizarre was his baseless charge that the Clinton campaign was behind the allegations of nine women that Trump improperly groped or kissed them, charges that Trump has denied.</p> <p>Some analysts thought Trump may have lost the election the day the disgusting tape of him <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/07/donald-trump-leaked-recording-women\">bragging</a> about his ability to kiss women and \u201cgrab them by the pussy\u201d became public. His standing in battleground states and national polls did <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/us/general_election_trump_vs_clinton-5491.html\">drop precipitously</a> and steadily after the tape became public.</p> <p>But his constant claims of a rigged election and refusal to join his running mate, Mike Pence, in saying he\u2019d accept the election results are equally, if not more, outrageous. They are intended to damage people\u2019s confidence in the election process itself.</p> <p>So Trump blew his last best chance to present himself as a credible president, while Clinton, who maintained her composure throughout, radiated solidity.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/us-membership/inclusive.html\" data-alt=\"membership callout\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/us-membership/inclusive.html\">membership callout</a> </figure>  <p>Going into Wednesday\u2019s debate, her stature as a candidate was much greater than in the previous two. Most national polls of late show her with a prohibitive lead over Trump. With 20 days remaining before election day, it is all but impossible for him to make up the lost ground necessary to win the presidency.</p> <p>So the debate had far lower stakes for Clinton than Trump. Her strategy was fairly simple: show Trump as not fit for the presidency, defend herself without seeming defensive or evasive and, most important, maintain the demeanor of an all-but-president.</p> <p>She did a masterful job of not letting Trump\u2019s sharp attacks rile her. She did not assault Trump with as much sting as she had in the two past debates, though she still obviously got under his skin. He blurted out that she is \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/20/nasty-woman-donald-trump-hillary-clinton\">a nasty woman</a>\u201d.</p> <p>Trump began the debate talking in a quiet voice and scoring some points against Clinton on issues like trade. But he soon lost focus and eventually fell to pieces, denying, when there is tape to prove it, that he had demeaned the appearances of his female accusers and interrupting Clinton repeatedly, practically shouting \u201cwrong\u201d after some of her assertions about his record.</p> <p>There was substantive discussion of issues, on foreign policy, the supreme court, the US budget deficit and abortion. Clinton repeated her support for a woman\u2019s right to control her body, while Trump showed his revulsion of late-term abortions and repeatedly described it as \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/19/abortion-trump-clinton-debate\">rip[ping] the baby out of the womb</a>\u201d.</p> <p>Clinton evaded direct answers posed by the moderator, Fox\u2019s Chris Wallace about her ethics and used her answers to accuse Trump of being Vladimir Putin\u2019s \u201cpuppet,\u201d a remark that clearly rankled with him.</p> <p>But she was careful to be positive, too, saying that America is great because \u201cits people are good\u201d. She said she had devoted her life\u2019s work to women and children and would devote her presidency to protecting them. Trump again provided a very dark vision of the United States.</p> <p>At times Clinton projected an almost regal bearing. She wore an elegant suit in white, a color she has favored at other key moments in her climb to the White House, including her Brooklyn victory rally after the primaries and at her <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jul/29/hillary-clinton-speech-artful-response-trump-dnc-verdict\">acceptance speech</a> at the Democratic convention. She clearly knows she is on the brink of making history once again.</p>",

On average, premiums have <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/sep/04/republican-national-committee-republican/republican-national-committee-says-health-insuranc/\">risen</a> by about 5.8% a year since Barack Obama took office, compared with 13.2% in the nine years before Obama, <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/sep/04/republican-national-committee-republican/republican-national-committee-says-health-insuranc/\">Politifact found</a> earlier this year. Trump, however, is cherry-picking data from <a href=\"http://acasignups.net/\">various states</a> and <a href=\"https://ratereview.healthcare.gov/#urrresults?U2FsdGVkX19n4kcCdR5qUI27%2BwHheoDO2VGbcEEfi84Zrt9YzdawzO8%2BdPHtCLfThVI4mtetRmr28iQ8w29yvQ%3D%3D\">providers</a> where <a href=\"https://ratereview.healthcare.gov/#urrresults?U2FsdGVkX186EmjG4AR6ruydOJE2fGfzzCgpYCDVKZngFNf0hgLfrIhE%2BJuoUQjwImgHKotCy9LrONfdtvsk4im1VSMZcQCpaU3VHLZUiPU%3D\">rates have had higher</a> jumps. The most common healthcare plans will increase 9% on average, according to an <a href=\"http://kff.org/health-reform/issue-brief/analysis-of-2017-premium-changes-and-insurer-participation-in-the-affordable-care-acts-health-insurance-marketplaces/\">analysis</a> by the Kaiser Family Foundation. </p> <p><strong>Trump: \u201cWe take care of illegal immigrants \u2026 better than we take care of our vets\u201d</strong></p> <p>This claim flies in the face of evidence and logic. Like all US citizens, veterans enjoy the basic rights and benefits granted by US law (voting rights, social security, Medicaid, etc), while undocumented migrants (noncitizens) do not. Trump has in the past tried to justify this claim by saying the US spends more on undocumented people than on veterans, but has<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/02/lyin-trump-fact-check-mexico-wall-immigration\"> drawn a $113bn price tag from an explicitly anti-immigration foundation</a>. He also inflated that number. </p> <p>The campaign has said the US spends $2.8bn on housing migrants in prisons, combining an estimate <a href=\"http://www.nationalreview.com/article/421673/report-us-spent-187-billion-incarcerate-illegal-immigrant-criminals-2014-joel-gehrke\">on prison costs</a> and the 2016 budget for the care and processing of children who came to the US without adults. The Veterans Affairs administration has a 2016 budget of $69.7bn. Veterans and undocumented migrants alike have access to K-12 education, though few veterans would likely seek it, and veterans have access to the Affordable Care Act, military benefits and health benefits, while migrants do not.</p> <p><strong>Trump: \u201cOur inner cities are a disaster. You get shot walking to the store, you have no education, no jobs\u201d</strong></p> <p>Trump\u2019s repeated claim that \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/07/donald-trump-lies-this-week-taxes-bankruptcy\">African Americans, Hispanics, are living in hell</a>\u201d defies most of American history, from antebellum slavery through the Jim Crow decades, great depression and segregation. Even if Trump is only referring the past half century, he is still wrong by most metrics. </p> <p>Data on employment, education and health show empirical evidence for the <a href=\"http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/07/18/sharp-differences-over-who-is-hurt-helped-by-their-race/\">persistent reality</a> of <a href=\"http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/07/27/blacks-with-college-experience-more-likely-to-say-they-faced-discrimination/\">discrimination</a> against black Americans, but also show major gains in the last few decades.

Trump omits, however, two key points: Congress controls the government\u2019s wallet (ie Obama cannot spend or tax without approval from lawmakers), and Obama took office during the financial crisis, when Republicans, Democrats and most economists agreed that the US needed to spend in order to counteract the collapsing economy.

She seems to be citing another <a href=\"http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/publications/analysis-donald-trumps-tax-plan\">analysis, by the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center</a>, about the debt, and possibly overstates its estimated consequences. </p> <p>That center warned that without severe spending cuts, the plan would balloon national debt \u201cby nearly 80% of gross domestic product by 2036, offsetting some or all of the incentive effects of the tax cuts\u201d. According to that group, half of Trump\u2019s tax cuts would go to the top 1% of earners, and most families below the top 20% of earners would have income gains of less than 1%.</p> <p><strong>Trump: \u201cWhen you ran the State Department, $6bn was missing! Maybe it was stolen \u2026 nobody knows\u201d</strong></p> <p>This is not correct.

A Trump contractor hired undocumented Polish workers in the late 1970s and early 1980s, and in 1983 union members sued one of their organizers. Trump appeared in court in 1990 and blamed the contractor overseeing the project, which was for Trump Tower.</p> <p><strong>Trump: Obama \u201chas thousands and thousands of people, they have no idea where they come from\u201d</strong></p> <p>Ten thousand Syrian refugees have come to the United States in 2016, but Trump makes it sound misleadingly large.</p> <p>He is patently wrong about the screening process. The US has among the most intensive screening process in the world for refugees: it requires they register and interview with the United Nations, which then must refer them to the US; refugees who pass this test then interview with State Department contractors and have at least two background checks; then they have three fingerprint and photo screenings; then US immigration reviews the case; then Homeland Security interviews the refugee; then a doctor examines the refugee, and finally several security agencies perform one last check after the refugee has been matched with a resettlement agency. </p> <p>The process <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/02/donald-trump-syria-refugees-us-immigration-security-terrorism\">takes 18 months</a> to two years.

He said nice things about me \u2026 He has no respect for our president.\u201d</strong></p> <p>It\u2019s not clear whether Trump has ever spoken with the Russian president. Putin was invited to but did not attend a 2013 beauty pageant in Moscow, according to <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/inside-trumps-financial-ties-to-russia-and-his-unusual-flattery-of-vladimir-putin/2016/06/17/dbdcaac8-31a6-11e6-8ff7-7b6c1998b7a0_story.html\">one of the oligarchs</a> who helped organize the event. \u201cWill he become my new best friend?\u201d Trump <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/347191326112112640\">wondered</a> beforehand.</p> <p>The pair may have communicated through intermediaries. In 2014, Trump <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKkKQmbyECw\">told a National Press Club luncheon</a>: \u201cI was in Moscow recently and I spoke, indirectly and directly, with President Putin, who could not have been nicer, and we had a tremendous success.\u201d A year earlier, Trump <a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/trump-putin-tried-arrange-meeting-moscow-source-n619006\">told MSNBC</a>: \u201cI do have a relationship and I can tell you that he\u2019s very interested in what we\u2019re doing here today.\u201d</p> <p>Last November, Trump <a href=\"http://time.com/4107636/transcript-read-the-full-text-of-the-fourth-republican-debate-in-milwaukee/\">claimed in a debate</a> that he \u201cgot to know him very well because we were both on 60 Minutes\u201d. They appeared in separate, pre-taped segments and were not on set together.</p> <p>Trump has repeatedly tried to do business in Russia, and his refusal to release tax returns prevents him proving that he has no assets there. </p> <p>Putin has never called Trump \u201ca genius\u201d; he used the Russian word \u044f\u0440\u043a\u0438\u0439, which means \u201ccolorful\u201d or \u201cflamboyant\u201d. Trump likely heard the word translated as \u201cbright\u201d or \u201cbrilliant\u201d, though its connotations are often more pejorative than not: bright in the sense of glaring and gaudy, brilliant in the sense of dazzling light. Putin also called him \u201ctalented, undoubtedly\u201d. </p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not our business to decide his merits; that\u2019s for US voters,\u201d Putin said earlier this year.

Moderator Chris Wallace of Fox News will have questions cued to the six topic areas announced in advance: debt and entitlements, immigration, economy, the supreme court, foreign hotspots and fitness to be president.</p> <p>But the candidates\u2019 preferred messages in recent days, especially as Trump is concerned, touch on different themes. Trump has been talking a lot about a rigged election and promised to \u201cdrain the swamp\u201d of Washington. In recent days he has proposed ethics reform laws and congressional term limits. Meanwhile, Breitbart, Trump\u2019s phantom media arm, published today (for the first time, it seems) the <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/blogs/on-media/2016/10/former-tv-reporter-accuses-bill-clinton-of-sexual-assault-229987\">story</a> of a former Arkansas broadcaster, Leslie Milwee, who says Bill Clinton sexually assaulted her in 1980. She\u2019s invited to the debate.</p> <p>Trump says that Clinton emails released by Wikileaks show she is part of an international cabal, with banks and the media, to destroy the country and enrich and empower themselves. He has contended that the state department offered the FBI a quid pro quo for declassifying certain Clinton emails just as they were to come in for public scrutiny. Any of these would-be scandals might be expected to come up.</p> <p>Clinton, for her part, may want to discuss the attack by Trump on his Republican colleagues; Trump\u2019s increasingly wild talk about voter fraud; or the astounding outpouring since the last debate of women who have accused Trump of sexual misconduct or assault. (He denies all the claims.) Here is a video telling their stories:</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/oct/18/donald-trump-sexual-allegations-nine-women-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/583qb\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2817569\"            data-video-name=\"Nine women who accused Trump of sexual misconduct \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"Guardian, Access Hollywood, AP, CNN, Getty Images, NBC, Reuters, Palm Beach Post\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-58066cf1e4b0cd26ff71e6cc\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/10/19/161018womenst_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/10/19/161018womenst.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/10/19/161018womenst_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/oct/18/donald-trump-sexual-allegations-nine-women-video\">Nine women who accused Trump of sexual misconduct</a></figcaption> </figure>  </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-10-20T00:10:01.443Z\">at 1.10am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-580802f1e4b005f21833b3c9\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-19T23:37:30.704Z\">12.37am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Confirmed: Wayne Newton is coming.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/KellyannePolls/status/788884708327165952\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Our <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/debate2016?src=hash\">#debate2016</a> guests tonight include Marcus Luttrell, Pat Smith, and the legendary Wayne Newton.</p>&mdash; Kellyanne Conway (@KellyannePolls) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/KellyannePolls/status/788884708327165952\">October 19, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m_giioppT4\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/0m_giioppT4?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Speaking of legendary Las Vegas acts... did anyone think to invite Britney?</p> <p>Doesn\u2019t matter.

It\u2019s hard to feel excited or even relieved, though, when her road to victory is so slick with the odium of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\">Donald Trump</a>.</p> <p>Between the video of Trump bragging about sexual assault and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/15/donald-trump-sexual-misconduct-allegations-cathy-heller\">woman after woman</a> coming forward to claim he did just that, it\u2019s hard to stave off that sick-to-your-stomach feeling <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/14/michelle-obama-speech-transcript-donald-trump\">Michelle Obama described so powerfully last week</a>. For those of us who have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/may/28/jessica-valenti-my-life-as-a-sex-object\">endured a lifetime of unwanted leers and touches</a>, this last leg of the campaign has been painful. And as Trump surrogates and supporters \u2013<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/17/melania-trump-billy-bush-groping-tape-cnn-interview\">even his wife</a> \u2013 continue to shrug off the offenses as \u201clocker room talk\u201d or <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/787990502415167488\">outright lies</a>, we\u2019re reminded of just how easily women are disbelieved.</p> <p>There is one thing, though, that\u2019s giving me hope in the midst of this ugliness: the outcry from men who refuse to characterize sexual harassment and abuse as normal male behavior. Too often, discussions about sexual assault center only on women \u2013 our victimization and perceived culpability. Since the tape\u2019s release, though, the national conversation has shifted: men are coming forward en masse to reject the idea that \u201creal men\u201d talk about abusing women \u2013 that this is normal language to use in a locker room or anywhere else.</p> <p>Read further:</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/19/donald-trump-sexism-misogyny-men\">The silver lining of Trump's misogyny?

Fox News anchor Chris Wallace - the first anchor from that network to host a presidential debate - will moderate tonight\u2019s engagement. For a network that has been embroiled in scandal that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/jul/21/roger-ailes-leaves-fox-news-sexual-harassment-claims\">brought down its chief executive</a>, Wallace\u2019s position is an opportunity to hit the reset button on a miserable year - although Trump\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/apr/14/fox-anchor-megyn-kelly-meets-donald-trump\">willingness to feud</a> with Fox News personalities means that Wallace will not be protected from onstage criticism from the candidate just because he\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/oct/06/trump-only-goes-on-hannity-megyn-kelly-clashes-with-friend-at-10-oclock\">besties with Sean Hannity.</a></p> <p><strong>What is the format? </strong>The debate will consist of six 15-minute segments, following the same format as the first presidential debate. Each segment will be approximately 15 minutes long. Wallace will open each segment with a question, after which each candidate will have two minutes to respond. Clinton and Trump will then have an opportunity to respond to each other. Wallace may use the balance of the time in the segment for a deeper discussion of the topic. Those topics, <a href=\"http://www.debates.org/index.php?page=2016debates\">as revealed by the Commission on Presidential Debates</a>, are as follows:</p> <ul> <li>Debt and entitlements</li> <li>Immigration</li> <li>The economy</li> <li>Supreme Court</li> <li>Foreign hot spots</li> <li>Fitness to be president</li> </ul> <p><strong>Where is the debate being held? </strong>The debate is being held at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, which means that the journalists covering the debate are going to come home broke and hung over (they\u2019ve earned it, trust me).</p> <p><strong>How do I watch the misery? </strong>That\u2019s the easy part!

States vary on how late they allow abortions \u2013 in some states there have been attempts to introduce very short time limits, including in North Dakota where a proposal in 2013 for a ban six weeks after a woman\u2019s last menstrual period was ruled unconstitutional, but in most states the time limit is at the start of the third trimester or earlier. There are nine states without specific term prohibitions, but clinics do not abort at such late terms: only 1.2% of abortions occur after 21 weeks, according to the nonprofit Guttmacher Institute.</p> <p><strong>\u201cClinton wants open borders\u201d</strong></p> <p>Clinton does not want \u201copen borders\u201d: she supports reform to let people pass background checks and pay back taxes in order to stay in the US, and she supports Obama\u2019s executive actions to shield some migrants, such as people who were brought to the US as children. Like Obama, she supports deportation for people with criminal records.</p> <p><strong>\u201cObama has moved millions of people out\u201d</strong></p> <p>Trump is correct: Barack Obama has deported more than 2.5 million people, more than any other recent president, but he has prioritized migrants with criminal records. \u201cMillions and millions\u201d, however, is an exaggeration, and Obama also supports shielding millions of undocumented immigrants without criminal records, and reform for citizenship.</p> <p><strong>Obama \u201chas thousands and thousands of people, they have no idea where they come from\u201d<br></strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/us-membership/defy.html\" data-alt=\"membership callout\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/us-membership/defy.html\">membership callout</a> </figure>  <p>Ten thousand Syrian refugees have come to the United States in 2016, but Trump makes it sound misleadingly large.</p> <p>He is patently wrong about the screening process.

Trump likely heard the word translated as \u201cbright\u201d or \u201cbrilliant\u201d, though its connotations are often more pejorative than not: bright in the sense of glaring and gaudy, brilliant in the sense of dazzling light.

The US <a href=\"http://www.act.nato.int/nsip\">currently pays</a> about 22% of overall Nato spending, compared to Germany\u2019s 15%, France\u2019s 11%, the UK\u2019s 10%, etc, and most Nato members <a href=\"http://www.nato.int/nato_static_fl2014/assets/pdf/pdf_2016_01/20160129_160128-pr-2016-11-eng.pdf\">fail to pay the 2% of GDP</a> into defense as the alliance\u2019s guidelines dictate.

As of 28 September 2016,<a href=\"http://www.treasurydirect.gov/NP/debt/current\"> it was $19.5tn</a>. Trump omits, however, two key points: Congress controls the government\u2019s wallet (ie Obama cannot spend or tax without approval from lawmakers), and Obama took office during the financial crisis, when Republicans, Democrats and most economists agreed that the US needed to spend in order to counteract the collapsing economy. Pence has the right numbers but imputes too much responsibility on the president.</p> <p><strong>\u201cWhen you ran the state department, $6bn was missing! Maybe it was stolen \u2026 nobody knows\u201d</strong></p> <p>This is not correct. Trump is alluding to a March 2014 alert, about contractor spending in the Middle East and Africa, by the state department\u2019s inspector general, who was so perturbed by careless language around the $6bn figure that he wrote the Washington Post a <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/about-the-state-depts-missing-6-billion/2014/04/13/a6130790-c194-11e3-9ee7-02c1e10a03f0_story.html?utm_term=.452a9d665b36\">letter</a> that April. His alert did not conclude that the money was \u201cmissing\u201d he told the Post, but rather that officials had failed \u201cto adequately maintain contract files\u201d that created \u201csignificant financial risk\u201d.

During the FBI investigation, Petraeus lied to agents, according to the plea deal. But the justice department only sentenced Petraeus to two years\u2019 probation and a $100,000 fine, provoking accusations that this relatively lenient sentence was evidence of a double standard for the powerful. The justice department\u2019s lenience toward Petraeus actually made it more difficult, in part, for prosecutors to recommend charges against Clinton.<br><br>This week Cartwright pled guilty to lying to the FBI in an investigation into leaking classified information about operations against Iran to journalists. Like Petraeus, though, the FBI found actual intentional wrongdoing in Cartwright\u2019s case.

This complexity makes the notion of a \u201crigged\u201d national election, at least in the US, logistically daunting to the point of practical impossibility. Thirty-one states have Republican governors, including the swing states of Florida, North Carolina, Iowa, Nevada and Ohio; Pennsylvania only elected a Democratic governor in 2015. Polls show Trump losing even in some states where governors have strongly supported him.

She seems to be citing another <a href=\"http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/publications/analysis-donald-trumps-tax-plan\">analysis, by the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center</a>, about the debt, and possibly overstates its estimated consequences.</p> <p>That center warned that without severe spending cuts, the plan would balloon national debt \u201cby nearly 80% of gross domestic product by 2036, offsetting some or all of the incentive effects of the tax cuts\u201d. According to that group, half of Trump\u2019s tax cuts would go to the top 1% of earners, and most families below the top 20% of earners would have income gains of less than 1%.</p> <p><em>\u2022 This article was amended on 21 October 2016.

Even Chris Christie and campaign manager <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/22/kellyanne-conway-is-donald-trumps-last-chance-winning\">Kellyanne Conway</a> are stressing they believe elections are for voters, not candidates, to decide.</p> <p>The issue may have roiled the political world this week, much as boasting of groping women overshadowed the previous debate, but what really distinguished the third and final television showdown of the reality TV election was the unusual amount of time both candidates devoted to attacking each other\u2019s policies rather than each other.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6ba2f1bf7bd50fa9e24a5187747d7ee0c75aa084\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6ba2f1bf7bd50fa9e24a5187747d7ee0c75aa084/0_76_5299_3179/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Clinton played Trump\u2019s characteristic lack of discipline like a well-practised musician.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Clinton played Trump\u2019s characteristic lack of discipline like a well-practised musician.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Win McNamee/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It wasn\u2019t until 30 minutes in, when Clinton accused Trump of hiring undocumented immigrants to build his hotels, that either candidate got even as remotely personal as in previous encounters. As if relieved that she still had the capacity to goad him into losing his cool, Clinton shot a broad grin as the Trump temper flared up on cue. \u201cGimme a break!\u201d he demanded at one point, as if acknowledging her ability to play his characteristic lack of discipline and thin skin like a well-practised musician. \u201cYou\u2019re the puppet,\u201d was his childish response to a very grown-up question about whether Russia is pulling strings in his favor using orchestrated computer hacking.</p> <p>But the relative calm that preceded these moments of old Trump, lucidity that returned again briefly when they turned later to foreign policy, allowed for some rare, more substantial moments of political swordplay. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/19/abortion-trump-clinton-debate\">Clinton condemns Trump's abortion 'scare rhetoric' in debate clash</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Trump, for example, was forced to spell out that he wants to use his supreme court appointments to overturn federal protection for women seeking abortion. Muttering that this would be left up to the states to decide in future could not hide the fact that this felt jarringly Victorian from a man whose own moral standards have been exposed for all to see. </p> <p>Similarly on guns and tax policy, Trump may have sounded like a traditional Republican, but it was an echo of the tradition which has seen the party lose the last two presidential elections in an America that feels like it has moved on from the strictures of old.</p> <p> \u201cYou can <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/19/abortion-trump-clinton-debate\">rip the baby out of the womb</a> of the mother,\u201d Trump blasted. \u201cThe government has no business with the decisions that a mother makes,\u201d was Clinton\u2019s reminder that there is nothing freedom-loving about overturning Roe vs Wade.</p> <p>For the first time, it was the madness of Trump\u2019s ideas rather than his erratic manner that took centre stage during this debate.</p> <p>For some Republicans, the moments of relative calm, the brief nostalgia of familiar policy proposals, will come as a relief \u2013 perhaps just enough to stop his poll numbers plummeting further. For what looks like a growing majority of Americans who have already decided he is too ill-tempered and under-qualified to be president, the reminder that even his policies feel like a bad trip will not have made this a pleasant illusion.</p>",

  "<p>The debate watch party hosted by the New York Young Republican Club on Wednesday night was quite disconcerting.<br></p> <p>For one thing, it was the first Donald Trump-oriented event I\u2019ve been to where nobody was wearing a novelty hat, or a pin-badge accusing Hillary Clinton of war crimes. There was no one shouting \u201cbuild that wall\u201d at the television.</p> <p>People even shushed each other when cheers or chatter threatened to drown out the candidates.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/19/donald-trump-presidential-debate-election-result\">Donald Trump refuses to say if he will accept election result in final debate</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But the lack of Trump accoutrements, and the genteel atmosphere, didn\u2019t mean the young Republicans were liberal.</p> <p>\u201cI can never see myself voting for a pro-abortion candidate,\u201d said Steven Ridge, 31. He had been whooping as Trump professed his opposition to Roe v Wade, the US supreme court ruling that established a woman\u2019s right to an abortion.</p> <p>Ridge, who said he was \u201cborn and raised\u201d in Brooklyn, described himself as a libertarian, but conservative on social issues.</p> <p>\u201cThere were 6,000 troops killed in Iraq. That\u2019s the number of babies aborted in two days,\u201d Ridge said. \u201cIs there anything more important than human life?\u201d </p> <p>Ridge said he supported the death penalty. \u201cThose two positions are not in conflict. They are consistent,\u201d he said. \u201cIt means we respect life and we\u2019re prepared to give the death penalty to stop people killing each other.\u201d</p> <p>Despite supporting Trump on abortion, Ridge, who said he worked in the media, described the Republican nominee as \u201ca jerk\u201d. </p> <p>\u201cI completely despise this man,\u201d he said. Ridge said he was voting for Trump because he believed the supreme court was \u201ca major issue\u201d. He said he believed Trump would nominate more socially conservative justices.</p> <p>The New York Young Republican Club had hired out the Katra Lounge, in Manhattan\u2019s Lower East Side, to host the watch party. Katra Lounge, which has a 2.5-star average rating on Yelp, seemed to be more of a dance spot than a forum for political debate. </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/katranyc/photos/a.235018159679.171298.169064339679/10154611016029680/?type=3&amp;theater\">On its Facebook page</a> the bar was marketing an event on Friday night where women were entitled to free vodka between 11pm and midnight.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/oct/20/presidential-debate-highlights-clinton-and-trumps-final-face-off-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/58aff\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2822379\"            data-video-name=\"Presidential debate highlights: Clinton and Trump's final face-off \u2013\u00a0video\"            data-video-provider=\"Reuters / AP\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-58086051e4b055209adaf6c9\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/10/20/161020Debatesub_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/10/20/161020Debatesub_V4.webm\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/10/20/161020Debatesub.m3u8\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/oct/20/presidential-debate-highlights-clinton-and-trumps-final-face-off-video\">Presidential debate highlights: Clinton and Trump\u2019s final face-off \u2013 video</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>There was no free vodka on Wednesday. A bottle of Stella Artois cost $9, according to a man I asked. About 60 young Republicans \u2013 the club defines young as between 18 and 40 years old \u2013 had gathered at Katra Lounge.</p> <p>Rachel Olson, who said she was in her late 30s, was among the attendees. As we watched the middle part of the debate she said she wanted to see more focus on the issues.</p> <p>\u201cI think we all know what their characters are at this point,\u201d Olson said. Like Ridge, she said she was a \u201csocial conservative\u201d. She said she liked that Trump had provided a list of potential supreme court nominees, and that they were all pro-life. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/us-membership/truth.html\" data-alt=\"membership callout\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/us-membership/truth.html\">membership callout</a> </figure>  <p>Olson, a marketing manager, said she was conservative on fiscal matters too.

So ultimately it cuts jobs,\u201d she said.</p> <p>A little later, Trump criticized the media, as is his wont.

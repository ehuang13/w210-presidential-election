Those are important states for Trump, but not sufficient for him to win the presidency if he loses states like Florida or North Carolina.</p> <p>\u201cThe Trump campaign should be concerned,\u201d said Scott Tranter, co-founder of Optimus, a Republican data analytics firm. His firm\u2019s analysis suggests a \u201cstrong final showing for the Clinton campaign\u201d in early voting.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"91724e6b48fd50b00e50d62c383c3cb298c8139a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/91724e6b48fd50b00e50d62c383c3cb298c8139a/0_47_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Soon.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Soon.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Carlos Barria/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Clinton campaign is looking to build an insurmountable lead in Florida and North Carolina during early voting. If she wins either of those states, she\u2019ll probably be the next president.</p> <p>Using 2012 as a guidepost, she appears to be in a strong position in early voting.</p> <p>While Democrats tend to do better in early voting, Republicans usually post an initial lead with mail-in ballots before Democrats surpass them during in-person early voting in mid to late October.</p> <p>Democrats so far have kept it close with mail-in ballots, giving Clinton a chance to run up the score with in-person early voting. To do that, she\u2019ll need non-whites and young people to turn out near the high levels they did in 2012 for Barack Obama.</p> <p>In North Carolina, Democrats have moved ahead of Republicans in early voting. Republicans had held a modest lead based on mail-in ballots returned, but that was at a much narrower margin than in 2012, when Mitt Romney narrowly won the state. After in-person voting began on Thursday, Democrats overtook Republicans in overall votes cast.</p> <p>In Florida, a record 3.1 million people have requested ballots, more than one-third of the total voters in 2012. Democrats have requested almost as many ballots as Republicans: 39 percent vs. 40 percent.</p> <p>By comparison, in 2008, Republicans held a lead of 49 percent to 32 percent in requests, according to an analysis for AP by Catalist, a Democratic analytical firm. Obama won in Florida in 2008 and 2012.</p> <p>Democrats are also showing momentum in the 2nd congressional district of both Maine and Nebraska. The two states allocate electoral votes by congressional district.</p> <p>There\u2019s more where that came from. <a href=\"https://www.apnews.com/8aeeaf8ed917469da03b1381cbe13d47/Early-voting:-Democrats-show-strength-in-key-battlegrounds\">Read further here</a>. </p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-580a3eb8e4b055209adaff6f\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-21T17:14:13.232Z\">6.14pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Clinton to meet with Black Lives Matter activists</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>In advance of her rally in Cleveland, Ohio, this afternoon, Hillary Clinton will meet with Movement for Black Lives activists Brittany Packnett and DeRay Mckesson, her campaign reports.

I mean, when Michelle, you know, she had her own sort of professional life, and she was very committed, as she is now, to the kids. And so there was this understanding between them before he ran for president that you know, that was his career. She would be as supportive as she could, but she wasn\u2019t really involved. You know, she wasn\u2019t, she didn\u2019t campaign terribly much for him in 2004 when he ran for the Senate, for example, a campaign that I was involved in.

  "<p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/19/donald-trump-presidential-debate-election-result\" title=\"\">final presidential debate</a>, thankfully the last set piece in a wretched campaign, revealed what is admirable and loathsome in American politics. Hillary Clinton displayed a razor-sharp intelligence and a quick wit. Her facility with facts trumped Donald Trump\u2019s lack of them. Americans finally saw on Wednesday why Secretary Clinton had got rich from giving lectures after leaving office. Her fluency with words, which has earned her $22m in speaking fees, appeared to silence her opponent. Mr Trump, a boastful, thin-skinned billionaire who trades in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jun/16/donald-trump-mexico-presidential-speech-latino-hispanic\" title=\"\">racism</a> and misogyny, was left squawking on the sidelines of the debate. His jibes revealed a&#xa0;man out of his depth. His answer was to plunge down deeper. By disgracefully refusing to rule out calling this a rigged election he gave up a fight he had by then lost.</p> <p>Americans should vote for Secretary Clinton as an able and proven politician. A Trump presidency would be bad for America and dangerous for the world, so a vote for Secretary Clinton is the most effective way of preventing it. Mr Trump has been exposed for <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/02/us/politics/donald-trump-taxes.html?_r=0\" title=\"\">questionable tax arrangements</a>, outrageous business practices and irregularities at his charity. The billionaire is a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/07/donald-trump-leaked-recording-women\" title=\"\">grabber and kisser</a> of women who he presumed gave consent because he was famous. There are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/20/donald-trump-sexual-misconduct-tenth-woman-accuser\" title=\"\">numerous allegations</a> of sexual assault by Mr Trump. He has demonstrated that he has neither the conscience, training nor sense of history \u2013 and the desire to be judged well by it \u2013 to occupy the White House. Secretary Clinton possesses such attributes. She has a serious and sustained commitment on issues like education, healthcare and equality, and she has stood consistently for the rights of women, ethnic minorities, children and the disabled through her long career.</p> <p>However, there are fewer reasons to vote for Secretary Clinton than one would have hoped. For more than two decades she has been part of a political establishment that shaped a dysfunctional country. She has been unable to escape being tarnished by the most damaging policies \u2013 notably around <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-36020717\" title=\"\">criminal justice</a> \u2013 of&#xa0;her husband\u2019s administration. There are well-founded concerns, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/16/wikileaks-hillary-clinton-wall-street-goldman-sachs-speeches\" title=\"\">highlighted by transcripts of her speeches</a>, that she is too close to Wall Street to be an effective check on&#xa0;its excesses if&#xa0;elected.</p> <h2>The mood for change</h2> <p>Even so, as the first female president she would represent a symbolic transformative change in American politics. In some ways what Secretary Clinton has had to deal with are ingrained cultural attitudes about what success and leadership look like. These were exposed by the <a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/election-update-women-are-defeating-donald-trump/\" title=\"\">finding that Mr Trump would win if only men voted</a> and Secretary Clinton would win if only women voted. That most men favor Mr&#xa0;Trump over Secretary Clinton demonstrates at some level a more insidious sexism than the one Mr Trump peddles: that centred on the mind, not the body. It is a hostility \u2013 deeply embedded but rarely conceded \u2013 against seeing women as genuinely equal.</p> <p>There is little doubt that the 2016 presidential campaign has been one of the most confrontational contests of the modern era. The mood for change has been more pervasive and volatile, and has been supercharged by Mr Trump, a braggart with tyrannical instincts. The backdrop to this election has been genuine and understandable public anger about economic insecurity, growing inequality and frustration with elites. Mr Trump on the right and Bernie Sanders on the left have reflected that mood in their very different ways. That is not going to disappear after 8 November. The election has also raised real questions about the crisis of American democracy. Mr Trump encouraged violence against opponents and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/10/debate-donald-trump-threatens-to-jail-hillary-clinton\" title=\"\">threatened to jail Secretary Clinton</a> if he took office.</p> <p>The civility that has marked out US democracy as ordered and restrained appears dead. The next president will have to resurrect it. The political topography of a polarized and resentful nation has been obscured by the preternatural equanimity of Barack Obama. Mr Trump has in some ways skilfully exploited these divisions. On social security he has moved to the left on the campaign trail, telling jobless Americans that he would <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/nextavenue/2016/08/08/social-security-where-clinton-and-trump-stand/#6dbc02aa4f40\" title=\"\">not touch their benefits</a>. Mr Trump also wants to repeal the Affordable Care Act, the landmark measure that increases health coverage for low-wage workers and benefits <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/18/health/immigrants-the-poor-and-minorities-gain-sharply-under-health-act.html?_r=0\" title=\"\">large numbers of immigrants and minorities</a>. This contrasts with the real estate magnate\u2019s offer to expand the US health programme for the elderly \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.webmd.com/health-insurance/20161020/clinton-trump-tangle-on-preserving-medicare\" title=\"\">Medicare</a> \u2013 which benefits overwhelmingly older, whiter voters.</p> <p>These dog whistles have been part of American politics for decades. But they come at a time when there is a sense that there are too many losers from economic growth in the country. Driving discontent in the US is a system that no longer defuses high levels of inequality with opportunities for all. The&#xa0;middle classes <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-09-13/u-s-poverty-rate-falls-to-post-recession-low-as-incomes-gain\" title=\"\">are poorer today than in 2000</a>. Since the Great Recession the top <a href=\"http://equitablegrowth.org/research-analysis/u-s-top-one-percent-of-income-earners-hit-new-high-in-2015-amid-strong-economic-growth/\" title=\"\">1% of families in the US have captured 52% of the income growth</a>. There\u2019s understandable anger that the wealthy were bailed out while ordinary Americans were hollowed out. Voters rage that, in the current incarnation of globalization, jobs that disappeared when the US decided to import rather than manufacture did not come back \u2013 they simply popped up elsewhere, usually in China.</p> <h2>The Sanders effect</h2> <p>Nowhere has this fury been more keenly felt than in the country\u2019s former manufacturing heartlands, tapping into America\u2019s long history of resistance to free trade and making protectionism a potent political force once again. The politician who has shaped the politics of the country and accounted for populist anger is Senator Sanders. The man from Vermont understood, earlier than most, that voters see the economy as rigged against them by a political system that has been corrupted by big money. <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/blog/fixgov/2016/06/03/the-democrats-generation-gap/\" title=\"\">His campaign was backed three to one by millennials in the Democratic primaries</a>. This month his favorability ratings in opinion polls <a href=\"https://d25d2506sfb94s.cloudfront.net/cumulus_uploads/document/cx4orjzwhb/econTabReport.pdf\" title=\"\">are only bettered by Michelle&#xa0;Obama</a>.</p> <p>Senator Sanders\u2019 insurgent campaign has transformed Democratic politics \u2013 forcing Secretary Clinton to adopt, albeit sotto voce, <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-election-democrats-sanders-commentary-idUSKCN0Y90C9\" title=\"\">key planks of his program</a> such as a federal minimum wage of $15 an hour, tuition-free public college and opposition to the Trans-Pacific Partnership \u2013 President Obama\u2019s big trade deal. Until this week, Secretary Clinton failed to outline enough of a bold reform program. Tellingly, she offered signs of one in the final televised debate, making unprompted promises to push immigration reforms, a key Sanders point, within the first 100 days of her presidency.</p> <p>Although domestic politics has framed the campaign, Secretary Clinton\u2019s election would be greeted with relief and optimism in most world capitals other than Moscow and Damascus. Despite her <a href=\"http://foreignpolicy.com/2016/07/27/hillary-the-hawk-a-history-clinton-2016-military-intervention-libya-iraq-syria/\" title=\"\">hawkish outlook</a>, she will have no alternative but to recognize that the 21st century no longer always looks to the United States as an indispensable hegemon, whether benign or threatening. Secretary Clinton should focus on US soft, not hard, power \u2013 dealing with climate change and working out fairer global trade arrangements.</p> <p>If Secretary Clinton is elected she must recognize the mood without pandering to its demons. She needs to bring the bold ambition about the role of government to this era that Theodore and Franklin Roosevelt each did in earlier times. She has the intelligence, the seriousness and the experience to do this. The&#xa0;US presidency is hugely powerful: 10% of all posts in federal government are allocated on the basis of political patronage. Secretary Clinton offers the best chance of ensuring those jobs go to competent people. Her choice of Treasury secretary in the aftermath of the banking crisis will be watched with special care, as will an olive branch appointment to Senator Sanders of the kind that president Obama made to her in 2008. She offers the greatest hope that the supreme court defends abortion rights and looks again at issues like campaign finance as well as background checks on gun owners. Yet America will soon find itself weakened at home and abroad if the new president is as badly served by congress as Mr Obama has been for most of his tenure.</p> <p>There is a danger, if Mrs Clinton wins, that&#xa0;the Republicans will relapse into the Hillary-hatred that has marked them for a quarter century.

And the mothers of two of them watched it happen.</p> </blockquote> <p>The most impressive coverage I\u2019ve seen today is by WalesOnline. They have produced <a href=\"http://aberfan.walesonline.co.uk/\">a beautifully designed special feature on Aberfan</a>, which includes the testimony of several survivors and rescue workers who have never spoken publicly before about their experiences.</p> <p>I truly urge you to spend some time reading through it \u2013 I can\u2019t stop thinking about these words by Melvyn Walker about the impact it had on him as an eight year old who had escaped from one of the classrooms:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I couldn\u2019t go to school for two years. Nobody knew, I couldn\u2019t tell anybody. I used to go out and then head up to the mountainside in my uniform and sit there on my own all day.</p> </blockquote> <p>As with many man-made disasters, the bereaved then faced a battle with the authorities to get the true nature of what happened recognised. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/oct/21/aberfan-survivors-mark-50th-anniversary-of-disaster\">As my colleague Steven Morris wrote today</a>, one father stood up during an inquest after the cause of his child\u2019s death had been given as asphyxia and multiple injuries and declared: \u201cNo, sir, buried alive by the National Coal Board. That is what I want to see on record.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a3e8c2be39ce843e856b3be5cd31e57897998416\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a3e8c2be39ce843e856b3be5cd31e57897998416/0_219_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Plaque on the memorial garden to the victims of the Aberfan disaster that was built on the site of Pantglass Junior School\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Plaque on the memorial garden to the victims of the Aberfan disaster that was built on the site of Pantglass Junior School</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Steve Parsons/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-10-21T13:59:31.729Z\">at 2.59pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-580a1d0ce4b0cd26ff71f874\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-21T13:50:29.344Z\">2.50pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>More views below the line on that Brexit vs the NHS question.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-comment\" data-canonical-url=\"https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/85907912\">  <div class=\"d2-comment-embedded\" itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Comment\"> <div class=\"d2-left-col\"> <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/4153533\" title=\"View Qube2\u2019s profile\"> <img class=\"d2-avatar\" src=\"https://avatar.guim.co.uk/user/4153533\" height=\"40\" width=\"40\" alt=\"User avatar for Qube2\"> </a> </div> <div class=\"d2-right-col\"> <div itemscope itemprop=\"author\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\"> <a class=\"d2-username\" href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/4153533\" title=\"View Qube2\u2019s profile\" itemprop=\"url\"> <span itemprop=\"givenName\">Qube2</span> </a> </div> <div class=\"d2-permalink\"> <a class=\"d2-datetime\" href=\"https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/85907912\" title=\"Link to this comment\" itemprop=\"datePublished\">21 October 2016 2:33pm</a> </div> <div class=\"d2-body\" itemprop=\"text\"><p>Tories have a lot of responsibility for the problems within the NHS, but others are based on the system itself. It is simply too large and too centralised, for example patients shouldn't need to travel to a central hospital for an ultrasound; patients and their families shouldn't need to explain the same symptoms/history at every shift change to all the new staff. While emergency care is amazing the primary care can be completely patchy depending on where you're unlucky to be ill. In many European countries private capacity is incorporated into health services and it works remarkably well without fears of money grabbing or lousy service. The problem with the Tory approach is that privatisation never really works in the UK, because making profits becomes paramount and share ownership promoted as a virtuous ideal - there are scant examples of real value and improvements being delivered by privatisation. So the problem is a psychological British one: why can't we do privatisation to actually improve service? Other countries do.</p></div> </div> </div>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5809dda3e4b0cd26ff71f73c\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/guardian-readers\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-21T13:42:26.068Z\">2.42pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Are baby boxes on the way for Scotland?</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Another conversation our team of moderators found particularly interesting this week (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/live/2016/oct/21/baby-boxes-the-nhs-join-our-live-look-at-the-week-to-discuss?page=with:block-5809dccfe4b055209adafd6c#block-5809dccfe4b055209adafd6c\">see 13:35</a>) was around this article on baby boxes in Scotland.

A list of 'things that are normal, so don't worry' with a poo chart, pictures of benign rashes, like cradle cap and the 6 week spots (erythema toxicum neonatorum).

It is scary to suddenly come across part of the British population who must have had a simmering anti-foreign sentiment for a long time. I've lived here longer than I lived in my native country and if someone is asking me now if I wanted to become British to make my life here secure, I think I would have to be nearly desperate to do so as this country is split, with nationalism raising its ugly head. Having read plenty of blogs, I can't but help that many of the people having voted BREXIT have done so because they felt left behind and unheard and are under the impression that they will get back what the lost over the last 40 or so years. What they want back cannot be got back as what they want is for globalisation to go away, as the world is so meshed up now that you can't have control as one has to compromise in this globalised world. If people think that foreign people undercut their own wages, ask if something produced or service rendered more expensive than created or done by people in another country will not be left unbought, making it unproductive so that said UK worker will be out of a job soon, never mind if the competition is working within the UK or in another country.</p></div> </div> </div>  </figure>  <p>What do you think?

  "<p><br>After America went bananas over Donald Trump\u2019s refusal to say he\u2019d accept the results of the presidential election, it seemed almost inevitable that he would keep saying it. When Trump says something that shakes the earth, he\u2019s almost bound to double down. Because <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/16/donald-trump-narcissist-profile\">the only thing Trump loves almost as much as himself is attention</a>.</p> <p>And did he ever double down. It might\u2019ve been a triple down. At a campaign rally on Thursday morning, Trump leaned in hard: \u201cI will totally accept the results of this great and historic presidential election.\u201d Then, in an emphatic cadence that can only be expressed in that internet-y way with extra periods, he delivered this horrifying caveat: \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/20/donald-trump-us-election-result\">If. I. Win.</a>\u201d</p> <p>That it was a punchline seemed evident from Trump\u2019s trademark self-satisfied grin, but this was no joke. Because Trump is backed by a massive constituency whose worst instincts he both harnesses and strengthens.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/20/donald-trump-refuse-concede-election-electoral-college\">What would happen if Donald Trump refused to concede this election?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In this case, that constituency is made up of some 40-odd-percent of Americans who probably thought <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/mar/03/goodbye-ben-carson-thanks-for-the-laughs\">our man Dr Ben Carson</a>\u2019s story about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/sep/05/quiet-rise-ben-carson-republican-presidential-race\">stabbing someone in the belt buckle</a> was a charming anecdote about youthful indiscretions. In other words, Republicans.</p> <p>If you\u2019re the type of person who\u2019s inclined to stick with Trump through everything that\u2019s come out about him, you\u2019re probably going to buy into his bogus claims that the election is \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/16/donald-trump-rigged-election-poll-giuliani-gingrich-pence\">rigged</a>\u201d.<br></p> <p>You see, the normal rules of democracy don\u2019t apply to Donald Trump. Just as Trump doesn\u2019t need to bother with all the traditional electoral stations of the cross \u2013 like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/22/harry-reid-donald-trump-tax-returns-senate-democrats\">presidential candidates releasing their tax returns</a> \u2013 he simply doesn\u2019t have to accept a vote from the American people he doesn\u2019t want.</p> <p>For Trump and his supporters, that leaves only one possible outcome. Trump\u2019s line about accepting the results only if he wins smacks of a man who says <em>of course</em> he believes in getting consent \u2013 but only if she says yes. <em>Of course</em> a peaceful transition is a hallmark of our governmental system; that\u2019s why we have to hand the White House over to Donald Trump.</p> <p>This line of thinking is about as self-serving and circular as it gets. It\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/16/donald-trump-narcissist-profile\">high narcissism</a>. Trump <em>can</em><em>not</em> lose this election. That would make him a loser, and Donald Trump is no loser. Losers are the people Trump mocks, mostly by calling them \u201closers\u201d.</p> <p>So it comes as no surprise that, when Trump put out a call for official \u201cvolunteer Trump Election Observers\u201d \u2013 under the banner \u201c<a href=\"https://www.donaldjtrump.com/landing/volunteer-to-be-a-trump-election-observer\">Help Me Stop Crooked Hillary From Rigging This Election!</a>\u201d \u2013 his supporters began signing on. And you can bet those Trump volunteers with unnecessarily capitalized titles like \u201cTrump Election Observers\u201d are going to take their charge way, way too seriously.<br></p> <p>Their willingness to perform this task is a clear result of the stakes Trump has imposed on the contest. His rhetoric is apocalyptic. And that\u2019s how eagerness builds into a frothing at the mouth; they are ready to go out and make sure America wins by having Donald Trump win. If they have to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/18/donald-trump-volunteer-election-observers-voter-intimidation\">intimidate some voters</a> \u2013 as some fear they will \u2013 by \u201cpoll watching\u201d, so be it. If they need to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/20/citizens-for-donald-trump-exit-poll-roger-stone-rigged-election-claim\">masquerade as exit pollsters in minority neighborhoods in order to do so</a>, no big deal. </p> <p>To make sure America is made great again, they must destroy what is already great about it: democracy. The whole thing has a very mobbed-up flavor; it\u2019s a lot like a boneheaded protection racket where thugs extort so much money from a business that it\u2019s forced to shut down, cutting off a lucrative income stream for the thugs themselves. </p> <p>Nice democracy you got there, Trump and his ilk are telling the rest of us. It\u2019d be a shame if anything happens to it ...</p>",
  "<h2>Trump flops, booed, at Catholic charity fundraiser</h2> <p>If Donald Trump\u2019s campaign has been defined by going where no candidate has gone before, on Thursday the real estate mogul went even further: getting himself roundly booed at a Catholic charity dinner that is usually a moment of bipartisan good cheer in the presidential race. Trump earned some laughs with his address to the crowd \u2013 \u201cmany tell me modesty is my best quality\u201d \u2013 but it quickly deteriorated into an attack on Clinton that prompted jeers from the audience and shouts for him to stop speaking. Clinton retaliated, saying Trump was Russian president Vladimir Putin\u2019s horse.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/21/trump-booed-for-calling-clinton-corrupt-as-bipartisan-dinner-turns-sour\">Donald Trump booed for calling Clinton \u2018corrupt\u2019 as bipartisan dinner turns sour</a></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/oct/21/trump-clinton-speech-jeered-insults-new-york-fundraiser-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/58et7\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2825368\"            data-video-name=\"Trump is jeered during exchange of insults with Clinton at New York fundraiser \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"Reuters/AP\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-58099fe8e4b055209adafc87\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/10/21/161021alsmithedit_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/10/21/161021alsmithedit.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/10/21/161021alsmithedit_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/oct/21/trump-clinton-speech-jeered-insults-new-york-fundraiser-video\">Trump is jeered during exchange of insults with Clinton at New York fundraiser</a></figcaption> </figure>   <h2>Trump plans crowdfunded exit poll</h2> <p>Donald Trump loyalists will attempt to conduct their own crowdfunded exit polling on Election Day, ostensibly due to fears that electronic voting machines in certain areas may have been \u201crigged\u201d, the Guardian has learned. The effort, led by Trump\u2019s notorious informal adviser Roger Stone, will focus on 600 different precincts in nine Democrat-leaning cities with large minority populations, a tactic branded highly irregular by experts, who suggested that organizers could potentially use polling as a way to intimidate voters.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/20/citizens-for-donald-trump-exit-poll-roger-stone-rigged-election-claim\">Trump loyalists plan own exit poll amid claims of \u2018rigged\u2019 election</a></p> <h2>Will the west turn blue?</h2> <p>Across the towns and cities of bone-dry Arizona, voters and pollsters have started to ask openly about a change that seemed nearly glacial, if not impossible, not so long ago: could Democrats take the American west? An Arizona Republic poll released Wednesday showed Clinton up by five percentage points. Nevada, another toss-up state, showed Clinton ahead by seven, and she has an apparent lock on Colorado and New Mexico.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/21/arizona-swing-state-west-democrats-clinton\">Arizona asks \u2018the unprecedented\u2019: could Democrats sweep the west?</a></p> <h2>Clinton\u2019s problem with young black voters</h2> <p>There\u2019s no question that black voters will support Hillary Clinton over Donald Trump in large numbers, but the real question is whether they will actually come out and vote for her. Democrats believe they need a turnout of black voters on par with the numbers reached during the 2008 and 2012 election. As they anxiously try to rally their bases, the concern is that there is limited enthusiasm from black millennial voters.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/21/hillary-clinton-black-millennial-voters\">Why should we trust you?

Then the trouble started. First Megyn Kelly lit into Trump over the candidate\u2019s insulting remarks about women. Then came the ousting of Fox\u2019s founder and chairman Roger Ailes, who left the network in disgrace in July amid a series of allegations of sexual misconduct. Now the chaos of the Trump candidacy is tearing the network in two. But this is the logical conclusion of what Fox News spent nearly 20 years sowing in rightwing politics.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/oct/20/fox-news-changes-donald-trump-rightwing-politics-roger-ailes\">Can Fox News survive the forces it unleashed on the 2016 election?</a></p> <h2>The plight of central American migrants</h2> <p>A M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res study has found that nine out of 10 migrants seen by the charity\u2019s psychologists this year have showed symptoms of anxiety or depression caused by violence and threats suffered during their journeys.

It\u2019s a real honor; he\u2019s taken time out from socializing with his friends to talk to you! Instead of understanding how much of an honor it is, however, you tell him that you\u2019re not really interested.

Bush lost the national popular vote to Gore by 0.51% but won the electoral college by 271 votes to 266.<br></p> \n<p>After initially conceding to Bush on election night and minutes before he was due to formally admit defeat, Gore famously phoned Bush back to explain that circumstances had changed and he now wanted to change his mind. </p> \n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re calling me back to retract your concession,\u201d Bush said.</p> \n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s no need to get snippy about it,\u201d Gore shot back. </p> \n<p>The election result hinged on Florida, where the margin of victory was so slim it triggered a recount. Gore sought recounts in a handful of counties and Bush sued to stop them. A case was ultimately brought before the US supreme court, whose 5-4 decision stopped the recount and in effect awarded Bush Florida\u2019s electoral votes. </p> \n<p>Gore disagreed with the decision but conceded nonetheless. In his concession speech, delivered days before the electoral college vote, Gore quoted Stephen Douglas, who lost the presidency to Abraham Lincoln: \u201cPartisan feeling must yield to patriotism. I\u2019m with you, Mr President and God bless you.\u201d</p>",
  "<p></p> <p>Donald Trump has boasted of being the law and order candidate, but legal scholars and ex-government ethics officials have warned against what they see as his cavalier attitude toward potential conflicts of interest and the rule of law, based on the Republican presidential nominee\u2019s rhetoric and policy stances.</p> <p>Specifically, ethics and legal scholars say that Trump\u2019s notion of creating a supposed \u201cblind trust\u201d for his businesses, if he becomes president, that would let his children run the Trump Organization without an independent trustee is risible. Trump told Fox News last month: \u201cI will sever my connections and I\u2019ll have my children and my executives run the company, and I wouldn\u2019t discuss it with them.\u201d</p> <p>He told CNN last month that \u201cI would most likely put it in a blind trust and they [his children and executives] would run it, or something.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-money-blog/2016/apr/21/donald-trump-brand-white-house-business-empire\">Why winning the White House would be the best deal of Donald Trump's business career</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This, legal experts say, is not how a blind trust is supposed to work. Richard Painter, who served as chief ethics lawyer for President George W Bush, says that in a true blind trust \u201cthe trustee has to be independent of the office holder and certainly not the sons and daughter\u201d. Additionally, he said, Trump would have to sell off his real estate assets and an independent trustee would then have to place his funds or investments in a new trust without revealing the contents to Trump or his children.</p> <p>Other legal scholars concur. \u201cAbsent a truly blind trust, Mr Trump would be able to make decisions that could benefit his business interests,\u201d says Lloyd H Mayer, a law professor and tax specialist at Notre Dame. \u201cNothing Trump has said indicates he\u2019s interested in setting up a truly blind trust where neither he, nor his family members, nor his close associates would know what\u2019s going on.\u201d</p> <p>The criticisms of Trump\u2019s blind trust proposal echo other recent controversies over legal issues over which Trump has faced fire from scholars and former government officials for challenging, or ignoring, social and legal norms through his policy stances.</p> <p>Some legal scholars, for instance, note that Trump has shown contempt for press freedoms by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/feb/26/trump-pledges-curb-press-freedom-libel-laws-first-amendment\">advocating changing the libel laws</a> to make it easier to sue the media \u2013 and \u201cmake lots of money\u201d in Trump\u2019s words \u2013 while using inflammatory words to paint a picture of a vast press conspiracy ranged against him.</p> <p>Painter sees Trump\u2019s talk of changing libel laws as glib and dangerous since he \u201cdoesn\u2019t acknowledge there\u2019s a constitutional problem\u201d, given the first amendment right to free speech.</p> <p>In a similar vein, Trump\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/20/donald-trump-us-election-result\">stonewalling and equivocating over whether he would accept the election results</a> \u2013 win or lose \u2013 drew widespread bipartisan fire as a rebuke to the principles of democracy.<br></p> <h2>Conflicts of interest</h2> <p>Most recent presidents have taken pains to curb conflicts of interest or appearance problems \u2013 even though the president and vice-president are exempt from the conflict of interest statute that other executive branch officials have to follow.</p> <p>But legal scholars say that Trump would potentially face more conflict of interest problems than previous presidents given the global nature of his real estate empire and business dealings \u2013 from Azerbaijan to Turkey and from China to India \u2013which could be impacted by government economic or foreign policy decisions and often involve licensing agreements with his name and brand on hotels plus residential and office properties.</p> <p>\u201cWhile Donald Trump\u2019s conflicts of interest would arguably be more extreme than those of previous presidents, who have used blind trusts to hold and manage their assets while in office, this kind of arrangement would not work for Trump because he has integrated his children into the management of his business operation, and his assets are so closely tied to his name and identity,\u201d says Kathleen Clark, a law professor at Washington University who specializes in legal ethics.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4c1008c96c9f33cdd5fc5d9a8f7cae7d3752e6c8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4c1008c96c9f33cdd5fc5d9a8f7cae7d3752e6c8/173_0_4526_2715/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Donald Trump\u2019s conflicts of interest would arguably be more extreme than those of previous presidents.\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Donald Trump\u2019s conflicts of interest would arguably be more extreme than those of previous presidents.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: George Frey/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Further, Trump and his businesses could face legal risks under the constitution\u2019s emoluments clause, an ethics measure that bars a president from receiving gifts or payments from foreign governments, or entities controlled by those governments. Painter points out that Trump\u2019s real estate empire has often relied on foreign bank loans \u2013 including from the Bank of China \u2013 which could create problems if new loans were made, or old ones renegotiated, under terms that deviated from normal rates, thus giving Trump\u2019s businesses a financial edge.</p> <p>Other experts agree that the emoluments clause could impact Trump\u2019s businesses. \u201cIf Donald Trump\u2019s business arrangements involve his receiving payments, directly or indirectly, from a foreign government or an entity it controls, that would violate the emoluments clause,\u201d Clark said.</p> <p>As legal criticism has escalated of Trump\u2019s unusual concept of a blind trust, his son Eric Trump last month tried to defend it in an ABC television interview by noting that his father would not make decisions as \u201cit relates to the company\u201d, and that \u201cwe\u2019re not going to be involved in government\u201d.</p> <p>Those broad assertions haven\u2019t quieted critics of Trump\u2019s notion of a blind trust. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t even have cosmetic value because his interests are presumably aligned with his kids\u2019,\u201d says Ken Gross, a partner with Skadden Arps Slate Meagher &amp; Flom.</p>",

This complexity makes the notion of a \u201crigged\u201d national election, at least in the US, logistically intimidating to the point of impossibility. Thirty-one states have Republican governors, including the swing states of Florida, North Carolina, Iowa, Nevada and Ohio; Pennsylvania only elected a Democratic governor in 2015.

Both Democrats and Republicans, including Trump supporters Paul Ryan and Marco Rubio, have rejected his doubts about the electoral system. </p> <p>If Trump loses the presidential election, it will be because American voters do not want him in the White House, not because of a conspiracy involving Republicans and Democrats alike at state and city levels around the nation \u2013 a conspiracy for which Trump has provided no evidence.</p> <p><strong>\u201cThe following information comes straight from Pew Research, quote: \u2018approximately 24 million people, one of every eight, voter registrations in the United States are no longer valid or significantly inaccurate.\u2019\u201d </strong>\u2013 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGYKDqqOwG0\">17 October, Green Bay, Wisconsin</a></p> <p>Trump is quoting <a href=\"http://www.pewtrusts.org/~/media/legacy/uploadedfiles/pcs_assets/2012/pewupgradingvoterregistrationpdf.pdf\">a study about voter registration</a>, not about actual voting practice, as he misleadingly suggests. The Pew study points out that inefficiencies among state registrars are mostly the cause of innocent, if unfortunate, circumstances: one in eight Americans moved between 2008 and 2010, many pushed by the financial crisis, which also strained local budgets, and 51 million more Americans were not registered anywhere to vote at the time of the study.</p> <p><strong>\u201cMore than 1.8 million deceased individuals right now are listed as voters.

The report nowhere suggests that 1.8 million dead people have cast any votes, only that registrars have failed to catch up with deaths. Nor does it suggest that people who registered in more than one state have actually voted in more than one state. The report also highlights problems with registering in the first place: in 2008, 2.2m votes \u201cwere lost because of registration problems\u201d, and another 5.7 million people \u201cfaced a registration problem that needed to be resolved before voting\u201d. </p> <p><strong>\u201cThe following comes from a 2014 report from the Washington Post, [titled] \u2018Could non-citizens decide the November election?\u2019 \u2026 More than 14% of non-citizens in both 2008 and 2012 samples indicated that they were registered to vote.\u201d </strong>\u2013 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGYKDqqOwG0\">17 October, Green Bay, Wisconsin</a></p> <p>Trump omits important context for the article in question, which was written by two academics <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2014/10/24/could-non-citizens-decide-the-november-election/\">on the Washington Post\u2019s Monkey Cage blog</a> about their own study.

But an Arizona Republic poll released on Wednesday showed Clinton up by five percentage points, the first survey taken during the general election in which she was ahead of Trump by more than the margin of error.</p> <p>The most recent poll in Nevada, another toss-up state, showed Clinton ahead by seven. She has an apparent lock on Colorado and New Mexico, and the entire west coast in her column. There are even questions about Trump\u2019s strength in bright red Utah, where he has alienated Mormon voters with his comments about women, accusations of sexual harassment, three marriages and admitted affair. </p> <p>\u201cI could see Clinton sweeping the west,\u201d said Samara Klar, an assistant professor of political science at the University of Arizona. \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s out of the question.

Now get out of the ladies\u2019 dressing room.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Just a few breaths later he skewered Trump again over the allegations of sexual assault and a lewd tape in which the former reality TV star bragged of kissing and groping women without their consent.</p> <p>\u201cDon, even though there\u2019s a man sitting next to you in a robe, you\u2019re not in a locker room,\u201d Smith told the New York developer in his hometown. \u201cSo please watch your language.\u201d</p> <p><br></p>",

45,\u201d she added, in reference to the number marking the next president\u2019s place in US history.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58097cf0e4b0cd26ff71f5ba\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-21T02:27:11.392Z\">3.27am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Donald Trump\u2019s staff is throwing him under the bus...</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/RosieGray/status/789286023721287680\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">So I have a senior Trump source claiming Trump wrote his Al Smith speech himself. \ud83e\udd14</p>&mdash; Rosie Gray (@RosieGray) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RosieGray/status/789286023721287680\">October 21, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58097b1de4b0cd26ff71f5b5\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-21T02:19:26.364Z\">3.19am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Donald Trump's full speech to the Alfred Smith Dinner</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Watch and cringe:</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNoQI8_J_gA\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ZNoQI8_J_gA?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5809750de4b055209adafbe7\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-21T01:53:28.766Z\">2.53am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Kellyanne Conway is taking Hillary Clinton\u2019s jokes in stride:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/KellyannePolls/status/789281519777046528\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">A shout out from <a href=\"https://twitter.com/HillaryClinton\">@HillaryClinton</a> at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/AlSmithDinner?src=hash\">#AlSmithDinner</a> ... <a href=\"https://t.co/DgHcT5kkFG\">https://t.co/DgHcT5kkFG</a></p>&mdash; Kellyanne Conway (@KellyannePolls) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/KellyannePolls/status/789281519777046528\">October 21, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-580972fee4b055209adafbe3\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-21T01:45:00.290Z\">2.45am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <h2>Donald Trump, the moment of the loudest boos:</h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Here she is tonight, in public, pretending not to hate Catholics.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/BraddJaffy/status/789276963441614848\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Here&#39;s video of Trump getting booed down during his set at the Al Smith Dinner <a href=\"https://t.co/025zgItcfy\">pic.twitter.com/025zgItcfy</a></p>&mdash; Bradd Jaffy (@BraddJaffy) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BraddJaffy/status/789276963441614848\">October 21, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-10-21T01:47:24.451Z\">at 2.47am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-580972d9e4b0cd26ff71f599\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-21T01:43:58.612Z\">2.43am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>YIKES.</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Kesha_Monk/status/789275105511759872\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">I don&#39;t know why I&#39;m watching this <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/AlSmithDinner?src=hash\">#AlSmithDinner</a> ... but I&#39;m so glad I caught this part.

Much like a Trump rally, the Facebook Live event brought in a massive crowd of viewers, and the campaign saw record-breaking engagement numbers, proving Mr. Trump\u2019s message is resonating across the board.</p> <p>24 million people were reached during the ground breaking Facebook Live event, which translated into 8.8 million video views, 91 percent of which were unique users. These viewers watched 11.8 million minutes of content, the equivalent to 22 years of view time, which illustrates the strength of the event\u2019s reach. There were 1.3 million comments made about the event, which garnered over 8 million post engagements making it one of the largest debate discussions on the internet.</p> <p>The enormous groundswell of support for Mr. Trump spurred an impressive fundraising effort as well, generating $9 million in contributions from an excess of 150 thousand donors.</p> <p>Mr. Trump has said many times that this is not a campaign, it\u2019s a movement. That is evident in the size of the crowds our campaign rallies attract, and also in the unprecedented level of engagement sparked by Mr. Trump\u2019s social media activity. According to an analysis by the Center for Public Integrity, more than 96 percent of presidential campaign contributions made by members of the media have gone to Hillary Clinton. Our pre-and-post-debate Facebook Live event gave the Trump campaign an opportunity to leverage our candidate\u2019s massive digital footprint to take our message straight to millions of voters, without the filter of the clearly biased media.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-580958b3e4b005f21833b9df\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-20T23:52:34.453Z\">12.52am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <h2>The Internet has crowned this President Obama\u2019s greatest burn:</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/scottbix/status/789204320184963072\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">President Obama: Marco Rubio is &quot;willing to be anybody just to be somebody.&quot;</p>&mdash; Scott Bixby (@scottbix) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/scottbix/status/789204320184963072\">October 20, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5809562fe4b0cd26ff71f531\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/olivia-solon\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-20T23:42:19.109Z\">12.42am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/silicon-valley\">Silicon Valley</a> billionaire Peter Thiel should not be ousted from Facebook\u2019s board for his political views, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos has said, even though he believes Donald Trump\u2019s actions \u201cerode democracy\u201d.</p> <p>Speaking at the Vanity Fair New Establishment Summit in San Francisco, the entrepreneur described how the Republican <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/13/amazon-getting-away-with-on-tax-says-donald-trump\">presidential candidate had attacked him on Twitter</a>, making allegations that he bought the Washington Post to exert political power and avoid paying taxes.</p> <p>\u201cMy first instinct was to take it very lightly,\u201d said Bezos, explaining how he responded to Trump using the humorous hashtag #SendDonaldToSpace. \u201cI have a rocket company so the capability is there.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/JeffBezos/status/674008204838199297\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Finally trashed by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump\">@realDonaldTrump</a>.

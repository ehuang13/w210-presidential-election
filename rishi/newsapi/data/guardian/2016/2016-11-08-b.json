The Republican-controlled legislatures efforts to introduce one of the strictest forms of photo-ID requirements in the country has led to widespread confusion, Perez said.</p> <p>The coalition has found numerous cases of signs being posted on the walls of polling stations that incorrectly inform voters about Texas\u2019 photo-ID criteria.</p> <p>Many complaints have come in about alleged intimidation of voters outside polling stations from a number of states. \u201cWe\u2019ve certainly heard from voters complaining about this, though it\u2019s going to be very hard to tell how organized it was. It\u2019s too early to tell whether it was an individual action or something more planned.\u201d</p> <p>One development that Perez said would have to be reviewed after the dust has settled from this election was the proliferation of poll watchers. The 2016 election cycle, given the degree of suspicion around, had spawned the surreal phenomenon of poll watchers observing voters and then poll monitors watching them.</p> <p>\u201cWe are creating a culture of multiple layers of people observing each other, which produces it\u2019s own challenges.

She was born in January 1920, months before the final state ratified the 19<sup>th</sup> Amendment, which granted women the right to vote. Now, the 96-year-old, who immigrated to America from Russia as a child, is looking forward to voting for a woman herself. \u201cI\u2019ve hoped for a long time that this day would come,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Diamond is just one of many women born before the 19<sup>th</sup>Amendment profiled on the website <a href=\"http://iwaited96years.com/\">iwaited96years.com</a>: different women from different backgrounds sharing the same excitement about this historic moment. In a lifetime they\u2019ve gone from being disenfranchised because of their sex to casting a vote for, potentially, the first female President of the United States.</p> <p>There\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.iwaited96years.com/eugenia\">Eugenia Perkins</a>, 102, in North Carolina: \u201cIt is about time there was a woman President!\u201d</p> <p>There\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.iwaited96years.com/lung-hsin\">Lung Hsin Wu</a>, 98, in Oregon, by way of Beijing: \u201cMy vote means another step towards equity for women!\u201d</p> <p>And there\u2019s Diamond, who says: \u201cSince as long as I can remember\u2026I don\u2019t want to be better than men. I want to be equal to them. You\u2019re a second-class citizen if you\u2019re not.\u201d</p> <p>Women\u2019s rights have progressed a lot in Diamond\u2019s lifetime, but there\u2019s still a way to go. \u201cWhen you hear the difference in salaries between men and woman for the same job and the men get more than you do\u2026\u201d she shakes her head. \u201cMaybe Hillary can help.\u201d</p> <p>Diamond has been doing as much campaigning as she can for Clinton. When her assisted living facility had early voting a couple of weeks ago she got a placard of Hillary made up \u201csat 50 feet away from the voting booth\u201d doing last minute electioneering.</p> <p>Diamond thinks the final result will be close. But whether Clinton wins or not, \u201cshe\u2019s opened the door for future women to think about running and that\u2019s important. I\u2019m sure there will be others, maybe not in my lifetime.

I was pleasantly surprised to only wait about 15 minutes in line, and I am so grateful for the friendly attitudes and efficiency of the volunteers. The voting process went smoothly, and regardless of how long anyone has to wait in line, I encourage you to vote. Quite frankly, there is too much at stake in this election. My girlfriend and I are going to order takeout and watch the election results tonight... Regardless of which candidate wins Missouri this year, I\u2019m proud to say I cast my ballot to promote a better political future for myself as a young adult, and a better future for all Americans.</p> <p><strong>Steve Pearcy from Manassas, Virginia says his mom would have liked to have seen today:</strong></p> <p>When my mom and dad were born, a woman couldn\u2019t vote in the US. A black man theoretically could vote, but his right to do so was usually denied, usually, alas, by Democrats in the south. Folks from poor backgrounds like my folks didn\u2019t really have much chance of going to college to change their lot in life. If someone without money got seriously ill, they usually died, like my grand-uncle\u2019s young wife and their two-year old child in the flu epidemic of 1918.</p> <p>A little over 40 years later when I was born, a woman could vote in the US. Barriers to black folk voting would be torn down a few years later with the Civil Rights and Voting Rights Acts, laws pushed through by more visionary Democrats. A few years later Medicare and Medicaid programs were enacted by Democrats so people without means had access to health care. A woman and man of different races could not marry in many states of the US. My father, who grew up on a tenant farm in Missouri, went to college after World War II with the GI Bill. My brother would go to college a few years after I was born, my mother would get her degree 14 years after I was born, and from an early age I just assumed I\u2019d go to college. As a kid, my grandmother used to say with pride, \u201cI\u2019m a Baptist and a Democrat,\u201d and my parents took me to vote and see them vote for Democrats because the Democratic party tried to help all people, not just the rich.</p> <p>A little over 40 years after I was born, I sat with my parents and cheered and cried as we watched as Barack Obama, the son of a white woman and a black man, was nominated to be the Democratic candidate for president. Unfortunately there were and still are folk who try to keep people of color from voting, but such efforts have the boom-a-rang effect of making people more determined to vote. More and more people in the United States are getting the chance to go to college. The Affordable Care Act enacted by Democrats provides access to health care to millions who did not have access before. People of all races can marry anyone who they wish. The country continues to try to be better with every generation, to try to be a more perfect union.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-11-08T21:25:46.074Z\">at 9.25pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-58222cd2e4b0eda0192fd8a9\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/sam-thielman\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-08T19:52:43.099Z\">7.52pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Trump cited voting machine malfunctions on CNN on Tuesday afternoon when he again refused to say whether he would concede the election if he lost.

One of them was tied to a broom stick with blue rope and had a very length message on the front. It mostly discussed Trump\u2019s mental health. People are actually allowed to go into Trump Tower, if they were prepared to brave the sanitation trucks, metal barricades, and police.

It\u2019s election day, but we\u2019ll resist the temptation to wax dramatic. No reflections on the historical import of a day that could see the election of the first woman US president, or of Donald Trump. No musing about just how long these last 18 months have sometimes felt. No solicitations after your personal health, mental and physical, at this, the (apparent) end of our collective slog through a muddy field of base discourse, objectionable behavior and trampled bunting.</p> <p>There were some happy moments in there! We think. And we will recall them just as soon as the votes are counted. Which brings us to the main business of the day: bringing you the election results, as soon as they come in, from Maine to Alaska. That\u2019s the purpose of today\u2019s blog, and that\u2019s what you can expect as the polls begin to close, initial returns come back, state results are declared and the identity of the 45th president of the United States is revealed.</p> <p>When will we know who was elected president? In 2000, they didn\u2019t know until December. But that was exceptional. With any luck tonight, we\u2019ll know the identity of the next president before the clock ticks into Wednesday on the east coast. The first polls opened in New Hampshire at midnight - with three tiny towns allowing midnight voting and immediate results. </p> <p>Out of the 64 ballots cast in those three counties, Trump nabbed 32 votes, Clinton got 25 and three went to Libertarian Gary Johnson.</p> <p>The last polls, in the Aleutian Islands of Alaska, aren\u2019t due to close until 1am ET.

  "<p>The Dakota Access pipeline operator chose the day of the US presidential <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2016/nov/08/us-election-2016-polls-trump-clinton-results-live\">election</a> to announce that the final phase of its controversial construction project will begin in two weeks \u2013 marking a bold escalation in its response to the Native American protests.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/03/north-dakota-access-oil-pipeline-protests-explainer\">Dakota Access pipeline: the who, what and why of the Standing Rock protests</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Energy Transfer Partners, the company overseeing the North Dakota oil pipeline, has already completed construction up to the river that provides water to the Standing Rock Sioux tribe and announced on Tuesday it would soon begin drilling at the site.</p> <p>The company said it would not halt construction, despite requests by federal agencies to delay the project as the US government reassesses permits and considers possible reroutes.</p> <p>In a statement, Energy Transfer Partners said it was \u201cmobilizing horizontal drilling equipment\u201d in preparation for tunneling under Lake Oahe, a reservoir on the Missouri river by the protest camps and Native American reservation. The corporation said it would be ready to start crossing the water in two weeks.</p> <p>The announcement came on a quiet election day at the encampments built by members of the Standing Rock Sioux nation and other indigenous people in opposition to the pipeline.</p> <p>After a string of clashes and mass arrests, rumors spread among activists that the pipeline, government and tribal leaders had negotiated a <a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/environment/2016/11/dakota-access-pipeline-standing-rock-delay\">30-day moratorium</a> on both construction and protest or religious ceremonies on the \u201cfront lines\u201d of the conflict.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m in shock. I\u2019m speechless,\u201d said Cheryl Angel, a Sicangu Lakota tribe member who has been at the Standing Rock camps since the spring. \u201cIt\u2019s unconscionable and devastating. It\u2019s almost as though they have no soul.\u201d</p> <p>The announcement presents the final phase of construction as a done deal, and will be seen as a clear illustration that the oil company is aggressively moving forward with the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/03/north-dakota-access-oil-pipeline-protests-explainer\">$3.7bn pipeline</a> in defiance of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/02/dakota-access-obama-suggests-ways-to-reroute-pipeline-being-investigated\">Barack Obama</a> and the thousands of demonstrators who are camped out at Standing Rock to fight the project.</p> <p>Last week, Obama made his first remarks on the huge demonstrations since police <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/27/north-dakota-access-pipeline-protest-arrests-pepper-spray\">arrested hundreds of unarmed protesters</a>, who call themselves \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/18/north-dakota-pipeline-activists-bakken-oil-fields\">water protectors</a>\u201d and say the pipeline is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/29/north-dakota-oil-pipeline-protest-standing-rock-sioux\">destroying sacred indigenous lands</a>.</p> <p>The president said the US army corps of engineers was exploring ways to \u201creroute\u201d around Native American lands, and said the government was \u201cgoing to let it play out for several more weeks, and determine whether or not this can be resolved in a way that I think is properly attentive to the traditions of the first Americans\u201d.</p> <p>In September, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/12/north-dakota-standing-rock-protests-civil-rights\">government said</a> it would temporarily <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/joint-statement-department-justice-department-army-and-department-interior-regarding-standing\">halt permits</a> to dig on federal land near or under the Missouri river and requested that the company \u201cvoluntarily pause all construction activity within 20 miles east or west\u201d of Lake Oahe.</p> <p>Energy Transfer Partners ignored that request and continued construction, recently <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/31/north-dakota-access-pipeline-protest-last-stand\">approaching within a few miles of the river</a>, causing widespread anger and sadness at the Standing Rock camps, which have been opposing the pipeline since April.</p> <p>Tuesday\u2019s statement does not address the requests from the government for a delay. On the contrary, it suggests that the company is not giving consideration to alternative routes or Obama\u2019s recent remarks.</p> <p>\u201cDakota Access previously received a permit from the army corps with respect the tunneling activities under Lake Oahe, and Dakota Access has all other regulatory approvals and land rights to complete the crossing of the Missouri river at Lake Oahe,\u201d the statement said, adding that the company expects to receive final permissions \u201cin a time frame that will not result in any significant delay\u201d.</p> <p>The army corps did not respond to requests for comment.</p> <p>Asked about Obama\u2019s comments, pipeline spokeswoman Vicki Granado told the Guardian: \u201cWe are not aware that any consideration is being given to a reroute, and we remain confident we will receive our easement in a timely fashion.\u201d</p> <p>The company\u2019s announcement comes as North Dakota regulators are moving ahead with a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/05/dakota-access-oil-pipeline-native-american-artifacts-discovered\">formal complaint against the corporation</a> for failing to properly disclose findings of Native American artifacts along the construction route.</p> <p>Angel said the pipeline construction plan was \u201cenvironmentally irresponsible\u201d and \u201cillegal\u201d considering the army corps has yet to approve final permits. Noting that the Missouri river provided drinking water to millions, she added: \u201cI\u2019m in tears, because I can\u2019t believe [the company] would do this to a whole group of people who don\u2019t have any say.\u201d</p> <p>This past Sunday, more than a hundred water protectors used boats to ferry across the Cannonball river and attempted to climb \u201cTurtle Island\u201d \u2013 a portion of army corps land where tribal members say there are 11 burial sites. Several tribal elders, including Darrel Killsinsight, implored everyone to return to the main camp, referencing the alleged 30-day agreement.</p> <p>But representatives of the tribe never officially confirmed that any such agreement was in place, and Tuesday\u2019s statement flies in the face of any hope for a moratorium. </p> <p>Jan Hasselman, the attorney representing the Standing Rock Sioux in its permit litigation, said that the statement from Dakota Access was probably a <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-north-dakota-pipeline-energy-transfer-idUSKBN1332QZ?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=domesticNews&amp;utm_medium=Social&amp;utm_source=Twitter\">response to an army corps spokesman</a> telling Bloomberg that the company had agreed to slow construction. But, she added, Dakota Access does not have all the permits it needs to begin drilling, including the easement. </p> <p>\u201cStarting construction without permits would be beyond the pale, even for Dakota Access,\u201d Hasselman told the Guardian. \u201cIt is deeply irresponsible to keep putting investors\u2019 money into this route when both the President and Senator Tim Kaine are openly discussing rerouting away from Lake Oahe.\u201d</p> <p>The timing of the announcement on election day instantly raised suspicion \u2013 and anger \u2013 among the activists gathered at Standing Rock. Activists have expressed frustration with the US presidential race, noting that Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2016/oct/27/north-dakota-access-pipeline-police-protesters-live-updates?page=with:block-58129388e4b08d944ba4b6f5#block-58129388e4b08d944ba4b6f5\">refused</a> to take a position on the conflict and GOP candidate <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/26/donald-trump-dakota-access-pipeline-investment-energy-transfer-partners\">Donald Trump has close financial ties to the pipeline</a>.</p> <p>\u201cWith the election being so big, and North Dakota being so small, they think they can just sweep this under the rug,\u201d said Danny Grassrope, a member of the Lower Brule Sioux Tribe. \u201cI\u2019m not really surprised. Snakes are sneaky, and this is a black snake. It blindsides everyone.\u201d</p> <p>He added: \u201cA lot of people are going to get angry, and this is where we need to stay positive. We need prayers more than ever now.\u201d</p> <p>The protesters were also disappointed that Obama has not condemned the highly militarized police force in North Dakota, which has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/04/dakota-access-pipeline-protest-standing-rock-women-police-abuse\">arrested more than 400 people</a> and deployed Mace, Tasers, rubber bullets and army tanks to respond to demonstrations.</p> <p>A UN group is also investigating claims of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/29/dakota-access-pipeline-native-american-protesters\">inhumane jail treatment</a> and other human rights abuses by law enforcement.</p> <p>\u201cAre indigenous people so invaluable that now that Dakota Access is to the water, does it not matter to anyone that people are going to start laying down their lives?\u201d asked Eryn Wise, a member of the Jicarilla Apache and Laguna Pueblo tribes.</p> <p>\u201cI think that people need to seriously question the integrity of the work produced by DAPL right now, because they\u2019re rushing,\u201d Wise added. \u201cIs it safe when they\u2019ve been rushing like this?\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 The headline on this article was amended on 11 November 2016 to better reflect the article.</p>",

John Higgins at consultancy Capital Economics said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>A victory for Hillary Clinton in the presidential race was heavily discounted on the day of the vote. So we doubt that there will be much of a response in the markets today if she has triumphed. But a win for Donald Trump could cause major upheaval.</p> <p>For example, a victory for Trump would probably send the dollar down sharply against other \u201cmajors\u201d, particularly the Swiss franc and the Japanese yen. We would expect the yen/dollar exchange rate to break below 100, compared to a current level of nearly 105. We would also anticipate a sharp rise in the dollar against some emerging market currencies. For example, the Mexican peso could hit 25/$, versus 19/$ or so now.</p> <p>In our view, a Trump win would also have large effects on equities. For example, we think the S&amp;P 500 would fall below 2,000, compared to a current level of around 2,130. And many stock market indices elsewhere would probably fare worse. The Nikkei 225 could be hit especially hard by accompanying strength in the yen \u2013 we wouldn\u2019t be surprised if it tumbled below 15,000, versus a current level of more than 17,000. And there would probably a broad-based rout in emerging markets.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9a93ec2b8167d4198cafd8cfd932aa8bbbd8d631\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9a93ec2b8167d4198cafd8cfd932aa8bbbd8d631/0_117_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Traders on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange as the US votes\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Traders on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange as the US votes</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Brendan Mcdermid/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <blockquote> <p>We suspect that US Treasuries would rally if Trump won, with the 10-year yield falling to 1.5% from around 1.8%. Admittedly, he has talked about defaulting on the national debt, has a fiscal plan that includes unfunded tax cuts and has proposed trade tariffs that would boost inflation. But a plunge in risky asset prices would prompt a reassessment of the near-term outlook for Fed policy and boost the demand for safe havens.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the initial uncertainty following a victory for Trump would surely undermine the prices of industrial commodities, including oil and base metals, while gold would benefit from a renewed burst of safe-haven demand. In the short term, therefore, we would expect crude oil to fall to around $40 and gold to surge to at least $1,400. The impact of the dollar is a further wildcard. A big fall in the value of the US currency would limit the downside for the dollar prices of industrial commodities, while adding to the upside for gold. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5821ee7ae4b029b92ca46a78\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-08T15:31:34.879Z\">3.31pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Back with the presidential election, and if Hillary Clinton wins, it would give a green light to the Federal Reserve to raise US interest rates in December, says Kathleen Brooks, research director at City Index:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Markets have rushed to price in a rate hike from the Fed in recent days, the current implied probability of one 25 basis point hike next month is 82%, up from 68% a week ago.

There is nothing constructive to be said today on the political noise, so perhaps we should look to the challenges ahead.</li> <li>Prejudice is one of the biggest threats to economic and social stability. Prejudice is on the rise. Declaring a group in society to be \u201csecond class\u201d undermines their economic contribution \u2013 increasingly so in today\u2019s changing world. Politicians must tackle prejudice head-on; it is morally and economically the right thing to do.<br></li> <li>Global trade patterns are changing. Lengthening supply chains and outsourcing are outdated as localized production reintroduces the imperial trade model, and technology means that trade in services is increasingly important. Politicians need to stop living the trade of the past, and embrace the trade of the future.<br></li> <li>Jobs do not disappear; jobs become different.

But, while building up his new political movement, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/07/frances-emmanuel-macron-launches-political-movement\">En Marche!</a>, he has played a long game, feeding months of speculation over his intentions and whether or not he would run.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/11/emmanuel-macron-will-frances-young-economy-minister-launch-presidential-bid\">Will France's young economy minister \u2013 with a volunteer army \u2013 launch presidential bid?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Macron will \u201cdeclare his candidacy before 10 December\u201d a member of his team told Agence France-Presse on Tuesday. \u201cAll the conditions are in place.\u201d</p> <p>Macron\u2019s camp then played this down, saying only that he would make a decision on whether or not to run for president before 10 December, when he would hold a large rally in Paris. </p> <p>Speeding up the launch of a possible presidential bid would allow Macron to exploit the deep divisions on the French left. The Socialist party is in disarray, with a recent poll showing only 4% of people were satisfied with Hollande. The party base is increasingly disillusioned and there are serious questions over whether Hollande, or anyone else from the Socialist party, could even make it into the final runoff of the presidential race next May. </p> <p>The French presidential election is more open than any previously. Hollande is France\u2019s least popular president since the second world war, and is expected to announce next month whether he will attempt a re-election bid that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/07/francois-hollande-would-be-swept-aside-in-presidential-election-poll-shows\">some predict</a> is already doomed. Meanwhile, the far-right Front National\u2019s Marine Le Pen is tipped to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/18/nation-state-marine-le-pen-global-mood-france-brexit-trump-front-national\">easily make it through</a> to the final runoff. </p> <p>The French right will choose its presidential candidate in a primary race at the end of this month. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/14/alain-juppe-france-prophet-happiness-presidential-wows-rally-crowd\">Alain Jupp\u00e9</a>, the pro-business and socially moderate mayor of Bordeaux, is the favourite to win ahead of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/19/le-comeback-kid-sarkozy-shapes-up-for-presidential-run-on-hardline-platform\">former president Nicolas Sarkozy</a>, who has run an increasingly hardline campaign, veering towards the themes of the far right. </p> <p>But it is the first time the right has held an open primary race to choose its candidate, making the turnout and result hard to predict. Jupp\u00e9 is currently rated France\u2019s most popular politician, and Macron \u2013 who shares similar free-market reform ideas \u2013 is the second most popular.</p> <p>Macron prides himself on his independence and belonging to no political party, saying it doesn\u2019t matter he has never before run for elected office. He describes himself as of the left but keen to bring together people from across the whole spectrum, including the right. Polls show he is most popular among rightwing, older and professional voters. But pollsters have said Macron has his work cut out to expand his support base.</p> <p>Only two years ago, when Macron was Hollande\u2019s chief adviser in the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace, he was totally unknown to the general public. The philosophy postgraduate and former Rothschild banker\u2019s rise to government minister was so extraordinary and unconventional that he is still known as a \u201cflying saucer\u201d on the political scene.</p> <p>Five years ago the notion that someone with no constituency or political party and no electoral experience could be a serious contender for the French presidency would have been unthinkable. But Macron \u2013 a pro-reformist, pro-business figure who served for two years in a Socialist government while insisting he was \u201cneither left nor right\u201d \u2013 has spent months building up financial and strategic backing for a presidential bid. He is seen as a product of the times: a non-politician wanting to take on politics. Yet, though he is a rebel, he is also a product of the establishment as a former minister and graduate of France\u2019s top civil service school. He is seen as someone new, but a safe pair of hands.</p> <p>As economy minister, Macron regularly launched scathing attacks on the left\u2019s defining characteristics \u2013 from the 35-hour-week to the large public sector \u2013 and repeatedly criticised the discrimination and inequality that still defined France\u2019s high-rise suburban estates. Not afraid of grand metaphors, Macron has likened his own rebellious streak to France\u2019s 15th-century saint and saviour, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/26/joan-of-arc-ring-stays-in-france-after-appeal-to-queen\">Joan of Arc</a>.</p> <p>He has not yet set out his political platform \u2013 which he calls a mission to \u201ctransform France\u201d \u2013 but he has spoken of the need to cure France of its \u201cdemocratic malaise\u201d, warning of people\u2019s distrust of the political class.</p> <p>He has often been intentionally cryptic and is expected to flesh out his ideas in a book this month. \u201cFrance is a project, and that\u2019s the project I want to take further,\u201d he said at a rally in Montpellier last month.</p>",

US journalists, politicians and public intellectuals are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2016/sep/15/smithsonian-museum-african-american-history-culture-review\" title=\"\">engaged in impassioned debates</a> about the balance between inviolable liberties and social obligations, diversity claims and national unity.</p> <p>In Britain meanwhile there has been little discussion, and in its absence the forces of conservatism and petty nationalism have triumphed.

We may soon hear that Father Christmas has had his beard pulled by Muslim extremists.</p> <p>So what changed? The PC movement started in earnest on US campuses back in the 80s, when feminists, gay people and antiracists began to demand respect, equality and a more inclusive curriculum. Language was examined and challenged; so too first-world arrogance and, most threateningly, power. The establishment on both sides of the Atlantic was unnerved by this impertinence.</p> <p>During the Reagan and Thatcher era, this nonviolent struggle for respect and rights was routinely defamed, branded McCarthyite and Stalinist (subsequent research proved that lies and exaggerations fuelled much of the manufactured panic). When Ken Livingstone turned the Greater London council into a temple of political correctness, and other Labour councils across the country followed suit, the British journalist Ann Leslie warned: \u201cThey terrorise America and now they have established a beachhead on our shores.\u201d</p> <p>Even Prince Charles joined the fray.

Only eight years ago, 86% of presidential primary voters in Youngstown and the surrounding Mahoning County, for instance, were Democrats and just 14% were Republicans. This year, the split was 51-49.</p> \n<p>Under Barack Obama, Ohio\u2019s economy has recovered steadily from the 2008 recession. The number of manufacturing jobs in the state has actually ticked up slightly in recent years, after falling sharply and consistently under the administration of George W Bush.</p> \n<p>Trump has, however, relentlessly claimed that the sector\u2019s decades-long structural decline was somehow caused directly by Clinton and her husband, Bill, who was president when the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta), which was signed by his predecessor, came into force.</p> \n<p>The Republican nominee has turned the trade pact into a shorthand for one of the central themes of his campaign: that leaders in Washington, supposedly incapable of standing up to canny foreigners, have left US workers exposed to the ravages of international competition without protection.</p> \n<p>\u201cEvery time you see a closed factory or wiped out community in Ohio, it was essentially caused by the Clintons,\u201d Trump said at a rally in Springfield last month.</p> \n<p>However untrue, the message has resonated deeply with workers such as Brunelle, who long for the stability enjoyed by their parents and grandparents.</p> \n<p>\u201cBecause of global competition, we have to compete with second- and third-rate countries around the world,\u201d he said, noting that he and his friends discuss Nafta quite a bit these days.</p> \n<p>Until last year, Brunelle managed a plant in the town of Bedford for Production Pattern, a company which makes moulds for vehicles. But the firm was buffeted by competition from China, he said, where companies could sell finished moulds for less than the cost of the materials he and his colleagues were using to make them. Some jobs at Brunelle\u2019s plant were moved out of state and others went overseas, he said. Brunelle lost his position, which paid him $70,000 a year.</p> \n<p>Before that, Brunelle was a plant manager for Water Star, a hi-tech manufacturer in Newbury, Ohio. The firm makes anodes and cathodes that are used to purify and treat water. But then Water Star was bought by Tennant, a commercial cleaning company from Minnesota, which wanted the technology for its floor scrubbers. Brunelle lost his job.</p> \n<p>As he wandered around a state-sponsored jobs fair in Akron on Monday, Brunelle winced at the sort of positions on offer at many of the stands.</p> \n<p>Packing boxes of potato chips on the midnight shift for $30,000 a year. Helping gamblers use video slot machines at an out-of-town mega-casino for $10 an hour plus tips. Serving sandwiches in a popular fast-food outlet for $9 an hour.</p> \n<p>Brunelle is a smart man. He knows the arguments in favor of globalisation, knows how difficult it would be for any president to turn back the clock. But as he sets off to wander the aisles for a few more minutes while employers begin dismantling their stalls, it\u2019s just difficult to take.</p> \n<p>\u201cIn the long term, maybe it is good for the world economy,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we have to go down for the rest of them to go up. And it hurts.\u201d</p>",

She will have to get used to it.</p> <p>EU leaders are planning a meeting in December to discuss Brexit without the British prime minister, the Guardian has learnt.</p> <p>Donald Tusk, the president of the European council, wants the EU\u2019s 27 remaining member states to discuss Brexit around the time of an EU summit scheduled for 15-16 December, according to two Brussels sources.</p> <p>The British prime minister would attend the EU summit, but would not be invited to separate Brexit talks, the third time the UK has been excluded from leaders\u2019 talks since it joined the bloc in 1973. EU leaders met without David Cameron soon after the Brexit vote and held the summit in Slovakia without Theresa May in September.</p> <p>The meeting is a sign the EU27 are intensifying preparations on Britain\u2019s EU exit ahead of article 50, which May has promised to trigger by the end of March.</p> <p>Once the UK fires the starting gun on talks, the EU will spend four to eight weeks drawing up detailed guidelines for negotiations, a list of red lines that could cover everything from the single market to the status of Gibraltar.</p> <p>That work hasn\u2019t started yet, but Tusk wants to start preparing the ground. One senior EU diplomat told the Guardian the guidelines would be a trade off between speed and precision: \u201cif the guidelines remain flexible they are easier to adopt, if they are very detailed, they are likely to take more time.\u201d</p> <p>Brussels diplomats are keenly following Brexit fallout in the UK.

He said: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There are those who have deliberately chosen to misrepresent the facts to challenge the independence of the judiciary, one of the cornerstones of our democratic parliamentary system. The reporting of this judgment in some newspapers was frankly a disgrace and an insult to the good name of journalism.</p> <p>The democratic structure of the UK and indeed this assembly is built on a foundation of the rule of law and the independence of our judicial system. The tragic recent history of Europe is littered with examples of countries that overthrew the rule of law and undermined the independence of the courts. That road is not a democratic one and leads only in one direction. I would hope those who may have made comments and statements in haste, will want to reflect.</p> </blockquote> <p>Explaining to the assembly in Cardiff why he wants to appear in person at the supreme court hearing, Antoniw said: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I consider that this case raises issues of profound importance not only in relation to the concept of parliamentary sovereignty but also in relation to the wider constitutional arrangements of the United Kingdom and the legal framework for devolution.</p> <p>I think it is of paramount importance to emphasise at this point that despite the political furore surrounding it and the frankly alarming tone of much of the press coverage, as the high court itself said, this case involves a pure question of law. It is not concerned with the merits and demerits of leaving the European Union and the politics surrounding that.</p> <p>The sole legal question at issue is whether the UK Government can as a matter of constitutional law use the prerogative powers to give notice of withdrawal from the European Union. In seeking to intervene in any appeal, the Welsh government will seek to reinforce the importance of parliamentary sovereignty and the rule of law: core, established principles of British constitutional law.</p> </blockquote> <p>Antoniw emphasised that the Welsh government was not seeking to reverse the result of the referendum. He said: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Having outlined what the case is about I should also make a comment on what it is not about. The first minister has made crystal clear and I repeat that sentiment now: the Welsh government respects the result of the referendum and this is absolutely not about overturning that decision.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5821fae1e4b07ceadb3a39c3\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-08T16:23:28.701Z\">4.23pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The legal commentator <strong>Joshua Rozenberg </strong>has posted a good story <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/JoshuaRozenbergQC/posts/222545208167403\">on his Facebook page.</a> He says that Liz Truss, the lord chancellor and justice secretary, is being sued by six high court judges for age discrimination.

That may sound like cheating, but the IFS commends this approach.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Only two targets managed to be met consistently: that is the coalition government\u2019s initial target to aim for a cyclically-adjusted balance on the current budget five years out and its subsequent revised target to aim to achieve this three years out. It is perhaps not a coincidence that these two targets also had much to commend them. In contrast the other targets either had more thresholds that were more arbitrary (\u201cwhen did the cycle start and end?\u201d, \u201cwhy 40% of GDP?\u201d, \u201cwhy should debt definitely fall between two future points in time?\u201d, \u201cwhy should welfare spending definitely be below some fixed level?\u201d) and/or were not sufficiently flexible in the face of adverse fiscal shocks (\u201cwhy must there be an overall surplus in 2019\u201320?\u201d, \u201cwhy must borrowing in 2013\u201314 be no more than half what it was in 2009\u201310?\u201d).

So we should all give a lot of thought to that when you\u2019re talking to your friends and neighbours and trying to influence them. The first thing this election is about is how to restore broad-based prosperity and growth to the American economy. And I hope in the next presidential debate she and Senator Sanders and the others will be able to talk about what the best way to do that is. Hillary says that you have to have a campaign that appeals to the struggling, the striving and the successful. We have to do this together. And Bernie says just go get the money from the millionaires. And it sounds good because there\u2019s \u2013 to a lot of people, if you look all over the world \u2013 the British Labor Party disposed of its most (inaudible) leader, David Miliband, because they were mad at him for being part of Tony Blair\u2019s government in the Iraq War. And they moved to the left and put his brother in as leader because the British labor movement wanted it. When David Cameron thumped him in the election, they reached the interesting conclusion that they lost because they hadn\u2019t moved far left enough, and so they went out and practically got a guy off the street to be the leader of the British Labor Party, who I saw in the press today said that he was really a British citizen and had real British (inaudible). (Laughter.) </p> <p>But what that is reflective of \u2013 the same thing happened in the Greek election \u2013 when people feel they\u2019ve been shafted and they don\u2019t expect anything to happen anyway, they just want the maddest person in the room to represent them. And that is perfectly psychologically understandable and predictable. Most people in America haven\u2019t had a raise in 15 years. 86 percent of the American people, adjusted for inflation, have an income today lower than it was the day before the crash. The median income of American families, adjusted for inflation, is lower than it was the day I left office. </p> <p>So this election, first of all, should be: how do we restore broad-based prosperity? We\u2019ve only had one period in 50 years, since the early 1960s, when all segments of the American economy grew together, and that was the eight years when I served. You have to work at that. It is not an accident. That\u2019s a matter of policy. It really does matter what you do. And I\u2019m really proud of the fact that we moved 100 times as many people out of poverty into the middle class through work as happened in the Reagan years. You had 16 million jobs almost; we had almost 23 million. But the most important thing was 100 times as many people moved into the middle class. That\u2019s policy. It\u2019s policy that led the bottom 20 percent of workers to increase their income in percentage terms as much as the top 5 percent. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5821cbe3e4b0d073c27d292e\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/libbybrooks\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-08T13:02:51.137Z\">1.02pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Sturgeon says Scottish government wants to join article 50 case to oppose UK government</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Nicola Sturgeon</strong> has confirmed that the Scottish government will intervene in the article 50 legal case as the UK government prepares to appeal the decision at the supreme court.</p> <p>At a regular press briefing held at Bute House in Edinburgh, Sturgeon confirmed that the Lord Advocate will lodge a formal application to intervene in the UK government\u2019s supreme court appeal against last week\u2019s high court ruling that Theresa May\u2019s government must seek the permission of the Commons before it can trigger article 50 and begin the process of leaving the EU.</p> <p>The Lord Advocate \u2013 Scotland\u2019s most senior law officer \u2013 will lodge the application as soon as the UK government lodges its own appeal.</p> <p>Sturgeon added that the Scottish parliament should also be formally consulted on the decision.

But building a plan for further austerity in the next parliament would be prudent. Indeed even if a balanced headline budget was delivered in 2020\u201321 and then maintained thereafter public sector net debt would not be on course to reach its pre-crisis level of 40% of national income until around the mid-2040s. Unfortunately if anything the \u00a325 billion estimated deterioration in the public finances in 2019\u201320 is likely to understate the increase in the longer-term challenge that has occurred since the March Budget. The OBR\u2019s previous long-run projections were based on an optimistic assumption about NHS productivity growth which they have recently said is likely to be revised down in their future projections. More fundamentally any reduction in future immigration, any reduction in longer-term growth or any increase in future interest rates would make the fiscal arithmetic harder still. </p> </blockquote> <p>This morning Nick Gibb, the education minister, and Lord O\u2019Donnell, the former cabinet secretary, are both giving evidence to select committees.

This unlikeliest of public servants began his political life as the anti-Obama candidate, seeking to ride the swinging pendulum away from a high point in racial equality and shifting into opposition to the equivalent moment in women\u2019s emancipation.</p> <p>It was a crowded field. Former Florida governor Jeb Bush was long seen as the Republican frontrunner and raised more money within weeks than his self-described billionaire opponent was ever to contribute to the presidential campaign.

Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren was petitioned by many on the left and resisted. Sanders, an independent Vermont senator, stepped forward instead \u2013 at first with little hope of winning much beyond his home state, but determined there should at least be a debate about a more progressive alternative to the centrism traditionally associated with the Clinton family.</p> <p>The 74-year-old was to win 22 states and ride a tidal wave of enthusiasm rarely seen in politics. Fueled by anger over economic inequality and corruption, this gruff outsider came close several times to achieving enough momentum to pull off a victory that would have made Trump\u2019s nomination look tame. Like the reeling Republicans, the Democratic party too was convulsed by a wave of populism it first seemed ill-equipped to recognise, let alone respond to.</p> <p>Though a generation of young white supporters \u201cfelt the Bern\u201d, his campaign nonetheless never reached escape velocity. Quite apart from its shocking radicalism (at least by modern American standards), it was held back by a lack of early media coverage, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/mar/02/bernie-sanders-revolution-white-african-american-voters\">limited support among African American voters</a> in the south and determined resistance from the party hierarchy. Despite conspiracy theories to the contrary, Clinton was to win nationally by a clear and convincing majority.</p> <p>But the long, and sometimes bitter, Democratic primary showed its eventual nominee\u2019s vulnerabilities just as much as it also helped shift her manifesto to the left in ways even Sanders could once only dream of.

Compared to the meagre gruel that Republicans had fed the media before his candidacy, this flamboyant 69-year-old made news from the moment he opened his mouth. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"92f114cba55cd975868fff7a1a81d2417e9c3313\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/92f114cba55cd975868fff7a1a81d2417e9c3313/0_167_2500_1500/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Donald Trump at Trump Tower\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An elevator descent into madness.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Gregory/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Where others had sought, for example, to rehash obscure details of Clinton\u2019s role during the 2012 Benghazi terrorist attacks, here was someone who spoke in single-syllable soundbites that made little sense, but loud headlines. \u201cI would build a great wall, and nobody builds walls better than me,\u201d began his <a href=\"http://time.com/3923128/donald-trump-announcement-speech/\">announcement speech</a> in 16 June 2015.</p> <p>By contrast, Clinton\u2019s formal debut before an expectant media in April of that year was polished and professional but lacking in big ideas. An excited press pack chased her across the plains of Iowa in a bus they dubbed the \u201cScooby van\u201d, only to discover a tightly disciplined campaign nothing like the cartoon playing on the other channel.</p> <p>Trump also immediately showed a remarkable gift for offending people. In the same first speech, Mexican immigrants were dismissed as \u201crapists\u201d, bringing nothing but drugs and crime to the US. Within minutes it was clear this would be a shockingly divisive campaign.</p> <p>But it was a weapon he would wield effectively against Republican opponents. Bush was taunted as \u201clow energy\u201d during a series of debates that played to Trump\u2019s strengths as a TV performer but brought the Grand Old Party down to the level of a schoolyard bully. </p> <p>By the time New Jersey governor Chris Christie joined in by destroying another promising rival, Marco Rubio, it was clear Trump had re-created the brutal dynamic of his reality TV franchise, The Apprentice. Like many bullies, he also showed the thin skin \u2013 and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/03/donald-trump-hand-display-madame-tussaud-wax-museum\">small hands</a> \u2013 that Clinton would later learn how to exploit in their own debates.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/07/republicans-lose-election-day-donald-trump-civil-war\">Win or lose, Republicans are heading for civil war after election day</a> </p> </aside>  <p>She showed early poise, too, in her debates against Sanders, helped by his determination to focus on their many policy disagreements. \u201cThe American people are sick of hearing about your damn emails,\u201d he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/oct/13/bernie-sanders-hillary-clinton-damn-email-server\">conceded</a>, rescuing his opponent from an early controversy over a private email server she had used while working as secretary of state.</p> <p>It was an issue that was to come back to haunt her again. Though many Democrats agreed with Sanders, the email controversy raised worrying questions about Clinton\u2019s penchant for privacy. Why should she evade rules designed to ensure classified information remained safely stored on government computers \u2013 measures that meant embarrassing transgressions might be subject to freedom of information requests?

Hers was, without doubt, one of the most qualified candidacies of modern times.

Sanders was to lose to Clinton by a whisker, providing an early indication of her difficulties with white working-class voters.</p> <p>Trump got off to a slow start in Iowa thanks to the evangelical appeal of Texas senator Ted Cruz, but by the time the Republicans got to the next vote, in New Hampshire in February, the anti-establishment revolt was in full swing. Sanders and Trump were to win there by record landslides that continued to worry the Clinton campaign up until the general election.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/mar/01/super-tuesday-trump-clinton-sanders-cruz-rubio\">Super Tuesday</a> on 1 March provided much stronger territory for Clinton, who took an ultimately unassailable lead over Sanders by cleaning up across the south.

Reviewing a 'political revolution'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There were still surprises to come, some with further potential bearing on Clinton\u2019s vulnerabilities in a general election. Michigan was the biggest shock, pointing to the anger in the industrial midwest over trade policy. Wisconsin and Colorado were other states where Sanders would continue to raise the hopes of his supporters and the eye of Republican strategists come November.</p> <p>But Clinton also demonstrated her strength in diverse, prosperous, metropolitan America. Her wins in New York and California finally extinguished the Bern and showed the power of the multi-racial coalition built up by Democrats. Neither Green party candidate Jill Stein nor libertarian Gary Johnson would gain much traction against such a polarising pair of candidates in the months of bitter slogging that followed the primaries.</p> <p>When things looked bleakest for Trump, he would turn abroad for inspiration. He visited Britain the day after it voted to leave Europe to align himself with the mood of rebellion and invited UK Independence party leader Nigel Farage to campaign with him in Mississippi. He would travel to Mexico to try to prove statesmanship, and developed a bizarre affinity with Vladimir Putin that would lead some to suspect Republicans had nominated a modern-day <a href=\"http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2016/11/is-donald-trump-a-manchurian-candidate\">Manchurian candidate</a>.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s authoritarian streak was most visible during the Orwellian-sounding Republican convention in Cleveland where he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/21/donald-trump-republican-national-convention-speech\">proclaimed himself the \u201claw and order candidate\u201d</a>.

Internal Democratic campaign emails obtained by WikiLeaks also created both heat and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/27/wikileaks-bill-clinton-foundation-emails\">light</a>, but the website was accused of aiding and abetting a Russian hacking operation.</p> <p>Yet it was the FBI that was to play the most controversial role, revealing at the 11th hour the existence of further Clinton emails found on the laptop of the disgraced husband of her confidante Huma Abedin. Some say the bureau was stung into action after allegations that Bill Clinton had sought to interfere in earlier investigations by meeting with US attorney general Loretta Lynch. Others, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/02/barack-obama-fbi-hillary-clinton-emails-election-polls\">including Obama</a>, accused it of improper leaks.

But as he headed into the final days of the campaign almost drawing level with Clinton in the polls again, many Democrats worried whether the electorate had grown numbed to his outbursts. They have had to wait until election day to discover whether voters would reject the bombastic populism and embrace a Madam President, or opt to make history in another way.</p>",

No independent report of voting irregularities had been confirmed by mid-afternoon.</p> \n<p>The comments came just after Trump <a href=\"https://www.scribd.com/document/330439388/Trump-Nevada-Lawsuit\">filed a lawsuit against Clark County</a>, Nevada, claiming four polling stations had allowed people to vote past the early voting deadline.</p> \n<p><a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/card/trump-campaign-sues-accuses-nevada-county-keeping-polls-open-too-n679871\">Clark County representatives said</a> people who were in line before the polling stations\u2019 closing time were allowed to vote after the deadline, in keeping with state law.

She arrived at the station, inside an elementary school, with husband Bill Clinton just under four hours after landing in Westchester from a final day of campaigning with four rallies across three battlegrounds.</p> \n<p>Dozens of supporters had braved a chilly fall morning to greet the candidate they hoped would be the first woman to serve in the nation\u2019s highest office. Chants of \u201cI believe that she will win\u201d and \u201cMadame President\u201d broke out as the Clintons emerged after voting in the company of an eager herd of locals who appeared to forget their own ballots in the company of the former \u2013 and perhaps future \u2013 first couple.</p> \n<p>Clinton told reporters voting for herself was \u201cthe most humbling feeling\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cI know how much responsibility goes with this and so many people are counting on the outcome of this election, what it means for our country,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I will do the very best I can if I\u2019m fortunate enough to win today.\u201d Clinton also confessed to thinking of her late mother, Dorothy Rodham, who she has described as one of her greatest inspirations.</p> \n<p>It was then a quiet afternoon for the Democratic nominee. She taped a series of radio interviews, and prepared for the night that will seal her fate from her home with a small group of confidantes. Clinton was set to watch the returns from The Peninsula, a luxury hotel that, incidentally, sits a block from Trump Tower on Manhattan\u2019s Fifth Avenue. The mood within the campaign was cautiously optimistic, with few signs of a team bracing for the unexpected.</p> \n<p>New, but untested, <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/votecastr_election_day_turnout_tracker.html?live=true\">projections of real time voting patterns</a> also appeared to support the Democratic party\u2019s belief that its voters were flocking to the polls, helping rally US stock markets for a second day running. But the Trump campaign reads the turnout signals in a different way, pointing out that the numbers of registered Republicans turning out to vote in battleground states were up on the level seen by Mitt Romney in 2012, while Democrats were seeing smaller turnout than for Obama.</p> \n<p>Some residents of Manhattan\u2019s Upper West Side cast their vote in Trump Place, a residential development built by the Republican nominee in the 1990s. The polling station\u2019s name seemed to have no bearing on voting intentions for many of them. \u201cHe\u2019s a misogynist, and he\u2019s phobic of everyone who isn\u2019t like him,\u201d said Juliet Herman, a 52-year-old strategist.</p> \n<p>Slava Hazin, 50, was one of the few outside Trump Place who said they were voting for Trump. \u201cABC,\u201d he said. \u201cAnyone but Clinton.\u201d</p> \n<p>Hazin said he \u201ccan\u2019t stand Trump\u201d, but as a Republican, he was voting for him anyway. \u201cIt was the worst lineup we\u2019ve ever had,\u201d he said of the original Republican candidates. \u201cI mean, I\u2019ve voted for some Republican duds but this really takes the cake.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/nov/08/hillary-clinton-voting-for-myself-was-the-most-humbling-feeling-video\" data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/5b32v\" data-show-ads=\"true\" data-video-id=\"2875959\" data-video-name=\"Hillary Clinton: Voting for myself was the 'most humbling feeling' \u2013 video\" data-video-provider=\"Reuters\"> \n <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-5821d9f7e4b029b92ca46a08\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> \n  <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/11/08/161108Clintonvotenew_desk.mp4\">\n  <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/11/08/161108Clintonvotenew_V3.webm\">\n  <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/11/08/161108Clintonvotenew.m3u8\"> \n </video> \n <figcaption>\n  <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/nov/08/hillary-clinton-voting-for-myself-was-the-most-humbling-feeling-video\">Hillary Clinton: Voting for myself was the \u2018most humbling feeling\u2019</a>\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Before polls opened on Tuesday morning, more than 46 million people nationwide had already voted \u2013 compared with the 32.3 million people who voted early <a href=\"http://www.electproject.org/2012_early_vote\">in 2012</a>. The huge turnout broke early voting records in many states, <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2016/11/clinton-trump-early-voting-230916\">with some predicting it would prove positive news for the Democratic party</a>.</p> \n<h2>Hispanic surge</h2> \n<p>In Florida, a key swing state, nearly 50% of the state had already voted by the time polls opened on Tuesday morning. It was one of many states to see a surge in Hispanic voters, with 36% more of the population voting early in the election than had voted altogether in the 2012 election.</p> \n<p>And in Ohio, thousands of people swamped county election board offices on Monday to take advantage of the campaign\u2019s final early-voting hours, which were restricted this year by the Republican-controlled state legislature and Republican governor, John Kasich.</p> \n<p>Party affiliations of early voters in Ohio have not been made public, but a decline in the percentage who are African American compared with 2012 gave supporters of Donald Trump cause for optimism that the Republican nominee would be able to clinch the state.</p> \n<p>Hundreds of people \u2013 black, white, young and old \u2013 snaked around a parking lot in Akron to cast votes in Summit County, which has voted Democrats for president ever since Ronald Reagan\u2019s re-election in 1984.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/08/voting-poll-workers-rigged-us-election-clinton-trump-president\">Poll workers share their thoughts on the election and fears of voter fraud</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>In Youngstown, the center of Mahoning County, a former Democratic stronghold where Trump has this year enjoyed a surge in support among blue-collar workers, hundreds more people waited patiently in unseasonably warm sunshine to cast the final votes before election day.</p> \n<p>Kevin Stillwell Jr was one of the county\u2019s last early voters, waiting almost two hours in line to cast his ballot shortly before 4pm on Monday.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing,\u201d Stillwell, a 20-year-old student at Youngstown State University, said of the wait he had endured. \u201cIt\u2019s all worth it to have my say on who will be our president.\u201d</p> \n<p>Stillwell, who was raised in Canton, about 60 miles to the south-west, voted for Hillary Clinton, but without much enthusiasm. \u201cThey both suck, in my opinion,\u201d he said. \u201cBut in this situation, the question is: which is the least worst?\u201d</p> \n<p>Trump\u2019s claims in recent weeks of a \u201crigged election\u201d had left people nationwide concerned that his supporters would attempt to intimidate voters at polling stations.</p> \n<p>On Monday, two witnesses for the Democratic party testified in a Pennsylvania court that Trump\u2019s claims had left them afraid that people armed with assault rifles would be coming to Philadelphia to watch the polls on voting day.</p> \n<p>But in the north of the Pennsylvania city on Tuesday morning, at a handful of the voting divisions that recorded zero votes for Mitt Romney in 2012, there was not a single vigilante poll watcher standing outside the voting places \u2013 not even outside the ones that had given Barack Obama 100% of the vote.</p> \n<p>Outside Meade elementary school in Philadelphia\u2019s 47th ward, where one voting division had cast all 173 votes for Obama, there was a booth offering free smoothies, but no one who appeared to be monitoring the polls for Trump. Three members of the Clinton campaign\u2019s voter protection team were present.</p> \n<p>Gwen Frazier, 62, stopped to celebrate voting along with her son, Malik. Both had voted for Clinton. Trump\u2019s comments about Muslims and Mexicans had left her convinced that he did not like African Americans either, she said. \u201cWhat is he going to say to the foreigners overseas?

Indeed, it\u2019s now starting to overtake long political rants as the thing you\u2019re probably seeing most of on your social media feed. The trend apparently <a href=\"https://twitter.com/thvtmelanin_/status/791414169329369088\">started</a> with high school kids who may have taken their teacher\u2019s supplications to \u2018please, can you all just sit still\u2019 a little too literally. It infiltrated the adult world over the weekend; the hashtag #mannequinchallenge has been mentioned <a href=\"http://time.com/4562272/hillary-clinton-mannequin-challenge/\">2.3m times</a> in the past week on Twitter. <a href=\"http://people.com/celebrity/destinys-child-adele-mannequin-challenge/\">Everyone</a> from Adele to Ellen DeGeneres the New York Giants has given it a go. Destiny\u2019s Child even briefly reunited briefly to film their take. And Hillary Clinton\u2019s team <a href=\"https://twitter.com/HillaryClinton/status/795955854059171840\">got in on the (non)action</a> Tuesday morning.</p> <p>So what exactly is the Mannequin Challenge? The clue is in the name. A group of people freeze in mid-action like mannequins while someone goes around filming them. The only thing moving in the shot should be the camera. Then you put a soundtrack on it, stick it online, and watch the likes rack up. Black Beatles by Rae Sremmurd is one of the more popular options for soundtracks. It\u2019s a perfect song for the challenge because there\u2019s a quiet build up and then, around 25 seconds in, the beat drops and \u2026 nothing happens.</p> <p>You see, normally when the beat drops in a video meme, things happen. In the Harlem Shake it\u2019s the moment where everyone starts dancing. But with the Mannequin Challenge, the song gets going and everyone stays resolutely in position. It\u2019s, like, we\u2019re all going to stand this one out, OK? We\u2019re exhausted. Let\u2019s see about dancing next year.</p> <p>In a sense, the Mannequin Challenge is not actually that new; it\u2019s just a digital reboot of a craze from the 19th century for tableau vivant. Otherwise known as \u2018living pictures\u2019, these were used to dramatize important moments of history or famous paintings. They were also a bit of after-dinner fun. People used to hang around in their parlors after dinner and recreate famous scenes. To younger readers: yes, that is what life was like before the internet. It was rough.</p> <p>But while it may date back to the 19th century, the Mannequin Challenge is also very much of the moment. The fact that just being quiet and still for a moment has been so enthusiastically embraced by everyone from high schoolers to imminent presidents is a sign, I feel, that we are all very, very tired, and we would like a little rest, please.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/nov/08/trauma-presidential-election-2016-turning-point\">What can we salvage from the trauma of the US presidential election? | Lucia Graves</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Mannequin Challenge isn\u2019t the only indicator of a need for less speed in an always-on, always-moving world. In August, Netflix started to air slow TV. Something of a cultural phenomenon in Norway, slow TV is basically a genre where nothing happens for hours on end. The first installment, a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7VYVjR_nwE\">7.5-hour train ride</a> from Bergen to Oslo, was watched by around 45% of Norway\u2019s population.</p> <p>Just to reiterate, absolutely nothing happens on this train ride. There\u2019s no background music or narrative. It\u2019s just train sounds. Oh, and there are several tunnels, so the screen often just goes dark. This quiet hit was followed by other instant classics such as National Knitting Morning, National Knitting Evening, and National Knitting Night (my favorite of the trilogy). That Netflix US has recently picked up Slow TV might be a sign it thinks that Americans may well be in need of a little audiovisual Xanax.</p> <p>And then, of course, there\u2019s the growing popularity of mindfulness, which has gone mainstream in the last couple of years. In a world where being busy is the ultimate badge of honor, corporatized mindfulness allows you to take some time out in a socially approved way. You\u2019re not just sitting around doing nothing, you\u2019re not taking a break, you\u2019re being <em>mindful.</em></p> <p>When there\u2019s constant pressure to be achieving, and doing, and ticking off boxes, and racking up likes, it\u2019s worth remembering that there\u2019s nothing wrong with doing nothing now and again. We shouldn\u2019t need Slow TV or mindfulness apps or Mannequin Challenges to give us an excuse to just sit quietly. </p> <p>Still, here\u2019s hoping the Mannequin Challenge ushers in a new era of Slow Viral Memes. Maybe a Putting on the Kettle For a Nice Cup of Tea Challenge? Or a Just Having a Quick Nap Challenge? Of course, depending on how the presidential election turns out, the next viral trend may well be emigrating en masse to Canada.</p>",

In their own words:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p> I\u2019ve been an election officer in Delaware for six election cycles, a total of 16 primaries, national, or local elections; we have never denied a person the right to vote.

  "<p></p> <p>As she has reminded us through her campaign, Hillary Clinton has 30 years of political experience she may drag over the finish line into the executive office. But her opponent represents a series of unknowable unknowns.<strong> </strong>Sure, Donald Trump is as well-known as Clinton, but he has chalked up not a single month of political office, and has no track record. </p> <p>It\u2019s also very hard to work out who his key advisers will be. His campaign is very much a family affair. Much of the Republican establishment has distanced themselves from him \u2013 some so far <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/mar/18/stop-donald-trump-presidency-republicans-vote-hillary-clinton\">they will be voting for Clinton</a>. It is not clear who his key economic, defence or foreign policy advisers are and 50 former Republican national security advisers <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/09/us/politics/national-security-gop-donald-trump.html?smid=tw-nytpolitics&amp;smtyp=cur&amp;_r=1\">publicly declared</a> against him in August. They are unlikely to be summoned back into the State, Defense or Homeland Security departments.</p> <p>There are also clear policy differences between Trump and his more experienced vice-presidential running mate, Mike Pence. Trump has publicly declared, in a presidential debate, that he <a href=\"http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2016/10/donald-trump-mike-pence-relationship\">disagreed</a> with Pence on Syria. So the prospect that Trump would sit back and let Pence run the executive while he \u201cmakes America Great again\u201d looks low. </p> <p></p> <h2><strong>Both candidates would face challenges governing </strong></h2> <h2></h2> <p>Both candidates will face a challenge in terms of how much they could actually do if elected. That will depend on the Congressional arithmetic. But Trump and Pence are short of any of the Capitol Hill experience that can help US presidents get Congress to work. And after such a polarising election, gridlock looks the most likely outcome even for such a seasoned operator as Clinton. That means domestic inaction \u2013 but also means that the president may be tempted to focus even more on redefining the US\u2019s international role.</p> <h2><strong>These unknowns will make planning in the UK very difficult</strong></h2> <p>In the run-up to any US election, the British embassy in Washington will try to build contacts to people who are likely to form part of the next administration and try to work out how a new president\u2019s policy positions will affect UK interests.</p> <p>Most famously Jonathan Powell, who went on to be Tony Blair\u2019s chief of staff, was detailed to get to know the team of a then little-known governor from Arkansas back in 1992. That set the basis for the close relationship between new Democrats and New Labour. Access to the Trump campaign will have been harder.</p> <p>The National Security Council should have been having discussions on the potential implications of a Trump presidency for Nato, relations with Russia, the Middle East and wider security issues. But they will hang on any post-election words for more concrete indications of a new style of governing. Diplomats will then lobby for an early visit to the US to cement the specialness of the special relationship.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/public-leaders-network/2016/jun/24/whitehall-brexit-civil-servants-jeremy-heywood\">Whitehall has no roadmap for the gargantuan task of enabling Brexit</a> </p> </aside>  <h2><strong>But what will they talk about?</strong></h2> <p>The UK has in the past presented itself as a bridge between Europe and the US.

  "<h2>Candidates sign off on 2016 election campaigns</h2> <p>The long, bitter presidential campaign is finally over and the two historically unpopular candidates have handed off to the nation\u2019s 225,788,000 eligible voters. At a monumental, final rally at Independence Hall in Philadelphia, Hillary Clinton, flanked by her husband, President Obama and first lady Michelle Obama promised a better future for the country and vowed to \u201cbridge the divides\u201d that emerged during the campaign. Obama, passing the torch to Clinton, echoed the themes of 2008 as he urged voters to \u201creject fear and embrace hope\u201d. The party was joined on stage by Lady Gaga and Jon Bon Jovi. Meanwhile in Michigan, Republican candidate Donald Trump ended his campaign with a show of relative restraint: \u201cWe\u2019re hours away from a once-in-a-lifetime change,\u201d Trump told thousands of supporters who waited until 12.30am to see him. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have real change, not Obama change.\u201d Here\u2019s a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/07/us-election-2016-complete-timeline-clinton-trump-president\">timeline</a> of how we got here and check out our <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2016/nov/08/us-election-2016-polls-trump-clinton-results-live\">election day live blog</a> for rolling coverage.</p> <p><strong>You can also sign up for our groundbreaking mobile election alert:</strong> The new live-updating alert we\u2019re launching will be one of the fastest ways worldwide to monitor US election results.

Or, maybe, one of the more seasoned former conservative governors would win the day, such as Florida\u2019s Jeb Bush or Texas\u2019s Rick Perry.</p> <p>But such hopes were dashed on 16 June 2015 when one Donald J Trump took what he now calls the \u201cfamous escalator ride\u201d down Trump Tower to announce his candidacy. The establishment immediately mocked him. But he went on to shock them.</p> <p>Over the next 11 months, the ideologically malleable alleged billionaire browbeat his way to the Republican nomination. He tagged his opponents as too low energy (Bush), too dishonest (Cruz) and too little and sweaty (Rubio) for the Oval Office. He would allow nothing to stand in his way \u2013 certainly not the truth \u2013 in his quest for the Republican nomination. </p> <p>To evangelicals, the thrice-married New Yorker with a potty mouth that made even Howard Stern blush pretended to be a committed Christian, even declaring that the reason the IRS was auditing his tax returns was probably because of his religious devotion. To immigration hawks, he pledged to deport each and every illegal immigrant in the country, even though he said after the 2012 election that the reason Mitt Romney lost was because of his harsh stand on immigration. </p> <p>But Trump didn\u2019t win the Republican nomination because of his policy positions. He won because of his personality and brand. For nearly four decades, he painted himself as the world\u2019s greatest businessman. Trump\u2019s lifelong marketing scheme got a boost from Hollywood in 2004 when he was cast as the star of the NBC reality TV show The Apprentice, where he flaunted his executive authority each week in front of millions.</p> <p>Trump was at his best when he wasn\u2019t talking specifics. He promised to make all America\u2019s problems go away, to make America great again, if Americans just put their faith in him. He was the strongman who was going to make everything OK if you just trusted him and didn\u2019t ask questions.</p> <p>And it worked in the Republican primary. But the nomination fight revealed much more about Trump\u2019s Republican opponents and the Republican electorate than it did about Trump. To those who cared to look, it was well known before Trump ever entered the presidential race that he was a dishonest lout whose business success was far less than claimed. </p> <p>But Trump\u2019s presence in the race revealed that the supposed GOP superstars were too weak to stand up to the charlatan in their midst. As for the Republican primary electorate, we learned that perhaps they don\u2019t care so much about conservative principles after all \u2013 that the conservative movement may be nothing more than a collection of magazine offices and think tanks in Manhattan and Washington, DC. No true believer in conservative principles could ever get behind Donald Trump. </p> <p>In winning the Republican nomination, Donald Trump may have destroyed the Republican party and drastically set back the conservative movement. His anti-immigrant vitriol, his mainstreaming of conspiracy theories, his portrayal of American exceptionalism as an arrogant concept, his anti-women invective and, yes, his occasional racism will taint the Republican party for the foreseeable future.</p> <p>Well, it will taint the Republican party if it lasts. But that remains an open question. The odds are Hillary Clinton will win, and the question will then be: what will become of the Republican party? Will the #NeverTrump wing and the Always Trump forces come together? Or will a civil war break out, ultimately tearing the party it apart? </p> <p>The GOP should have been ascendant this election cycle. Instead, it lies in ruins, all thanks to Donald Trump. He\u2019s the man of the hour, exactly as he would want it to be. </p>",

Likewise <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/jul/22/roger-ailes-fox-news-sexual-assault-allegations\">Roger Ailes</a>. Powerful men who had been in the public eye for decades were made to face the claims of their accusers. More than that, the public finally listened.</p> <p>It\u2019s upsetting but not surprising that this happened in tandem with a woman\u2019s rise to the top of a major party ticket for the first time. The forces that made that impossible for the past 240 years are same ones that taught these men to measure their power in terms of their control of women, that it\u2019s excusable to treat women as trophies or toys.</p> <p>While Trump is the only person running for high office who\u2019s had more than a dozen different women come forward to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/13/list-of-donald-trump-sexual-misconduct-allegations\">accuse him</a> of sexual misbehavior and assault, he\u2019s far from the only powerful man to have internalized misogynistic values. And while the wider electorate, and women and minorities in particular, have signaled we are ready to evolve from this social barbarism, the swell of popular support for Trump signals that too many men in America are not.</p> <p>It\u2019s not just Republican men, either. Hillary Clinton\u2019s biggest weakness when it comes to painting herself as a leader for women is her own husband\u2019s past. Bill Clinton\u2019s record doesn\u2019t look so good re-litigated by the standards of 2016. As a result, he\u2019s wisely opted to get out of the way. His most effective speech of the campaign, given at the Democratic national convention in Philadelphia, was more love ballad than call to arms. \u201cIn the summer of 1971,\u201d he began, \u201cI met a girl ...\u201d</p> <p>A few decades back, it was she, not Bill, who was the political liability in the relationship, famously refusing to change her last name, bake cookies, and stand by her man in the soul-crushing Tammy Wynette sense of that phrase. But our culture has shifted dramatically since then.</p> <p>As more women make the same choices young Hillary Rodham did, she appears in our rear window as ahead of her time. But so much of this race has been stuck in the gender politics of the past. </p> <p>Her character has been reduced to \u201cresilience\u201d; her theme music is Fight Song; the one thing everyone, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2016/10/2016-presidential-debate-donald-trump-hillary-clinton-fighter-229499\">even Trump</a>, will praise her for is staring down defeat after defeat after defeat. Many of the words used to describe Clinton tell us as much about us as they do about her. </p> <p>And the final insult is that she may just lose it all again. Because, well, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/28/fbi-reopens-hillary-clinton-emails-investigation\">Anthony Weiner</a>. It\u2019s not so much that Clinton is innately secretive and often seemingly bereft of personality \u2013 it\u2019s that being a woman seeking power in our society made her that way.</p> <p>This has already been a big year for feminism, but there\u2019s a lot of work left to do. If we make Clinton president tonight, we can expect the work of equality to continue. It\u2019s hard to know whether a vision of the first female president will help destroy bygone gender identities, or drive those who cling to them screaming into the arms of the next manifestation of Trump. What we do know is that everything from parental leave to equal pay and the right to control our own bodies will get a different treatment than they\u2019ve ever had from office of the president.</p> <p>And if we get a President Trump? It\u2019s hard to fathom just how much damage he could do. He\u2019s promised to jail his opponent and wants to \u201copen up\u201d libel laws to make it easier to sue the press. He\u2019s hinted that he won\u2019t accept the results of the election unless he wins. He\u2019s said those who get abortions should endure some form of punishment. His <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/03/30/politics/donald-trump-abortion-town-hall/\">walkback</a> notwithstanding, women certainly would be punished in some form or other under a Trump administration.</p> <p>Whatever happens, we shouldn\u2019t forget the trauma of the election that got us here. All the ugliness we\u2019ve seen is part and parcel of the fight to shatter that \u201chighest, hardest glass ceiling\u201d. And no matter how bad it gets, and no matter how many times we have to hear phrases like \u201cgrab them by the pussy\u201d, we know we can\u2019t plug our ears or stay quiet, because all of this would just happen again. This is the moment to speak. This is the moment to say: it stops here. </p>",

One poll showed half the voters <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2016/10/26/poll-clinton-builds-leads-nation-worried-election-day-violence-trump/92712708/\">fear there could be violence </a>on Tuesday. We will have some kind of result on Wednesday but with both sides declaring the apocalypse if the other side wins, it\u2019s not obvious to me that it\u2019ll be accepted, whoever wins.</p> <p>Next week I\u2019ll publish my final piece in The View from Middletown series. (You can catch up with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/membership/ng-interactive/2016/oct/11/view-middletown-gary-younge-us-presidential-election\">all my reporting in this series here</a>.) Remaining in Muncie for a month, guided by your suggestions, has helped me go beyond the superficial analysis and better understand this election. I hope it has helped you too. Regardless of the result, this election has laid bare the importance of reliable news sources, such as the Guardian, countering smears and rumours.</p> <p>But alongside the facts we have also brought perspective. After I wrote my first article Jamie Walsh, a former Muncie resident, wrote: \u201cI cried when I saw your article. I literally wept at the thought that there are people out there that still give a shit about us.\u201d I was able to follow up with Walsh and her voice found its way into a few articles. After the second article a student from Ball State University wrote: \u201cWhat you\u2019re doing, coming to Muncie and showing the election to the UK, to the world really, through our eyes is completely amazing. It\u2019s coverage about the election that I feel like I actually want to read.\u201d </p> <h2>What you\u2019ve been saying</h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>What I love about this whole project is the focus on a real place ...

It will take the form of a long read in which I bring together what I\u2019ve learned in the month I\u2019ve spent in Muncie and draw whatever parallels I can between my reporting here and the national landscape after the election.</p> <p>It\u2019s been a fabulous month and I have been the recipient of extraordinary generosity \u2013 people have given me time, food, advice and friendship. I\u2019ll miss it.</p> <p>Last week, before dawn broke, I went to the Central high school to witness a twice-weekly ritual. Just after 7am, about 10 adults, black and white, stood at the doors forming a human corridor as the kids walked in. They held up signs with messages such as \u201cWe believe in you\u201d, \u201cYou are the future\u201d, \u201cLove one another\u201d and \u201cWe\u2019re proud of you\u201d. Some gave fist bumps as the kids walked in, others hugs.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s important for them to know that there are adults out here who care about them,\u201d explained Cornelius Dollison, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/membership/2016/nov/03/the-view-from-  middletown-whoever-wins-election-needs-to-address-the-rage-out-there\">a well-respected figure</a> in Muncie\u2019s civic life.</p> <p>How effective it is I couldn\u2019t say. But it was certainly moving to see such a selfless piece of civic engagement seeking to make some connection and give encouragement to young people in a town where some are told and believe they have no future.</p> <p>American politics is doing a grave disservice to American people. It\u2019s not that citizens aren\u2019t out there fighting for it. I\u2019ve seen it, in a range of ways on both sides of the divide, in my time here. Sadly, whatever the result on Wednesday, they will have to fight much harder and longer for the politics they deserve.</p> <p><em>Main image by David Levene for the Guardian</em></p> <ul> <li><strong>If you\u2019ve appreciated this series, become <a href=\"https://membership.theguardian.com/uk/supporter?INTCMP=gdnwb_copts_editorial_mem_garymunciefinal_inarticle\">a Guardian Supporter</a>, or make <a href=\"https://contribute.theguardian.com/home?INTCMP=co_uk_editorial_garyyoungeelectionday_footer\">a one-off contribution</a> to fund our unique journalism</strong><br></li> </ul>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/2016/sep/30/enhance-middletown/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/2016/sep/30/enhance-middletown/boot.js\" data-alt=\"Interactive script\"> </figure>",
  "<p>This election, white people in the Republican party settled upon the angriest, meanest, vilest person they could rally around \u2013 a con artist whose con they may well have been in on. He embodied their rage, and the possibility of enacting revenge for a black president, a declining white majority and a rising Black Lives Matter movement.</p> \n<p>But as the campaign wore on, the angry white man at the top of their ticket made Republicans, who have long fancied themselves Christian moralists, look increasingly hypocritical. He openly bragged about the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/07/election-2016-sexism-hillary-clinton-donald-trump\">size of his penis</a>, said he could <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2016/01/23/donald-trump-iowa-rally-shooting-sot.cnn\">shoot someone on Fifth Avenue</a> without losing voters, <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/videos/tv/2015/11/26/donald-trump-mocks-reporter-with-disability-berman-sot-ac.cnn\">mocked a disabled reporter</a> and boasted of grabbing women \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/07/donald-trump-leaked-recording-women\">by the pussy</a>\u201d. It didn\u2019t seem to matter. By the time he wrapped up the primary, I predicted <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/video/2016/may/11/trump-has-to-be-the-next-president-american-history-dictates-it-video\">Trump would become the 45th president</a> \u2013 and if it were <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/09/dissecting-donald-trumps-support/499739/\">up to white men alone</a>, he probably would.</p> \n<p>Fortunately, though, people of color had different ideas about who should be America\u2019s leader. In the Democratic primary, some of those ideas took shape \u2013 and a socialist channeled the conversation in surprising new ways.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/nov/08/path-election-day-hillary-clinton-video\" data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/5b39z\" data-show-ads=\"true\" data-video-id=\"2876172\" data-video-name=\"Bumpy road to election day: Clinton's campaign in two minutes \u2013 video\" data-video-provider=\"C-Span, CNN, MSNBC, Reuters, AP, ABC News\"> \n <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-5821f678e4b07ceadb3a39aa\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> \n  <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/11/08/161108clinton_desk.mp4\">\n  <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/11/08/161108clinton.m3u8\">\n  <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/11/08/161108clinton_WebM.webm\"> \n </video> \n <figcaption>\n  <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/nov/08/path-election-day-hillary-clinton-video\">Bumpy road to election day: Clinton\u2019s campaign in two minutes</a>\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton began a spirited and substantive contest, full of clashing policies and differing approaches to education, foreign affairs, Wall Street regulation, and healthcare. Sanders won an astounding <a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/was-the-democratic-primary-a-close-call-or-a-landslide/\">43%</a> of the Democratic primary votes (and <a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-young-democrats-love-bernie-sanders/\">handily won</a> its young people), after running against the biggest family machine in Democratic politics. But he never effectively made his case to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/03/bernie-sanders-failure-diversity-hispanic-black-voters\">black or Hispanic voters</a>, his team wasn\u2019t ready for primetime, and he lost \u2013 though not exactly fairly and squarely. Leaked emails revealed that the Democratic National Committee was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/24/debbie-wasserman-schultz-resigns-dnc-chair-emails-sanders\">no unbiased arbiter</a> in the primary. Meanwhile Sanders was harmed by the fact that, by <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2015/12/17/wheres-bernie-media-ignores-sanders-though-hes-more-popular-than-trump/\">some estimates</a>, Trump got 23 times the media coverage he ever did.</p> \n<p>Then, after the primary was over, the quality of discourse dropped - particularly with regard to subjects that were important to young people and people of color. If you were against Trump, the options varied between conservative and unimaginative. Gone was the spirited debate of the primary; assuming that progressives and people of color had nowhere else to go, Clinton welcomed the endorsement of neocons like John Negroponte and offered up pabulum like \u201cAmerica is great because America is good\u201d. Black Lives Matter \u2013 the most exciting movement in contemporary American politics \u2013 was never mentioned in the general debates, not even in St Louis, a few miles away from the scene of Michael Brown\u2019s killing.</p> \n<p>Many black voters, including me, came to feel the Democratic party had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/21/hillary-clinton-black-millennial-voters\">little or nothing</a> to offer us. This is not simply because Hillary Clinton once spoke of \u201csuper-predators\u201d \u2013 a whole lotta black politicians in the 1990s voted for that crime bill, too \u2013 but because the Black Lives Matter movement has changed the conversation about respectability politics. It made us ask if black politicians, or our alleged allies, are actually helping achieve black liberation. After we went all out for Barack Obama in 2008, only to discover that having a black president didn\u2019t change how black people are disproportionately unemployed, arrested, incarcerated and killed by police, it\u2019s little wonder that early voting is down among black voters. Not only that; as Luvvie Ajayi <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/Luvvie/posts/10107001752798080\">points out</a>: \u201cThis is also the first major election since 1964 where the Voting Rights Act hasn\u2019t protected us\u201d. We are tired of fighting GOP <a href=\"https://thinkprogress.org/study-finds-republican-voter-suppression-is-even-more-effective-than-you-think-3b2562ae2f52#.olav37i1m\"> voter suppression</a>, Trump\u2019s attempts at <a href=\"https://myaccount.nytimes.com/auth/login?URI=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2016%2F10%2F19%2Fus%2Fpolitics%2Fdonald-trump-voting-election-rigging.html%3F_r%3D0\">voter intimidation</a>, and the fact that <a href=\"http://fusion.net/story/335786/long-lines-minority-voter-suppression/\">black people wait twice as long as white people to vote</a>.</p> \n<p>Hispanic Americans have also found good reason to be disillusioned. When Trump called Mexicans \u201crapists\u201d and criminals, <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/nbc-donald-trump-2015-6\">NBC cut ties with him</a> \u2013 only to <a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2016-election/donald-trump-hosts-saturday-night-live-amid-protests-n459341\">welcome him back to host Saturday Night Live a few months later</a>. The message was symbolic and clear: America would tolerate Trump\u2019s disdain for Mexicans if and when it seemed profitable. A handful of politicians distanced themselves from Trump\u2019s \u201cgrab them by the pussy\u201d remark and his lewd comments about a white woman. But Paul Ryan, Newt Gingrich and the entire Republican establishment embraced Trump after he demonized Hispanic people. Hillary Clinton, likely to continue the deportation policies of the Obama administration, is not offering a satisfying alternative.</p> \n<p>Native people are disillusioned, too. They are the <a href=\"http://www.democracynow.org/2016/10/19/the_police_killings_no_one_is\">most likely</a> to be killed by police and, in North Dakota, are supposed to accept <a href=\"http://www.attn.com/stories/12405/two-tweets-show-double-standard-standing-rock-debate\">having their water threatened</a> in a way the white people of Bismarck didn\u2019t. And while they have mounted a beautiful and sustained protest at Standing Rock, they have been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/nov/02/dakota-pipeline-protest-bundy-militia\">assaulted</a> by the state for peaceful demonstration while the Bundys got off scot free.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom element--supporting\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"569772bd-4556-4621-a8b0-3ee9683bf545\" data-atom-type=\"explainer\"> \n  <div>\n   <figure class=\"element element-explainer element-atom\" data-display-type=\"expandable\"> \n    <h1>US presidential election: five scenarios </h1> \n    <div>\n     <p>1) The Clinton Crush: In which&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\">Donald Trump</a>&nbsp;loses every state with even a hint of Democratic flavor and drops a few big Republican ones too \u2013 the fantasy scenario for every American offended by Trump\u2019s candidacy</p>\n     <p>2) The Trump Bank Shot: Trump has performed strongly all night, winning Florida, Ohio, North Carolina and Iowa.

Our anger has been sidelined this year, while white rage has been front and center.</p> \n<p>In 2008, we had \u201cJoe the Plumber\u201d (<a href=\"http://www.sfgate.com/politics/article/Story-of-Joe-the-Plumber-springs-many-leaks-3265195.php\">actually</a> a man named Samuel Wurzelbacher), an aggrieved white man who got to set the presidential campaign\u2019s agenda in its final days. Joe/Sam got ample airtime simply because he was white and male and angry \u2013 and was amplified for his anger in a way a woman or a person of color never would be in America.</p> \n<p>In 2016, we got Joe the Plumber on steroids, reincarnated as the actual Republican candidate.</p> \n<p>And so, we slouch towards the finish line, our political imagination battered, our discourse made small, our political options reduced to \u201cAre you for fascism or not?\u201d For the first time in my life, I have begun to understand why people don\u2019t vote. </p>",
  "<p>The 2016 American presidential election has been an absurd, exhausting and bruising spectacle. Now imagine living through it all as a Muslim American. Somehow, this election has managed to cram all the Islamophobic sentiments of the last 15 years into the span of 15 months, and then morph them into one ugly thing. </p> <p>Donald Trump is largely to blame. He called for \u201ca total and complete shutdown of Muslims\u201d entering the country until it became clear that the proposal was embarrassingly ill-conceived, only to be replaced by the equally vague \u201cextreme vetting\u201d. He fought publicly with the Gold Star Khan family, suggesting Ghazala Khan was not \u201callowed to speak\u201d at the Democratic convention because of her Muslim faith. He <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2016/06/15/top-republicans-pretend-donald-trump-didnt-just-say-u-s-muslims-shield-terrorists/\">accused</a> Muslim Americans as a group of harboring terrorists.

Now just going out requires courage | Linda Sarsour</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Trump has insulted and defamed many different groups along the way, but what we may not realize is how it\u2019s different when it comes to Muslims. Over the course of the campaign, Trump has very publicly reached out to <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-trump-latinos-20160820-snap-story.html\">Latino</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/cheats/2016/08/19/trump-to-african-americans-vote-for-me-what-do-you-have-to-lose.html\">African American</a> and <a href=\"http://qz.com/823649/donald-trump-unfurled-a-rainbow-flag-with-lgbt-written-on-it-at-a-rally-in-greeley-colorado-to-express-his-so-called-support/\">LGBTQ</a> voters to ask for their support. We can question his sincerity, but the gestures are there. He even briefly tempered his tone regarding Mexicans during a <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-na-pol-trump-mexico-visit-20160831-snap-story.html\">quickly arranged visit</a> to President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto in Mexico City last August. </p> <p>His daughter <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/3063963/behind-the-brand/ivanka-trump-doesnt-flinch\">Ivanka</a> and wife <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/17/politics/melania-trump-interview/\">Melania</a> have defended him for his unforgivable behavior toward women, and Ivanka also <a href=\"http://time.com/4515709/ivanka-trump-campaign-ad-women/\">recorded</a> an official campaign television advertisement openly courting women voters for her father. Trump denies the charge he mocked a disabled reporter, and despite a bevy of antisemitic <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/10/donald-trump-anti-semitism-young-jews-214314\">incidents</a> involving Trump and his supporters over the past months, he has also <a href=\"http://www.sun-sentinel.com/florida-jewish-journal/news/broward/fl-jjbs-candidates-1102-20161101-story.html\">directly</a> sought Jewish American support. Such is his style of leadership: he may insult you, but he still wants your vote. </p> <p>Not so with the Muslims. A tiny handful of Muslim Americans may, bizarrely, be Trump supporters, but that doesn\u2019t diminish the fact that, while attempting to engage every other constituency, Trump\u2019s campaign has made essentially zero public outreach to the Muslim electorate. It\u2019s as if Muslim citizens already don\u2019t exist in Trump\u2019s America.</p> <p>The irony is that Trump\u2019s willful blindness to Muslim voters may lead to his defeat. Muslims may only account for a small part of the American population, but a concerted <a href=\"http://www.voanews.com/a/us-election-muslim-voters/3576727.html\">push</a> by Muslim Americans during this season has meant that there are now over a million registered Muslim voters, more than double the number in 2012. And Muslims tend to live in key battleground states such as Florida, Michigan, Ohio and Virginia. </p> <p>But Hillary Clinton may not be able to count on all of those votes either. Many Muslim Americans have long been uncomfortable with her hawkish foreign policy record and her superficially inclusive rhetoric. \u201cWe need American Muslims to be part of our eyes and ears on our frontlines,\u201d is a standard Clinton refrain, and with it we hear the suggestion that our communities live on some kind of \u201cfrontline\u201d of warfare. </p> <p>This is so not true: the front line of Costco, maybe. Most Muslim Americans are boring, middle-class folk. Clinton also seems to see Muslim Americans as separate from her idea of \u201cwe\u201d (\u201cwe\u201d need \u201cthem\u201d to be part of \u201cus\u201d) and to believe that we, as a group, carry some insider knowledge about evildoers that we may \u2013 or may not! \u2013 be willing to trade in exchange for equal treatment in the United States. </p> <p>This is offensive to our citizenship, and Muslim Americans must be afforded the same rights and protections as everyone else without precondition. But what this campaign has really shown is how contested and precarious the place is for Muslim Americans today. That won\u2019t change after 8 November, regardless of who wins. </p> <p>Even with a Clinton victory, Trump and his \u201cmovement\u201d, which is how he refers to his campaign, will not simply vanish. And the suggestion that Trump is merely using the election as a platform from which to start a new media empire is hardly comforting, as if there has never been a connection between mass media and far-right politics. So how prepared are we, as a nation, to deal with Trumpism after Tuesday?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/11/911-15-anniversary-united-states-lessons\">How we learned all the wrong lessons from 9/11 | Moustafa Bayoumi</a> </p> </aside>  <p>If there\u2019s any good news to come out of this election, it\u2019s that the country now recognizes the potent political force that is Islamophobia.

  "<p>Stock markets are drifting as the US finally gets to vote in the presidential election, with investors pausing for breath after Monday\u2019s surge on the prospects of a Hillary Clinton victory.</p> <p>But <strong>Imperial Brands</strong>, the maker of JPS and Gauloise cigarettes and Rizla papers, has dropped 2.5% to \u00a337.07 as news of new investment overshadowed in-line full year profits.</p> <p>The company said it planned to spend \u00a3300m in 2017 on \u201cselected quality growth opportunities\u201d, supported by moves to cut annual costs by \u00a3300m by 2020. It said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>To further drive delivery of our strategic priorities and underpin revenue growth over the medium term, we will invest an additional \u00a3300m, which net of investment returns will have a \u00a3200m impact in 2017. This will be partly offset by \u00a390m of cost optimisation savings resulting in a 4% net impact on 2017 constant currency earnings.</p> </blockquote> <p>Its 2016 results showed operating profit rising from \u00a31.9bn to \u00a32.2bn but after financing costs profit before tax fell from \u00a31.7bn to \u00a3669m. It hiked its dividend by 10%.</p> <p>Sales volumes were boosted by its recent US acquisitions, which were up 4.2% but there were declines in Iraq and Syria.</p> <p>Jefferies analyst Owen Bennett said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>While not set to grow earnings at the same level as peers, it needs to be judged on different parameters, in our view, with too much focus on share trends not doing the name justice. We believe that actions the company has taken has positioned it well to deliver mid-single digit earnings over the medium to long-term (and they committed to this in today\u2019s release).</p> <p>While bears will likely take the additional investment as a sign of weakness we believe the action should be applauded, taking advantage of supportive foreign exchange, and giving them a greater opportunity to improve momentum of growth brands.</p> <p>The medium-term outlook and expected 2017 earnings per share growth of over 10% (even with additional investment) is not appropriately reflected in the valuation, in our view, trading on 13.4 times net twelve month consensus PE, over 20% discount to the global space (we also think Imperial could be a take-out target in the next 18 months).</p> </blockquote> <p>Overall the <strong>FTSE 100</strong> has added 10.08 points to 6816.98.</p> <p>Primark-owner <strong>Associated British Foods</strong> and <strong>Marks &amp; Spencer</strong> are heading in different directions following their latest updates.</p> <p>ABF has added 136p to \u00a326.25 as it reported a 3% rise in full year operating profits and forecast higher earnings for the current year as the weak pound boosted overseas earnings, making up for the impact of rising import prices on Primark.</p> <p>Mike van Dulken, head of research at Accendo Markets, said: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Markets [have reacted] very positively to better than expected full year growth (sales, profits, selling space), helping shares extend an October bounce to levels last seen in late September. A global bond rally reducing financing costs coupled with lower tax and helpful foreign exchange moves are helping sugar margins (already up on better global sugar prices), bringing focus back to the \u2018ingredients/agriculture\u2019 segment to prove that the ABF story can still be something other than discount fashion and Primark.</p> <p>The latter\u2019s margins are still likely to suffer as a result of a weak pound/dollar rate, but markets are clearly glad that the overall negative effects to date (and forecast) are no more than the company had previously guided to.</p> </blockquote> <p>But Marks has dropped 5.6p to 343.4p after it reported <strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/nov/08/m-and-s-marks-spencer-close-80-stores-major-overhaul\">a 19% fall in profits and said it was shutting 80 stores around the world.</a></strong></p> <p>Lower down the market <strong>Punch Taverns</strong> has put on 2.4% to 115p as it said changes to pub regulations were having a negative effect on letting activity in the first half of the year, but its expectations for longer term growth were unchanged. In a buy note Stifel said the results were in line with expectations, adding:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We continue to believe that the shares are an overlooked and materially undervalued special situation. </p> </blockquote>",

What do these stops tell us about the race?</p> <p>Typically, last-minute campaign decisions are based on internal campaign polling not available to the public. Such polling explains why Al Gore campaigned at 2am in Florida on election day in 2000, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/stuartpstevens/status/795685460953677826\">as confusing as that move was</a> for the opposition at the time.</p> <p>The late moves of the 2016 campaign may be trickier to decode, in part because of the drunken-ninja style of the Donald Trump campaign, which <a href=\"https://twitter.com/maggieNYT/status/795722142159605760\">reportedly</a> ceased conducting its own polling last week or even two weeks ago.</p> <p>The action in Michigan, visited twice by Clinton and four times by Trump, may be most interesting. The Great Lakes state emerged as an object of interest relatively late in the race, with both campaigns having dispensed with other, more central fights, and with the Trump campaign sensing opportunity with the state\u2019s white blue-collar voters. The Clinton campaign hopes the state\u2019s Democratic voting record since 1988 will be good for 16 electoral votes Tuesday night.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/07/clinton-trump-final-campaign-stops-election-what-it-means\">The last-minute map: how to read each presidential candidate\u2019s final stops</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58214bdae4b029b92ca467a9\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-08T03:56:06.278Z\">3.56am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Shares in Asian markets \u2013 where it\u2019s Tuesday already \u2013 have edged up as the prospect of a Clinton win looks more likely, Reuters reports:</p> <blockquote> <p>Most Asian stock markets rose on Tuesday ahead of the election, with investors optimistic but cautious over improving prospects for a win by Hillary Clinton.</p> <p>The Mexican peso, which strengthens as the perceived chances of an election victory by Donald Trump fall, retained its strong gains from Monday.</p> <p>The dollar, which also advanced on Monday, edged slightly lower. </p> <p>Boosting Clinton\u2019s chances of winning, and markets globally, was a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/06/fbi-director-hillary-clinton-email-investigation-criminal-james-comey\">statement by the FBI on Sunday</a> standing by its July finding that Clinton was not guilty of criminal wrongdoing in her use of a private email server. </p> <p>That came after the FBI <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/28/fbi-reopens-hillary-clinton-emails-investigation\">announced on 28 October</a> it was reviewing additional emails relating to the server while Clinton was secretary of state, sending markets around the world tumbling. </p> <p>Clinton is seen by investors as offering greater certainty and stability, and, until last week\u2019s stumble, had been seen as the likely victor in Tuesday\u2019s presidential vote. </p> <p>But investors remained wary, noting Britain\u2019s shock vote in June to leave the European Union had defied most polls and bookmakers\u2019 odds. <br></p> <p>\u201cAs markets head into the U.S. election, a final recalibration of risk is in train,\u201d Michael McCarthy, chief market strategist at CMC Markets in Sydney, wrote in a note. <br></p> <p>\u201cAsia-Pacific markets were the first to adjust to the political shift, and may trade more modestly today after roaring back to life yesterday.\u201d </p> </blockquote> <p>We\u2019ll be keeping an eye on markets in Asia and beyond as the votes are totted up on Tuesday (or Wednesday as it\u2019s known in some parts of the globe).</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58214ad7e4b029b92ca467a6\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-08T03:48:25.836Z\">3.48am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The Miami Herald op-ed page is keeping it simple tomorrow:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/PatriciaMazzei/status/795819819090186240\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Prediction: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/HeraldOpEd\">@HeraldOpEd</a> gonna get a *few* emails about this one.

The cities he listed then \u2013 Cleveland, Detroit, Philadelphia, Las Vegas, Milwaukee, Fort Lauderdale, Charlotte, Richmond and Fayetteville \u2013 had large minority voting populations.</p> <p>In response, local Democratic parties in six battleground states filed lawsuits against Stone, Stop the Steal, and Republican parties, alleging broad efforts to intimidate minority voters.<br></p> <p>The new guidelines for the Stop the Steal volunteers nationwide come as another federal judge expressed skepticism that Democrats had any proof that the Trump campaign, local Republican parties, Stone and Stop the Steal were \u201cconspiring to threaten, intimidate, and thereby prevent minority voters in urban neighborhoods from voting\u201d, as Democrats had alleged in multiple lawsuits.</p> <p>In Philadelphia, US district judge Paul Diamond denied Democrats\u2019 request for a temporary restraining order on voter fraud prevention activities on Monday, ruling that Democrats had failed to make \u201cany credible showing\u201d that voters\u2019 rights were in jeopardy. The judge slammed the local Democratic party for \u201cbelated, inflammatory allegations<strong> </strong>that<strong> </strong>appear intended to generate only heat, not light\u201d.</p> <p>The supreme court on Monday also denied a request to restore a sweeping temporary restraining order issued by a federal judge in Ohio last week, which had briefly enjoined the Trump campaign, Stone, and Stop the Steal, as well as the Clinton campaign, from engaging in a variety of voter intimidation behaviors. A panel of sixth circuit judges had quickly stayed the order, which a leading election law expert had <a href=\"http://electionlawblog.org/?p=88761\">dubbed</a> \u201clikely unconstitutionally vague\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/07/donald-trump-poll-watcher-voter-fraud-roger-stone-steal-the-vote\">Donald Trump ally swears vigilante poll watchers will not target voters by race</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-582127b8e4b07ceadb3a360b\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-08T01:18:19.213Z\">1.18am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Donald Trump campaign creates 'voter assistance hotline'</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>From an email sent to supporters this evening:</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Thank you again for supporting Donald Trump for President.

The familiar syntax was not lost on us Latinos, who have been told to \u201cgo back\u201d for as long as we\u2019ve been in the United States, whether we were born here or not.</p> <p>Before he was forcibly removed, Ramos was criticizing Trump for effectively saying he would deport 11 million undocumented people and build a 1,900-mile border wall. Well, Trump skirted those specifics, but that was the reality of what he was proposing. We Latinos were put in a familiar place \u2013 where we are merely numbers or parasites to the economy, seen not for our worth as human beings but for our worth as laborers.</p> <p><em>Al mal tiempo, buena cara, </em>goes an old Mexican proverb. \u201cTo the bad times, good face.\u201d When I first delved into the world of activism, I used to hold the saying in contempt. It seemed to feed into the bottomless humility of the Mexican American in the face of oppression, the immigrant family, the Chicano who doesn\u2019t want to make a fuss. It painted us, I thought, as a people who merely stood by while bad things happened to us.</p> <p>Watching the Trump campaign, being its first scapegoats, I felt we were in that helpless place where our only option was to endure. The slogan Make America Great Again encapsulated exactly how we are seen in this country. We are the unclean other, our culture dilutes the purity of America\u2019s white citizens who must be protected from us. Make America great again \u2013 by kicking us out.</p> <p>Violence <a href=\"http://americasvoice.org/trumphatemap/\">against Latinos surged</a>, at Trump rallies and across the country. Xenophobia and racism were whipped into a fever pitch by the demagogue\u2019s rants, his constant attacks on our families and our neighbors. \u201cSend them back\u201d was a phrase I heard more in those months than I ever had in my life. \u201cYou have to go back\u201d became a common response to everything I wrote. Something had changed.</p> <p>It was Trump\u2019s attack on US district court judge Gonzalo P Curiel, born in Indiana and of Mexican descent, that saw our worst fears begin to take shape in reality.

They are, in fact, widespread and even predicted by some local officials.</p> <p>Since 2000, the popularity of early voting has increased from 12% of the electorate to an anticipated 40% this year, according to a <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/early-voting-2016-election/\">CBS report of the AP Election Research Group</a>. During that same time though, <a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/americans-love-early-voting-and-it-might-help-clinton/\">Republican-led</a> legislatures have pushed back against early voting in Ohio, Arizona and Nebraska. </p> <p>Why?</p> <p>In-person early voting tends to benefit Democrats. In North Carolina, for example, 60% of black voters \u2013 a reliably Democratic group \u2013 cast early ballots, as opposed to 44% of white voters, according to the <a href=\"https://www.facingsouth.org/2016/09/why-early-voting-matters\">Institute for Southern Studies</a>.</p> <p>Following the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/26/us/supreme-court-ruling.html\">US Supreme Court\u2019s dismantling</a> of the Voting Rights Act, which required some southern states to get pre-approval of election law changes from the federal government, North Carolinian state representatives passed a law that <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_slatest/2016/07/29/fourth_circuit_strikes_down_north_carolina_voting_restrictions.html\">eliminated early voting on one Sunday</a>. In part, that move was designed to impact \u201csouls to the polls\u201d day, a powerful program that brings black churchgoers to vote after Sunday service.</p> <p>A judge struck down that state law in July, finding that it targeted African Americans \u201c<a href=\"http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_slatest/2016/07/29/fourth_circuit_strikes_down_north_carolina_voting_restrictions.html\">with almost surgical precision</a>\u201d. Nevertheless, <a href=\"https://www.facingsouth.org/2016/09/why-early-voting-matters\">three North Carolina counties</a> still managed to limit early voting the Sunday before election day.</p> <p>Research from the Brennan Center for Justice on three states with the longest lines in 2012, Florida, Maryland and South Carolina, found that voters in urban areas tended to have fewer machines, less poll workers or both. More research cited by the center backs up findings that voters in <a href=\"http://www.pewhispanic.org/2016/10/11/democrats-maintain-edge-as-party-more-concerned-for-latinos-but-views-similar-to-2012/\">Latino</a> and African American districts tend to wait the longest (both constituencies lean Democratic).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e9e33d07f2741447a79ff6aa2b190503a8dc2a67\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e9e33d07f2741447a79ff6aa2b190503a8dc2a67/0_365_5472_3283/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A line of early voters waits outside the Franklin County Board of Elections, Monday, Nov. 7, 2016, in Columbus, Ohio.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A line of early voters waits outside the Franklin County Board of Elections, Monday, Nov. 7, 2016, in Columbus, Ohio.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Minchillo/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Just this spring, lines were so long in Arizona that voters of both parties were <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/2016/03/25/471891525/arizona-polling-places-overwhelmed-with-long-lines-on-primary-day\">livid</a>. Why? Republican state officials cut budgets for county officials, who in turn demanded cheap elections, which cut polling places. Democratic leaders tended to blame Republicans, who cut budgets. Arizona was another state that used to be required to seek pre-approval of election law changes under the Voting Rights Act.</p> <p>If politicians wanted to end long lines, experts say some simple recommendations could make a big impact. A January 2014 report called The American Voting Experience looked at ways that officials could predict and plan for voter turnout, after Floridians waited <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2012/11/no-one-in-america-should-have-to-wait-7-hours-to-vote/264506/\">seven hours</a> to vote for Barack Obama in 2012.</p> <p>They found that expanding early voting, online registration, new technologies and efficient polling place management could all help reduce and eliminate long wait times. </p> <p>So if you\u2019re waiting in a long line, congratulate your fellow voters, and consider a letter to you local election commission. </p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5820cee2e4b07ceadb3a34c6\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-07T19:00:40.062Z\">7.00pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Obama picks up on report that aides confiscated Trump's Twitter</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Don\u2019t miss this from the New York Times: <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/07/us/politics/donald-trump-presidential-race.html\">Inside Donald Trump\u2019s Last Stand: An Anxious Nominee Seeks Assurance</a>. <br></p> <p>Among the juicy details: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Aides to Mr. Trump have finally wrested away <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/\">the Twitter account</a> that he used to colorfully \u2014 and often counterproductively \u2014 savage his rivals.

It was about whether a woman could be the president of the US.</p> <p>How did it even start? I was no <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/feminism\">feminist</a> prodigy, just a shy kid who preferred reading to talking; politics weren\u2019t my destiny. Probably, I was trying to work out what was possible for my category of person \u2013 legally, logistically \u2013 as one might ask which kinds of terrain are navigable for a newly purchased bicycle. Up until then, gender hadn\u2019t darkened my mental doorway as I followed my older brother into our daily adventures wearing hand-me-down jeans.</p> <p>But in adolescence it dawned on me I\u2019d be spending my future as a woman, and when I looked around, alarm bells rang. My mother was a capable, intelligent, deeply unhappy woman who aspired to fulfilment as a housewife but clearly disliked the job. I saw most of my friends\u2019 mothers packed into that same dreary boat. My father was a country physician, admired and rewarded for work he loved. In my primordial search for a life coach, he was the natural choice.</p> <p>I probably started by asking him if girls could go to college, have jobs, be doctors, tentatively working my way up the ladder. His answers grew more equivocal until finally we faced off, Dad saying, \u201cNo\u201d and me saying, \u201cBut why not?\u201d A female president would be dangerous. His reasons vaguely referenced menstruation and emotional instability, innate female attraction to maternity and aversion to power, and a general implied ickyness that was beneath polite conversation.</p> <p>I ended that evening curled in bed with my fingernails digging into my palms and a silent howl tearing through me that lasted hours and left me numb. The next day I saw life at a remove, as if my skull had been jarred. What changed for me was not a dashing of specific hopes, but an understanding of what my father \u2013 the person whose respect I craved \u2013 really saw when he looked at me. I was tainted. I would grow up to be a lesser person, confined to an obliquely shameful life.</p> </blockquote> <p>Read the full piece here:</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/nov/06/hillary-clinton-white-house-donald-trump-bullying-barbara-kingsolver\">End this misogynistic horror show.

(In 2012, the state did not report results until four days after election day.)</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/ForecasterEnten/status/794215432135864320\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Giving the high early vote totals in both FL and NC, we&#39;re going to know fairly early on whether Clinton has won or Trump still has a shot.</p>&mdash; (((Harry Enten))) (@ForecasterEnten) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ForecasterEnten/status/794215432135864320\">November 3, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>Steve Schale is a Democratic analyst who ran Florida operations for Obama in 2008. He<strong> <a href=\"http://steveschale.com/\">sees low-propensity Hispanic voters</a> </strong>\u2013 meaning voters who weren\u2019t judged especially likely to turn out \u2013 <strong>pushing the election in Clinton\u2019s direction:</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>But two things emerged last week. One, this low propensity Hispanic thing became a thing. While Trump folks argued that Trump would turn out low propensity voters, we\u2019d see slight edges for Democrats in this category. What became clear over days last week, this was a Hispanic deal, and as week 2 of early voting took hold, so did this surge. As of Saturday, Democrats had an edge of more than 175K low propensity voters.</p> </blockquote> <p>Schale also sees <a href=\"http://steveschale.com/\">serious strength</a> for <strong>Clinton in Miami-Dade:</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Dade is at 11.9% of all votes cast so far (should be 10.3%), and Broward is at 9.55%, where I had it pegged at 8.75%. The media market is a full two points bigger than it should be. If the Miami market finishes at 21.8% of all votes, this thing is cooked, and we will know it before 8:00 (assuming Miami decides to count all these ballots)</p> </blockquote> <p>Schale sees <strong>Clinton \u201cunder-performing\u201d in Palm Beach county,</strong> two counties north of Miami:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The red flag for Dems: Palm Beach. It is at 62% of its 2012 total, and it is also the county most \u201cunder-performing.\u201d It should be about 7% of the state vote, but today it is about 5.9%. Of all the data points right now, this is the only one that concerns me. While Miami is more than making up for it, for HRC, win path is much easier with a more robust Palm Beach.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9a51b3fa0aebea1a11c2e7e8618af8dd2a7fb7f4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9a51b3fa0aebea1a11c2e7e8618af8dd2a7fb7f4/0_0_3500_2099/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Recording artist Stevie Wonder performing prior to President Obama coming on stage at a Clinton rally at Osceola County Stadium, Kissimmee, Florida, November 6, 2016.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Recording artist Stevie Wonder performing prior to President Obama coming on stage at a Clinton rally at Osceola County Stadium, Kissimmee, Florida, November 6, 2016.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: UPI / Barcroft Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><a href=\"http://steveschale.com/\">Here\u2019s Schales conclusion:</a></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I am going to write a wrap tomorrow for E-Day, but two questions I get a lot.</p> <p>What am I worried about for HRC?</p> <p>Really, almost nothing. I\u2019ve mentioned the Palm Beach thing a few times, but right now, the diversity mix is rounding nicely into shape, and our best counties are way out-performing the state. Right now, she needs the organization on the ground to get this done on Tuesday</p> <p>Could there be a Trump surge on Tuesday? It is possible, because the counties most under-performing right now are Trump counties. His problem, most of them are very small, part of what Jonathan Martin called the Gingrich Counties (where Newt beat Romney)-- those rural places in-between all the big counties.</p> <p>All in all, the I-10 markets are way below where they should be, maybe as much as 3% below where its share should be. If that comes in tomorrow, it will tighten the race considerably.</p> <p>Tomorrow\u2019s memo will also lay out some things you watch for. If she wins by 3, we will know pretty well, probably before the Panhandle returns come back after 8. If it is close, prepare for a long night.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58209c4ce4b07ceadb3a33c3\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-07T15:26:50.731Z\">3.26pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>She was 9 or 10 years old (depending on whether she falls in Aquarius-Leo or in Virgo-Capricorn) when the 19th amendment giving women the right to vote was ratified. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/1199SEIUFlorida/status/795367927285485569\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Desiline Victor, at 106 years old, is the oldest voter in <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/MiamiDade?src=hash\">#MiamiDade</a> arrives at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/NorthMiami?src=hash\">#NorthMiami</a> to cast her vote <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/WeCareWeVote?src=hash\">#WeCareWeVote</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/MobilizeFlorida?src=hash\">#MobilizeFlorida</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/PfPo7aeGRx\">pic.twitter.com/PfPo7aeGRx</a></p>&mdash; 1199SEIUFlorida (@1199SEIUFlorida) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/1199SEIUFlorida/status/795367927285485569\">November 6, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58209ab8e4b029b92ca464f6\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-07T15:18:06.012Z\">3.18pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Hi Grandma, what are you doing today? </p> <p>Hillary Clinton has a granddaughter who just turned two, and a grandson who\u2019s five months. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"clinton\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;instagram-media&quot; data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-version=&quot;7&quot; style=&quot; background:#FFF; border:0; border-radius:3px; box-shadow:0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width:658px; padding:0; width:99.375%; width:-webkit-calc(100% - 2px); width:calc(100% - 2px);&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;padding:8px;&quot;&gt; &lt;div style=&quot; background:#F8F8F8; line-height:0; margin-top:40px; padding:58.9932126697% 0; text-align:center; width:100%;&quot;&gt; &lt;div style=&quot; background:url(data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAACwAAAAsCAMAAAApWqozAAAABGdBTUEAALGPC/xhBQAAAAFzUkdCAK7OHOkAAAAMUExURczMzPf399fX1+bm5mzY9AMAAADiSURBVDjLvZXbEsMgCES5/P8/t9FuRVCRmU73JWlzosgSIIZURCjo/ad+EQJJB4Hv8BFt+IDpQoCx1wjOSBFhh2XssxEIYn3ulI/6MNReE07UIWJEv8UEOWDS88LY97kqyTliJKKtuYBbruAyVh5wOHiXmpi5we58Ek028czwyuQdLKPG1Bkb4NnM+VeAnfHqn1k4+GPT6uGQcvu2h2OVuIf/gWUFyy8OWEpdyZSa3aVCqpVoVvzZZ2VTnn2wU8qzVjDDetO90GSy9mVLqtgYSy231MxrY6I2gGqjrTY0L8fxCxfCBbhWrsYYAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC); display:block; height:44px; margin:0 auto -44px; position:relative; top:-22px; width:44px;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p style=&quot; margin:8px 0 0 0; padding:0 4px;&quot;&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/p/BMg3PI8AH2J/&quot; style=&quot; color:#000; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px; text-decoration:none; word-wrap:break-word;&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Hillary Clinton Facetimes with her granddaughter Charlotte on final morning of the campaign trail.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style=&quot; color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;&quot;&gt;A photo posted by Sabrina Siddiqui (@sabrinasiddiqui) on &lt;time style=&quot; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;&quot; datetime=&quot;2016-11-07T15:11:20+00:00&quot;&gt;Nov 7, 2016 at 7:11am PST&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;script async defer src=&quot;//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58209989e4b07ceadb3a33b1\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-07T15:14:43.720Z\">3.14pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Philly transit strike ends</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>If voters in Philadelphia, prime Democratic territory, don\u2019t turn up at the polls tomorrow, they will not have a weeklong public transit strike to blame.

  "<p>To become the 45th president of the United States, Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump has to win 270 electoral college votes. The candidates have spent what feels like 100 years locked in mortal combat, but in the next few hours there will finally be a victor. (Well, probably. If there\u2019s a 269-vote tie, or a mandatory recount, prepare for constitutional chaos.)</p> <h2>So remind me how the electoral college works again? </h2> <p>Each state is assigned a certain number of electoral votes, ultimately based on its population. California has the most, with 55. Seven states \u2013 Alaska, Delaware, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Vermont and Wyoming \u2013 have just three electoral votes. Washington DC gets three too.</p> <p>While there are 50 states in the US, most of these are \u201csafely\u201d Republican or Democrat. They vote the same way every time going back at least six elections. So the presidential election boils down to just a handful of \u201cswing states\u201d \u2013 the 10 or 11 states that have a recent history of selecting both Republicans and Democrats. </p> <p>This is why voters in places such as Ohio, Florida, Iowa, North Carolina, Virginia, Nevada, Colorado and New Hampshire are subjected to a barrage of television advertising and campaign stops. It\u2019s also why you have not seen Clinton and Trump holding rallies in Louisiana (safely Republican) or Washington (safely Democratic).</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/oct/31/how-does-electoral-college-work-us-election-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/59yvc\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2849673\"            data-video-name=\"How does the US electoral college work? \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"Guardian/Getty Images\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-58136bc4e4b08d944ba4ba7a\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/10/28/161028elect1_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/10/28/161028elect1.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/10/28/161028elect1_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/oct/31/how-does-electoral-college-work-us-election-video\">How does the US electoral college work?</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Trump faces a much more difficult path to victory. He needs to win almost all of these swing states to become the next president, whereas if Clinton wins two or three, she wins the race. </p> <p>This is because Democrats start from a stronger position. There are 18 states plus DC that have voted for a Democrat for president in every election since 1992. That batch amounts to 242 electoral votes. There are only 13 states that have voted for a Republican in every election since 1992. Those states carry just 102 electoral votes.</p> <p>If Clinton simply wins all the states that have voted for her predecessors in the recent past, then adds Florida (which has 29 electoral votes), she is the next president. If she loses Florida but wins, say, Virginia and North Carolina, she will be the next president.</p> <p>Trump needs to hold on to all the historically Republican states, win states such as Georgia and Arizona \u2013 which are usually Republican but where he has struggled in the polls \u2013 and then win enough swing states to tip him over 270.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/11/poll-closings/\" data-alt=\"Poll closing times\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/11/poll-closings/\">Poll closing times</a> </figure>  <p><em>(For our international readers following along across Europe and beyond, a little light math for you ... in the UK, Ireland, Iceland and Portugal, add five hours to ET; anywhere else from Poland west, add six hours; in eastern Europe, add seven hours; Australia add 16 hours; and so on.) </em></p> <h2>6pm ET (5pm CT, 4pm MT, 3pm PT, 11pm GMT) \u2013 let\u2019s go!<br></h2> <p>Buckle in because now the real fun begins: polls close in eastern Kentucky and most of Indiana.

But Donald Trump doesn\u2019t have to worry about the prospect of a Donald Trump presidency. A nice way to toast \u2013 and mock, if you were minded to do so \u2013 the 70-year-old builder might be to mix up a <a href=\"http://www.liquor.com/articles/presidential-election-cocktails/\">\u201cThe Donald\u201d</a> cocktail as you settle in for the night.

Trump likes the Rolling Stones and played this song at his rallies. The Rolling Stones do not like Donald Trump, and asked him to stop. He didn\u2019t.</p> <h2>7pm ET (6pm CT, 5pm MT, 4pm PT, 12am GMT)</h2> <p>Voting ends in three key swing states: Virginia, Florida and New Hampshire (where a minimal number of polling stations may stay open until 8pm ET).<br></p> <p>Florida\u2019s 29 electoral college <a href=\" http://dos.myflorida.com/elections/for-voters/voting/election-day-voting/\">votes</a> have proved crucial in the recent past. Al Gore can tell you that. He narrowly lost the state \u2013 some still believe he actually won \u2013 and the election to George W Bush, despite winning the national popular vote. </p> <p>Away from the top of the ticket, Florida senator and one-time Republican presidential candidate Marco Rubio is up for re-election. He has been running a bit ahead of Democrat Patrick Murphy in the polls. Debbie Wasserman-Schultz, who resigned as chair of the Democratic National Committee in July after leaked emails showed the party favoring Clinton\u2019s campaign, is expected to comfortably win re-election to Congress.</p> <p>Virginia was a reliably Republican state until Obama won there in 2008 and again in 2012. The state\u2019s mix of less-educated, rural voters; wealthy suburbanites; federal government employees and military families; academics; jet-setters and so on make it difficult to read, but Clinton has been decisively ahead this year. </p> <p>New Hampshire has been won by a Democrat in five of the past six presidential elections. But the Granite State gave Trump his first big primary win, and recent polling here has shown a tight race.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"d26348a1118b4b39b2fd0263b5f76c785aaa2311\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d26348a1118b4b39b2fd0263b5f76c785aaa2311/0_0_1472_5321/277.png\" alt=\"Spicy Hot Sauce\" width=\"277\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Spice things up</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Erickson Photography/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Other states closing at 7pm ET include South Carolina and Vermont \u2013 Bernie Sanders\u2019 home state.

Expect the result from West Virginia very quickly \u2013 Trump should win easily. </p> <p>North Carolina and Ohio are swing states and will take longer. Ohio has been seen as a reliable bellwether state, voting for the presidential winner in every election since 1964. That run might be coming to an end, however, either <a href=\"http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/political_commentary/commentary_by_kyle_kondik/why_trump_will_do_better_in_ohio_than_he_does_nationally\">because of the state\u2019s changing demographics</a> or because of the strangeness of the current contest, in terms of the unfavorability of both candidates. </p> <p>While its demographics are complicated \u2013 a mix of Rust Belt, big cities, Appalachia, farmland and more \u2013 the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/30/us/politics/ohio-campaign-trump-clinton.html\">Ohio electorate</a> has grown more white and less educated than the national mean. That trend appears to account in part for Trump\u2019s strength in the Buckeye State this year.</p> <p><strong>Election soundtrack: </strong>The Pretenders, Message of Love. Because Chrissie Hynde is was born in Akron, Ohio. You could also make a point about spreading a message of love. Or of someone pretending to spread a message of love. Not that we\u2019re questioning, in any way at all, how much politicians love the voters.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <h2>8pm ET (7pm CT, 6pm MT, 5pm PT, 1am GMT)</h2> <p>In 2012, the Associated Press called the Indiana result just before 8pm. Vigo County, which borders Illinois in west Indiana, is seen as <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.msnbc.com/portrait-bellwether-indiana-county-has-history-picking-presidents#slide1\">the ultimate bellwether</a>. It has voted for the winner of every presidential election in 30 of the past 32 elections \u2013 dating back to 1888. Keep an eye out for its result.</p> <p>A big swing state closes its polls at 8pm: Pennsylvania.</p> <p>Republicans have long dreamed of winning Pennsylvania\u2019s 20 electoral college votes, based on growing support among once flourishing manufacturing and mining sectors in the south-western and north-eastern corners of the state. But Clinton has been creaming Trump in polls in Philadelphia and its suburbs, which is where most of the people live, and she has been comfortably ahead in statewide polls for months. </p> <p>Pennsylvania will also be under scrutiny on election day because of Trump\u2019s controversial <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/16/donald-trump-rigged-election-poll-giuliani-gingrich-pence\">claims</a> that there has been voter fraud in Philadelphia in the past and his calls for \u201cvolunteer election monitors\u201d.</p> <p>The results in non-swing states will start to come in thick and fast. Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Mississippi, Missouri, New Jersey and Rhode Island all close at 8pm ET, and we can expect AP to call all these states pretty much immediately.</p> <p>Maine\u2019s polls also close at 8pm. It is one of only two states \u2013 the other is Nebraska, where voting finishes at 9pm \u2013 that splits its electoral votes <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/22/politics/electoral-college-split-votes-maine-nebraska-proportional/\">according to congressional district</a>.</p> <p>The state as a whole is likely to vote Democrat, but Trump may steal an electoral vote in Maine\u2019s second district, which is made up of more rural voters.</p> <p><strong>Election fuel:</strong> There\u2019s a whole \u201cChefs for Hillary\u201d page <a href=\"https://www.pinterest.com/search/pins/?rs=ac&amp;len=2&amp;q=chefs%20for%20hillary&amp;etslf=4171&amp;eq=chefs%20for%20hilla&amp;term_meta[]=chefs%20for%20hillary%7Cautocomplete%7C\">on Pinterest</a>, a tribute to Clinton\u2019s attempts to win the foodie vote. <a href=\"https://www.pinterest.com/pin/554716879086195985/\">One of the recipes is provided by John Podesta</a>, the chairman of Clinton\u2019s campaign.

In the 2012 election, Mitt Romney was declared the winner just before 8.30pm. A Democratic candidate hasn\u2019t won in Georgia since proper southern boy Bill Clinton in 1992, but strong support for Hillary Clinton in Georgia counties with a high African American population, and in Atlanta, have made her a threat to Trump. </p> <p>If Clinton wins Georgia, Trump might as well concede. (Don\u2019t hold your breath.)</p> <p><strong>Election tunes: </strong>Marvin Gaye, Inner City Blues (Make Me Wanna Holler). The African American vote is in, and Trump gets a big 1%.</p> <h2>9pm ET (8pm CT, 7pm MT, 6pm PT, 2am GMT)</h2> <p>Polls close in two traditional swing states: Wisconsin and Colorado, and in Arizona, which is usually firmly Republican but is swingy this year.<br></p> <p>An increasingly influential Hispanic bloc and Mormons who can\u2019t stand Trump \u2013 not to mention a superior Democratic ground game \u2013 mean that Clinton has a decent chance of becoming the first Democrat to win Arizona since her husband in 1996.</p> <p>When the polls close in New York, at 9pm ET, they will have been open for 15 hours \u2013 the longest polling window of any state. Barring an almighty upset, Clinton will quickly be declared the winner.</p> <p>Wyoming, Louisiana, North and South Dakota, Kansas and Texas all close at 9pm too. The networks should swiftly call these for Trump \u2026 unless loose talk of Clinton taking Texas, which last went Democratic in the Watergate era, comes true? If it\u2019s that kind of night, water the horses and go to town.</p> <p>Nebraska, which like Maine splits its electoral votes by <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/22/politics/electoral-college-split-votes-maine-nebraska-proportional/\">congressional district</a>, shuts its polls at 9pm ET. Barack Obama won Nebraska\u2019s second district \u2013 Omaha \u2013 in 2008. Clinton could do the same this year, thanks to a well-financed get-out-the-vote effort spearheaded by Susan Buffett, daughter of Warren. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"8edfd50af2c072354a729c7babe3cd48a3ecacea\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8edfd50af2c072354a729c7babe3cd48a3ecacea/0_0_2261_2097/1000.png\" alt=\"Slice of plain cheesecake\" width=\"1000\" height=\"927\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>Election fuel:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.food.com/recipe/new-york-cheesecake-57025\">New York cheesecake</a>. Hillary Clinton was born in Chicago but was a senator from New York for eight years. Donald Trump was born in Queens, New York, before inheriting his father\u2019s successful real estate business. In January, Trump claimed his popularity was such that he could \u201cstand in the middle of Fifth Avenue [in New York City] and shoot somebody\u201d without losing voters. Trump <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/ny/new_york_trump_vs_clinton-5792.html\">has been trailing</a> Clinton by 20% in New York.</p> <p><strong>Election soundtrack:</strong> Fleetwood Mac, Silver Springs. \u201cI know I could\u2019ve loved you, but you would not let me,\u201d laments Arizona\u2019s Stevie Nicks. Might Trump be thinking the same thing when the Grand Canyon State\u2019s results come in?</p> <h2>10pm ET (9pm CT, 8pm MT, 7pm PT, 3am GMT)</h2> <p>Given Clinton\u2019s apparent strength in Pennsylvania, we may see the state called for her by 10pm (or, in a deeply troubling upset for her, Trump may win). The New Hampshire result should also come in around this time. They will offer one of the first concrete indications of how the night is going.</p> <p>Nevada and Iowa are the final swing states to close their polls. In the past two elections, Iowa was called quickly for Obama. Montana and Utah also close at 10pm; both are traditionally safe Republican states, but Trump\u2019s unpopularity means <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2016-10-24/mormon-support-could-push-mcmullin-over-the-top-in-utah\">independent Evan McMullin</a>, who\u2019s from Utah, has a strong chance of becoming the first non-Republican or Democrat to win electoral college votes since 1968. </p> <p>Utah has been called soon after the polls close in the recent past. If McMullin is declared the winner, it\u2019s a good sign that the night is truly in uncharted territory, terra incognita, in the most exciting way. Former congressional staffer Evan McMullin: buckle up, America.</p> <p><strong>More election drinking:</strong> Yuengling brewery \u2013 the oldest brewery in the US \u2013 is based in Pennsylvania. Its owner <a href=\"http://www.phillyvoice.com/beer-drinkers-disavow-yuengling-after-owner-shows-support-for-trump/\">came out in support of Trump</a> in October, a move which has seen some drinkers boycotting the beer. You could however source some craft ale from the <a href=\"http://www.victorybeer.com/\">Victory Brewing Company</a>, also based in Pennsylvania.

These are all safe Democrat states that are unlikely to unexpectedly impact the outcome. </p> <p>Back in 2012, the Associated Press called the swing states of Colorado, Iowa, North Carolina and Ohio \u2013 worth a combined 48 electoral votes \u2013 in the space of 30 minutes at around 11pm, then declared Obama\u2019s re-election at 11.38pm. </p> <p>In 2008, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73ksUPU0Nbo\">networks announced</a> Obama had won just after 11pm.</p> <p>We might know the outcome sooner this time. Or we might not know for a while.</p> <p>If Clinton\u2019s lead in opinion polls translates to the actual polls, then we may see states called for her earlier, on the back of strong early voting results. If enough swing states are called quickly, we could find out the result before 11pm ET. Or, if Trump proves the polls wrong, the race could as quickly run to him.</p> <p>Separately, there are some individual states to look out for.</p> <p>Ohio is one. Some polling experts believe that if Trump doesn\u2019t win there, it is effectively game over. <a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/if-trump-wins-heres-how-the-map-might-look/?ex_cid=538twitter\">Fivethirtyeight.com gave him</a> less than a 1% chance of winning the presidency if he fails to take the Buckeye State.</p> <p>Likewise, if Trump loses North Carolina or Pennsylvania or Florida, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/most-routes-to-270-blocked-for-trump-needs-last-ditch-surge/2016/10/30/b3cf409a-9ede-11e6-8864-6f892cad0865_story.html\">it also becomes very difficult</a> for him to win.</p> <p>And beyond that, if Clinton can win Georgia \u2013 remember, these are usually solidly Republican \u2013 it would suggest she is in for a blowout victory that could see the election called for her very early.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"100102cda2684f749441d7cb80e7b29f4e29d579\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/100102cda2684f749441d7cb80e7b29f4e29d579/0_0_1197_3576/335.png\" alt=\"Queen Latifah\" width=\"335\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Queen Latifah</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Toth/FilmMagic</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In 2012, Virginia was only called for Obama after midnight and Florida was not called for four days.

We may see the first female president, following a campaign marked by sexism and inappropriate behaviour towards women. Queen Latifah called out the disrespectful treatment of women in this 1994 hit.</p> <p><strong>Election fuel: </strong><a href=\"http://www.chowhound.com/recipes/cuban-sandwiches-30428\">Cuban sandwich</a>. Florida\u2019s signature dish is said to have originated in Cuba or in Key West, part of the Florida Keys archipelago. It\u2019s got ham, swiss cheese, mustard and pickles in it, and might be a good way to soak up the booze.</p> <h2>Time for the the speeches?</h2> <p>In the early hours, we would expect a victory speech and a concession speech \u2013though Trump has spoken of a threat that the election could be rigged and refused to say that if he loses he will accept the result. </p> <p>If elected, Clinton would be the first woman to be elected US president. She has <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/hillary-clinton-glass-ceiling_us_579827fee4b0d3568f85272e\">repeatedly spoken</a> about breaking the \u201cglass ceiling\u201d in politics, and has chosen to hold her election night party at New York City\u2019s Javits Center, which <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/26/politics/hillary-clinton-election-night-javits-center-irpt/\">actually has a glass ceiling</a>.</p> <p>If Trump is elected, he will be the first person with his own vodka line to be elected president, and <a href=\"http://thehill.com/blogs/pundits-blog/presidential-campaign/252557-how-often-do-americans-elect-political-outsiders-to\">only the fifth</a> president to have never held elected office. </p> <p>The winner will have 73 days to set up a new government before they are sworn into office on 20 January 2017.</p> <p>But if you\u2019re concerned about post-election withdrawal symptoms, don\u2019t worry: the midterm elections, sometimes seen as a referendum on the president, will take place in November 2018. All 435 members of the House of Representatives will be up for re-election, along with a third of the Senate and more than half the governors.</p> <p>And then, in summer 2019, a whole new cast of hopefuls will announce their presidential campaigns, and the whole thing starts over again.

  "<p>Frank Archambault is not going to vote for president. </p> <p>In mid-July, the 45-year-old member of the Standing Rock Sioux tribe packed up all of his belongs and his family \u2013 five children and a grandson \u2013 to travel from Little Eagle, South Dakota, to Cannon Ball, North Dakota, to join the movement of \u201cwater protecters\u201d facing off against the federal government and the oil industry.

Generations of war, massacres, broken treaties, discrimination, police harassment, and poverty have resulted in a general feeling of distrust, disillusion, and disinterest in mainstream politics among the Native Americans gathered at Standing Rock. And historical traumas have only been compounded by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/29/dakota-access-pipeline-native-american-protesters\">militarized police response</a> to unarmed protesters, who have been met with Mace, rubber bullets, Tasers and sound weapons. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f3da547d142a32bae22dd8397c0441c90ab55e8b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f3da547d142a32bae22dd8397c0441c90ab55e8b/0_115_4032_2419/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Frank Archambault: \u2018I don\u2019t have faith in government, so I don\u2019t want to have a say.\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Frank Archambault: \u2018I don\u2019t have faith in government, so I don\u2019t want to have a say.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Julia Carrie Wong/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think anyone here votes,\u201d said Julie Richards, an Oglala Lakota from Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in South Dakota. \u201cWe\u2019re all like, fuck the government, fuck voting, and fuck the people running.\u201d </p> <p>The rest of the nation may be glued to cable news and the latest polls, anxious for the uncertain future of an unusual election.

  "<p>Many of us have been stuck in a Brexistential crisis since June. Uncertainty over if, whether and how <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/article-50\">article 50 will be triggered</a> only sharpens our distrust of political leaders, and ever more hyperbolic, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/nov/04/labour-condemns-newspaper-attacks-on-judges-after-brexit-ruling\">rabble-rousing headlines</a> appear now on a daily basis. We face another looming worry: the possibility of a Donald Trump victory in the US. Like Princess Diana\u2019s death or 9/11, these are world events that we struggle to compute. They are absolutely real yet seem strangely unreal.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/nov/07/what-happens-after-clinton-trump-win-election-progressive\">Whether Trump or Clinton wins the US election, what follows is up to us | Rebecca Solnit</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Both Brexit and the US election raise questions about borders and identity, which trigger primitive and personal anxieties about the breaching of the boundary between inside and outside, provoking associations with the body. For example, there\u2019s the idea that the national border, our collective \u201cskin\u201d, might collapse, and that we might face annihilation. Or that we have something so precious that others wish to take us over, to invade us and steal this. A leader who promises to protect the boundary of inside and outside can thus have a special allure, as history shows. Hence the appeal of a Trump, with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/nov/07/donald-trump-presidency-america-endure-latinos-experience\">his Mexico-US wall</a> and his evocation of the \u201cTrojan horse\u201d of immigration. These images might seem laughable to many, but they touch on people\u2019s basic anxieties about boundaries.</p> <p>The supreme certitude and confidence of such leaders gains a particular power when the world feels so tenuous, fragile and uncertain. Our changing relationship to expertise, evidence and traditional hierarchical structures leaves a dreadful vacuum. We haven\u2019t really established any new forms of political organisation in their place. This is partly because new forms of organisation are quickly ridiculed as we struggle between old and new. And partly because at some level we take for granted that things can\u2019t and won\u2019t change.</p> <p>Yet, ambivalent as we so often are, we also yearn for change. The presumption that we wish to maintain the status quo forecloses our perhaps more covert desire to shake things up, turn over the apple cart, to see what happens. When these sometimes destructive whims <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/24/meriden-brexit-leave-regret-doubts-linger-eu-referendum\">turn into a reality</a> it can be all the more unsettling, as seen in the numbers of Bregrexit voters who didn\u2019t think their vote would really count, or people who secretly want a Trump victory to see what happens. Even the philosopher Slavoj Zi\u017eek says <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Channel4News/status/794232437337247744\">he would vote for Trump</a> for precisely this reason.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/oct/31/donald-trump-hillary-clinton-650-million-people-week-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/5a5j5\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2858198\"            data-video-name=\"Trump: Clinton would let 650 million people into US in one week \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"Pool\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-58171544e4b08d944ba4c889\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/10/31/161031TrumpImmigrationClaim2_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/10/31/161031TrumpImmigrationClaim2.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/10/31/161031TrumpImmigrationClaim2_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/oct/31/donald-trump-hillary-clinton-650-million-people-week-video\">Trump: Clinton would let 650 million people into US in one week</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>We like to ridicule such voters to assure ourselves that we act rationally, that we want the sensible, fair solution. But of course we all vote from a transitional space between reality and fantasy, influenced by pulls and pushes based on our background, and the histories of generations before us that have been transmitted to us both consciously and unconsciously.</p> <p>The reaction to this year\u2019s votes show a fundamental lack of curiosity, an increasing intolerance for other people\u2019s attitudes and ideals. People who vote for Clinton, Trump, leave, remain all believe in their position, and most will have constructed an internal logic to justify it. We must make the effort here to humanise the other by trying to find out, gently, about this logic, or we become ourselves the creators of Trump\u2019s dividing wall.</p> <p>In the face of such uncertainty, it is perhaps no surprise that experts are brought in to instruct us on how to cope. The advice tends to be quite simple. Limit your social media. Meditate. Connect with friends. Go out into nature. And, as the American Psychological Association (APA) recommends, \u201c<a href=\"http://www.apa.org/news/press/releases/2016/10/presidential-election-stress.aspx\">avoid catastrophising, and maintain a balanced perspective</a>\u201d. These suggestions are both vaguely useful and patently ridiculous, and they serve to depoliticise our situation. In their own way, they reinforce a split between inside and outside, as if it were sane to focus on inner peace when Rome is burning.</p> <p>We need instead to remember the transformative potential of emotion. Uncertainty and fear can be a means to recognise the intimate, mutual relationship between our inner lives and outer political realities. Rather than aiming to stay calm, is it not time to remember that emotion has always been the fuel for collective action, social justice movements and political change? Advice on how to cope through techniques of self-management, here, can interfere dangerously with what our bodies are cueing us to do.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Perhaps we can find inspiration instead in those who suffered trauma and tried to do something with it</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Perhaps we can find inspiration instead in those who suffered trauma and tried to do something with it. I spent last weekend at a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/MHWelfareReform?src=hash\">welfare reform</a> conference where we were greeted by a banner with the names of those who had died as a result of benefits sanctions carefully embroidered on it. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/22magoo\">Maggie Zolobajluk</a> and her allies had put love, grief, tears and passion into this creation.</p> <p>My heroes are not politicians but exceptional people such as Zolobajluk who, when a tragedy has occurred, manage to find the political drive to create something new, to try to make sure that nothing similar ever happens again.</p> <p>Here Zi\u017eek has a point. If Clinton wins, if things seem to be stabilising, we risk becoming complacent again, and losing the transformative potential of the emotions we now feel. We must resist this false calm, for it would reduce us to being subject once more to the forces that have created the current crises. Rather, we must surely use our feelings to charge us to create forms of organisation and resistance that, like Zolobajluk\u2019s banner, bear crucial messages. A breakdown, after all, always carries within it the seeds of a breakthrough if we take it seriously, and act accordingly.</p>",

Election day is \u2018choice day\u2019, but we make choices all the time, day to day.\u201d</p> <p>One of the voting machines takes its choices from Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump television commercials, with Clinton and Trump edited out of them. </p> <p>\u201cI got a list of characteristics of campaign B-roll from Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump commercials,\u201d DuBois says. \u201cIf you take the campaign ads and remove footage from the candidates, and you look at the other footage they use \u2013 it\u2019s pretty specific. Hillary has tons of ads where she starts with a shot of blue sky. Donald Trump has lots of ads where he shows the American flag.</p> <p>\u201cWhen Hillary shows cities she shows people,\u201d he continues. \u201cWhen Trump shows cities he tends to show empty playgrounds, or bombed-out public housing. It\u2019s pretty different. What I did was extract 12 sets of words. Do you want blue or red? Sky or ground? Do you want a building or people? Based on how you choose you get an image montage \u2013 you get your own personal one-minute video.\u201d</p> <p>Another voting machine makes odd text mashups based on how you vote, using classic book titles like Pride and Prejudice and Tropic of Capricorn, drawn from the <a href=\"https://www.gutenberg.org/wiki/Gutenberg:Offline_Catalogs\">Project Gutenberg database</a>. A voting machine next to it creates sound. It draws its categories from Luigi Russolo\u2019s classic 1913 Futurist manifesto <a href=\"http://www.unknown.nu/futurism/noises.html\">The Art of Noises</a>; you can vote on categories like roar, whistle, bang, hiss and mumble. When you\u2019re done voting, the machine makes you a custom piece of music collaged from the <a href=\"http://shop.prosoundeffects.com/products/bbc-complete-sound-effects-library\">BBC sound effects library.</a> Another machine makes drawings for you on a small screen, inspired by Logo, the brainchild of the late MIT professor<a href=\"http://www.papert.org/\"> Seymour Papert</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1e1b308e46690178d5a24b081cf524cc1b527d72\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1e1b308e46690178d5a24b081cf524cc1b527d72/0_0_720_540/500.jpg\" alt=\"Learning Machine #4: Language, using a machine from 1960.\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Learning Machine #4: Language, using a machine from 1960.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Berens</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A red velvet curtain in a corner of the gallery encircles a giant voting machine from the 1950s \u2013 a behemoth weighing over 600 pounds. This machine draws its values from the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/careers/careers-blog/myers-briggs-employee-personality-test-accurate\">Myers-Briggs personality test</a>. An overwhelming sea of choices faces you, in alphabetical order \u2013 compassionate, dutiful, ecstatic, fashionable \u2013 on a massive steel panel. The choices feel like they were part of the original machine; DuBois had a collaborator, the designer <a href=\"http://www.samarskaya.com/\">Ksenya Samarskaya</a>, design a special vintage typeface for the choices that recalls the 1950s.</p> <p>A computer connected to the machine then looks up your choices on Instagram and the New York Times. A screen next to the machine shows the results in real time, in a disorienting, endless scrolling collage. Looking up the choices on Instagram brings up lots of strange selfies. The New York Times database brings up lots of obituaries. \u201cWe tend to only use these values when people are dead,\u201d DuBois says. \u201cWe don\u2019t tend to use these values to describe living people.\u201d</p> <p>In another corner of the gallery lurks the infamous voting device that produced the \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/sep/15/2016-election-old-voting-machines-hanging-chad\">hanging chads</a>\u201d seen in Florida in the 2000 presidential election, complete with plenty of punched card ballots so you can try your hand at producing a hanging chad yourself. A glass vitrine nearby houses pieces of the old voting machines, so you can see the intriguing backs of them \u2013 along with gears, keys and other ephemera. </p> <p>\u201cBy drilling it down to playing with these machines, and doing these seemingly low-stakes actions with media, I wanted people to just meditate on what it means to have options, and to not understand what these options mean,\u201d DuBois says. \u201cI don\u2019t think that we think as much as we should about it. This show is more lyrical; I\u2019m not trying to hit you over the head with a specific point of view. </p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s an admittedly modest contribution to the discourse, but rather than making a show that\u2019s just bashing Donald Trump, I wanted to get people to focus more on what Tuesday is all about, which is choosing.

  "<p>Donald Trump may not have had any celebrities appearing his behalf on Monday night \u2013 but he told a crowd of more than 10,000 that he was backed by the New England Patriots star quarterback, Tom Brady, and their head coach, Bill Belichick.</p> <p>In a local interview earlier on Monday, though, Brady said he hadn\u2019t voted yet \u2013 \u201cI am going to vote today or tomorrow\u201d \u2013 and played coy on who he might vote for: \u201cNext week I\u2019ll tell you.\u201d<br></p> <p>Speaking in Manchester, New Hampshire, in an arena lit with laser lights and smoke machines, the Republican nominee took the stage in his penultimate event before election day to announce the support of two of the most beloved sports figures in New England.<br></p> <p>Trump has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/sep/03/donald-trump-tom-brady-great-friend\">long bragged</a> that Brady, a two-time NFL MVP and four time Super Bowl champion, \u201cis a great friend of mine\u201d. Brady was suspended for four games at the start of the 2016 season for his role in the Deflategate scandal.</p> <p>The Republican nominee told the cheering crowd on Monday night that Brady called him earlier in the day to say: \u201cDonald, I support you. You\u2019re my friend and I voted for you.\u201d<br></p> <p>The quarterback was photographed in 2015 with a Make America Great Again hat in his locker. Brady <a href=\"http://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2015/12/15/tom-brady-donald-trump-is-a-good-friend-and-i-support-my-friends/\">also said</a> in an interview in December 2015: \u201cDonald is a good friend of mine. I have known him for a long time. I support all my friends.\u201d However, Brady\u2019s wife, Gisele Bundchen, last week <a href=\"http://nesn.com/2016/11/gisele-bundchen-tells-fan-she-and-tom-brady-dont-back-donald-trump/\">denied that the couple would vote for Trump</a> in a comment on her Instagram page.</p> <p>The Republican candidate also boasted of his support from the Patriots head coach, Bill Belichick. The famously taciturn and obsessive coach has won four Super Bowls with Brady as his quarterback and is considered one of the greatest coaches in NFL history. Belichick\u2019s girlfriend <a href=\"http://www.foxsports.com/nfl/story/bill-belichick-donald-trump-new-england-patriots-presidential-candidate-030616\">posted a picture</a> on Instagram of Trump and the NFL coach in the spring, describing the Republican nominee as \u201cour good friend\u201d.<br></p> <p>Trump announced after the Brady endorsement that Belichick \u201cwrote me the most beautiful letter\u201d. The Republican nominee said he called back Belichick and asked he could read it on stage and Belichick wrote an even nicer letter in response, which he read on stage. </p> <p>The letter as Trump read it said: \u201cCongratulations on a tremendous campaign. You have dealt with an unbelievable slanted and negative media and come out beautifully. You have proved to be the ultimate competitor and fighter. Your leadership is amazing. The toughness and perseverance you have displayed in the past year is remarkable. Hopefully the results in tomorrow\u2019s election will give you the opportunity to make America great again.\u201d</p> <p>Trump has long touted the support of a number of current and former professional athletes, and campaigned with some ex-college sports coaches including the former Indiana basketball coach Bobby Knight and ex-Florida State football coach Bobby Bowden. </p> <p>At the same time Trump has repeatedly condemned Hillary Clinton for using celebrities to campaign on her behalf, including Jay-Z, Beyonce and Bruce Springsteen. He told the crowd in Manchester that it \u201cwas demeaning to the political process\u201d.</p> <p>On Monday night Trump didn\u2019t embrace everything about Massachusetts and New England, though. He attacked the Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren, a Hillary Clinton supporter, as Pocahontas and proclaimed: \u201cI\u2019ll make you a deal, you can have Pocahontas and I\u2019ll have Tom Brady and Bill Belichick.\u201d </p> <p>He also seemed to endorse the former Red Sox pitcher Curt Schilling as candidate to run against Warren in the 2018 Senate election. Schilling has made a number of racially charged comments in recent years including comparing Muslims to Nazis. Earlier on Monday Schilling <a href=\"https://twitter.com/gehrig38/status/795772253245992960\">tweeted praise</a> for a shirt that called for the lynching of journalists. Schilling was also involved in a failed software company subsidized by the state of Rhode Island which cost taxpayers there tens of millions of dollars.</p> <p>A spokesman for the New England Patriots did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>",

  "<p>Gold has long thrived on bouts of uncertainty and right now markets have uncertainty in spades. The Brexit vote in Britain, the prospect of Donald Trump as US president and a raft of elections due in Europe next year have all pushed investors to ramp up their holdings of the precious metal.</p> <p>That strong demand for gold \u2013 seen as a safe haven in troubled times \u2013 has sent its price soaring on world markets this year. But while big investors like pension funds stock up, individuals who fancy their own little pot of gold for a rainy day have been priced out of the market. </p> <p>As the World Gold Council releases its <a href=\"http://www.gold.org/supply-and-demand/gold-demand-trends\">latest figures</a> we look at key trends for the metal.</p> <h2>Global climate of uncertainty is boosting investor demand</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5dbfa95df111ddc38d0efacb82ac95a760be17ee\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5dbfa95df111ddc38d0efacb82ac95a760be17ee/0_0_547_321/500.jpg\" alt=\"Gold demand\" width=\"500\" height=\"293\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gold demand in the third quarter.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: Metals Focus; World Gold Council</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Investment demand for gold was up 44% in the third quarter on a year earlier, dominated by demand from European funds. That was a bright spot in an otherwise weak quarter for gold. Demand was down 10% overall from a year ago, as the growth in investor demand failed to offset a drop in appetite for gold among central banks, the jewellery sector and technology companies that use gold in electronics.</p> <p>The solid demand among institutional investors such as pension funds and insurers builds on a strong first half to 2016. For the year to date, demand from investors is up 98%, according to the World Gold Council, a lobby group for the gold industry. <br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"3e0927139e56265df454744c5b5a8ec4eefa3b06\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3e0927139e56265df454744c5b5a8ec4eefa3b06/65_0_2402_3000/801.jpg\" alt=\"Donald Trump\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>As polls tightened between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton ahead of Tuesday\u2019s US presidential election, the gold price rose. But Alistair Hewitt, head of market intelligence at the World Gold Council, says the demand for the precious metal goes beyond worries about a political upset in the US.</p> <p>\u201cFocus this week is going to be centred around the US election but it\u2019s bigger than that,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Uncertainty rose on the back of the vote for Brexit, and with it activity in the gold market, Hewitt adds. Now investors are worrying about a series of elections in Europe next year with the Dutch, French and Germans going to the polls, and possibly the Italians too. <br></p> <p>\u201cGiven what we have seen in the UK referendum and what we\u2019ve seen in the US election, there is huge uncertainty about what the outcome of these [European elections] is going to be,\u201d says Hewitt.</p> <p>\u201cOne thing that is completely clear to us and certainly to institutional investors is that gone are the days of the predictable status quo.\u201d</p> <h2>That has lifted the gold price 20% so far this year</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b6ef3b0a34823ef55bd28ddcb6ed88a480c8f171\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b6ef3b0a34823ef55bd28ddcb6ed88a480c8f171/0_0_1323_675/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The spot gold price this year\" width=\"1000\" height=\"510\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The spot gold price this year</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Thomson Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There are other factors working in gold\u2019s favour, too. </p> <p>Investor demand has also been helped by the fact interest rates are negative in the eurozone, Japan and elsewhere. That effectively means <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/22/rbs-charging-customers-cash-negative-interest-rates\">people end up paying for the privilege of parking their cash with a bank</a>. In the US and UK, official rates remain in positive territory but they are not far off zero, making returns meagre for savers. That has made gold a more attractive asset and coupled with the boost from geopolitical and economic worries has seen the spot gold price rise more than 20% this year to $1,279 an ounce on Monday.</p> <h2>Pricier gold has put off retail investors</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"44e90f2166918e05bac39b146478720d4efe5f4f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/44e90f2166918e05bac39b146478720d4efe5f4f/0_97_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A saleswoman\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A saleswoman arranges a gold necklace inside a jewellery showroom in the southern Indian city of Kochi.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sivaram V/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Demand for coins, gold bars and jewellery have all suffered from the rise in prices, says Hewitt at World Gold Council. Both China and India, the world\u2019s leading gold markets, experienced a drop in consumer demand this quarter, of 22% and 28% respectively as price savvy customers waited to buy on a dip - something many did at the start of October, he adds.</p> <p>In China, ongoing economic uncertainty also contributed to a softening in sentiment towards gold, as did changing consumer behaviour. </p> <p>In India, appetite has been affected by more stringent government regulations, such as a 1% excise duty on gold jewellery manufacturing, designed to formalise the gold industry, the World Gold Council said. Added to that is the impact of a squeeze on disposable rural incomes. With consistently high prices hurting demand, one or two stores in Southern India introduced gold-plated silver jewellery.</p> <h2>Millennials don\u2019t have the gold bug</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1f05618d4be9ad765bddc8ed282316043dcb6660\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1f05618d4be9ad765bddc8ed282316043dcb6660/0_0_3600_2160/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Two women dancing\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A trend among millennials to spend more on going out and travel is impacting the gold market.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sinopix/Rex Features</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In China and elsewhere changing tastes are impacting the gold market. Hewitt at the World Gold Council says millennials living in Chinese cities do not go for the top grade gold favoured by their parents but instead tend to look for design over quality. They also share a trend seen among other young consumers around the world to spend on experiences rather than objects. </p> <p>\u201cThe industry also faces the challenge of the rising popularity of \u2018experiential\u2019 purchases at the expense of physical consumption,\u201d says the World Gold Council\u2019s report. </p> <p>\u201cEvidence of this can be seen in the way the Chinese populace chose to celebrate the recent Golden Week national holiday.

  "<p>For the past month, while the attention of the world has been fixed on every dramatic twist in the US presidential election, the renewal of armed conflict between India and Pakistan has barely touched the headlines. In the past few weeks, the two nuclear states have, between them, killed two dozen civilians and injured scores of others in exchanges of artillery fire across the disputed border \u2013 known as the \u201cline of control\u201d \u2013 that divides Kashmir into parts controlled by India and Pakistan.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/29/pakistani-soldiers-killed-surgical-strikes-kashmir-india\">latest flare-up</a> in the long-running war of attrition between the two countries comes on the heels of a bloody summer of protest and repression in Kashmir that has now been erased from memory by the banging of war drums in Delhi and Islamabad. Since July, when the killing of a young militant leader <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/11/kashmir-death-toll-23-protests-shooting-burhan-wani-independence-violence\">sparked a furious civilian uprising</a> across the Kashmir valley, the Indian state has responded with singular ruthlessness, killing more than 90 people. Most shocking of all has been the breaking up of demonstrations with \u201cnon-lethal\u201d pellet ammunition, which has blinded hundreds of Kashmiri civilians.</p> <p>In four months, 17,000 adults and children have been injured, nearly five thousand have been arrested, and an entire population spent the summer under the longest curfew in the history of curfews in Kashmir.</p> <p>All this has been quickly forgotten in the past two months. On 18 September, a small group of jihadi fighters, widely believed to have come from Pakistan, staged a commando raid on an Indian army camp near the northern Kashmir town of Uri, killing 19 Indian soldiers \u2013 the deadliest attack on Indian security forces in Kashmir in two decades. Indian politicians quickly blamed Pakistan, which the country\u2019s home minister described as a \u201cterrorist state\u201d, while Pakistani leaders made the implausible claim that India had staged the attack itself to distract from the protests in Kashmir.</p> <p>The Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, who came into office promising to take a harder line with Pakistan, announced that \u201cthose behind this despicable attack will not go unpunished\u201d. At the end of September, India retaliated with what it called a \u201csurgical strike\u201d against alleged militant camps in Pakistan-controlled territory, which, according to an army statement, \u201ccaused significant damage to terrorists\u201d. Pakistan denied the attack ever took place \u2013 claiming that there had been nothing more than the usual exchange of fire across the border. Meanwhile, an ugly war of words continued to escalate in TV news studios, some of which were refurbished as pop-up war rooms.</p> <p>Since then, the relationship between the two countries, which is at the best of times characterised by varying degrees of hate \u2013 depending upon the political temperature in Kashmir \u2013 has soured to the point where both are now suddenly finding spies in each others\u2019 diplomatic missions. A tit-for-tat nearly every day, on TV, on social media, in ambassadorial corps \u2013 even in the realm of culture, where India has effectively banned Pakistani actors from working in Bollywood, and Pakistan has banned the screening of Indian films in cinemas. According to recent reports, civilians caught in the crossfire have been evacuated, hundreds of schools shut, and local residents pressed into service to ferry supplies to troops stationed high in the Himalayas<strong>.</strong> As always, the victims of the artillery duels have been the civilians living on either side of a border that did not exist until the middle of the 20th century.</p> <p>In the war of words that has followed the bloodshed in Uri, the brutal oppression of protest in Kashmir has been largely ignored. Indeed, the Indian state, aided by a near-militaristic TV news media, has used the Uri attack and its aftermath to cover up a surge of killings, maimings and blindings in one of the longest-running conflicts in the world. This is the story of the bloody summer that Kashmiris have endured \u2013 and of why they will not forget it.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>On 8 July, a militant rebel leader, Burhan Wani,<strong> </strong>was shot dead by Indian armed forces and police in a remote Kashmir village. The killing sparked a series of spontaneous <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/10/kashmir-death-toll-rises-as-protesters-defy-curfew\">demonstrations and protests</a>, which, in a matter of days, turned into a reinvigorated popular revolt against India\u2019s dominion over this disputed state.</p> <p>Wani\u2019s path to militancy began in another one of Kashmir\u2019s bloody summers \u2013 back in 2010, when Indian security forces killed 120 protesters. Wani, who was then 15 years old, is said to have joined a small group of homegrown militants after he and his brother were humiliated and abused by Indian soldiers. Over the next few years, he became Kashmir\u2019s most famous militant commander, and acquired something of a cult following among young Kashmiris, who saw him as a symbol of resistance against Indian occupation. Wani was a new breed of militant: unlike the first generation of Kashmir separatist fighters in the early 1990s, he did not cross over into Pakistan; he didn\u2019t use a nom de guerre, and he amassed a huge following on social media, where he issued brazen challenges to the Indian state. It was therefore no surprise that thousands attended Wani\u2019s funeral in his hometown of Tral \u2013 or that those who could not get there organised their own funeral services across the Kashmir valley.</p> <p>As Kashmiris took to the streets, police and paramilitaries were deployed in large numbers across the region. Thousands of young protesters charged at the armed forces with stones and slogans demanding freedom. Indian forces responded with lethal effect, firing bullets, CS gas, and metal pellets into the crowds. In less than four days, nearly 50 people were killed and thousands injured. More people took to the streets to protest against these killings, and the Indian forces and Kashmiri police killed and injured more of them. A cycle of protests connected to the funerals of those protesters were, in turn, fired upon, resulting in yet more killings and blindings. By the end of July, India was faced with a full-scale popular revolt in Kashmir.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"77f92c07beee9be688ba8e66092e7e795cfb8a59\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/77f92c07beee9be688ba8e66092e7e795cfb8a59/0_0_1536_2560/600.jpg\" alt=\"An Indian policeman aims a pellet gun towards Kashmiri protesters in Srinagar in July.\" width=\"600\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An Indian policeman aims a pellet gun towards Kashmiri protesters in Srinagar in July.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Composite: Syed Shahriyar/Syed Shahriyar/NurPhoto via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The most recent figures put the number of dead at 94, including a young Kashmiri academic who was <a href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/news/soldiers-raid-village-indian-kashmir-one-dead-082540745.html\">battered to death</a> by Indian soldiers, and an <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/protests-in-kashmir-valley-after-body-of-11-year-old-found-with-pellets-3036803/\">11-year-old boy</a>, whose body, riddled with hundreds of pellets, was found on the outskirts of Srinagar, the joint capital of Kashmir, in mid-September. Shockingly, more than 500 people, most of them young, were shot in the face with the pump-action \u201cpellet guns\u201d that the Indian forces routinely use to suppress protests. These weapons discharge hundreds of small metal pellets, or birdshot, capable of piercing the eye.</p> <p>As the uprising continued, the armed forces, by their own admission, fired nearly 4,000 cartridges at stone-throwing demonstrators, crowds protesting against police brutality, and even onlookers. This means that they sent, by one recent estimate, 1.3m metal balls hurtling towards public gatherings predominantly made up of young unarmed people.</p> <p>Children as young as four and five now have multiple pellets in their retinas, blinding them partially, or fully, for life. At the start of September, doctors at Kashmir\u2019s main hospital reported that on average, one person had their eyes ruptured by pellets every other hour since 9 July. \u201cIt means <a href=\"http://www.greaterkashmir.com/news/front-page/every-2nd-hour-lethal-pellets-rupture-an-eye-in-kashmir/227294.html\">12 eye surgeries per day</a>,\u201d one doctor told a local newspaper. \u201cIt is shocking.\u201d</p> <p>On 12 July, the fourth day of the protests, the state government, which is run by a controversial coalition between Modi\u2019s Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and a local ally, the People\u2019s Democratic Party (PDP), finally issued its first official statement on the use of the so-called \u201cnon-lethal\u201d pellet guns.<strong> </strong>A spokesperson for the government, representing the PDP, described its position to the media: \u201cWe disapprove of it \u2026 But we will have to persist with this necessary evil till we find a non-lethal alternative.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There is no recorded instance of a modern democracy systematically and willfully shooting at people to blind them</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>At first, the statement appeared as a typical soundbite, the sort of thing that officials must compose and recite with studied ambiguity for the press \u2013 the \u201cgovernment version\u201d, as its known. But I was struck by its cavalier defence of state violence and brutalisation. It was obvious that this was not the spokesman\u2019s personal view; it was a clear articulation of the intent of the Indian state in Kashmir: <em>we have no choice but to shoot people in the eyes</em>.</p> <p>This was an unprecedented expression of state violence. There is no other recorded instance of a modern democracy systematically and wilfully shooting at people to blind them. At the end of August, according to data obtained by one of India\u2019s national newspapers, nearly 6,000 civilians had been injured<strong>, </strong>and at least 972 of them had suffered injuries to their eyes.</p> <p>According to official records at SMHS, the main hospital in Srinagar, 570 people sought treatment after their eyeballs were ruptured by metal pellets. Ophthalmologists at the hospital performed more surgeries in three days \u2013 from 10 to 12 July \u2013 than they had in the past three years. Many of the wounded were protesters, but not all. Not one of them deserved to be robbed of their sight.</p> <p>By 14 August, as India prepared to celebrate its Independence Day, Kashmir was under a near total blackout. I briefly lost touch with my parents, as the state cut off all telephones and the internet. I was reminded, once again, of the lines of the late Kashmiri-American poet Agha Shahid Ali, which still echo 20 years after he wrote them: \u201cThe city from where no news can come / is now so visible in its curfewed night / that the worst is precise.\u201d Just before the shutdown, I had talked to my youngest sister over WhatsApp \u2013 she was a little girl in the 90s, when Kashmir witnessed the first rebellion against Indian rule. \u201cI\u2019d never imagined my [three-year-old] child would see everything that I saw as a child,\u201d she told me.</p> <p>Rebellion against India\u2019s rule over Kashmir is neither new nor surprising \u2013 and the brutality of the state\u2019s response is equally familiar. In the 1990s, India came down hard on a widespread uprising in the Kashmir valley \u2013 killing, torturing, disappearing, and imprisoning thousands. Some estimates put the number of people killed since<strong> </strong>1989<strong> </strong>at 70,000. Some 8,000 non-combatants are thought to have been disappeared, and 6,000 are believed to have been buried in mass graves. Human rights reports have identified thousands of cases of torture, including shocking techniques such as \u201csimulated drowning, striping flesh with razor blades and piping petrol into anuses\u201d. According to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jul/09/mass-graves-of-kashmir\">a 2012 report in the Guardian</a>, government documents revealed that one group of security agents had \u201clopped off the limbs of suspects and fed prisoners with their own flesh\u201d.<strong> </strong></p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>In southern Kashmir, four girls, aged between 13 and 18, were shot in their faces as recently as last week</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Years later, very little has changed in the Indian state\u2019s response to the demand for self-determination from the people of Kashmir. In a matter of four to five weeks this summer, Indian troops, with a clear mandate to be unsparing, wounded over 10,000 people. One of the youngest \u2013 five-year old Zohra \u2013 was admitted to a hospital in Srinagar with <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/kashmir-violence-what-are-pellet-guns-and-why-are-they-so-lethal-2913917/\">lacerations to her abdomen and legs</a>. Fourteen-year-old Insha was in the family kitchen when a <a href=\"http://thewire.in/51740/kashmir-young-paying-governments-lack-vision/\">swarm of pellets pierced her face</a>. She has lost vision in both eyes. In southern Kashmir, four girls, aged between 13 and 18, were shot in their faces last week. The prognosis for the youngest of these, <a href=\"http://www.catchnews.com/india-news/pellets-continue-to-blind-kashmiri-kids-but-it-has-stopped-making-news-1478345066.html\">13-year-old Ifra Jan</a>, \u201cis not good\u201d, a doctor said. It is doubtful that these little girls posed a threat to the military force \u2013 estimated at 700,000 soldiers and police \u2013 stationed in Kashmir.</p> <p>As the showers of metal pellets were unleashed upon protesters, bystanders and homebound schoolchildren, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/25/opinion/kashmir-and-the-inheritance-of-loss.html?_r=0\">hospitals in Kashmir</a> began to resemble scenes from the great wars of the 20th century. Rows of beds with blindfolded boys and girls on them, parents waiting anxiously, doctors and paramedics in attendance around the clock. On occasion, police and spies also infiltrated the wards to compile profiles of the injured, in order to place them under surveillance after their release. The wounded were brought in by the dozen, like birds in the hunting season.</p> <p>All of this was incomprehensible, even to longtime observers of violence in Kashmir. One of the largest military forces on the planet could not be waging a war against seeing.<strong> </strong>Perhaps a few aberrations, a crowd-control tactic gone woefully wrong \u2013 one hoped so, but the numbers kept piling up, eye after mutilated eye popping up on the screens of phones and computers, as journalists began to publish their reports.</p> <p>As none of the powerful men who run Kashmir from Delhi expressed qualms about the blinding of children, it became clear that in its hubris the Indian state had decided that snatching vision from a few hundred young people was a fair price to pay for keeping Kashmir in check. Perhaps itself blinded by a strain of arrogance peculiar to occupying powers, it continued to pummel a subject population into submission.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>The phrase Raqs-e-Bismil,<strong> </strong>used in mystic Persian poetry to denote the passion of the devoted, translates as the \u201cdance of the wounded\u201d. In the slaughterhouse of the Kashmir valley, even the grievously injured \u2013 with pellet-scarred eyes or broken limbs \u2013 have remained defiant. \u201cWe have even got some patients whose guts are perforated and they are asking when they can go back and join the protests,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2016/08/kashmir-story-defiance-grief-160821113602572.html\">one doctor reported</a>.</p> <p>Two-and-a-half decades of rebellion in Kashmir have hardened the indifference of India\u2019s political and intellectual classes to the human cost of the country\u2019s repressive tactics in the valley. Amid rising nationalist fervour, any sense of the basic rights of a suffering population has been eroded or vanished entirely. The hostility now appears to be total, unbridgeable, and for those on the receiving end, unbearable. Powerful TV studios urge the state to be more aggressively macho, while actively <a href=\"http://www.asianage.com/india/scribe-quits-tv-channel-over-bias-539\">suppressing or distorting news</a> from Kashmir. One prominent newspaper ran an online poll about the continued use of the pellets that had wounded and blinded so many Kashmiris \u2013 a clear majority voted in support. Eminent columnists speak calmly of the need for \u201charsh love\u201d toward civilian protesters to rationalise<strong> </strong>the state\u2019s ruthless response. And the Twitter account for a government initiative, Digital India, <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/digital-india-twitter-handle-poem-to-kill-kashmiri-by-indian-army-deleted-shankar-pradad-3021298/\">posted a poem</a> calling for the army to murder Kashmiris until they surrender.</p> <p>As images from Kashmir began to circulate on the internet \u2013 despite frequent attempts to block communications, including at least one midnight raid on the offices of a local newspaper, and a blanket ban on one English daily, the Kashmir Reader \u2013 pictures of the wounded emerged by the dozen, many of them looking as though they had ruptured fruits where their eyes should have been. On the second day of the protests, more than 50 people were admitted to the main hospital in Srinagar. Medics and parents were desperate to save vision in at least one eye for those who had been shot, attempting to extract the jagged and irregular pellets. \u201cThis only happens in <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-36822567\">a war-like situation</a>,\u201d a surgeon sent from Delhi later said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"9ab063d714870483d86b81e29ce26509b6334778\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9ab063d714870483d86b81e29ce26509b6334778/0_256_3900_2341/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A Kashmiri protester who was shot by Indian security forces in Srinagar, in July 2016.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A Kashmiri protester who was shot by Indian security forces in Srinagar, in July 2016.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tauseef Mustafa/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The protocol for the use of these crowd control weapons is to aim at the legs to disperse demonstrators. But it seems that the paramilitaries and the police have been deliberately firing into faces. Some may only have minor wounds, some will suffer limited loss of vision, some will lose one eye, some both, and some will be impaired for life, but the pitiless assault on protesting adolescents forces us to ask one question: is the Indian state happy to blind a generation?</p> <p>It is inconceivable that policy mandarins in Delhi or their advisers in Kashmir could be unaware of the destructive power of \u201cnon-lethal weapons\u201d. Earlier this year, the International Network of Civil Liberties Organisations and Physicians for Human Rights published a report titled \u201c<a href=\"http://www.iccl.ie/international-network-of-civil-liberties-organizations-launch-report-on-crowd-control-weapons.html\">Lethal in Disguise</a>\u201d. \u201cPellet rounds\u201d, it stated, \u201ccause an indiscriminate spray of ammunition that spreads widely and cannot be aimed ...\u201d They, therefore, \u201care not only likely to be lethal at close range, but are likely to be inaccurate and indiscriminate at longer ranges, even those recommended by manufacturers for safety\u201d.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>Many countries have banned police from using ammunition meant for hunting animals. The multidirectional spray of pellets was designed to catch prey in flight. But many countries have continued to use them as a means of force to control civilian demonstrators.</p> <p>In Israel, security forces often deploy lethal and \u201cnon-lethal\u201d ammunition against Palestinian protesters, and crowd-control weapons have blinded at least five young Palestinians in the last two years. The use of rubber bullets by police was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2014/apr/30/rubber-bullets-banned-catalonia-spain-video\">banned in the Spanish region of Catalonia</a> in 2014, after at least seven people were blinded by them on the streets of Barcelona.</p> <p>In 2011, months after the uprising in Tahrir Square that toppled an Egyptian dictator, a young police lieutenant, Mohamed el-Shenawy, became infamous for firing pellets into the eyes of protesters against Egypt\u2019s military government. His exemplary skill at blinding civilians earned him the nickname the \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/shortcuts/2013/mar/06/eye-sniper-tahrir-egypt-jailed\">Eye Sniper</a>\u201d, and his notoriety as a symbol of ongoing state brutality eventually led to a three-year jail sentence.</p> <p>Will India prosecute its own eye snipers? Or outlaw the use of these weapons?</p> <p>In the country\u2019s present hypernationalist mood, every kind of other is a suspicious figure, a ready-made scapegoat for any failure that befalls the politicians determined to make India great again: the secessionist Kashmiri, the impure Dalit, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/03/inside-bishari-indian-village-where-mob-killed-man-for-eating-beef\">traitorous beef-eating Muslim</a>, the woman who speaks her mind, the anti-national journalist, the dissenting writer. Any voices who might call for a ban on these \u201cnon-lethal\u201d guns are certain to be ignored. To the contrary, ministers and police, and their demagogues and cheerleaders, have continued to advocate the use of both pellets and bullets against protesting crowds in Kashmir: unruly cattle must be reined in at any cost.</p> <p>Because Kashmiris have become accustomed to the violence inflicted on them \u2013 as they are to the indifference of the world \u2013 when pellets were first sprayed at protesters in the heated summer of 2010, most people processed this as nothing more than a new misfortune; just another element of the war in Kashmir. If one were to draw a diagram of the assaults inflicted on Kashmiri bodies over the decades, hardly a single part would remain unmarked: in the 1990s, when the violence was at its worst, the eyes were spared; now they seem to have become a favourite target.<strong> </strong>The victims of such tactics, consciously and not, cultivate reserves of tolerance for pain, but also a capacity to remember.</p> <p>I remember, too. I grew up amid the darkness of the late 80s and early 90s. I remember that most of us teenagers innately understood that being abused, slapped, or beaten with batons and rifle butts by an Indian trooper was a bit of a joke when compared to the horrors that others endured in the dungeons of Kashmir. (One of the most notorious torture centres, Papa II \u2013 a colonial-era building on the banks of Dal Lake in Srinagar \u2013 was refurbished and redecorated, and served as the stately residence of the late pro-India politician Mufti Mohammad Sayeed. His daughter, as the current chief minister, now presides over the brutalisation of another generation of Kashmiri youth.)</p> <p>I remember that the war in those years taught us to treat corpses and shrouds as reminders of passing time, which was measured for the young in massacres and assassinations. I recall, too, the tragic rupture in the Kashmiri body politic when an atmosphere of fear and loathing forced out the Kashmiri Pandits \u2013 a Hindu minority that had cohabited with Muslim Kashmiris for centuries \u2013 in an almost overnight exodus<strong>, </strong>many of them targeted and killed by separatist militants. Sanjay Tickoo, who runs an organisation for the welfare of Kashmiri Hindus, says: \u201cOver the past 20 years, we estimate that <a href=\"http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/spotlight/kashmirtheforgottenconflict/2011/07/201176134818984961.html\">650 Pandits were killed</a> in the valley.\u201d I don\u2019t know what happened to Sunil and Rajesh, my childhood mates from the primary school we all attended near an idyllic river bend in Verinag in south Kashmir.</p> <p>Growing up, I experienced a brutal, bleak time, as India\u2019s response to the uprising included the grotesque policy of \u201ccatch and kill\u201d, under which combatants and non-combatants alike were dispatched in summary executions or tortured to death. And yet, I don\u2019t remember such a vengeful assault on ordinary people as we are seeing now. Buoyed by a belligerent nationalist at the helm in Delhi, the security forces on the ground perhaps feel emboldened to unleash a more widespread cruelty.</p> <p>In 2013, an affecting <a href=\"http://india.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/11/25/casualties-of-kashmirs-unrest-live-in-the-dark/\">photo essay</a> by journalist Zahid Rafiq in the New York Times documented a few of the stories of those who had been blinded by pellets. It remains a grim testament to the darkness in Kashmir <strong>\u2013 </strong>even though the blindings at that time, amid hundreds dead, did not attract too much notice. At the time, hardly any Indian civil society group or human rights organisation thought fit to speak up about such a wicked crime. The wanton demonisation of the Kashmiri Muslim, a project that some media organisations in India take particular pleasure in, was perhaps fully realised even then. It certainly is now, when thousands<strong>, </strong>fed on a daily diet of nationalist fury, take to social media to celebrate the killing, maiming, and blinding of young Kashmiris.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>That the government in Kashmir<strong> </strong>\u2013 a collection of local elites comprising career politicians, technocrats, and chancers loyal to India \u2013 considers pellet guns a \u201cnecessary evil\u201d, might make us feel grateful. At least they acknowledge the \u201cevil\u201d part<strong> \u2013 </strong>perhaps to address their own guilty consciences.</p> <p>A few days into this summer\u2019s uprising<strong>,</strong> the Kashmir Observer, a local English-language daily, reported that the local government had deployed a fleet of brand new ambulances to securely <a href=\"https://kashmirobserver.net/2016/local-news/amid-bloodbath-streetsgovt-using-ambulances-ferry-vip-guests-picnicking-8686\">ferry visiting VIPs</a> to picnic spots in the valley. This was while protesters were being killed, maimed and blinded \u2013 and while the ambulances carrying them to hospitals were coming under fire from security forces.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"8b93e0246bc9206eeb55ba4c70583f22282ca528\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8b93e0246bc9206eeb55ba4c70583f22282ca528/0_97_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Victims of police shooting who have been blinded in one or both eyes in hospital in Srinagar.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Victims of police shooting who have been blinded in one or both eyes in hospital in Srinagar.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Yawar Nazir/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>An ophthalmologist at the main hospital in Kashmir told the Indian Express in July: \u201cFor the first time the <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/kashmir-protests-non-lethal-weapon-pellets-causing-more-damage-to-eyes-doctors-2918249/\">foreign bodies are irregular edged</a>, which causes more damage once it strikes the eye.\u201d Irregular, sharp edges? I had assumed that the pellets fired at protesters \u2013 like rubber or plastic bullets, were round discoid things. It turns out that there exist different kinds of pellets, and in 2016, some Indian forces are using the jagged variety \u2013 which inflict greater damage to flesh and eyes alike, and which doctors say is far more difficult to remove.</p> <p>How did India get here? How is it all right for a constitutionally democratic and secular, modern nation to blind scores of civilians in a region it controls? Not an authoritarian state, not a crackpot dictatorship, not a rogue nation or warlord outside of legal and ethical commitments to international statutes, but a democratic country, a member of the comity of nations. How are India\u2019s leaders, thinkers and its thundering televised custodians of public and private morality, all untroubled by the sight of a child whose <a href=\"http://kashmirreader.com/2016/07/21/first-patient-to-have-pellets-in-heart-is-13-years-old/\">heart has been penetrated by metal pellets</a>? This is the kind of cruelty we expect from Assad\u2019s Syria, not the world\u2019s largest democracy.</p> <p>Historically, such an inhuman response to an uprising \u2013 to mass dissent \u2013 has been the province of empires and tyrants. A modern democratic nation rarely unleashes such violence, except upon victims whom it does not regard as its own people. It is quite clear that for India and its rulers, Kashmiris have been subjects and not citizens for as long as Kashmiris have refused Indian rule. You do not shower projectiles that target eyes and viscera on a people you consider your own. In snatching away the vision of Kashmiri children, the Indian state has decisively announced that it has only one message: <em>you must be servile and submissive, and if you refuse, we will unleash our fury</em><strong>.</strong></p> <p>With a hubris derived from its might and military dominion over Kashmir, the state convinces itself that it has the power to inflict blindness. In no time, then, it blinds itself too \u2013 to the <a href=\"http://www.hindustantimes.com/columns/unrest-in-kashmir-threat-to-the-idea-of-india/story-2uVkjCgSGdsXOEzKHVWIPK.html\">character of democracy</a> that is its central founding principle. The harsh repression of Kashmiri protests, the Nobel prize-winning Indian economist Amartya Sen declared in July, is \u201cthe <a href=\"http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/amartya-sen-kashmir-situation-democracy-raghuram-rajan/1/717959.html\">biggest blot on India\u2019s democracy</a>\u201d.</p> <p>It is hard not to see this mood of brutality connected, at the very least in its tenor, to the larger register of extreme violence, by both state and non-state actors, that has come to be normalised over the last couple of decades.</p> <p>There has been some dissent in India. Journalists, activists, even <a href=\"http://www.ndtv.com/opinion/over-40-days-curfew-in-kashmir-shows-how-wrong-we-have-got-it-1446756\">some politicians</a>, have written elegiac <a href=\"http://www.ndtv.com/opinion/what-burhan-wanis-death-exposes-for-kashmir-and-delhi-1430050\">columns and essays</a> on the savage response to the rebellion in Kashmir. They have implored their government to cease the brutality, to be kind, and to <a href=\"http://thewire.in/61373/framework-peace-kashmir/\">talk to Kashmiris</a>. But it appears that the Indian government, clouded by a newfound chauvinism and a hunger for votes, is in no mood to listen to the nation\u2019s voices of sanity. In August, only a few days after Indian forces in Srinagar murdered a <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/kashmir-21-year-old-killed-by-pellets-case-registered-against-security-personnel-2951122/\">21-year-old cash-machine watchman</a> by firing 300 pellets into his body from close range, the Indian prime minister used a <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/full-text-of-pm-narendra-modi-speech-pakistan-forgets-that-it-bombs-its-own-citizens/\">speech on Kashmir</a> to taunt Pakistan over its own atrocities against separatists in the province of Balochistan, where the Pakistani army has inflicted forced disappearances and summary executions on the Baloch people. \u201cPakistan forgets that it bombs its own citizens using fighter planes,\u201d he said. But Modi chose to forget that his own forces had, by then, killed scores of young Kashmiris.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>We need to interrogate the circumstances that have led to the deliberate blinding of hundreds of young people at the hands of armed forces in Kashmir, before this too is forgotten. As some of the wounded have begun to heal, some accounts have suggested that the damage may have been less severe than initially feared \u2013 that perhaps many of those who underwent eye surgery will regain \u201csome vision\u201d in at least one eye. This might make one feel better<strong> </strong>\u2013 relieved that its not worse \u2013 but there is something wrong with that kind of moral reckoning, akin to the Indian security officials who continue to maintain that pellet guns must be used because the alternative would be worse. One security official told an Indian news website that pellet guns had actually \u201c<a href=\"http://thewire.in/51740/kashmir-young-paying-governments-lack-vision/\">saved lives</a>\u201d: \u201cIt is unfortunate that there have been eye injuries but the pellets are less lethal than getting hit by bullets.\u201d</p> <p>So we might ask: what if the armed forces stationed in Kashmir had fired live bullets instead? <em>Imagine the death toll!</em> But this doesn\u2019t compute: in 2016, the security forces have already killed nearly 100 civilians. Is that an acceptable number?</p> <p>In a year or two, as India, and Pakistan, continue to harp on their territorialist positions, there will arrive a season of surface calm \u2013 a \u201creturn to normalcy\u201d \u2013 in Kashmir. People will shop, marry off their children, and celebrate an uncurfewed Eid. They will also welcome tourists in their blighted land.</p> <p>But when this new generation of freedom-seekers grows up into blinded, maimed, adulthood, they will carry our guilt-ridden consciences for us. They will remember more than they have seen. They will certainly remember the country that did this to them.</p> <p>\u2022 Follow the Long Read on Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/@gdnlongread\">@gdnlongread</a>, or sign up to the long read weekly email <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2015/jul/20/sign-up-to-the-long-read-email\">here</a>.</p>",

  "<p>In the final nine days of the presidential campaign, Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump made a combined total of 50 stops in 14 states. What do these stops tell us about the race? </p> <p>Typically, last-minute campaign decisions are based on internal campaign polling not available to the public. Such polling explains why Al Gore campaigned at 2am in Florida on election day in 2000, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/stuartpstevens/status/795685460953677826\">as confusing as that move was</a> for the opposition at the time.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/11/campaign-stops-map/\" data-alt=\"final stops\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/11/campaign-stops-map/\">final stops</a> </figure>  <p>The late moves of the 2016 campaign may be trickier to decode, in part because of the drunken-ninja style of the Donald Trump campaign, which <a href=\"https://twitter.com/maggieNYT/status/795722142159605760\">reportedly</a> ceased conducting its own polling last week or even two weeks ago. </p> <p>It\u2019s not clear what explains Trump\u2019s visit, in the final week of the election, to Minnesota, which has been a solidly Democratic state since the Great Depression. Trump may see something there no one else does. The visit may have been a mistake. Conspiracy theorists have even noted that the Trump campaign chairman loathes the Republican congressional leadership, the theory being that sending Trump to Minnesota may have been a play to disrupt two delicate House races there.<br></p> <p>The Clinton campaign, which during the primary season at one point was <a href=\"http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/clinton-spending-more-polling-six-gop-candidates-combined\">spending more on polling</a> than the top six Republican candidates combined, does not dabble in such freelancing. Most of her visits are where one might expect them to be, in obvious swing states: Florida, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Ohio and Nevada. Clinton also made one trip to Arizona, where some polls have suggested that she has a shot at toppling Trump.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/07/hillary-clinton-donald-trump-election-day-final-voting-push\">Clinton and Trump make climactic final pitches on eve of historic election day</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The action in Michigan, visited twice by Clinton and four times by Trump, may be most interesting. The Great Lakes state emerged as an object of interest relatively late in the race, with both campaigns having dispensed with other, more central fights, and with the Trump campaign sensing opportunity with the state\u2019s white blue-collar voters. The Clinton campaign hopes the state\u2019s Democratic voting record since 1988 will be good for 16 electoral votes on Tuesday night.</p> <p>Two final observations. </p> <p>One: Trump made almost two more stops per day, on average, than Clinton did. That\u2019s either working harder \u2013 or being less focused. Clinton also was able to take advantage of high-profile surrogates \u2013 such as the president, first lady, vice-president, and her husband \u2013 to pop up in key states for her, while Trump is the only major star, political or otherwise, in his universe.</p> <p>Two: in only two states did Clinton make more stops than Trump in the final week, Arizona and Ohio. For whatever reason, she may have sensed a need to work harder in those states, while still <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/02/hillary-visits-arizona-in-unprecedented-show-of-bravado-for-democratic-nominee\">seeing opportunity in those states</a>, perhaps in contrast to some extent with Iowa, where Clinton let Senator Bernie Sanders do the work of campaigning. </p>"

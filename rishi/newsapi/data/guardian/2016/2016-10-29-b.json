  "<p>The latest furore over Hillary Clinton\u2019s alleged misuse of private emails when she was secretary of state in 2009-2013 has thrown a tumultuous and unedifying US presidential election into even greater confusion, with little more than a week to go before voting day.</p> <p>The FBI\u2019s unexpected and very public revelation that it is <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/29/us/politics/fbi-hillary-clinton-email.html?emc=edit_th_20161029&amp;nl=todaysheadlines&amp;nlid=53657756\" title=\"\">recommencing its investigation </a>into Clinton\u2019s conduct may not be politically motivated, but its timing certainly makes it appear that way. The row represents yet another hammer blow to a democratic process whose credibility has been repeatedly challenged, principally by the unscrupulous Republican candidate, Donald Trump.</p> <p>Despite this new firestorm, stoked by Republicans and rightwing media, it remains likely that American voters will deliver a clear, possibly resounding, rejection of Trump on 8 November. Although opinion polls show the race tightening nationally and nothing is certain as a febrile campaign climaxes, Clinton is ahead almost everywhere that matters \u2013 and she is the sane and reasonable, if uninspiring, choice. A Trump defeat will be richly deserved. As we have noted previously, he is not a fit and proper person to serve in the White House. His behaviour during a long, raucous and often embarrassingly vulgar campaign <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/28/observer-view-donald-trump-ugly-truth\" title=\"\">made that abundantly plain</a>.</p> <p>Yet consigning \u201cthe Donald\u201d to the rubbish bin of electoral history is easier than getting rid of Trumpism. This is likely to take a lot longer. Trump\u2019s platform was based not on thought-through policies and careful analysis but on prejudice, grievance, ignorance and fear, spiced with opportunism. His unexpected success in winning the nomination, despite the Republican establishment\u2019s hostility, reflected his close identification with mainly white, working-class and lower-middle-class voters who, like him, feel angry, undervalued and alienated. While public figures such as Barack Obama, Trump\u2019s failed Republican rival Jeb Bush and Clinton appear to this constituency to be remote, out of touch and uncaring, Trumpism peddles the delusion that the candidate is \u201con their side\u201d. Again and again, in Ohio, Florida and elsewhere, disaffected voters claimed that only Trump could be trusted to tell the \u201ctruth\u201d, only Trump would keep his promises, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/28/ds-2710-trump-rally\" title=\"\">only Trump</a> could make America great again.</p> <p>Oblivious to paradox, irony, history or facts, Trumpism projects a distorted vision of American greatness. The Trump doctrine decrees that a nation built by immigrants, that became the most powerful on Earth is so scared of migrant and refugee hordes that it must build a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/apr/05/donald-trump-mexico-border-wall-plan-remittances\" title=\"\">2,000-mile wall with Mexico</a>. Trumpism holds that a great nation that incorporated religious tolerance into its groundbreaking constitution and bill of rights must now shatter its own principles and deliberately discriminate against Muslims to keep itself safe.</p> <p>As general concepts, Trumpism makes an enemy of the \u201cother\u201d, equates nationality with homogeneity, calls honest critics liars and seeks to threaten, jail or harm opponents. It says individualism outweighs state authority, as in the unfettered right to bear firearms, but not, perversely, in the case of a woman\u2019s right to choose abortion. Trumpism distrusts and fears foreigners. It believes free trade, international treaties and economic globalisation in general are loaded dice intended to rip off Americans. Paranoid Trumpism holds that long-term allies such as Germany and Japan get a free security ride at America\u2019s expense.</p> <p>Trumpism admires the domestic authoritarianism and international bullying of dictatorships in Russia and China. Vladimir Putin is a strong leader standing up for his people, national beliefs and way of life. Any inconvenient truth that contradicts this or other Trumpist narratives is inherently mendacious, part of a web of lies and falsehoods spun by the treacherous mass media conspiring with the establishment to dupe honest citizens. And don\u2019t forget: Trumpism cannot be fairly defeated. If it loses, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-34903577\" title=\"\">it was cheated</a> for sure.</p> <p>Trumpism appeals to the worst in people, cynically exploiting and fanning the anger, grievances and prejudices of the economically disadvantaged, the embittered, uneducated and plain ignorant. It appeals to base instincts, to lowest common denominators. Its is political dumbing down writ large. It is underpinned by a pervasive and comprehensible insecurity, engendered across the west by post-2008 economic injustice and social division, the growing gulf between rich and poor and incompetent, unfeeling or corrupt governance.</p> <p>Fear is the common enemy, but fear is Trumpism\u2019s friend. This phenomenon is not confined to America. European countries, including Britain, experience variations on the theme. In Germany and France, concern about rising immigration has boosted hardline nationalists whose appeal and disturbing ideology extend far beyond the cathartic issue of Syria. In Greece, Poland, Austria and Hungary, rightwing extremists\u2019 evil, dehumanising ideas about refugees, migrants and foreigners in general have become <a href=\"https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/europe/2016-06-03/rise-populism-europe\" title=\"\">a commonplace of political discussion</a>. In Britain, Ukip, provides a noisy echo-chamber for some of Trumpism\u2019s most divisive, chauvinistic and discriminatory refrains.</p> <p>If Trumpism is indeed a transnational pestilence, it would be wise to look for a common remedy. But first, the symptoms must be accurately diagnosed and its long-term effects should not be exaggerated. Much of the political turbulence and iconoclasm witnessed of late in America and Europe is the direct result of continuing, negative economic fallout from the 2008 financial crash. Hard times, austerity cuts, high unemployment and low wages are the manure in which political aberration takes root. But as history shows, they sometimes, yet rarely, lead to disaster. When economies improve, generally speaking, so too does the quality of political discourse. Ensuring all people benefit equally from such an improvement is the one certain antidote to extreme politics.</p> <p>While protest movements share characteristics and aims, it is also evident that they are not all the same as each other. Trumpism is an infection others can catch, yet it is also unique to America. Before panicking about the advance of the far right and far left in Europe, commentators in Britain and elsewhere should remember that, when all is said and done, mainstream politicians such as Angela Merkel, Alain Jupp\u00e9, Mariano Rajoy and yes, Hillary Clinton do, on the whole, get elected or re-elected. Notwithstanding Greece\u2019s epic upheavals, the centre does mostly hold.</p> <p>More than anything else, Trumpism will fade and fail because, ultimately, it is a minority pastime, pandering to bigotry, which runs against the grain and spirit of the times, Brexit notwithstanding. Trumpism decries the impact of globalisation, yet globalisation, for all the dislocation and often unwelcome change it brings, is the inescapable way ahead for a more integrated, more connected and more mutually responsible and caring world.</p> <p>For good or bad, this clock cannot be turned back. Closed borders and closed minds, crude nationalism, trade barriers, xenophobia, religious, racial and sexual discrimination \u2013 these are old mistakes and old hatreds that, while still in evidence everywhere, belong to times past. The world is moving forward, not back. In the end, Trumpism and all its ghastly incarnations, dwelling in fear and darkness, will, like Trump himself, be exorcised.</p>",
  "<p>Democratic party outrage at the FBI\u2019s shock revelation, almost on the eve of the US presidential election, that it is <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-clinton-idUSKCN12S299\" title=\"\">resuming its controversial investigation</a> of Hillary Clinton after declaring in July that the matter was closed, has been fierce.</p> <p>Donna Brazile, chairwoman of the Democratic national committee, was one of many to cry foul. \u201cThe FBI has a solemn obligation to remain neutral in political matters. Even the faintest appearance of using the agency\u2019s power to influence our election is deeply troubling,\u201d she said.</p> <p>John Podesta, the Clinton campaign chief, also hinted at skulduggery: \u201cIt is extraordinary that we would see something like this just 11 days out from a presidential election.\u201d Podesta said the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/29/us/politics/fbi-hillary-clinton-email.html?emc=edit_th_20161029&amp;nl=todaysheadlines&amp;nlid=53657756&amp;_r=0\" title=\"\">FBI statement</a> left it unclear whether there was anything remotely new to investigate.</p> <p>This may well be true. In his letter of notification to Congress, James Comey, the FBI director, said he did not know whether a batch of newly discovered emails bore any relation to previous claims that Clinton acted illegally in sending private emails containing classified information when she was secretary of state from 2009-13.</p> <p>Comey said the new emails \u201cappear to be pertinent\u201d, but he and his officials had not yet examined them. In a later statement, he admitted \u201cwe don\u2019t know the significance\u201d of the emails, but said he felt obliged to investigate and make his decision public. It is not even certain that the emails came from Clinton\u2019s private server.</p> <p>Comey\u2019s move is either extremely naive or extremely cynical. FBI investigations are routinely conducted behind closed doors. Only when a decision to prosecute has been taken, based on persuasive evidence, is an inquiry made public or suspects named.</p> <p>For a respected, ostensibly independent figure like the FBI director to tip his hand at this extraordinarily sensitive moment amounts to an overtly political, partisan act. Since it must be assumed that Comey is no fool, it must also be assumed that he knew what he was doing.</p> <p>A less damning explanation is that he was clumsily attempting to save the FBI (and himself) further criticism from the Republican right, which denounced his earlier investigatory efforts as a pro-Hillary cover-up. But if that is the case, why did Comey not have a confidential word with the relevant congressional oversight committees? Nobody could then subsequently accuse him of a cover-up. And he would not have triggered the firestorm in which the FBI\u2019s impartiality is again being questioned, and this time from the left.</p> <p>Whatever Comey\u2019s reasons, the damage is done. Clinton must now try to weather the storm until 8 November, having previously believed that she was in the clear. It will be a rough ride. The ugliest and most personally vindictive presidential campaign in modern history is now set for a frenetic, furious and nail-biting finale.</p> <p>Donald Trump and his supporters have been quick to wade in. Speaking on the campaign trail, the Republican nominee revived jibes that Clinton is a corrupt and habitual liar. In typically hyperbolic terms, he said that her conduct was \u201cthe biggest scandal since Watergate\u201d.</p> <p>As usual, Trump\u2019s risible exaggeration undermines his case. But the genuine anger and alarm expressed by Clinton\u2019s surrogates reflect their fear his attacks may be hitting home and their knowledge of how damaging renewed questions about her honesty and competence could potentially be.</p> <p>Although in Trump she faces the least qualified and, for a host of reasons, most objectionable Republican candidate in living memory, Clinton is still only about 5% ahead in the polls, as a national average.</p> <p>This bald figure may be considered misleading. In 14 battleground or \u201cswing\u201d states, where the electoral college will be decided, Clinton is ahead in all but Ohio, Iowa and Georgia. But polls across the nation are tightening. This latest flurry of negative headlines in national media desperate for a sensational story to keep the race alive (or in some cases, to dish her) <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/\" title=\"\">will not help</a>.</p> <p>Despite her advantages in experience, name recognition, political achievement and spending power, Clinton has evidently failed to knock Trump out of the race.</p> <p>Despite a deeply damaging few weeks for Trump, when he was beset by allegations of sexual misconduct, he still appears, amazingly, to be in with a shot.</p> <p>A more skilled and savvy politician than Clinton could and would have buried Trump months ago. A more charismatic, popular or likeable Democratic standard-bearer could now be awaiting electoral coronation. This latest blow may cause some underwhelmed Democrats to abstain. And Clinton\u2019s best pitch to sceptical independent and undecided voters \u2013 that she is the least worst candidate \u2013 leaves her vulnerable to a last-gasp upset.</p>",
  "<p>If it looks and sounds like a scandal, is it really a scandal?</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/29/fury-fbi-director-cryptic-letter-clinton-emails-response\">latest Clinton email flap</a> has all the trappings of one. With evasive answers, shady characters and FBI investigations, there must be something going on. Right?</p> <p>Rather like Saddam\u2019s weapons of mass destruction, we may not know what\u2019s hidden or where, but it sure looks like the Clintons have been hiding something.</p> <p>Sadly, this reasoning is enough for most Republican voters and a good chunk of independents. It may be enough to depress support among Democrats just at the moment the party needs to drive a high turnout among voters.</p> <p>But it\u2019s not at all clear what the FBI is talking about in terms of Clinton emails. <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-na-pol-fbi-clinton-email-probe-20161028-story.html\">Some reports</a> suggest they are neither to nor from Clinton herself, in which case we have just consumed a giant nothing-burger. After all, we already know that the FBI has no idea whether the emails amount to anything of any significance.</p> <p>This raises the obvious question: what on earth was the FBI director thinking when he dropped his letter on Friday making it crystal clear that he knew nothing? As a rule, law enforcement agencies generally don\u2019t publicize the fact that they are clueless.</p> <p>Beyond James Comey\u2019s extraordinary intervention in the late stages of a presidential election, his letter raises another, more familiar question about the Clintons: why do they attract pseudo-scandals with such alarming ease and frequency?</p> <p>From the Clinton foundation to the private email server, from Benghazi to Weiner, from Whitewater to Monica, the list is as long as it is utterly spurious. Whatever crumbs of wrongdoing there may be, they don\u2019t amount to something worthy of Watergate, or even the myriad gate-suffixed scandals since. Questionable behavior is not the same as criminal or even impeachable conduct.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/oct/28/hillary-clinton-new-fbi-investigation-emails-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/59nxm\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2851168\"            data-video-name=\"Hillary Clinton reacts to new FBI investigation into her emails \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-5814032ae4b0219a00d39cc9\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/10/29/161028clintonemails_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/10/29/161028clintonemails.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/10/29/161028clintonemails_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/oct/28/hillary-clinton-new-fbi-investigation-emails-video\">Hillary Clinton reacts to new FBI investigation into her emails</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Perhaps the pseudo-scandals say more about the Clinton haters than they do about the Clintons themselves. But it remains true that there is a remarkable contrast between the clouds that hang over the Clintons and those over the Obamas.</p> <p>Barack Obama has not exactly luxuriated in eight years of hate-free politics. The haters have thrown their best at him: questioning his citizenship and suggesting he secret sympathies for Isis. They even accused him of wanting to pull the plug on <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/grassley-warns-of-government-pulling-plug-on-grandma/\">grandma</a>.</p> <p>And yet there have been no pseudo-scandals about his personal life, his friends and donors, or even open microphone moments. As a candidate he was accused of palling around with terrorists, cutting a sweetheart deal for his home, and following the lead of an anti-American preacher. Inside the White House, not so much. The integrity and self-discipline over the last eight years has almost driven the scandal-mongers out of business.</p> <p>All that\u2019s left are the obvious problems posed by a radical Islamist from Kenya looking to foment a socialist revolution from the Oval Office. Given that he has only two months left in the White House, Obama needs to speed up his secret plans or else he\u2019ll turn into an even greater disappointment to the rightwing nuts.</p> <p>The good news for the scandal-mongers is the next Clinton administration appears to be just around the corner. House Republicans are already prepping their subpoenas in case they can launch another <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/house-republicans-are-already-preparing-for-years-of-investigations-of-clinton/2016/10/26/e153a714-9ac3-11e6-9980-50913d68eacb_story.html\">several dozen investigations</a> into the newly elected President Clinton.</p> <p>In that context, it doesn\u2019t much matter whether the FBI\u2019s Clinton emails amount to anything more than political gossip. The Hunting of Hillary has only just begun.</p> <p>What does matter is the impact on voters in these final frenetic days of the 2016 election. Recent polling suggests that most voters have already made up their minds about whether Clinton is honest and trustworthy: they don\u2019t believe her. To be sure, they also think the same about Donald Trump, albeit in slightly lower numbers.</p> <p>But those poll numbers mean that the email pseudo-scandal is unlikely to change anyone\u2019s mind about the candidate. In the same way, it\u2019s highly unlikely that Bill Clinton\u2019s money-making schemes at the Clinton Foundation will affect his wife\u2019s honesty numbers.</p> <p>For many voters, this email story comes too late. More than 12m votes have already been cast across the country in early voting, representing around 10% of the likely total votes in this election.</p> <p>In any case, the polls were already tightening, as Republicans inevitably rally to their candidate, no matter how catastrophically compromised he is with the voting demographic commonly known as \u201cwomen\u201d.</p> <p>Clinton\u2019s post-debate highs were unlikely to hold. In fact, numerous studies have shown that elections tend to end where the polls stand <a href=\"http://www.vox.com/2016/8/11/12426346/trump-polls-today\">two weeks after the conventions</a>, despite all the fluctuations back and forth. That suggests this election will end up as a race in the mid-single digits as a margin of victory for Clinton.</p> <p>Of course we don\u2019t know what the FBI emails may yet uncover, and we certainly don\u2019t know what turnout will look like on election day.</p> <p>But we do know that the closing days of a presidential election are anxious times. Campaign staffers are exhausted and fear failure. The media is desperate for one more fix of adrenaline, one more turn of the story to upend the likely outcome. Supporters on both sides become obsessive consumers of any snippet of information that might tip the balance.</p> <p>Into this gasoline-soaked period, the FBI director just threw a burning match and walked away. But the dumpster fire was already raging in this shocking election, and the voters who find the whole scene disgusting will likely stay away.</p> <p>Never mind the emails. This election was already in flames.</p>",

Comey stood accused of betraying the bureau\u2019s political neutrality, and came under growing pressure to make public everything he knows.</p> <p>The latest twist in a topsy turvy election arrived on Friday afternoon, when Comey said in a letter to Congress the FBI would review whether there was any classified information in new \u201cemails that appear to be pertinent to the investigation\u201d. In a <a href=\"https://www.lawfareblog.com/memo-press-what-comeys-letter-does-and-doesnt-mean\">carefully worded letter</a>, the director said he wanted to \u201csupplement my previous testimony\u201d about the original Clinton email investigation, which he told Congress <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/05/fbi-no-charges-hillary-clinton-email-investigation\">had closed this summer</a>, and said: \u201cThe FBI cannot yet assess whether or not this material may be significant.\u201d</p> <p>On Saturday, Clinton campaign chair John Podesta said: \u201cBy providing selective information, he\u2019s allowed partisans to distort and exaggerate in order to inflict maximum political damage and no one can separate what is true from what is not because Comey has not been forthcoming with the facts. </p> <p>\u201cWhat little Comey has told us makes it hard to understand why this step was warranted at all.\u201d</p> <p>It is \u201centirely possible\u201d that the emails are duplicates of those already studied by the FBI in its earlier investigation into Clinton\u2019s use of a private server while secretary of state, Podesta told reporters on a conference call, adding that Clinton would not be distracted in the final days of the campaign. </p> <p>In July, the FBI closed that investigation. Comey said at the time that Clinton and her aides had been \u201cextremely careless\u201d but not criminal with their email practices.</p> <p>\u201cDirector Comey was the one who decided to take this unprecedented step,\u201d Podesta said, \u201cwe now learn, against the advice of senior justice department officials who told him it was against longstanding department policy of both Democratic and Republican administrations.</p> <p>\u201cDirector Comey was the one that wrote a letter that was light on facts, heavy on innuendo, knowing full well what Republicans in Congress would do with it. </p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s now up to him, who owes the public answers to the questions that are now on the table, and we\u2019re calling on him to come forward and give those answers to the American public.\u201d</p> <p>Law enforcement sources speaking anonymously told news outlets the new emails came from devices belonging to Anthony Weiner, the<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/21/anthony-weiner-sexually-explicit-messages-teen-daily-mail\"> disgraced former congressman</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/29/huma-abedin-anthony-weiner-hillary-clinton\">estranged husband of Huma Abedin</a>, one of Clinton\u2019s closest aides.

But for the millions of Americans who can\u2019t arrange childcare or work in jobs where clocking off for a few hours on a Tuesday isn\u2019t an option, that answer is not an excuse, it\u2019s a reality. </p> <p>The overall effect of all these barriers is that minorities and poorer Americans, people who are <a href=\"http://www.people-press.org/2015/04/07/2014-party-identification-detailed-tables/\">more likely to identify as Democrat</a>, are less likely to vote. These facts will negatively affect Hillary Clinton on 8 November, as they have affected Democratic candidates before her.</p> <h2><strong>Won\u2019t vote</strong></h2> <p>Census Bureau data does point to millions of Americans who <em>chose</em> not to vote in the last presidential election. The bureau estimates that 16% of the 19.1 million Americans who didn\u2019t vote were \u201cnot interested\u201d, and another 13% felt they \u201cdid not like candidates or campaign issues\u201d.</p> <p>Those reasons are more crucial than ever in an election with the two most <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/04/donald-trump-hillary-clinton-general-election-analysis\">unpopular</a> candidates in decades.

It is oddly reassuring to discover that there is still a place in the US not transfixed by Clinton\u2019s reckless emails or Trump\u2019s 3am tweets. Here sports comes first, politics nowhere. A baseball cap is still a baseball cap, not a marketing prop for making America great again.</p> <p>Thom Majka, a sales rep who keeps his Indians cap on through every game for good luck, said: \u201cThese fans couldn\u2019t care less about the election.

It is the most <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/apr/09/american-exceptionalism-us-election-2016-baseball-lincoln-walt-whitman\">storied and soulful of US sports</a>. It survived the second world war when Franklin D Roosevelt declared: \u201cI honestly feel that it would be best for the country to keep baseball going.\u201d After reaching the World Series at last, Cubs manager Joe Maddon watched the Kevin Costner movie Field of Dreams and wept.

And where in July party delegates walked behind high steel fences separating them from potential civil unrest and thousands of police, this week Clinton and Trump supporters rubbed shoulders, recalled learning the sport in corner parks and backyards, and went to the ballgame together. </p> <p>Cubs fan Joe Wiegand, 51, from Maniton, Colorado, mused: \u201cBaseball is a wonderful distraction from the workaday world and the issues at hand. It brings people together. It\u2019s an important election and this is just a game but this is not only once in a lifetime, it\u2019s once in three lifetimes.

He bills himself as the \u201c<a href=\"http://www.teddyrooseveltshow.com/\">world\u2019s premiere Theodore Roosevelt reprisor</a>\u201d and was dressed for the part, including a \u201c1908 / Cubs\u201d sign attached to his top hat \u2013 referring to a year when Roosevelt was in the White House and the Cubs last won the World Series (the Indians need only go back as far as Harry Truman). </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We are long suffering but always hopeful</p> <footer> <cite>Joe Wiegand, Cubs fan</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cWe are long suffering but always hopeful,\u201d Wiegand said. \u201cThat optimistic statement: \u2018Just wait till next year.\u2019 We believe in the Cubs.

And I think we will win the World Series.\u201d</p> <p>As he spoke, Wiegand was greeted by old acquaintances: Cubs fan Wendy Menard, 56, and her partner Chris Frampton, 57, an Indians supporter. The couple, both financial advisers, recalled being nine or 10 years old when they attended their first baseball games. Frampton said: \u201cAs much as following Cleveland has been difficult for a long time, I\u2019m an Indians fan and always have been.\u201d</p> <p>Menard added: \u201cIt\u2019s in your blood. Cut me and it\u2019s blue.\u201d</p> <p>And how about the election? \u201cWhat election?\u201d Frampton shot back.</p> <p>The Indians\u2019 comprehensive 6-0 victory in game 1 on Tuesday, with pitcher Corey Kluber dominant, was celebrated by fans driving the streets blasting horns and high-fiving each other. The mood was more subdued on Wednesday as Cubs pitcher Jake Arrieta took control over four hours in a raw 43F (6C); a crowd watching the game on two giants screens outside the park ebbed away into the night. A small plane flew overhead trailing a banner that said: \u201cTrump tried to buy and move the Indians.\u201d</p> <p>The Cubs, whose home, Wrigley Field, is one of the great cathedrals of American sport, seem to have most of the country rooting for them. They have been striving and falling short for more than a century. Author Rich Cohen <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/25/opinion/the-cubs-reach-the-promised-land-now-what.html\">wrote in the New York Times: </a>\u201cFor as long as anyone remembers, following the Cubs has meant embracing futility, choosing the losers over the winners, seeing the romance in failure.\u201d</p> <p>The \u201clovable losers\u201d have suffered a legendary curse ever since a tavern owner, barred from a World Series game in 1945 because he was trying to bring in a <a href=\"http://www.billygoattavern.com/\">malodorous goat</a>, proclaimed that they would never win the title again. But inspired by Cubs fan Bill Murray\u2019s film Ghostbusters, some fans have paraded the slogan \u201cI ain\u2019t afraid of no goat\u201d and this year the team have carried all before them. Barack Obama has expressed hopes for a Cubs victory despite being a supporter of city rivals the Chicago White Sox.</p> <p>Cleveland, meanwhile, is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/18/cleveland-republican-national-convention-lebron-james\">relishing its moment in the sun</a>. It is one of America\u2019s poorest and most racially segregated big cities; only Detroit fared worse from the trauma of industrial decline. It has had to live down nicknames such as \u201cthe mistake on the lake\u201d while its river was so badly polluted that it caught fire in 1969. Progressive Field sits near steel bridges, smoking chimneys and slag heaps.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4ba820dd5f951b7f2c3109ad74475662e50723f9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4ba820dd5f951b7f2c3109ad74475662e50723f9/0_67_4880_2927/1000.jpg\" alt=\"progressive field in cleveland\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018The idea was that in an industrial, smoky city you could get a ticket and walk through that gate into a green space.

We\u2019re still considered a blue-collar town. Growing up in my neighbourhood, we played baseball in the spring and football in the fall and winter. When all the jobs left, that\u2019s what everyone clung to: our sports team.\u201d</p> <p>Majka, 63, whose daughter Stephanie favours the Cubs, agreed. \u201cCleveland is not a city people flock to as a major metropolitan area,\u201d he said. \u201cThe 70s, 80s and 90s have been tough years and that\u2019s why people hold on to their sports teams. Things in Cleveland are consistent. They put up with tough winters and losing sports franchises. They keep on coming back, hoping tomorrow will be a better day.</p> <p>\u201cPeople in Cleveland are hard-working and good-hearted and have their hearts broken thousands of times. To have the baseball after what happened in June with the basketball \u2013 two tremendous events in one year \u2013 was worth the wait. That\u2019s the Cleveland mentality: the harder you work, the luckier you get.\u201d</p> <p>Cleveland is a Democratic stronghold but Ohio remains a perpetual electoral battleground. Majka says he intends to vote for Trump because he wants change from the career politicians who run America. But if he was forced to choose between picking the winner of the election or the World Series? \u201cIt\u2019s got to be the Indians.\u201d</p> <p>Most fans would make the same decision in the view of <a href=\"http://history.case.edu/faculty/john-grabowski/\">John Grabowski</a>, who teaches a sports history course at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland. \u201cThe election has been a long, brutal process and people are much more interested in the World Series,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is pushing the campaign off the front of the news locally.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>The election has been a long, brutal process and people are much more interested in the World Series</p> <footer> <cite>John Grabowski, Case Western Reserve University</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Grabowski cautioned against notions of baseball as morally pure escapism, noting the sport\u2019s own history of \u201cchicanery and trickery\u201d, but added: \u201cNonetheless it\u2019s linked to what America is supposed to be about \u2013 the field of dreams. The idea was that in an industrial, smoky city you could get a ticket and walk through that gate into a green space. This is the pastoral aspect.\u201d</p> <p>Although there has been concern about the drop in African American players across baseball as a whole, both the Cubs and Indians have increasingly racially diverse lineups, he added, reflecting the diversity of the US itself. \u201cYou can see yourself on the field, no matter who you are.\u201d</p> <p>Baseball has arguably been in decline since the 1980s, although the sport has long served as a metaphorical shorthand for an idealised America. Grabowski sees evidence of a revival in that rose-tinted view in the era of Ronald Reagan \u2013 his celebrated <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU-IBF8nwSY\">\u201cMorning in America\u201d</a> TV commercial was released in the same year, 1984, as the fond movie The Natural starring Robert Redford.

Oriole Park at Camden Yards in Baltimore was conceived in the 1980s and completed in 1992, starting a trend for nostalgic \u201cretro ballparks\u201d.</p> <p>Reagan\u2019s promise to \u201cmake America great again\u201d has been expropriated by Trump and sewn into baseball caps and other merchandise. Trump\u2019s repeated promise at rallies \u2013 \u201cWe\u2019re going to win so much, you\u2019re going to be so sick and tired of winning\u201d \u2013 is probably unfathomable to success-starved Cubs and Indians fans.<br></p> <p>The battle shifted on Friday to Chicago, where residents are no less sports mad: box seats for the first World Series game at Wrigley Field in 71 years were <a href=\"http://hosted2.ap.org/APDEFAULT/347875155d53465d95cec892aeb06419/Article_2016-10-24-BBO--World%20Series-Ticket%20Prices/id-9df7d6488bc447baa0260cc10138c261\">selling on StubHub</a> for $50,000 and more.

  "<p>I love Great Britain. I\u2019ve always loved it: the mysteries by PD James, the pop songs by Oasis and Pulp, the comedy of Monty Python\u2019s Flying Circus.

And although the prime minister, Theresa May, said Brexit means Brexit, we\u2019re beginning to see that Brexit might be a movable feast.</p> <p>It\u2019s not only in Great Britain that rightwing and Eurosceptic forces have become substantially stronger. There is a possibility that they might take control in other countries as well: the Front National in France, with Marine Le Pen running for president, has always praised the nation state and complained about mass immigration, as well as the Dutch Party for Freedom of Geert Wilders, who said this week on Breitbart News: \u201cBritain is the Brexit pioneer and others will follow.\u201d <br></p> <p>Polls show that Le Pen will make it into the final round of the presidential election in May.

Like [this] whole thing is fucking insane.\u201d</p> <p>Fortunately for Clinton, in July the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/fbi\">FBI</a> eventually decided to let this potentially illegal evasion of security protocol pass with a sharp wrap on the knuckles.</p> <p>There was an audible intake of breath among campaign followers in the summer, when Comey criticised her for being \u201cextremely careless\u201d in her handling of classified information, but his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/05/fbi-no-charges-hillary-clinton-email-investigation\">decision not to recommend criminal charges</a>brought to an end the one threat deemed capable of preventing her from becoming president.</p> <p>That was, at least, until Comey dropped a fresh bombshell. The <a href=\"https://twitter.com/juddzeez/status/792051041399439360\">three-paragraph letter</a> he released to Congress on Friday revealing the existence of potentially significant new evidence may or not have any legal bearing on whether charges are again possible. It certainly had a political impact.</p> <p>Clinton was in the air when the letter leaked. An onboard Wi-Fi outage meant she may not have discovered its existence at all until her plane landed in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, for a campaign stop just down the road from her very first event as a candidate on 14 April 2015.<br></p> <p>There was a long delay in her leaving the plane as aides urgently gathered onboard to discuss the issue. A planned photoshoot with Annie Leibowitz had to be cut short. Her opponent wasted no time pointing out that it is never a good look for a presidential candidate to be under criminal investigation by the FBI.</p> <p>\u201cHillary Clinton\u2019s corruption is on a scale we have never seen before,\u201d was Donald Trump\u2019s predictable hyperbole at a rally minutes later in New Hampshire. \u201cWe must not let her take her criminal scheme into the Oval Office.\u201d</p> <p>Democrats rushed to downplay its significance on Friday, as campaign chairman John Podesta suggested Comey may have been \u201cbrowbeaten\u201d by aggressive Republicans into announcing a relatively minor wrinkle for the sake of transparency.</p> <p>The investigation had still not officially been closed, so it is also oversimplifying to say, as many initially did, that it has been \u201creopened\u201d. The fact that the evidence in question reportedly comes from separate investigation into a sex scandal engulfing Anthony Weiner, the estranged of husband of Huma Abedin, one of Clinton\u2019s key aides, should make it less relevant to her security case, not more.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/28/hillary-clinton-emails-fbi-election-voters\">Hillary Clinton's email woes refuse to go away \u2013 what does this latest twist mean?</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5813bd27e4b08d944ba4bbfc\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-28T21:04:40.151Z\">10.04pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Speaking in Lisbon, Maine, nearly an hour after he was scheduled to appear - there was an issue with the stairs on his plane - Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump told a room full of supporters that Hillary Clinton\u2019s use of private email servers when she served as secretary of state is \u201cthe biggest political scandal since Watergate.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe FBI, after discovering new emails, is reopening their investigation into Hillary Clinton,\u201d Trump said, inaccurately. \u201cI have great respect for the FBI for righting this wrong.

But it\u2019s a great relief that Pence is going anywhere, after what happened to his plane last night.</p> <h2>Pence plane overshoots runway</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/video/2016/oct/28/mike-pences-unharmed-after-plane-slides-off-runway-at-new-york-airport-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/59tdc\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2847837\"            data-video-name=\"Mike Pence's unharmed after plane slides off runway at New York airport \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"Reuters\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-5812a0bde4b08d944ba4b729\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/10/28/161028pence_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/10/28/161028pence.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/10/28/161028pence_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/video/2016/oct/28/mike-pences-unharmed-after-plane-slides-off-runway-at-new-york-airport-video\">The aftermath: Pence plane slides off runway at New York airport</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/mike-pence\">Pence</a> emerged unscathed after his plane skidded off the runway while landing at LaGuardia airport in New York in heavy rain.</p> <p>The Boeing 737 carrying Trump\u2019s running mate came in for a landing and went off the runway at about 7.40pm local time.

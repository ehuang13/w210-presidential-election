She spoke with Kellyanne Conway, the pollster promoted to campaign manager in the overnight Trump campaign shake-up.</p> <p>\u201cNow we see a number of voters who are not coming clean about their support for Donald Trump,\u201d Conway tells Lauren. <strong>And don\u2019t call it</strong><strong> a shake-up:</strong></p> <p>\u201cThis is an expansion at an incredibly busy time, the last 12-week homestretch for the campaign. We look at personnel as more as more. With Paul continuing as our chairman and Rick Gates as his deputy, Stephen Bannon and I have been added to what I would call the \u201ccore four\u201d of that senior team and we\u2019re going to divide responsibilities according to our best an highest uses.\u201d <br></p> <p>Q: How will she and Bannon work together?</p> <p>\u201cSteve Bannon and I have tremendous respect for each other as colleagues and as friends and we also have the trust of Donald Trump the candidate. You first of all have the trust of the candidate and the latitude \u2026 We have different styles but we have one vision.\u201d </p> <p>She said she expects to hit the campaign field and TV circuit while Bannon mans the HQ at Trump Tower. </p> <p>Q: Is the race over or just getting started?</p> <p>\u201cTwo or three things we\u2019ve all learned about Donald Trump is No 1: Don\u2019t underestimate him. No 2: You know he exceeds expectations and No 3: he also exceeds the metrics that are usually at play, meaning he over performed many of his polling averages in the primaries and the caucuses. But now we see a number of voters who are not coming clean about their support for Donald Trump. I can\u2019t find a single hidden Hilary Clinton voter in the country. I\u2019ve been looking for him or her. They all seem to be out, proudly saying that their voting for Hillary Clinton. </p> <p>\u201cIn the case of Mr. Trump, the race isn\u2019t over because August is not October let alone November.\u201d</p> <p>Q: How does Manafort fit in on the new team?:</p> <p>\u201cWe would hope and expect Paul continues to do many of things he\u2019s been doing. He\u2019s just been doing the job of three or four people.

That kid is Donald Trump. </p> <p>A full three months before the first vote is even counted <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/02/donald-trump-calls-hillary-clinton-the-devil-and-suggests-election-will-be-rigged\">Trump is claiming</a> that the system is rigged. He\u2019s claiming that the only way Hillary Clinton can win is if she cheats. To ensure that the election isn\u2019t taken away from him like the cake he thinks he\u2019s entitled to, Trump has added a new \u201cvolunteer\u201d opportunity to his website:</p> <p>\u201cHelp Me Stop Crooked Hillary From Rigging This Election! Please fill out this form to receive more information about becoming a volunteer Trump Election Observer.\u201d </p> <p>There\u2019s no information on what being an \u201celection observer\u201d actually entails.</p> <p>I\u2019ve never done a scientific study on voter fraud, but I do have some street cred as far as ballot integrity goes. In California I\u2019m usually the <a href=\"http://www.calnewsroom.com/2014/06/26/5-things-to-know-about-recounts-from-jimmy-camp/\">first guy they call</a> when there\u2019s a close election. The call usually comes around midnight on election night. Right about the time I\u2019m either drowning my sorrows over a loss with a single malt scotch or celebrating a win with cheap bubbles.</p> <p>I have spent hundreds of hours in the back rooms of county election offices in multiple states going over ballots. Looking at signatures on absentee ballot envelopes. Counting the number of votes cast per precinct compared to the number of registered voters. Trying to determine the slightest anomaly that would swing the election, the will of the people, one way or the other. On average I can usually come up with 10 or 12 votes in a city council race, state assembly, or statewide race, that otherwise shouldn\u2019t be there. But in the decades I\u2019ve been involved in politics, I\u2019ve never come across a case of widespread voter fraud that could swing the outcome of an election.</p> <p>If you really wanted to swing an election on a national level in a presidential race, here\u2019s how it would be done. Listen up, Hillary:</p> <ul> <li>Bring on a national voter fraud coordinator. (Perhaps the Clinton Foundation could pay for the program?)<br></li> <li>Hire a statewide voter fraud coordinator that answered to the national voter fraud coordinator in Colorado, Florida, Iowa, North Carolina, Virginia, Ohio and Pennsylvania.<br></li> <li>Enlist a county voter fraud coordinator in each of the targeted states.</li> </ul> <p>Each county coordinator in the targeted state would place ads on Craigslist recruiting supporters who were willing to commit a felony and vote multiple times. The ad would read: </p> <p>VOTERS NEEDED IN POLK COUNTY</p> <p><em>Are you a voter in Polk County willing to commit voter fraud in order to swing an election? Are you outgoing and not afraid to talk to people? If so, please respond and you will be given instructions on how to register to vote multiple times using different names and then how to apply for absentee ballots sent right to your home in the names of the fraudulent voters you registered under.</em></p> <p>Then, and only then, if the thousands of people they enlisted actually followed through, they could swing a presidential election. That is assuming the thousands involved in the conspiracy could keep a secret and not Instagram or Tweet about it so the media, the opposing campaign and the justice department didn\u2019t pick up on the scheme.</p> <p>So the big question now is, what exactly will Trump\u2019s \u201celection observers\u201d be doing? They could show up at polling places and attempt to intimidate voters they don\u2019t believe \u201clook\u201d like a voter. Perhaps Trump would encourage his observers to \u201crough them up a little bit\u201d or \u201cpunch them in the face\u201d. Sounds absurd right? No, it doesn\u2019t. It sounds like a scenario that should be expected based on past behavior.</p> <p>Trump no longer believes he can win this election and many have speculated that he never really wanted to be president in the first place. Donald hates to lose. So rather than losing gracefully and conceding and wishing the winner well as almost every single presidential candidate in recent history has done, he is knocking over the checkerboard like a spoiled brat.</p>",
  "<h2>Donald Trump shakes up campaign</h2> <p>Donald Trump has hired Stephen Bannon of the conservative website Breitbart News as campaign CEO and promoted pollster Kellyanne Conway to campaign manager in his latest <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/17/donald-trump-stephen-bannon-breitbart-news-kellyanne-conway\">campaign shakeup</a>. The moves represent a demotion for the Republican nominee\u2019s current campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, who has presided over a period of polling declines since taking control in June.

Billions of marine creatures ascend from as far as 2km below the surface of the water to the upper reaches of the ocean at night, only to then float back down once the sun rises. This huge movement of organisms \u2013 ranging from tiny cockatoo squids to microscopic crustaceans, shifting for food or favourable temperatures \u2013 was little known to science until relatively recently. \u201cThe deeper we go, the less we know,\u201d said Nick Schizas, a marine biologist at the University of Puerto Rico.

We all welcome this, don\u2019t you?\u201d Despite reports of potential links between the two men, these are the only public comments Putin has made on Trump.

Donald Trump has voiced support for capital punishment on at least two occasions; Hillary Clinton only talks about capital punishment when pressed, and then clumsily. Unlike most of her own party, Clinton supports execution in the case of terrorists. The best policy may be silence. \u201cWhy bring it up if it\u2019s going to stir the pot, if you don\u2019t have to?\u201d says Sherry Bebitch Jeffe, professor of public policy at the University of Southern California.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/17/death-penalty-election-2016-hillary-clinton-donald-trump\">Politics and the death penalty: for Clinton and Trump, safest stance may be silence</a></p> <h2>Ford to mass-produce driverless car</h2> <p>The auto manufacturer has announced it will produce a fleet of driverless cars for ride-sharing services, such as Uber and Lyft, by 2021. Mark Fields, Ford\u2019s president and chief executive, said the next decade would be \u201cdefined by automation of the automobile\u201d and the switch to driverless travel would affect society as much as the introduction of the assembly line did a century ago.

Parker granted two interviews with the Hollywood trade papers in which he described how he and Jean Celestin, a fellow student at Penn State University, were charged with raping a female student while she was unconscious. Parker was acquitted of the charges in 2001; Celestin was initially found guilty and later granted a new trial that was never held.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/aug/16/birth-of-a-nation-film-nate-parker-rape-trial\">The Birth of a Nation\u2019s reception compromised by director\u2019s rape trial</a></p> <h2>In case you missed it \u2026</h2> <p>With fashion\u2019s marketing season approaching again, Kate Baron casts an eye over the highlights of fashion\u2019s long association with pop music courtesy of her new book, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2016/aug/16/fashions-greatest-pop-hits-from-gagas-meat-dress-to-grace-joness-armani-suit\">Fashion + Music</a>.

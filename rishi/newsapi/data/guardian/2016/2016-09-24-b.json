Clinton must stem an apparent surge in Trump\u2019s popularity; the Republican needs to prove he has the temperament to be commander-in-chief. Both sides are desperate to manage expectations.</p> <p>\u201cIt is unprecedented to hold a conference call to talk about special precautions that need to be taken because your opponent is a habitual liar,\u201d said Palmieri, who said she was worried about what it \u201cmeans for the how debate may unfold and how viewers should judge [Trump\u2019s] performance\u201d.</p> <p>Though ridiculing the disciplined rehearsal schedule of his opponent, Trump also suspended campaigning on Friday in order to prepare. He sought to outsource his strategy to a giant focus group, asking supporters to email in suggested responses.</p> <p>With barely seven weeks to go until election day, Democrats are also pulling out all the stops.

I remember with [Ross] Perot and Clinton [in 1992] it was like within a few days, locked in. So the debates are important.\u201d</p> <p>Debate performance proved particularly decisive in the case of Al Gore, who, Greenberg says, went from five points ahead to seven behind over the course of three debates against George W Bush. </p> <p>\u201cHe got back to like a half-point lead but it had a huge impact because the voters decided they didn\u2019t like him in the first debate and then became more comfortable with Bush. In the third debate, Al Gore virtually tackled Bush physically.\u201d</p> <p>Debate performance is not always indicative of electoral success. Romney did well against Obama four years ago. </p> <p>\u201cJohn Kerry too,\u201d Greenberg said. \u201cHe had great debates against [George W] Bush, polls showed him winning, and yet in the end neither had any impact on the vote. The academic studies suggest that even the vote at the time did not shift. It was more a question of who was excited and energised and answered surveys, not any real change in the electorate.\u201d</p> <p>Greenberg believes Clinton is on course for victory in the debate and the election either way: \u201cHillary Clinton has debated a lot. She\u2019s very experienced and she does well. </p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019ll be prepared and I\u2019m pretty confident that the race won\u2019t change much. I obviously have no idea what Trump\u2019s going to do, it\u2019s so unpredictable, but I think she\u2019s a pretty steady and strong debater.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>When Nixon met Kennedy: the first TV debate</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"27a5c3c79f062ad418de5ce81b89527ce1cc224e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/27a5c3c79f062ad418de5ce81b89527ce1cc224e/0_0_2611_2048/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Richard M Nixon speaks as John F Kennedy watches\" width=\"1000\" height=\"784\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Richard M Nixon speaks as John F Kennedy watches.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Paul Schutzer/Time &amp; Life Pictures/Getty Image</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Clinton is not the first candidate to face scrutiny over her health during the gruelling spectacle of a presidential race.

He said: \u201cMy advice was that he should postpone leaving the hospital. That was not to be. If this was a private patient and not a political situation, one could be very insistent on him not leaving the hospital. But I was just a lowly captain.\u201d</p> <p>Nixon\u2019s health continued to suffer and he arrived at the debate with a 102F fever. He refused to postpone the event.

What would we do instead?\u201d </p> <p>Do debates affect the outcome of elections? The answer is mixed, according to Shrum. The 1960 debates were a \u201cdefining moment\u201d for Kennedy that \u201cbasically erased the experience argument\u201d. In 1976, Gerald Ford had been gaining on Jimmy Carter until he made a gaffe suggesting that Poland was free of Soviet influence and \u201cthe momentum was broken\u201d.</p> <p>But in 1980 and 1984, Ronald Reagan would have won anyway, Shrum believes, while \u201cin 1992, the debates were very important for Bill Clinton and he did a very good job\u201d. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The debates are the only faint hope that Trump can assure people that he is capable of being president</p> <footer> <cite>Robert Shrum</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Shrum added that in 2000, focus groups initially thought Gore had beaten Bush, but the post-debate narrative focused on Gore sighing and \u201cinvading Bush\u2019s personal space\u201d. In 2004, in Shrum\u2019s view, Kerry beat Bush in all three debates but still lost the election.</p> <p>He added: \u201cI would argue they matter a lot and they really matter this year.

He had a great mock debate and I knew he was dialled in. He was very focused and ready. He gave one of the best debate performances in modern history.\u201d</p> <p>Obama, by contrast, was widely seen as disappointing. Chen reflected: \u201cPart of it was that being president every day, you\u2019re not used to being told no. Part of it was that he underestimated Mitt.

It\u2019s the only opportunity that voters have to see the candidates engaging each other directly and to draw comparisons. </p> <p>\u201cThis year I think they\u2019re going to be great debates.

The 95% of eligible Haut Ogoou\u00e9ans who voted for Bongo just tipped the balance and he was declared the victor with a margin of fewer than 5,000 votes.</p> <p>The constitutional court revised the figures for Haut Ogoou\u00e9, saying there had been a 98% turnout, and that Bongo had won 83.2% to Ping\u2019s 4.6%. It also cancelled the results from 21 polling stations in Libreville. The African Union went to dispatch a team of observers to the court, but some were barred from entering. </p> <p>A high-ranking official in the Bongo camp, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that such a high turnout was normal in Gabon and dismissed the idea that anyone in the Haut Ogoou\u00e9 province could have been sick or giving birth on the day of the election.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/31/gabon-election-results-disputed-incumbent-ali-bongo-victor-jean-ping\">Violence erupts after Gabon election as incumbent Ali Bongo named victor</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Asked why African Union observers had been blocked from monitoring the constitutional court\u2019s review of the election, he said it was for reasons of \u201csovereignty\u201d.</p> <p>Ping is a former chair of the African Union and was a crony of Omar Bongo, the current president\u2019s father, who ruled the oil-rich nation for 42 years, until his death in 2009.</p> <p>Bongo\u2019s camp had called for Ping to be banned from standing for the presidency again for 10 years, for inciting violence immediately after the election. This was rejected by the court, which said there was no proof he had caused the violence.</p> <p>The president\u2019s spokesman Alain-Claude Bilie By Nze said the government \u201cexpects more responsibility from Mr Ping\u201d and added: \u201cIf he crosses the line, he will be arrested. If a Gabonese falls, he will answer.\u201d</p> <p>Former presidential candidate Leon Paul Ngoulakia, a cousin of Bongo who resigned from government last year and backed Jean Ping in the election, was reportedly arrested on Friday.</p> <p>In his last remarks to the court, Ping\u2019s lawyer Jean-Remy Bantsantsa said: \u201cDon\u2019t bring us stories of fake records, fabricated to make us believe that there were irregularities \u2013 because it is they who have falsified records. Everything has happened in unbelievable opacity.\u201d</p> <p>Each night since the election, the internet has been shut down, something the communications minister put down to mere \u201cdisruptions\u201d in the network. Twitter, Facebook and WhatsApp have also been blocked. Many locals have set up virtual private networks to be able to use them.</p>"

  "<p>His presidential campaign suspended with respect to the anniversary of the terror attacks of September 11 2001, Donald Trump kept a studious silence on Sunday, releasing only a <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/DonaldTrump/posts/10157676408515725:0\">statement</a>. It was a stance in sharp contrast to vehement and convoluted claims he has made about that day over the last 15 years.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/11/hillary-clinton-leaves-911-ceremony-after-feeling-overheated\">Hillary Clinton leaves 9/11 ceremony after 'feeling overheated'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Immediately after the attacks, the lifelong New Yorker spoke with <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MarlowNYC/status/774976459488292864\">a local news anchor</a> who asked whether, given his property in the financial district, he had learned anything about the devastation. Trump\u2019s mind turned to his buildings.</p> <p>\u201cIt was an amazing phone call,\u201d Trump replied. \u201cI mean 40 Wall Street actually was the second-tallest building in downtown Manhattan. And it was actually before the World Trade Center was the tallest. And then when they built the World Trade Center it became known as the second tallest. And now it\u2019s the tallest.\u201d</p> <p>Trump later <a href=\"http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/news/feds-gave-donald-quick-bundle-titans-9-11-funds-set-small-biz-article-1.558429\">collected a $150,00 grant</a> for 40 Wall Street, from a state recovery program meant to help small businesses after 9/11. In April 2016, he <a href=\"http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/exclusive-trump-didn-post-9-11-funds-helping-people-article-1.2786879\">claimed</a> that the funds were \u201cprobably a reimbursement for the fact that I allowed people, for many months, to stay in the building, use the building and store things in the building\u201d.</p> <p>Officials who helped with the recovery have disputed Trump\u2019s account to <a href=\"http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/exclusive-trump-didn-post-9-11-funds-helping-people-article-1.2786879\">the New York Daily News</a>, and questioned what help the businessman ever provided. But at recent rallies Trump has continued to take credit, saying at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GoAngelo/status/722224694078779392\">one campaign stop</a>: \u201cEveryone who helped clear the rubble, and I was there, and I watched, and I helped a little bit.\u201d</p> <p>How much money Trump has given to recovery efforts or charities related to the 9/11 attacks remains an open question, though not without diligent investigation by the Washington Post, which <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/politics/2016-election/trump-charity-donations/\">found, for example, no record that Trump had ever given his own money</a> to the 9/11 Museum. Just before the Republican primary, his foundation, which since 2008 <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/how-donald-trump-retooled-his-charity-to-spend-other-peoples-money/2016/09/10/da8cce64-75df-11e6-8149-b8d05321db62_story.html\">has exclusively spent other people\u2019s money</a>, gave $100,000. </p> <p>A spokeswoman for the Trump campaign told <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3304163/Trump-gave-500-000-pocket-help-9-11-victims-charities-claims-snubbed-way-off.html\">the Daily Mail last year</a> that Trump had given \u201ca total of $102m\u201d to \u201chundreds of charitable foundations over a relatively short period of time, many of which helped people affected by 9/11\u201d. Despite repeated requests, the campaign has <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2016/07/06/five-questions-we-still-cant-answer-about-donald-trumps-charity-donations/\">declined to provide evidence of these gifts</a>, and refused to release tax returns that would show donations.</p> <p>Trump quickly urged the city to rebuild on the site of the towers, but within a few years said that the new building \u201cshouldn\u2019t be built\u201d because of its \u201cterrible design\u201d. </p> <p>\u201cIf we build this job the way it is, the terrorists win,\u201d he <a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/id/7832944/ns/msnbc-hardball_with_chris_matthews/t/trump-calls-freedom-tower-disgusting-pile-junk/#.VfLjoxFVhBc\">told MSNBC host Chris Matthews in 2005.</a> \u201cIf we rebuild the World Trade Center but a story taller and stronger, then we win. I mean, I don\u2019t want to have the terrorists win, Chris. And that\u2019s what\u2019s going to happen if we build this pile of junk.\u201d</p> <p>During his presidential campaign, Trump has appeared to blamed the attacks on the inaction of American leaders. \u201cThe World Trade Center came down during the reign of George Bush,\u201d he said <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/feb/13/cbs-republican-debate-trump-bush-cruz-rubio-antonin-scalia\">in a February debate</a>. \u201cHe kept us safe? That is not safe. That is not safe.\u201d</p> <p>In August, Trump <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2016/08/donald-trump-muslim-ban-september11-226637\">said</a>: \u201cThose people that knocked down the World Trade Center most likely under the Trump policy wouldn\u2019t have been here to knock down the World Trade Center, just so you understand.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"http://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/donald-trump-osama-bin-laden-sept-11-attacks\">In September,</a> he said: \u201cI would\u2019ve been tougher on terrorism. Bin Laden would\u2019ve been caught a long time ago, before he was ultimately caught, prior to the downing of the World Trade Center.\u201d</p> <p>At another debate, he struck an uncharacteristically reflective note when spurred by criticism of \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jan/14/republican-debate-donald-trump-ted-cruz-new-york-values\">New York values</a>\u201d from a rival, Ted Cruz. </p> <p>\u201cNew York values were on display for all to see in the aftermath of 9/11,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIn our darkest moments, as a city, we showed the world the very, very best in terms of bravery and heart and soul that we have in America.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/MarlowNYC/status/774976459488292864\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Here&#39;s the disgusting audio of Trump on 9/11 bragging about how his building is now the tallest in Lower Manhattan: <a href=\"https://t.co/4ufikWwOom\">pic.twitter.com/4ufikWwOom</a></p>&mdash; Marlow Stern (@MarlowNYC) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MarlowNYC/status/774976459488292864\">September 11, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/09/donald-trump-fact-check-lies-military-tax-returns\">The lies Trump told this week: from military spending to his tax returns</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But at rallies over the last year, the businessman has frequently turned his attention toward Muslim Americans, whom he has accused of celebrating the attack.

Trump later <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2016/08/02/donald-trumps-revisionist-history-of-mocking-a-disabled-reporter/\">mocked a reporter</a> who wrote a 2001 article that mentioned the rumor in the context of police investigations.</p> <p>Trump has also claimed to have lost \u201c<a href=\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/02/17/donald-trump-s-hundreds-of-9-11-lies.html\">hundreds of friends</a>\u201d in the attacks, though his campaign has declined to identify any victim whom he knew.

In his statement, he said: \u201cToday is a day of sadness and remembrance. It is also a day of resolve.</p> <p>\u201cFifteen years ago, America suffered the worst terrorist attack in its history.

  "<p>Presidential rivals Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump visited Ground Zero in New York on Sunday, for ceremonies marking the 15th anniversary of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/11/9-11-illnesses-death-toll\">the terrorist attacks of September 11 2001</a>. Their unusual appearance at the same event ended early, when Clinton <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/11/hillary-clinton-leaves-911-ceremony-after-feeling-overheated\">felt unwell and left</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/11/hillary-clinton-leaves-911-ceremony-after-feeling-overheated\">Hillary Clinton leaves 9/11 ceremony after 'feeling overheated'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Just two weeks before the first presidential debate and 58 days before election day on 8 November, the Democratic and Republican nominees were present to pay silent tribute to the almost 3,000 people who died in the attacks 15 years ago.</p> <p>Politicians are invited to attend ceremonies every year at the site where the World Trade Center was destroyed by two hijacked jets, but not to speak. The event centers on those who lost loved ones. Some of the families gathered to commemorate their relatives, however, cheered and clapped as Trump arrived.</p> <p>According to a spokesman for the <a href=\"http://www.911memorial.org/\">National September 11 Memorial and Museum</a> that now stands at Ground Zero, it was the first time the New York real-estate billionaire had attended the official ceremony.</p> <p> Trump, who was born in Queens, grinned as people waved, and posed so they could take photographs. Clinton, who in 2001 was the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/09/hillary-clinton-9-11-attacks-response\">junior US senator from New York,</a> arrived quietly, greeting some families on her way into the site, and did not prompt applause like her rival. Both candidates issued short statements about the need to mark the day solemnly.</p> <p>In Washington, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/10/barack-obama-911-anniversary-america\">Barack Obama</a> observed a moment of silence in the White House and spoke at a commemoration of those who died in the attack on the Pentagon.</p> <p>People also gathered at the Flight 93 National Memorial in Shanksville, Pennsylvania, where one of the planes hijacked by terrorists crashed into a field.</p> <p>In lower Manhattan, family members of those who died, New York firefighters who lost 343 of their colleagues, police officers and survivors gathered under overcast skies. It was humid and haze obscured the top of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2014/sep/08/-sp-one-world-trade-center-new-york-rebuild-ground-zero-twin-towers\">One World Trade</a>, the skyscraper that now dominates the New York skyline, in contrast to the clear blue skies that dawned on the day 15 years ago that changed the course of history.</p> <p>In total, 2,977 people were killed. In Manhattan on Sunday, wives who lost husbands, children who lost fathers and mothers and other family members and friends laid flowers on the names of the dead that are engraved into the stone surrounds of two huge reflecting pools with waterfalls, constructed on the exact sites where the twin towers stood. The stage for the event sat between the two pools.</p> <p>A youth choir from Brooklyn sang the Star-Spangled Banner, to warm applause. A group of first responders in dress uniform held up the torn flag that was raised over the wreckage at Ground Zero in the aftermath of the attack, before marching away to the sound of a piped band.</p> <p>Then the site went still, for a moment of silence at 8.46am, the time the first jet hit, near the top of the north tower.</p> <p>Monica Iken Murphy, 46, from New York, attended with her daughters Madison, 10, and Megan, eight. On 11 September 2001 her husband, Michael Iken, a bond trader, was working on the 84th floor of the south tower.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"04973d093e817d91fcc25aa9f2940ded723c2f64\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/04973d093e817d91fcc25aa9f2940ded723c2f64/0_0_480_640/375.jpg\" alt=\"Monica Iken Murphy\" width=\"375\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Monica Iken Murphy holds a picture of her husband, Michael.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Joanna Walters/the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cHe called me that morning to tell me to watch the TV because a commuter plane had flown into the north tower, that\u2019s what they thought had happened,\u201d she said. \u201cBut they could not see what I saw when I switched on the TV \u2013 the big, gaping hole in the other side of the north tower.\u201d</p> <p>He told her he was fine. Some workers had left the building but he and some others were trying to help a colleague who was quaking with fear and hiding under a desk. A few minutes later, he called again.</p> <p>\u201cThe last thing he said was, \u2018People are jumping out of the windows\u2019, then \u2018I have to go\u2019. But no-one thought the towers would fall.</p> <p>\u201cHe told me to start calling friends and family and that\u2019s what I was doing when I saw on the TV the second plane hit the south tower. I froze, I could not believe what I was witnessing.\u201d</p> <p>The second plane hit the south tower about 20 minutes after the first impact. Michael Iken died when the tower collapsed, a short time later.</p> <p>His wife now comes to the site \u201cas a place of reverence\u201d, she said, and because, like many relatives of those who died, she never received any remains.</p> <p>\u201cBut this is where these people took their last breath,\u201d she said.</p> <p>After the overcast start to the morning, the sun suddenly shone. Iken Murphy stepped into its rays.</p> <p>\u201cWhen the sun comes out,\u201d she said, \u201cI feel his warmth and a connection to him as if he is communicating with me or hugging me.

D\u2019Amadeo choked up as he recalled how many people helped him in the years since 9/11.</p> <p>He told those gathered that he had recently attended a children\u2019s camp for those who lost family and friends in the mass shooting at Sandy Hook elementary school in Connecticut in December 2012.</p> <p>\u201cSuddenly I was able to be there for people and use my experience to help them,\u201d he said.

Ross Perot, a billionaire businessman running as an independent and focused on balancing the federal budget, debated Bill Clinton and incumbent president George HW Bush.</p> <p>Perot was in a far stronger position than Johnson. In June 1992, he actually led the polls \u2013 he had 39% in one Gallup survey \u2013 and was able to use his vast fortune to buy up half-hour blocks of TV time. But even with these advantages, Perot ended up with 18.9% of the vote \u2013 a lot, but not enough to secure any electoral college votes, let alone the 270 needed to win.</p> <p>Johnson might not have to win 270 either.

If no candidate reaches that total, the House of Representatives decides who will be the next president.</p> <p>\u201cDemocrats are not going to cross over the line to change to Trump, and Republicans are not going to go over the line to support Clinton.

  "<p>All of Donald Trump\u2019s strengths and weaknesses were on display this week as he kicked off the homestretch of his presidential campaign.</p> <p>From a walk through a county fair in Ohio, where throngs of people standing four and five deep along a paved path reached out to touch the waving Trump to a televised interview where the Republican nominee praised Vladimir Putin and denigrated American generals, it was a microcosm of Trump\u2019s campaign. One moment he went out of his way to be accessible to the media extending reporters (including one from the Guardian) an invitation to talk with him on a flight on his private plane. Next, he proclaimed to a shouting crowd that the journalists were a corrupt extension of the Clinton campaign.</p> <p>The Republican nominee started the week in Ohio where he sat down with union workers in the bar of an American Legion hall with a blinking LED sign announcing \u201cwings on Thursday\u201d. There, Trump waxed rhapsodic about Democrats who were now supporting him and the weakness of Barack Obama to a dozen weathered white men who looked to him as a potential savior.</p> <p>The blue-collar tour continued when Trump visited nearby Goody\u2019s Diner, which boasted its country tot bowl on a sign outside. The Republican nominee greeted individual diners there. He was particularly pleased when the first voter he met was a Hispanic who planned on voting for him. Trump pronounced \u201cMexican American supports Trump, Mexican American. It\u2019s so nice\u201d to the reporters surrounding him. Trump, looking quite pleased with himself, then gestured at the reporters and directed them to \u201cmake a note of it guys\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"82678156c9481e6b7ac935b4c832010ef506ab36\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/82678156c9481e6b7ac935b4c832010ef506ab36/0_212_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"trump\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Donald Trump speaks to diners during a stop at Goody\u2019s in Brook Park, Ohio.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mike Segar/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Republican nominee eventually sat down at a table with beefy, middle-aged men sitting around a pitcher of cola. He proclaimed to an assembled crowd of reporters and diners \u201cthese are the big union folks here\u201d. A longtime Trump aide standing nearby hastened to agree: \u201cAmazing,\u201d he exclaimed. </p> <p>The union folks must have been amazing as a heartened Trump invited reporters on his plane for a 30-minute flight afterwards. Not coincidentally though, the invitation was extended the same day Hillary Clinton started flying on the same plane as her press corps, something presidential candidates have traditionally done for six months before the election. Trump has declined to let reporters join him on his private plane.</p> <p>For this flight, the press sat facing Trump and his running mate, Mike Pence, in the main seating area of the cabin, which featured white leather chairs and couches along with shiny wood that a Trump bodyguard anxiously warned the press not to scratch. Each seat was emblazoned with the Trump crest while television screens through the cabin showed flight data. Some reporters had to go to a separate private room for takeoff because they couldn\u2019t sit on the floor for safety reasons. As the plane taxied, Trump got up and visited them, amiably making small talk. By the time the plane landed, Trump pivoted yet again on his immigration plan. Pence had helped one reporter find a missing cellphone that had gone flying across the cabin during takeoff. </p> <p>The next stop was a county fair where Trump received a welcome more akin to the Beatles at Shea Stadium than a presidential candidate in Ohio. Even teenage boys shouted \u201cI love you Donald\u201d as the candidate struggled to walk a block past rows of corndog vendors. Instead of working the crowd, Trump simply had to wave as secret service agents protected him from the crush of humanity eager for a glimpse.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7492e27227497ce0e3e801a21e12086a87170460\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7492e27227497ce0e3e801a21e12086a87170460/0_313_4696_2818/1000.jpg\" alt=\"trump supporters\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Throngs of Trump supporters try to get a photo of the Republican presidential candidate as he walks through the Canfield fair in Ohio.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Evan Vucci/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The following days for Trump were more conventional. On Tuesday, he held a town hall where in response to softball questions posed by General Mike Flynn, a longtime supporter, he demonstrated his nostalgia for the Iran-Iraq war. \u201cI always say Iran and Iraq were very similar militarily. They\u2019d fight, fight, fight and then they\u2019d rest. They\u2019d fight, fight, fight. And then Saddam Hussein would do the gas.\u201d Trump followed this with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/06/donald-trump-rally-greenville-north-carolina-clinton-attack\">a primetime rally</a> where he railed against Hillary Clinton as an adoring crowd chanted \u201clock her up\u201d.</p> <p>On Wednesday, Trump <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/07/donald-trump-us-military-spending-sequester-isis\">held a policy speech</a> in a wood-paneled club that has long catered to Philadelphia\u2019s elites, where he suggested \u201csometimes it seems like there wasn\u2019t a country in the Middle East Clinton didn\u2019t want to invade\u201d and railed against her legacy of \u201cturmoil, suffering and death\u201d.

  "<p>In repressive states, the role of the artist is unambiguous: to assert the individual imagination, the singular power that all dictatorships fear. I remember once <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/aug/02/ivan-klima-interview\">talking to the Czech dissident and writer Ivan Klima</a>, who had been subject both to the arbitrary horror of a Nazi concentration camp as a child and the long grinding years of Soviet occupation in which he had become a \u201cnon-person\u201d for two decades, harassed constantly by secret police and unable to speak or write in public. He survived by \u201cliving in truth\u201d. \u201cI have always pursued inner freedom,\u201d he said. \u201cI have never been censored.\u201d</p> <p>Klima was part of that group of artists and writers who gathered in the Magic Lantern theatre in Prague in 1989 to orchestrate the \u201cVelvet Revolution\u201d and see their dreams of liberation realised.

After his imprisonment in 2012, his tone seemed to change. \u201cPeople are always wondering if I am an artist or politician,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe I\u2019ll just clearly tell you: whatever I do is not art.

Sarah Sze, the American sculptor, who creates wonderful, unsettling mind maps of consumerist detritus that spill across the gallery floor, fell foul of the Chinese censors in Guangzhou. While in no way comparing her situation to that of Ai Weiwei, in some ways confronting the blunt instrument of censorship gave her work extra force and clarity, she suggested.</p> <p>\u201cProtest requires focus,\u201d she said. \u201cIf the Occupy movement could have focused around one moment or image \u2013 like John and Yoko in a bed \u2013 it would have helped that movement a lot.

So we were able to do that in an abandoned drive-in theatre in the middle of the desert where the train stopped, and the sound of this vocal was like a huge turbine engine, at dusk, and the warm wind blowing and you are in the middle of nowhere in America.

And fear of offence shows you are scared of what happens if people express their opinions. That often ends up in a kind of stagnation, with everyone holding each other at gunpoint.

We recently did a <a href=\"http://www.tamuseum.org.il/about-the-exhibition/elmgreen-dragset\">show in Israel</a> at the Tel Aviv museum. In their main hall, we put a full-scale replica of a section of the Berlin Wall.

But we could speak about our experience of how important it was for us that the Berlin Wall came down</p> <p><strong>What response did you get?</strong><br>People were moved by it, I think, especially because we did no finger pointing. It was something for them to stand in front of a wall as a single person being blocked in their movement.

We have lost our sense of being good citizens, of having a wider vision. That sounds quite old school and nostalgic, but it is true. Politics has just become economics \u2013 how much do I pay in tax, how much do I get? The internet has made us very egocentric individuals. We are no longer proud of, say, being part of a third generation of steel workers that built a country. We call ourselves \u201cworking class\u201d or \u201cartist\u201d or \u201cfeminist\u201d or \u201chomosexual\u201d in a very different way from the way we would have said those things in the 1960s.

That piece was then accepted for a triennial in Guangzhou. When we were shipping it we were contacted by the Chinese authorities saying they wanted specific front pages to be removed.</p> <p><strong>What was the problem?<br></strong>It turned out that every front page I was being asked to remove said something about China; it could be just a phrase or something. So I made a new version for China. The piece was actually on the floor, like it was protecting the floor, spattered with paint and so on. So I took black paint and painted out the parts they wanted redacted and then mentioned the fact in the wall note. For this show, I have done the opposite.

It is like a cloud that will never leave us but it has no meaning or substance.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://vimeo.com/79329869\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/79329869\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption><a href=\"https://vimeo.com/79329869\">Watch the trailer for Doug Aitken\u2019s Station to Station.</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p><strong>At some point soon, though, it might have real meaning for a lot of lives. Do we not need to find a direct way to engage with it?</strong><br>It\u2019s an interesting question and a strange time to ask it. What I see mostly is an incredible political apathy. By and large, the political system appears so corporate-driven that people have a hard time seeing how they can affect it. When you get to that point, real change comes from secession. The most interesting projects or groups or actions now don\u2019t exist in opposition in a traditional protest way, but as something entirely separate from the mainstream, for example, the Slow Food Movement, which is people following something they believe in ethically but also taking away the capital that is funding the existing system. They are voting with what they purchase or don\u2019t purchase.</p> <p><strong>Can art work in the same way?</strong><br>I don\u2019t separate social and political work as different from any other art. The value of any art is to be curious and to forge new languages and questions. The whole landscape has changed. You don\u2019t have to wait for a single critic in New York to come to your exhibition or hear your music. We don\u2019t have those high peaks of culture and dark valleys of culture \u2013 everything is eroded down to this kind of universal jungle. We are all our own critics and sponsors now.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.victoria-miro.com/exhibitions/494/\"><em>Protest</em></a><em> is at Victoria Miro gallery, London N1, 23 Sep-5 Nov </em></p> <p>\u2022 The title 10,000 Lives was amended to the correct title 10,000 Waves on 12 September 2016<br></p>",
  "<p>As the founder of Sports Direct and owner of Newcastle United, Mike Ashley will be used to sporting idioms, and here is one for him to ponder over the weekend: so near yet so far.</p> <p>That is the critics\u2019 reaction to Sports Direct after its public open day this week. Ashley has launched a series of initiatives to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/07/sports-direct-founder-mike-ashley-stands-by-under-fire-chairman\" title=\"\">try to improve working conditions and corporate governance at Sports Direct</a>, such as offering shop staff on zero-hours contracts the option of guaranteed hours.</p> <p>But major flaws at the company remain and when the mask slipped during Sports Direct\u2019s PR assault at the open day, Ashley showed that the fundamental problem has not changed \u2013 he has too much power.</p> <p>Ashley lost his cool in the company\u2019s annual shareholder meeting and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/07/sports-direct-board-turned-down-chairman-keith-hellawell-resignation\" title=\"\">tried to blame trade union Unite</a> for the working conditions in Sports Direct\u2019s warehouse. He also expressed his frustration at press coverage of the company and participated in cringeworthy joint television interviews with Sports Direct\u2019s chairman, Keith Hellawell, turning to the former policeman for his agreement about a point he had just made to say: \u201cKeith, yes?\u201d. Hellawell responded with a meek \u201cI agree\u201d.</p> <p>Hellawell\u2019s position at Sports Direct is at the centre of the problem. He should leave the company immediately. It is unprecedented for a FTSE company to have more than half its independent shareholders vote against the re-election of the chairman.</p> <p>Hellawell, we are told, tried to resign before the vote but was talked out of it by the rest of the board. This simply reinforces the perception that he does not have the power or the will to challenge Ashley, who still owns 55% of Sports Direct. The chairman is supposed to be head of the board. No one should be telling him what to do.</p> <p>The charge sheet against Hellawell is emphatic. His failures include: the lack of a permanent finance director for more than two years; carrying \u201cindependent\u201d non-executive directors who have been at the company so long they are no longer classified as independent according to the corporate governance code; and unorthodox related-party transactions with Ashley\u2019s brother, who manages international online delivery, and the boyfriend of Ashley\u2019s daughter, who manages Sport Direct\u2019s property strategy. Oh, and Sports Direct has also had to give back pay to staff who received less than the minimum wage, and its share price is trading at around a third of its peak.</p> <p>In this context, it is extraordinary that no heads have rolled among senior management and the board of Sports Direct. A fresh face as chairman or director could bring a new perspective to the company and at least show the world that Ashley is willing to take on new advice.</p> <p>As it is, Ashley has publicly asked that Sports Direct be given time to correct its shortcomings. But with Hellawell still in place, it is difficult to believe that the company will be revolutionised. The City institutions that have spoken out against Ashley, such as Standard Life and Legal &amp; General, rarely make such interventions and shy away from confrontations in public. The fact they aired their grievances in public \u2013 either through the media or the annual meeting \u2013 shows have they been unable to make progress behind closed doors.</p> <p>Sports Direct\u2019s shareholders must keep up the public pressure on Ashley. The tycoon has made welcome first steps in pledging to rethink zero-hours contracts and putting an employee representative on the board.</p> <p>But these are symptoms of a problem rather than a problem in themselves. The real problem is that no one at Sports Direct was ensuring that high standards of employment practice and corporate governance were maintained. That job should be the chairman\u2019s.</p> <p>A year ago it was unthinkable that Ashley would take the public and journalists on a tour of Sports Direct\u2019s warehouse. At previous AGMs Ashley would sit silently with his head in his hands before making a quick getaway by helicopter. So progress has been made \u2013 but, to use another sporting idiom, Sports Direct is still in the relegation zone.</p> <h2>Serenity only lasts until the next forecast at the Bank</h2> <p>Serenity is not usually a word associated with the Bank of England. Threadneedle Street is a place of unhurried calm, yes, but its staff are usually nervous about a possible recession or banking collapse for anyone to appear serene.</p> <p>Yet the bank\u2019s governor, Mark Carney, said he was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/07/mark-carney-serene-about-bank-of-englands-brexit-stance\" title=\"\">\u201cabsolutely serene\u201d about his warning of a possible recession after the EU referendum</a>, even though that now seems unlikely, at least in the short term.</p> <p>Questioned by Brexit-supporting MPs, Carney also rejected the idea that he overreacted when it looked like his prophecy would come true following a slew of bad economic data in July.</p> <p>Look at the counterfactual, he said. Without the warnings, businesses and consumers might have found themselves sleepwalking off a cliff edge. And without an interest rate cut and an extension of the bank\u2019s stimulus package in the wake of the Brexit vote, a recession is exactly what we might be looking forward to.</p> <p>It was a performance to rank alongside his speeches earlier in the year. At each one he appeared more presidential \u2013 and, with the Treasury distracted, the only person who cared about Britain\u2019s economy. Brexit campaigner and Tory MP Steve Baker said as much when he thanked Carney for riding to the rescue while the cabinet imploded.</p> <p>This week the rate-setting committee Carney chairs will meet and no doubt agree that it has done a good job. It is expected to say that the rebound in August from the terrible July means they should wait and see before making another move.</p> <p>It\u2019s not until early November that the monetary policy committee will meet again and revise its long-term forecasts. And that brings us to Carney\u2019s achilles heel, which is the bank\u2019s predictions for growth, inflation and interest rates. Year-in, year-out, they have proved over-optimistic. At the beginning of the year, economists were ridiculing the bank as out of touch. If Carney misplaces his oracle and fails again to read the economic mood, his bravura performances this year could be for naught \u2013 and his serenity lost.</p> <h2>Formula One is in dire neeed of a mechanical overhaul</h2> <p>For those who think watching Formula One on television is a bore, news that the business that runs the sport <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/07/f1-liberty-media-8bn-takeover-deal-agreed-bernie-ecclestone\" title=\"\">is being sold for $8bn </a>(\u00a36bn) would have been a shock. But it was probably also a shock for the team owners and track operators struggling to balance the books.</p> <p>Formula One Group looks like a consumer business that has been run too hot: think Tesco before its sales and profits slumped. It is making money for its owner but at the expensive of customers, who have become disillusioned with its offering. Eventually this has an impact on the financial performance, as it did for Tesco. TV viewing figures are stagnant, all but the biggest teams struggle to make a profit, and up-and-coming rivals, such as Formula E, are doing a better job of reaching out to a new generation of customers.</p> <p>Liberty Media, the new owner, has a lot of work to do.</p>"

  "<p>One day after Donald Trump reiterated his admiration for Vladimir Putin, saying the Russian president was a better leader than Barack Obama, Republicans on Capitol Hill struggled to explain why their party\u2019s presidential nominee was enamored with a man they have long cast as one of America\u2019s primary foes.<br></p> <p>Many Republicans who returned to Washington this week after the summer recess expressed confidence that Trump was improving as a candidate in both tone and message. But on Thursday, they found themselves in the familiar routine of distancing themselves from Trump\u2019s comments \u2013 the latest being his praise for Putin in an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/08/clinton-vows-no-more-troops-in-iraq-as-trump-slams-dumbest-foreign-policy\">NBC News national security forum held on Wednesday</a>.</p> <p>\u201cIf you\u2019re running for leader of the free world and you\u2019re expressing admiration for Putin, well then you\u2019re losing me,\u201d Lindsey Graham, a senator from South Carolina and former Republican presidential candidate, told reporters.</p> <p>\u201cI think Vladimir Putin is a thug, a dictator, an autocratic ruler who has his opposition killed in the streets of Russia. He has dismembered his neighbor.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/oct/03/vladimir-putin-is-a-gangster-and-thug-says-us-presidential-candidate-marco-rubio\">Vladimir Putin is 'a gangster and thug', says US presidential candidate Marco Rubio</a> </p> </aside>  <p>While Graham said he found Obama to be \u201cweak\u201d, \u201cindecisive\u201d and someone Putin had \u201cwalked all over\u201d, the visibly frustrated senator added: \u201cBut no, I\u2019m not going to say that Putin\u2019s a better leader than a democratically elected president of the United States even though I have differences with him.\u201d</p> <p>It was just earlier this week that Graham, who has thus far declined to endorse Trump and has been among the candidate\u2019s biggest critics, spoke positively for the first time of the direction his campaign had taken. After telling reporters on Monday that Trump would give Hillary Clinton \u201ca hell of a race\u201d, the senator hardly minced his words when reacting to Trump\u2019s overtures toward Putin. </p> <p>\u201cThis whole idea of admiring Putin is the biggest misunderstanding of a relationship in a person since Munich,\u201d Graham said.</p> <p>Marco Rubio, the senator from Florida who made his opposition to Putin a central tenet of his own presidential campaign, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/oct/03/vladimir-putin-is-a-gangster-and-thug-says-us-presidential-candidate-marco-rubio\">similarly disagreed with Trump\u2019s assertion</a> that the Russian president was a better leader than Obama.</p> <p>\u201cLook, I have tremendous policy disagreements with President Obama, but Vladimir Putin is an authoritarian thug who is accountable to no one,\u201d Rubio told the Guardian.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think what Vladimir Putin exhibits is leadership. I think what he exhibits is thuggery \u2026 and we should be clear-eyed about that,\u201d he added, noting that Putin controlled the media, the military and often his political opponents were either imprisoned or found dead.</p> <p>Asked by the Guardian if he was concerned that Trump had a penchant for commending Putin, despite those facts, Rubio said he was hopeful the candidate\u2019s posture might evolve.</p> <p>\u201cMy sense is those views will probably change once he understands better who Vladimir Putin truly is \u2013 that\u2019s my hope,\u201d responded the senator, who is backing Trump.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"972a9499a6ac1e40df907b7fec8b63dc3732b20d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/972a9499a6ac1e40df907b7fec8b63dc3732b20d/0_289_5971_3584/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Marco Rubio: \u2018Vladimir Putin is an authoritarian thug who is accountable to no one.\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Marco Rubio: \u2018Vladimir Putin is an authoritarian thug who is accountable to no one.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Broadimage/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cAt the end of the day, Hillary Clinton was part of the single biggest blunder ever when it came to Vladimir Putin, and that\u2019s the reset with Russia.\u201d</p> <p>While Trump\u2019s habit of making pro-Russia statements is <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/378102285001576448\">not new</a>, his refusal to adopt the GOP\u2019s hard line against Putin has become a source of discomfort for Republicans. </p> <p>Not only has his party argued that Russian military intervention in Ukraine would not have been possible had the Obama administration sufficiently stood up to Putin, but it has also cited Clinton\u2019s role as former secretary of state to discredit her foreign policy experience.</p> <p>But Trump, since becoming the nominee, has both continued to extol Putin\u2019s leadership and even called on the Russian government in July <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/27/donald-trump-russia-hillary-clinton-emails-dnc-hack\">to hack Clinton\u2019s emails</a>. While drafting the GOP platform at the Republican national convention in Cleveland, the Trump campaign also fought to eliminate language around arming Ukraine in its fight with Russia \u2013 bringing further scrutiny to the ties between <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/apr/27/paul-manafort-donald-trump-campaign-past-clients\">Paul Manafort, Trump\u2019s campaign manager at the time</a>, and pro-Russian interests. (Manafort was let go from the campaign last month.)</p> <p>The paradox was palpable as many Republicans approached in the hallways of the Senate declined to address Trump\u2019s latest string of pro-Putin comments.</p> <p>John McCain of Arizona and Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania, both vulnerable Republican senators facing tough re-election battles, had nothing to say.</p> <p>\u201cYou should ask Donald Trump about that,\u201d Toomey said, while McCain simply stated his own opinion that Putin is \u201ca murderer and a thug\u201d but pointedly refused to discuss Trump.</p> <p>Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, the runner-up in the Republican presidential primary who memorably declined to endorse Trump at the convention in Cleveland, referred the Guardian to his press office. And two members of Senate Republican leadership \u2013 John Barrasso of Wyoming and John Cornyn of Texas \u2013 said they had not seen Trump\u2019s remarks.</p> <p>Asked directly if it was fair to say that Obama has been a better president for America than Putin has been for Russia, Cornyn demurred: \u201cI\u2019m not gonna go down that path.\u201d</p> <p>Bob Corker, the senator from Tennessee who chairs the Senate foreign relations committee, also initially said he was no longer responding to each one of Trump\u2019s controversial statements. But when pressed by the Guardian about the implications of the mutual respect between Putin and Trump, if the latter was elected president, Corker acknowledged that \u201cpersonal relationships end up affecting things\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWe have national interests right now that are very different in many cases than those of Russia,\u201d he said. \u201cI think one has to be careful not to succumb to flattery.\u201d</p> <p>Earlier in the day, the House speaker, Paul Ryan, faced several questions pertaining to Trump\u2019s appearance at the foreign policy town hall. The nation\u2019s top Republican dubbed Putin as \u201can aggressor who does not share our interests\u201d and suggested Russia was behind state-sponsored cyber-attacks \u201con what appears to be [the US] political system\u201d.</p> <p>But Ryan, too, reached his limit while fielding repeated queries about Trump.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to stand up here and do a tit-for-tat on what Donald said last night,\u201d he said.</p>",
  "<p>David Bossie, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/03/citizens-united-david-bossie-trump-campaign\">new deputy campaign manager</a> for Donald Trump, was probably hoping \u2013 at best \u2013 that his 2008 anti-Hillary Clinton campaign commercial-cum-documentary Hillary: The Movie would put a fork in Clinton\u2019s political ambitions.</p> <p>Little did he know it would result in a major US supreme court ruling that would overturn years of campaign finance law, usher in an age of unlimited and undisclosed campaign spending and ultimately become a wedge issue between Clinton, during her second campaign, and the candidate running for the Democratic nomination \u2013 to her left. (Or that the 2016 Republican nominee and his eventual boss would also rail against the Super Pacs it helped spawn.)</p> <p>The movie itself, however, was largely ignored during its initial release, in part because of its amateurish production values, its line-up of mostly obscure conservative talking heads and its lightly factual, non-chronological look through <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/27/hillary-clinton-bill-clinton-scandals\">the scandals of the Clinton years</a> (some of which didn\u2019t even involve Hillary Clinton) that many Americans had tired of years before.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/27/hillary-clinton-bill-clinton-scandals\">Travelgate to Furnituregate: a guide to the Clinton scandals of the 90s</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But as former press secretary for Newt Gingrich turned Washington Times editorial page editor Tony Blankley (who <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/09/us/politics/tony-blankley-gingrich-aide-and-columnist-dies-at-63.html\">died in 2012</a>) noted in the movie, some politicians \u201csay what you need to say at any given moment, and rely on the lack of memory of the American public and the support of the mainstream media to support that lack of memory\u201d. Though Blankley, of course, was referring to the Clintons, similar criticisms have been leveled at her Republican opponent and film-maker Bossie\u2019s new employer. </p> <p>So what could Bossie pull out of his hat that hasn\u2019t yet been thrown at Clinton during this campaign?</p> <p>It\u2019s perhaps easier to look first at what has been ineffective in 2016. Calling her \u201cone of the most divisive figures in America\u201d, as the voiceover in the film does, is certainly not an effective criticism when her opponent is the equally divisive Donald Trump. Nor is Ann Coulter\u2019s assertion that \u201cany Republican with those numbers of character flaws, with that sort of behavioral problem and psychopathic psychology could not run or be elected dog catcher if it were a Republican\u201d.</p> <p>Attacking her problems, or Bill Clinton\u2019s problems, with ineligible or unethical campaign donors and the potential ties to a foreign power, such as China, seeking to influence the US election is certain to raise too many uncomfortable questions, given the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/30/donald-trump-paul-manafort-ukraine-russia-putin-ties\">appearance of a cozy relationship</a> between parts of the Trump campaign and Russia, and some of the people (like white supremacists) supporting him. Dick Morris\u2019s assertion that Clinton didn\u2019t pass enough far-reaching legislation during her tenure in the Senate isn\u2019t useful when your candidate is a political neophyte who\u2019s never been elected to office and makes that part of his supposed allure.</p> <p>Travelgate, which gets extensive \u2013 if slightly inaccurate \u2013 treatment in the film, is likely too obscure a scandal for most people in 2016; Hillarycare, though still a conservative bugaboo, is now the law of the land and <a href=\"http://kff.org/interactive/kaiser-health-tracking-poll-the-publics-views-on-the-aca/#?response=Favorable--Unfavorable&amp;aRange=twoYear\">about as many people</a> approve as disapprove it. And although the film criticizes her for her lack of support for the Iraq war, particularly in its later years, Trump has criticized her for supporting it at all (although he reserves the right to change his own mind).</p> <p>More effective \u2013 and more dirty \u2013 are assertions about the Clintons\u2019 marriage, included unsubstantiated but continuing allegations that she personally hired private investigators to dig up dirt on and intimidate women who had had contact with Bill Clinton and accused him of affairs or assault. (The Clintons have long denied these claims.) Given Trump\u2019s willingness to invite questions about his own less-than-squeaky-clean marital history by alleging that it\u2019s fair to ask Hillary Clinton questions about Bill Clinton\u2019s behavior, it seems likely that Bossie\u2019s background with Clinton accuser Kathleen Willey \u2013 who <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/presidential-races/268590-bill-clinton-sexual-assault-accuser-to-campaign-against\">alleged</a> that Bill Clinton groped her in the Oval Office and that Hillary Clinton <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2008/01/did-clintons-try-whack-cat\">had her pet cat killed</a> \u2013 and Jared K Stern \u2013 the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.bethesdamagazine.com/Bethesda-Magazine/July-August-2012/Sex-Lies-Videotape/\">private investigator</a> who says he was hired to follow Willey in 1998 \u2013 will come into play before the election season is over.</p> <p>Most interesting, though, is the last major anecdote of the Bossie film: he uses the story of Joe Connor \u2013 whose father, Frank, was killed in the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/manhattan/puerto-rican-terrorists-plant-bomb-tavern-1975-article-1.2484977\">Puerto Rican separatist group FALN\u2019s bombing of the Fraunces Tavern</a> in New York City in 1974 \u2013 to highlight Bill Clinton\u2019s <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1999/09/08/us/12-imprisoned-puerto-ricans-accept-clemency-conditions.html?pagewanted=all\">granting clemency</a> to 12 members of the organization in 1999. Though the man allegedly responsible for the bombing <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20141219/financial-district/cuba-decision-gives-fraunces-tavern-bombing-victims-son-hope-for-justice\">remains in exile in Cuba</a>, 10 of the members granted clemency were convicted of charges related to a series of bombings in Illinois, and the others were convicted in relationship to the hold-up of an armored car in Connecticut.</p> <p>The Senate <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/stories/1999/09/14/senate.faln/\">opposed</a> the granting of clemency 95-2 and Hillary Clinton, who was then running for the New York Senate seat, eventually <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/1999/sep/07/hillaryclinton\">opposed the offer</a> and said she\u2019d had no prior knowledge of it. Still, the move by the White House was widely seen as an attempt to help her curry favor with the large (and voter-rich) Puerto Rican community in New York City \u2013 though her subsequent denouncement of the offer did her no favors.</p> <p>Connor is <a href=\"http://thenewfounders.net/joseph-f-connor/\">an occasional Fox News guest</a> and a columnist on the conservative site TownHall, where he <a href=\"http://townhall.com/columnists/joeconnor/2015/12/22/hillary-not-qualified-to-win-war-on-terror-n2096386\">has</a> <a href=\"http://townhall.com/columnists/joeconnor/2016/09/04/flight-to-terror-n2213667\">inveighed</a> against electing Hillary Clinton. But in Bossie\u2019s documentary he came across as genuine, still hurting from his father\u2019s death, and very, very likable. It\u2019s unlikely Bossie\u2019s forgotten him in the intervening years \u2013 and more likely that he and the rest of the Trump campaign are just waiting for the right moment to bring him up again.</p>",

Trump has downplayed the severity of the intrusion and even invited \u2013 sarcastically, he claimed \u2013 Russia to hack Clinton\u2019s own emails. </p> <p>On Thursday, the House speaker, Paul Ryan, distanced himself from Trump\u2019s remarks, accusing Putin of conducting state-sponsored cyber-attacks \u201con what appears to be [the US] political system\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cVladimir Putin is an aggressor who does not share our interests,\u201d Ryan told reporters at a press conference in Washington. \u201cVladimir Putin is violating the sovereignty of neighboring countries.

  "<p>It was supposed to be the substantive counterpoint to a primary season dominated by frivolity, but Wednesday\u2019s national security forum \u2013 hosted by NBC and featuring back-to-back appearances by Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump \u2013 was nothing of the sort.</p> <p>To say it wasn\u2019t television news\u2019 finest hour <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/08/for-clinton-a-skirmish-with-history-from-trump-an-ambush-of-the-facts\">would be an understatement</a>.</p> <p>Instead of testing the limits of Trump\u2019s knowledge or probing Clinton to move beyond her standard talking points, the forum\u2019s setup seemed to encourage candidates to assume their usual roles. Trump was allowed to ramble on topics utterly devoid of policy content, <a href=\"http://www.vox.com/2016/2/18/11057968/donald-trump-iraq-war-2002\">while occasionally asserting lies as truths</a>; Clinton was forced to repeatedly defend herself against the same accusations regarding her private email server that have plagued her all election cycle. </p> <p>Trump was able to play all his greatest, phoniest hits \u2013 saying, for instance, he was against the war in Iraq all along. <a href=\"http://www.vox.com/2016/2/18/11057968/donald-trump-iraq-war-2002\">That\u2019s a lie</a>, pure and simple, as has been documented by a whole cadre of journalists by now.

He did the same routine a second time when asked about his relationship to Vladimir Putin, saying first that Putin\u2019s favorable impression of him would not have any impact on him and then saying the exact opposite thing in the next sentence: \u201cIf he says great things about me, I\u2019m going to say great things about him.\u201d No matter, both Trump and Lauer had moved on.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video element--supporting\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/sep/08/donald-trump-putin-more-of-a-leader-of-his-country-than-obama-for-us-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/525fa\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2700631\"            data-video-name=\"Donald Trump: Putin is far more of a leader of his country than Obama is for US \u2013\u00a0video\"            data-video-provider=\"NBC News\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57d10cdae4b0c1d95ae14821\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/09/08/160907Trump4putin_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/09/08/160907Trump4putin.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/09/08/160907Trump4putin_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/sep/08/donald-trump-putin-more-of-a-leader-of-his-country-than-obama-for-us-video\">Trump: Putin is more of a leader of his country than Obama is for US \u2013 video</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>The approach allows listeners to hear whatever they want to hear, something Trump, in his myth-making book, The Art of the Deal, touted as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/01/trump-immigration-code-switching-not-skillful-disingenuous\">one of his greatest strengths</a>. It also gives Trump an opportunity to parrot compliments he\u2019s received \u2013 in this case, from Putin.</p> <p>Lauer\u2019s not a national security expert and doesn\u2019t have a reputation for being hard-hitting. But even with that disposition and background, he still should have managed to call Trump out some of these things.</p> <p>Yet to simply blame Lauer for what\u2019s widely considered to be a missed opportunity is to miss the forest for the trees. Sure, he failed to elicit a substantive policy discussion from Trump. But he also failed where every other major moderator has failed as well. If there\u2019s a formula for stopping Trump from coasting on insults and babble, nobody\u2019s found it yet, and playing PolitiFact in real time is no easy feat.</p> <p>There were a few places where Trump walked himself into a corner, like his comment about how, under President Obama, military generals have been \u201creduced to rubble\u201d and things have eroded to a point where \u201cit\u2019s embarrassing\u201d. Those remarks came off as deeply unpatriotic. But any resulting controversy, like the comment he made last year about John McCain not being a war hero, will fade.</p> <p>Trump is winning the military vote handily, after all, as every Republican candidate in recent elections has. It\u2019s a vote that\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2016-election/military-communities-favor-trump-over-clinton-n644176\">disproportionately white, male and lacking a college degree</a> \u2013 which is to say, it checks all the right boxes for him. And no outlier comment about generals in a policy forum is going to change that.<br></p> <p>What does matter and should scare Clinton is that she just got an ugly preview of the coming debates: despite establishment insistence that Trump\u2019s playground-style taunts won\u2019t work on her in the general, we saw during Wednesday night\u2019s forum that they can.</p> <p>Trump is already using such tactics against Clinton, as he did at a town hall in Virginia earlier this week when he made a gendered dig about how <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/trump-putin-clinton-laughs-2016-9\">\u201cPutin looks at her and he laughs\u201d</a>. He did it when he observed her to be lacking a <a href=\"http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2016/09/donald-trump-says-clinton-doesnt-look-presidential.html\">\u201cpresidential look\u201d</a>, and when he insinuates she\u2019s untrustworthy through silly monikers like Crooked Hillary. It\u2019s an approach Paul Krugman referred to earlier this week as the politics of <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/05/opinion/hillary-clinton-gets-gored.html?rref=collection%2Fcolumn%2Fpaul-krugman&amp;action=click&amp;contentCollection=opinion&amp;region=stream&amp;module=stream_unit&amp;version=latest&amp;contentPlacement=1&amp;pgtype=collection\">innuendo</a>. It\u2019s not just Trump who\u2019s employing it, but he\u2019s channeling it more effectively than anyone else in recent memory.</p> <p>It was evident during the forum on Wednesday night, and it was evident afterwards, when Clinton\u2019s camp came after Trump on all the inconsistencies he spouted to Lauer, attacking his defense of sexual assault in the military, his embrace of Putin and his tarring of military generals. </p> <p>Meanwhile, the chairman of the Republican party attacked Clinton for, of all things, having <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Reince/status/773694140404170752\">\u201cno smile\u201d</a>. She was left playing defense against innuendo at an event <a href=\"https://twitter.com/chucktodd/status/773673483884720129?lang=en\">expressly billed</a> as the antidote to vapid dialogue. If that\u2019s any indication of what we\u2019re in for this fall, Clinton and anyone in support of examining actual political policy needs to come up with a new strategy.</p>",
  "<p>Plans for Palestinian elections in the West Bank and Gaza Strip next month have been plunged into disarray after a court in Ramallah ordered that the vote be postponed until at least December.</p> <p>The municipal elections, scheduled for 8 October, which Fatah and Hamas had both planned to contest, had been seen as a key step towards ending the prolonged impasse in Palestinian politics, and the first step towards long-delayed legislative and presidential elections.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>However, some in the Fatah movement, to which the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, belongs, view the prospect with deep trepidation, fearing a repeat of the 2006 election, when the Islamist movement Hamas won over large parts of the electorate, not least in its stronghold of Gaza.</p> <p>Behind the scenes, some Fatah figures have been pressuring Abbas to cancel or postpone the vote. Indeed, rumours have been circulating that a way will be found to cancel the elections.</p> <p>The court in Ramallah on the West Bank, where Abbas\u2019s Fatah movement rules, ordered the postponement following disputes over candidate lists, not least in Gaza where Fatah activists have complained of interference by Hamas.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3497f84fefcc0f91a70f4df19c81d38358cef0b4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3497f84fefcc0f91a70f4df19c81d38358cef0b4/203_324_3225_1935/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mahmoud Abbas.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mahmoud Abbas.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A key issue in the postponement was the claim that Hamas-run courts in Gaza had annulled candidate lists in Khan Younis, in the southern Gaza Strip, barring Fatah figures from standing for infringements including alleged \u201cimmorality\u201d, such as reported claims of a picture of one candidate dancing in a nightclub.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>\u201cElections can\u2019t take place in one place and not the other,\u201d the presiding judge of the Ramallah court said in his ruling. \u201cThe election can\u2019t take place in Jerusalem and its neighbourhoods. Also, there are problems with the formation of courts in Gaza \u2026 Therefore, the court decides to stop the election.\u201d</p> <p>In fact local elections in 2012 did proceed under exactly those conditions, with polling taking place in a fraction of the West Bank\u2019s 350 municipalities, and Hamas refusing to recognise the outcome.</p> <p>A Hamas spokesman said it rejected the court\u2019s decision. \u201cThis is a political decision,\u201d the Hamas spokesman Sami Abu Zuhri said. \u201cWe reject the decision to cancel the election and call on everyone to reject it.\u201d</p> <p>The court will hold another session to consider the issue on 21 September, but legal experts said Thursday\u2019s decision was unlikely to be changed, meaning it is almost certain that the municipal elections will not go ahead as planned.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Sources suggested Abbas would not seek to intervene to overrule the court by decree to ensure the elections went ahead on schedule.</p> <p>Official campaigning had been due to start in the coming weeks. The elections were seen as reflecting wider political rivalries in Palestinian society than the Hamas-Fatah split, including as a prism for the protracted and contested issue of who will succeed 81-year-old Abbas.</p> <p>The dispute underlines the legal and political divisions between Abbas\u2019s Palestinian Authority, which governs in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, and Hamas, which has controlled Gaza since 2007.</p> <p>The involvement of both in the elections had been briefly seen by some as a hint that long-stalled efforts to bring about a reconciliation between the two might be making practical progress.</p> <p>Interest in the elections has been high, including in Gaza where 90% of potential voters have registered to vote. The elections would have seen parts of Gaza that have not voted since 2006 participate, including 90,000 new young voters.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>The postponement of the elections also underlines the growing problem of Abbas\u2019s own long-expired democratic mandate. He is now in the 11th year of his four-year mandate, ruling by decree, with no sitting Palestinian legislative assembly since 2007. Opinion polls suggest most Palestinians would like him to step down.</p> <p> Hamas, which runs the Gaza Strip, boycotted the last Palestinian municipal elections in 2012. Fatah and Hamas have not contested an election since 2006 parliamentary polls, which Hamas won \u2013 sparking a conflict that led to near civil war in Gaza the following year.</p> <p>Both sides were quick to blame the other for the postponement. \u201cWe hold Hamas fully responsible for foiling the election, starting with the unjustified petitions it filed,\u201d the Fatah spokesman Osama al-Qawasmi said, accusing Hamas of using \u201cprivate courts\u201d in Gaza to block Fatah\u2019s lists.

The Port Authority\u2019s police department in Fort Lee, New Jersey, moved traffic cones without warning, forcing three lanes of cars through a single toll booth at the foot of the George Washington Bridge, which connects to New York. They chose the first day of the school year in Fort Lee for maximum impact. Commuters and students were gridlocked for hours, and emergency workers could not respond to calls. The lanes were shut for four days.</p> <p>\u201cIt was unbelievable,\u201d said <a href=\"https://twitter.com/rickwtyler?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">Rick Tyler</a>, a former spokesman for Ted Cruz, who ran against Trump and Christie in the Republican primaries. \u201cI\u2019ve been across the George Washington Bridge. I think I would have just removed the barricades and driven on.\u201d</p> <p>For a while, agency officials claimed that the operation had been a botched traffic study, but in early January 2014, leaked emails suggested a conspiracy. The motive is said to have been pure vengeance. Christie\u2019s aides allegedly wanted to get payback on a mayor, Democrat Mark Sokolich, who refused to endorse his re-election as governor, then deployed official resources to cover their tracks.</p> <p>The defendants on trial are Bridget Anne Kelly, Christie\u2019s deputy chief of staff, and Bill Baroni, Christie\u2019s top appointee at the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which operates the bridge. Following a 16-month investigation, federal prosecutors have charged them with nine counts, including conspiracy to commit fraud and with violating the civil rights of the people trying to cross the bridge.</p> <p>A third defendant, former Port Authority of New York and New Jersey executive David Wildstein, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/may/01/chris-christie-david-wildstein-bridgegate\">pleaded guilty and is assisting prosecutors</a>.

A taxpayer-funded investigation by a law firm hired by Christie cleared him of misconduct, but that finding was condemned by Democrats as a whitewash. </p> <p>Opening statements in the trial of Kelly and Baroni are scheduled for 19 September.

According to the New York Times, he told reporters last month: \u201cI know you guys all hope for this story to go on forever. But unfortunately for you, I suspect by the time we get to October or so, it will finally be over.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>These days it is en vogue in Washington DC to be itching for conflict with Russia.

In it, we hear echoes of the preacher\u2019s \u201crid ye of the devil\u201d and traces of the political call to \u201cthrow the bastards out\u201d.</p> <p>This election year, it\u2019s clearest in the Trump campaign but emerges in alternative form in Democratic positions. Populist demands grow loud when the \u201cbastards\u201d are identified as Washington insiders, constrainers of liberties, corrupt and incompetent. Nativist demands increase when the \u201cbastards\u201d are immigrants or other suspect groups. In both, a troubled world will be set right when evil forces are purged.</p> <p>The country was born in a revolution against central government, but long before, early settlers, fleeing the centralization of Charles I, were wary of London: the king\u2019s men were the bastards to be thrown out in order to preserve local control. \u201cThe Congregational churches and self-contained towns of Massachusetts,\u201d the historian TH Breen writes, \u201cstood as visible evidence of the founders\u2019 decision to preserve in America what had been threatened in the mother country.\u201d </p> <p>The many early settlers who were religious dissenters were doubly suspicious of government, first for its centralizing efforts and second for the persecution it had foisted upon them. Internal migration through sparsely settled land contributed to the dismissal of central government and growing self-reliance, as there was relatively little government to rely on. Individual initiative and local community were the keys to survival. </p> <p>National government took a larger role as the country grew, yet the value of individual and local effort combined with a suspicion of central authorities were rooted in America\u2019s civil faith.</p> <p>Protestantism, born also in revolution (against Rome), added to the mix. The mandate to read the Bible for oneself and find one\u2019s own path to God encouraged the view that the responsible moral agent is the individual (with guidance from her local church). The Great Awakenings of the 1730s-1740s and 1820s-50s were festivals of individual iconoclasm, religious groups splintering off from established institutions, and populist religious ideas.</p> <p>Reformed Protestantism, which came to America through Puritan and other Calvinist traditions, had an even stronger impact on political development. It held that the sovereign nation does not start with central government but with the local covenanted community \u2013 the foedus \u2013 which form networks to constitute the nation. It\u2019s these ideas that gave the US its federal system of government and the continuing political and legal battles about states\u2019 rights. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"ea2a3a3074dac52ce16a7a60491cda9ebe457494\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ea2a3a3074dac52ce16a7a60491cda9ebe457494/0_0_3500_2402/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ammon Bundy greets occupier Duane Ehmer and his horse at the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge.

Among the more anti-authoritarian sects was Arminianism \u2013 or in America, Methodism \u2013 in which the accent shifted subtly to the individual\u2019s role in salvation. It was a faith well-suited to a self-reliant nation wary of authorities, and America embraced it. The number of Methodist churches rose from 20 in 1770 to 19,883 in 1860. By the mid-19th century, two Kentucky preachers could in good anti-authoritarian conscience opine: \u201cWe are not personally acquainted with the writings of John Calvin \u2026 neither do we care.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>When Reagan said government was the problem, he was channeling American history and zeal</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>From this history came the myth, reality and creed of self-reliant localism and suspicion of central authority. Reliance on government is for the faint and faithless of heart. When Reagan said government was the problem, he was channelling American history and zeal. </p> <p>Today, Trump is giving this civil religion voice in populist form, and because \u201cthrow the bastards out\u201d is rooted in US culture and worldview, it wins votes. </p> <p>In April 2016, the Public Religion Research Institute reported: \u201cTwo-thirds of Trump supporters think the nation needs a leader who breaks the rules\u201d (a ritual redux of Boston\u2019s \u201cthrow the bastards out\u201d Tea Party). Other Republican candidates had populist, small-government positions but lacked Trump\u2019s feathers-and-warpaint yelp. Ted Cruz came closest, which is one reason, along with his social conservatism, why he was second in line and why there is substantial support for his running in 2020.</p> <p>Even when Trump says he\u2019d keep governmental social security for retirees, his jeremiad is brimstone and hellfire for Washington. The more unflinchingly Trump preaches, the more it \u201cclicks\u201d with the national creed and the more satisfying it feels.</p> <p>Trump University taught: \u201cYou don\u2019t sell products, benefits or solutions \u2013 you sell feelings.\u201d Trump had no hand in the development of America\u2019s civil-religious anti-authoritarian feelings, but he taps into them.

Closing borders to keep or throw the bastards out will probably not address America\u2019s economic or national security problems. Given the extensive vetting process, it\u2019s not clear that barring Muslims will boost security, but it does do Isis\u2019s PR for them, giving weight to the claim that America is in a war against all Muslims. It\u2019s also not clear that reducing immigration would yield economic benefits, since legal and illegal immigrants to the US create companies and jobs and boost the economy by a surplus of $35bn annually, benefiting all but the lowest earners. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/sep/07/kentucky-trump-obama-unemployment-drugs\">Pride and pain in Trump country: 'We all grew up poor, but we had a community'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>America\u2019s employment crisis could be addressed through education, job (re)training, and regional redevelopment, for a start.

He <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/kyleblaine/donald-trump-lies-that-he-opposed-iraq-war-from-beginning-an?utm_term=.wt2E7Y2rwP\">lied about opposing the Iraq war</a>, criticized Obama\u2019s 2011 withdrawal and repeated his advocacy of stealing Iraq\u2019s oil \u2013 a measure he evidently believes would require a minimal force presence, despite the certainty that the well-armed locals might have a problem with their principal source of wealth being plundered by a foreign power.</p> <p>Speaking before an audience of veterans, Trump unexpectedly attacked the current generation of generals and flag officers. While previously Trump had said he <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/11/13/the-remarkably-unappealling-anger-of-donald-trump/\">knew better than the generals</a> about fighting Islamic State, this time he intimated that he\u2019d get \u201cdifferent generals\u201d \u2013 a habit more typical of caudillos than American presidents.</p> <p>He followed up by saying his ultimate plan to defeat Isis would be some parts of his still-unspecified plan, and some parts of his unspecified generals\u2019 unspecified plan. He waved away his lack of specifics for a war in which 5,000 US troops are currently serving as not wishing to \u201cbroadcast\u201d his plans to the enemy.</p> <p>He interrupted a veteran\u2019s question about veterans\u2019 suicide rates after she gave the correct number, <a href=\"http://www.militarytimes.com/story/veterans/2016/07/07/va-suicide-20-daily-research/86788332/\">20 per day</a>, so he could give an incorrect one, 22. Trump fumbled through a question about redressing sexual assault against female service members \u2013 something he once tweeted was the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/331907383771148288\">inevitable result of mixed service</a>, a point he defended on Wednesday \u2013 by arguing the military needed to set up internal courts, as if the military does not already have its own well-established justice system.<br></p> <p>Trump\u2019s reversion to his typical ignorance and certitude obscured a poor showing from his opponent. Hillary Clinton spent her preceding half-hour grilling defending herself on her lax handling of classified information, a situation that a former Navy lieutenant in the audience correctly observed would spell doom for a low-ranking service member.</p> <p>She acknowledged her vote for the Iraq war was a \u201cmistake\u201d and gestured in the direction of the same for her advocacy of the 2011 Libya war, but waved it away by pointing out Trump\u2019s support for the same disastrous interventions, a baffling decision for a candidate whose central pitch is that Trump is uniquely unqualified to be president.</p> <p>To reassure a progressive veteran in the audience Clinton offered that she would treat the use of force as a \u201clast resort\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWe are not putting ground troops into Iraq ever again,\u201d Clinton said, as if there were not this minute thousands of them there.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57d0d178e4b042bbfb3246c8\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-08T02:53:24.444Z\">3.53am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Colin Powell's advice to Clinton on using personal email</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Although it didn\u2019t directly come up in the forum on Wednesday evening, this is intriguing reading: a 2009 email exchange between Hillary Clinton and former secretary of state Colin Powell in which she asks for \u2013 and he gives \u2013 advice on using her Blackberry in the state department.</p> <p>The full exchange is <a href=\"https://medium.com/oversightdems/cummings-releases-full-powell-email-advising-clinton-on-personal-email-use-65904c1ccfa#.lo7sv941t\">here</a>, released by Deomcratic Rep. Elijah Cummings via the House oversight committee, but here\u2019s a snippet of Powell\u2019s email:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p> I didn\u2019t have a BlackBerry. What I did do was have a personal computer that was hooked up to a private phone line (sounds ancient.) So I could communicate with a wide range of friends directly without it going through the State Department servers. I even used it to do business with some foreign leaders and some of the senior folks in the Department on their personal email accounts. I did the same thing on the road in hotels.</p> <p>Now, the real issue had to do with PDAs, as we called them a few years ago before BlackBerry became a noun. And the issue was DS would not allow them into the secure spaces, especially up your way. When I asked why not they gave me all kinds of nonsense about how they gave out signals and could be read by spies, etc. Same reason they tried to keep mobile phones out of the suite. I had numerous meetings with them. We even opened one up for them to try to explain to me why it was more dangerous than say, a remote control for one of the many tvs in the suite. Or something embedded in my shoe heel. They never satisfied me and NSA/CIA wouldn\u2019t back off. So, we just went about our business and stopped asking. I had an ancient version of a PDA and used it. In general, the suite was so sealed that it is hard to get signals in or out wirelessly.</p> <p>However, there is a real danger. If it is public that you have a BlackBerry and it it government and you are using it, government or not, to do business, it may become an official record and subject to the law. Reading about the President\u2019s BB rules this morning, it sounds like it won\u2019t be as useful as it used to be. Be very careful. I got around it all by not saying much and not using systems that captured the data.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57d0ceace4b042bbfb3246be\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-08T02:42:22.336Z\">3.42am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>For those now wondering when we can watch the two candidates go head to head \u2013 on the same stage, at the same time, presumably answering something like the same questions \u2013 here\u2019s the schedule:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Monday 26 September, </strong>Hofstra University, Hempstead, NY.

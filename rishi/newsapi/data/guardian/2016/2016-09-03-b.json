  "<p>In the picturesque hamlet of Brachay, in scorching late summer heat, Marine Le Pen was preaching to the politically converted. \u201c<em>Marine, pr\u00e9sident</em>\u201d, they chanted. \u201c<em>On va gagner</em>\u201d (we\u2019re going to win). A banner stretching the length of one of the stone buildings overlooking the village square read: \u201cMarine: Save&#xa0;France.\u201d</p> <p>Le Pen\u2019s stump speech was the most closely watched and significant campaign launch of <em>la rentr\u00e9e</em>, the national return to work after the long summer holidays, and the leader of France\u2019s far-right Front National was welcomed like a conquering hero.</p> <p>Le Pen has been largely absent from the political scene for several weeks and has refrained from adding her 10 cents\u2019 worth to the raging polemic over the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/24/the-burkini-ban-what-it-really-means-when-we-criminalise-clothes\" title=\"\">burkini</a> and rows about security following deadly attacks by Islamic fundamentalists, both fertile ground for her party.</p> <p>In the meantime, the country\u2019s governing Socialists and centre-right opposition Les R\u00e9publicains have engaged in what one FN heavyweight described with schadenfreude as a \u201cbloodbath, left and right\u201d.</p> <p>The Parti Socialiste is bitterly split and in turmoil over whether Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, with his calamitous popularity ratings will, or indeed should, stand for a second term. The alternative, to stand down, would be unprecedented for a serving leader. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/30/frances-economy-minister-emmanuel-macron-resigns\" title=\"\">Emmanuel Macron</a>, the finance minister who resigned last week, might be the rabbit that the party pulls out of the hat, but he is disliked by the PS\u2019s leftwing, which is fielding its own candidates. In any case, Macron has not said whether he will even throw his hat into the presidential ring.</p> <p>On the right, things are scarcely more harmonious. The deadline for Les R\u00e9publicains candidates is Friday, and already former president Nicolas Sarkozy, mayor of Bordeaux Alain Jupp\u00e9 and former prime minister Fran\u00e7ois Fillon have either announced they are standing or are expected to do&#xa0;so.</p> <p>Amid this political free-for-all, Le Pen is trying to throw off the party\u2019s divisive reputation and market herself as a politician above and beyond the fray of the same-old-same-old French elite: a new, unifying, patriotic force who will break the shackles of Europe, end \u201cmass immigration\u201d and give France back to the French. Her slogan is <em>La France apais\u00e9e</em> \u2013 a soothed France.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d76a4ad832a38d58e63950a0dc85399f8bfdc6f3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d76a4ad832a38d58e63950a0dc85399f8bfdc6f3/90_0_2700_1620/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Woman in burkini and two friends in bikinis.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Le Pen kept out of the controversy over banning burkinis on French beaches.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>She was, she said grandly from a hastily constructed stage in Brachay\u2019s main square, speaking for \u201ca forgotten France, a France abandoned by the self-appointed elite who either don\u2019t see it or view it with a kind of condescension\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThey describe places like Brachay as <em>la France profonde</em> [deepest France]. I prefer to think of it as deeply patriotic France,\u201d she said to more cheers.</p> <p>\u201cThe presidential campaign that is opening is unlike any other. The coming eight months will decide the fate of our nation, not just for the five years to come, but much longer. Maybe even for ever.\u201d</p> <p>Brachay mayor G\u00e9rard Marchand had likened Le Pen\u2019s appeal for his villagers \u2013 all 61 of them \u2013 to the popularity of the Beatles and there was a similar element of hero worship.</p> <p>Even by the standards of rural France, Brachay is a backwater. The road to the pretty hamlet, 200 miles south-east of Paris in the newly created Alsace-Champagne-Ardenne-Lorraine region \u2013 renamed the Grand Est \u2013 a few kilometres from Colombey-les-deux-Eglises, where General Charles de Gaulle is buried, winds through gently rolling farmland for as far as the eye can see. Brachayens, as they call themselves, boosted by party supporters, some of whom had been bussed in, cheered and clapped wildly and waved the tricolor as Le Pen spoke and they jostled bad-temperedly with the media. Her speech was punctuated by cries of \u201cit\u2019s true\u201d, \u201cyou\u2019re right\u201d, \u201cthat\u2019s why we need you\u201d. Reporters on the other hand, seen as being party to a political elite hostile to the FN, were branded <em>collabos</em> (collaborators).</p> <p>One exchange between FN supporters and the <em>Observer</em> set the tone: \u201cWhat are you writing, is that Arabic?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, shorthand.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt looks like Arabic. Anyway, all journalists write lies and propaganda.\u201d</p> <p>Le Pen said she was happy to be among rural French people with real concerns in the real France, far from the salons and sophistication, what Le Pen calls the \u201cbrouhaha\u201d of Paris.</p> <p>These are people, the FN leader refers to almost poetically, as \u201cthe forgotten French\u201d. They may not remember the last time, if ever, they saw a migrant in their midst and nobody has ever turned up in Brachay wearing a burkini. The European Agricultural Fund for rural development allocated \u20ac202m for the period 2014-2020 to the region. But Le Pen pledges to wrest sovereignty back from Europe, like the \u201ccourageous British who, despite dire warnings, chose their destiny\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a49165287a369473e2240e4da7552f950f22f18d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a49165287a369473e2240e4da7552f950f22f18d/0_218_4560_2736/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Two Front National supporters wear T-shirts emblazoned with the first sentence of the French National anthem.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Two Front National supporters wear T-shirts emblazoned with the first sentence of the French National anthem.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Francois Nascimbeni/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Brachay may be small, but it perfectly encapsulates the FN\u2019s target audience and has become a totem in the party\u2019s campaign. In the first round of the last presidential election in 2012, Le Pen won her highest score, 72% of the votes \u2013 31 out of the 43 votes cast. Back then, the PS and the UMP, predecessor of Les R\u00e9publicains, failed to get a single Brachay vote.</p> <p>Marchand admitted there was very little crime in his village, and no foreigners, but there were cases of severe poverty \u201cmostly among those who work and who earn less than those who don\u2019t and get benefits\u201d, he said.</p> <p>If locals were angry with the press, it was because journalists had \u201ccome here, taken pictures of them washing their socks in the sink\u201d and assumed they were all know-nothing country bumpkins, he explained.</p> <p>Opinion polls suggest Le Pen could win 28-29% in the first round of the presidential election next year. It seems likely that, unless the PS can come up with a stronger candidate than Hollande, who is scraping the bottom of the popularity barrel, Le Pen will be up against a centre-right opposition candidate, most likely Jupp\u00e9 or Sarkozy in the second round.</p> <p>That Le Pen will be there seems hardly to be in doubt. All of the last 38 opinion polls carried out in France suggest she will be in the second round.</p> <p>J\u00e9r\u00f4me Fourquet, director of the opinion pollsters Ifop, said Le Pen\u2019s discretion after the summer terrorist attacks in Nice and near Rouen had played well with the public.</p> <p>\u201cShe hasn\u2019t needed to speak out because the news, from Brexit to the attacks and on to the row over the burkini \u2026 have worked in her favour. There was no point in her spoiling this momentum with even tougher proposals,\u201d Fourquet told <em>Les Echos</em> last week.</p> <p>In Brachay, like many other communities in <em>la France profonde</em>, Le Pen has already said more than enough to gain their unwavering support.</p>",

But after 20 years of investigating the couple, Bossie has once again been summoned to help bring down his old foe, Hillary Clinton, this time from the perch of a presidential campaign with no apparent limits.</p> <p>Donald Trump announced on Thursday that he hired Bossie as a deputy campaign manager during an<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2016/09/01/trump-enlists-veteran-operative-david-bossie-as-deputy-campaign-manager/\"> interview with the Washington Post</a>.

On the campaign trail, Hillary Clinton has vowed to overturn the decision and push for limits on the amount of money corporations and unions can spend on campaigns.</p> <p>The case, Citizens United v the Federal Election Commission, stemmed from a decision by the FEC to block the conservative advocacy group, from publishing an unfavorable documentary about Hillary Clinton in early 2008, when she was locked in a tough primary battle with Barack Obama. </p> <p>The supreme court case was only one iteration of a deeply antagonistic relationship between Hillary Clinton and Citizens United that dates to before her husband was president.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1997/11/13/a-firefighters-blazing-trail/b9beb874-fd7b-4dfe-b285-ffcd385501a2/?postshare=6751472783643926&amp;tid=ss_tw\">A 1997 Washington Post profile</a> of Bossie traces his first turn on the national stage to 1992, when a CBS documentary identified him as one of two men who had been harassing the parents and friends of a young woman who had killed herself some years before.

He was pushed to resign in 1998 amid criticism of his overzealous tactics. </p> <p>In the profile, published one year before his resignation, the Post compared Bossie to Roy Cohn, the bare-knuckled right-hand man for Senator Joe McCarthy who mentored Donald Trump. </p> <p>Before joining Trump\u2019s campaign, Bossie served as president of Citizens United and head of the Super Pac Defeat Crooked Hillary. He has taken a leave of absence from both organizations while he serves on Trump\u2019s campaign. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/26/steve-bannon-domestic-violence-trump-campaign-ceo\">Steve Bannon, Trump campaign CEO, faced domestic violence charges</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Bossie is among a slate of recent top-level hires that include Stephen Bannon, the former head of the conspiracy theory-laden website, Breitbart News, where <a href=\"http://www.breitbart.com/author/david-bossie/\">Bossie has occasionally been published</a>, and Kellyanne Conway, a Republican pollster and strategist. </p> <p>The triumvirate of new hires are close allies of shadowy hedge-fund billionaire Robert Mercer. According to Bloomberg, Mercer has invested heavily in Breitbart News and helped finance a documentary spin-off of Clinton Cash, a book written by conservative author Peter Schweizer. </p> <p>The addition of Bossie, in many ways the early architect of what Hillary Clinton would famously call the \u201cvast rightwing conspiracy\u201d, signals that the Trump campaign has no intention of leaving any Clinton controversy untouched. Trump has already shown a willingness to revive some of the most sensational \u2013 and some of the darkest \u2013 Clinton controversies, including Bill Clinton\u2019s marital infidelity and the 1993 suicide of Vincent Foster, a Clinton White House aide and a personal friend. </p> <p>On Thursday night, Clinton\u2019s campaign chairman, John Podesta, said the decision to hire Bossie is another example of how the Republican nominee has embraced the \u201crightwing fringe\u201d. </p> <p>\u201cDavid Bossie is so craven and maniacal that in the heyday of the overreaching, Gingrich-era Congress, the top Whitewater conspiracy theorist in the House had to fire him for doctoring evidence,\u201d Podesta said.</p>",

Cooper provided Hanley with an Apple MacBook laptop from the Clinton Foundation \u2013 the family organisation currently <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2016/aug/26/election-2016-clinton-foundation-trump-campaign-live\">embroiled in controversy</a> \u2013 and talked her through the process of transferring emails from Clinton\u2019s private server to the laptop and a thumb drive.<br></p> <p>\u201cHanley completed this task from her personal residence,\u201d the notes record.

Clinton could not recall any briefing or training by state related to the retention of federal records or handling of classified information.\u201d</p> <p>Clinton was aware she was an original classification authority at the state department, but again \u201ccould not recall how often she used this authority or any training or guidance provided by state.

Clinton\u2019s answers either show she is completely incompetent or blatantly lied to the FBI or the public. </p> <p>\u201cEither way it\u2019s clear that, through her own actions, she has disqualified herself from the presidency.\u201d</p> <p>The Clinton campaign insisted that it was pleased the notes had been made public.

  "<p>Rudy Giuliani on Sunday defended Donald Trump\u2019s attacks on Bill and Hillary Clinton\u2019s marriage, saying \u201ceverybody\u201d has faced charges of infidelity. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/02/donald-trump-alicia-machado-republican-women-sexism\">The Republican women unfazed by Trump's sexism: 'I don\u2019t think it matters'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cIt\u2019s fair game,\u201d the top Trump adviser and former New York mayor said. </p> <p>On Saturday night, Trump told a rally in Pennsylvania that he doubted the constancy of the Clintons\u2019 marriage, saying: \u201cI don\u2019t even think she\u2019s loyal to Bill, you want to know the truth.\u201d</p> <p>He then asked the crowd: \u201cAnd, really, folks, really, why should she be, right?\u201d</p> <p>The baseless accusation, which Trump raised in the context of Bill Clinton\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/25/us/politics/gennifer-flowers-debate-trump-clinton.html\">admissions</a> of <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1998/08/18/us/testing-president-overview-clinton-admits-lewinsky-liaison-jury-tells-nation-it.html\">infidelities</a> in the 1990s, was defended by Giuliani. </p> <p>\u201cThat was a sarcastic remark pointing out that Bill Clinton has, you know, quite a past,\u201d Giuliani told CNN. \u201cAnd Hillary Clinton has done quite a job on attacking the people who were victims of Bill Clinton.\u201d</p> <p>Clinton stood with her husband in the 1990s through two scandals, during which the president eventually admitted to sexual liaisons with Gennifer Flowers, a former model, and Monica Lewinsky, a White House intern. The then first lady called Lewinsky a \u201c<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/21/us/politics/90s-scandals-threaten-to-erode-hillary-clintons-strength-with-women.html\">narcissistic loony toon</a>\u201d, according to a friend, Diane Blair, whose diaries were released after her death in 2000. Clinton <a href=\"http://nypost.com/2014/02/10/hillary-clinton-monica-lewinsky-is-a-narcissistic-loony-toon/\">also refused to excuse the \u201chuge personal lapse\u201d</a> by her husband, Blair wrote.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s fair game,\u201d Giuliani insisted, accusing Clinton of \u201cposing as a feminist\u201d, although he did not dispute that there are no grounds for Trump\u2019s aspersion about the Clinton\u2019s marriage. Trump, he said, had in fact been talking about donations by Middle East regimes to the Clinton family charity. </p> <p>In his speech on Saturday night, Trump said: \u201cClinton has collected millions of dollars from the same global corporations shipping your jobs and your dreams to other countries.\u201d He did not, however, mention the Clinton Foundation in context of the Clinton marriage.</p> <p>Giuliani was also forced to defend one of his own remarks. After the first presidential debate on Monday, after which Trump praised himself for not having broached the topic of the Clintons\u2019 marriage, <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/27/politics/rudy-giuliani-hillary-clinton-donald-trump-monica-lewinsky/\">Giuliani said</a>: \u201cIf you didn\u2019t know the moment Monica Lewinsky said Bill Clinton violated her and was telling the truth \u2013 then you\u2019re too stupid to be president.\u201d</p> <p>On Sunday, NBC host Chuck Todd pressed Giuliani, who in 2000 announced he was <a href=\"http://nymag.com/news/features/scandals/rudy-giuliani-2012-4/\">leaving his second wife for his future third wife</a> in a press conference, without having told his current spouse in advance. Todd said: \u201cYou have your own infidelity charge.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, everybody does,\u201d Giuliani replied. \u201cAnd I\u2019m a Roman Catholic, and I confess those things to my priest. But I\u2019ve never, ever attacked someone who\u2019s been the victim.\u201d</p> <p>He added: \u201cI think your bringing up my personal life really is kind of irrelevant to what Hillary Clinton did. She\u2019s running for president; I\u2019m not.\u201d</p> <p>Giuliani also held that he was \u201cthe right person to level this charge, because I\u2019ve never made such a charge, and I\u2019ve prosecuted people who\u2019ve committed rape\u201d.</p> <p>Trump, whose own history includes three marriages and <a href=\"http://www.people.com/article/marla-maples-hopes-ivana-trump-can-forgive-her-postdonald-trump-affair-scandal\">tabloid sagas of infidelity</a>, has struggled <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/apr/14/fox-anchor-megyn-kelly-meets-donald-trump\">throughout his campaign</a> with references to his long history of<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/15/us/politics/donald-trump-women.html\"> crude behavior and </a><a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/15/us/politics/donald-trump-women.html\">objectifying</a><a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/15/us/politics/donald-trump-women.html\"> insults</a> directed at women. </p> <p>In the week after the first presidential debate, he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/27/alicia-machado-miss-universe-weight-shame-trump-speaks-out-clinton\">repeatedly insulted </a>a former Miss Universe winner, Alicia Machado, whom he called \u201cMiss Piggy\u201d in the 1990s.

Fifty-two per cent of female respondents said they would vote for Clinton, and 39% said they would vote for Trump.</p> <p>White people with college degrees have traditionally voted Republican over the last 60 years, but Trump <a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-may-become-the-first-republican-in-60-years-to-lose-white-college-graduates/\">stands poised to lose them</a>, in particularly white women with degrees.</p>",
  "<p>Financial markets are preparing for an uncertain final quarter of the year as traders fret about Theresa May\u2019s more concrete Brexit timetable, the health of European banks and the US presidential elections.</p> <p>The British prime minister suggested on Sunday that the country\u2019s exit from the EU would <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/02/brexit-theresa-may-prioritises-immigration-curbs-over-free-movement\">lean towards a \u201chard Brexit\u201d</a>, as she implied regaining control of immigration was more important than access to the single market. May earlier announced that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/01/theresa-may-to-propose-great-repeal-bill-to-unwind-eu-laws\">article 50 \u2013 the legal device to begin the process of departure \u2013 would be triggered by the end of March</a>.</p> <p>Some traders fear the prime minister\u2019s moves might lead to a swift fall in the value of pound, mirroring the markets\u2019 reaction immediately after the UK voted to leave the EU on June 23, when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jun/23/british-pound-given-boost-by-projected-remain-win-in-eu-referendum\">sterling slumped to a 31-year low</a>.</p> <p>One trader said that financial markets had not taken account of a \u201ctimetabled hard Brexit\u201d when markets closed on Friday evening, meaning the pound could \u201cgap lower\u201d on Monday.</p> <p>However, others argued that the triggering of article 50 in early 2017 was expected, but the debate about what that move would mean would create uncertainty. <br></p> <p>Joshua Raymond, a director at financial trading firm XTB, said he expected volatility in the value of the pound, with both sides of the Brexit argument using the media to sway public opinion to their side of the argument. He believes that the government had hedged its bets by also implying a soft Brexit.<br></p> <p>He said that the prime minister\u2019s indication that the UK would enact article 50 before the end of March could actually be supportive of the pound in the very short term \u201cbecause of the certainty it provides investors and businesses that the roadmap to Brexit has begun\u201d.</p> <p>He added: \u201cHowever, the main support could come from recent comments from both the prime minister and chancellor, who spoke out against the idea of a hard Brexit to end freedom of movement. That leaves the door open for positive conversations about remaining in the single market, which is the markets key area of concern\u201d.</p> <p>The wavering over what Brexit eventually means comes as traders also try to take stock of how prices might be affected by a host of geopolitical issues, such as the increasingly bitter US presidential election.</p> <p>Alastair Winter, the chief economist at the investment bank Daniel Stewart, wrote in a research note on Sunday: \u201cBarclays Bank\u2019s latest survey shows geopolitical developments to have become the biggest concern to investors. Moreover, concern over the developed market economies (i.e. democracies) continues to overshadow those over China and other emerging markets. This suggests rising fears that the \u2018sans culottes\u2019 with their pitchforks will yet storm the great citadels of the west.</p> <p>\u201cIn summary, the political fundamentals are bad enough but may not get much worse soon. Of course ... the economic fundamentals also look grim.\u201d</p> <p>The UK\u2019s FTSE 100 rose by 6% in the July-September quarter, its best performance since 2013, as the weaker pound pushed up the value of internationally focused blue-chip companies. Sterling, though, fell against the US dollar for the fifth quarter running \u2013 the worst run since 1984.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/02/article-50-timescale-theresa-may-brexit\">What will happen now timescale for article 50 has been revealed?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>James Stanley, a currency analyst at foreign exchange group DailyFX, also believes the fourth quarter will be challenging.</p> <p>\u201cThere are some very pertinent themes for markets as we enter the final quarter of 2016,\u201d he said, referring the US election and concerns about the health of European banks following last week\u2019s gyrations in the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/deutschebank\">Deutsche Bank</a> share price. The Deutsche sell-off followed reports that <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/29/commerzbank-job-cuts-restructuring\">hedge funds were pulling assets from the bank amid suggestions that Berlin may be forced into a bailout</a>.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Deutsche Bank\u2019s plight has prompted fears that global markets are facing turmoil of the kind triggered by the collapse of Lehman Brothers eight years ago this month. </p> <p>Stanley said: \u201cThe big worry here isn\u2019t just one bank getting hit. The bigger concern is a contagion effect; because banks trade with each other and if one major bank gets taken out, this can create a nasty cascade effect across markets as other banks get pinched by counterparty risk. </p> <p>\u201cSo going into Q4 this is the top theme for markets to watch because, frankly, it can have the most firepower. It\u2019s also going to be one of the most difficult to time and follow, as this is basically a liquid situation that will continue to morph and develop as there isn\u2019t a template-response for the European Central Bank to handle such situations.\u201d</p>",

I think she is, versus Trump, an evil person. I just want to see somebody finally get something done, and he will. I think he has a lot to learn, but I think that when he gets into office, he\u2019ll do what he says he\u2019s going to do, and maybe we need somebody like that, and not an extra politician who has been in politics all these years.\u201d</p> <p>Kathy Fossber, 66, a retired Medicare specialist, sat in the leafy back patio of a hip coffee shop called the Avant Garden, catching up with a friend who knitted throughout the conversation.</p> <p>\u201cClinton is bringing this up, but it happened many, many years ago. Why is she doing this? (...)

She\u2019s a registered Republican planning on voting for Trump. His comments about weight weren\u2019t wise, she said, but there are larger issues in the election to consider. </p> <p>\u201cI am an overweight, middle-aged woman. I could really care less about the (weight) comment,\u201d she said. She was more bothered by the fact Trump didn\u2019t seem to be reining in inappropriate comments as she\u2019d hoped he would as he became a more seasoned candidate. \u201cHe needs to control his mouth, that\u2019s what he needs to do,\u201d she said. \u201cTo be quite honest, I say things that are inappropriate sometimes too, like everyone else, but I try not to let them come out when I am the face of an organization, much less the face of the free world.\u201d <br><br>A presidency isn\u2019t just about one person, it\u2019s about the group of people that they bring with them, she said. </p> <p>On the campus of University of Alaska in Fairbanks, social work professor Kim Swisher, 43, a life-long moderate Republican, said she believes strongly in second amendment rights and noted that her mother campaigned for Nixon. But Trump\u2019s weight comments pushed her over the edge. </p> <p>\u201cThe weight thing concerns me,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m a professional woman, and I\u2019m a size 16. What his comments have done for me, they have affirmed that due to my size, I would be invalid in a world where Trump leads.\u201d</p> <p>She was particularly disappointed in the Republican party for not offering voters a better choice. \u201cThis is not the Republican party I have voted for in the past,\u201d she said. </p> <p>Peggy Treadway, 30, works at an employment agency in Anchorage. In the office on Friday, she described herself as an outdoorsy woman who fishes in the summer and rides snow mobiles in the winter. </p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve always voted Republican, always, but this year I don\u2019t really know,\u201d she said. Trump should never have brought up a woman\u2019s weight, she said. \u201cHonestly, it just adds to the pile of stones that makes me not really like him as much. It\u2019s another strike against him. I don\u2019t how many strikes it will take before I say enough is enough. I don\u2019t really like the alternative, though.\u201d</p> <p>Outside the Safeway grocery store in Wasilla on Friday, Lisa Smith, 43, an independent voter and mother of four foster children, said she\u2019d gained weight due to a medication she was taking after spending many years as a size four. And for that reason, Trump\u2019s comments felt especially cruel. </p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m considered obese. What is it, Miss Piggy, he called one of those contestants?\u201d she said.

His obligation is to make money for his enterprises and save money for his enterprises.

  "<p>Amid all <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/02/donald-trump-federal-income-tax-new-york-times\">the drama and hyberbole</a>, it slipped by almost without being noticed. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/02/donald-trump-federal-income-tax-new-york-times\">Trump responds to tax 'bombshell': 'I know complex laws better than anyone'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Early in the first presidential debate last Monday, Hillary Clinton said: \u201cI also want to see more companies do profit-sharing. If you help create the profits, you should be able to share in them, not just the executives at the top.\u201d</p> <p>This might have ended up as a throwaway line, but it\u2019s a key part of Clinton\u2019s emphasis on trying to create an economy that works for everyone. It also could end up as a key part of her appeal to voters, especially in light of the news flow of late.</p> <p>Exhibit one: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/01/wells-fargo-investigations-lawsuits-john-stumpf\">Wells Fargo</a>, which doesn\u2019t seem to think too highly of sharing the profits. Instead, as a torrent of recent news has shown, the bank has tended to demand that rank-and-file employees meet impossible sales targets or risk losing their jobs. </p> <p>As long as that worked, those top-tier managers walked away with lavish compensation packages; CEO John Stumpf made $19.5m last year. True, the bank now (finally) will claw much of that back, but none of the ordinary bankers, who took on most of the risk, shared any of the rewards.</p> <p>Exhibit two: Hamilton, the musical. When it shifted from New York\u2019s Public Theater to Broadway, <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2016-hamilton-broadway-profit/\">22 of its stars penned a letter to its lead producer</a>, Jeffrey Seller, aka the CEO of \u201cHamilton Inc\u201d. They wanted \u2013 and got \u2013 a share of the profits the show will earn: 1% of net profits plus a slightly smaller proportion of those from every future production, including the one that just opened in Chicago. </p> <p>Those actors invested their creative energy and took risks every night to make the show the slam dunk success it has been and Sellers recognized that with a share of the rewards. </p> <p> There are two reasons why profit-sharing plans (and variations on this theme) are creeping back into the public discussion. </p> <p> First, there\u2019s the big picture. Since the economy began to recover from the financial crisis and the recession, the lion\u2019s share of the gains have gone not to those who simply collected wages and salaries \u2013 which largely have seen very little change \u2013 but <a href=\"http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2013/10/11/5-Years-After-Crisis-Why-Income-Gap-Widening\">to those who owned financial assets</a>, such as stocks and bonds. If you had a big investment portfolio in 2009, and simply hung on to it, you probably have done very, very well in the last seven years or so: the Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s 500 index has risen 105%, while the Nasdaq Composite Index has soared 150%. </p> <p> No prizes for guessing which part of the population is most likely to own investment portfolios.</p> <p> Secondly, as the wealth gap has grown, the gap between average CEO compensation and average worker salary has widened. Behavioral economists say that, unsurprisingly, this takes a toll on employee morale and can even dent productivity. Not surprisingly, headlines about CEOs receiving lavish paychecks and other perks when their employees struggle to eke out a living don\u2019t make for great corporate PR. </p> <p> Profit-sharing plans \u2013 which mark their centenary this year \u2013 can help address both of these problems. In many key respects, today\u2019s plans don\u2019t differ too much from the first deferred profit-sharing plan, established by the Harris Trust in 1916. Generally, they are <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.ebri.org/pdf/publications/books/fundamentals/fund06.pdf\">structured like a defined contribution retirement plan</a> but with the only contributions being made by the company. The business can set up a cash plan or a deferred plan, with payments being made immediately to the employee, or coming when they retire, leave the company, die or are disabled. Those payments can consist of cash or stock. </p> <p> Clinton\u2019s idea is to give those companies that adopt such a plan <a href=\"http://time.com/3961204/hillary-clinton-corporate-profit-sharing/\">a two-year tax credit</a> that is equivalent to 15% of the profit-sharing distributions. Meanwhile, an employee could receive only a sum equal to 10% of his annual salary or wages in profit-sharing, and as his income rose, it would diminish and eventually disappear. </p> <p>Some existing profit-sharing plans that companies put in place end up rewarding senior executives even more lavishly than rank-and-file employees. Clinton\u2019s goal is to direct the benefits to the lower-income and middle-income workers, or at least to restrict the tax incentives to companies that follow this track. </p> <p> Several companies have announced big profit-sharing payouts this year, demonstrating that this can offer a big boost to employees bottom lines. Delta Air Lines, after reporting a record $4.5bn in profits last year, paid its now retired CEO, Richard Anderson, $15.8m in compensation for 2015. While employees didn\u2019t earn anything like that, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.seattletimes.com/business/boeing-aerospace/delta-pays-53m-to-local-employees/\">they did collect $1.5bn in profit-sharing payments</a>, which averaged almost 21% of their base pay. Some Seattle-area workers pocketed checks for $18,000 (before taxes). </p> <p> It was also a great year for the auto industry, with nearly 53,000 unionized Ford workers collecting $9,300 apiece, and General Motors paying out a record $11,000 to its hourly workers in profit-sharing, thanks to strong sales of SUVs and trucks. </p> <p> It\u2019s entirely reasonable to wonder what would happen to existing profit-sharing plans like these, and how they would coexist with ones that companies would create if Clinton were elected and implemented her proposed tax incentive for the very specific kind of plans she has in mind.</p> <p> More seriously, there\u2019s the question of <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-trouble-with-hillary-clintons-profit-sharing-plan/2015/07/22/db9eab02-3084-11e5-8353-1215475949f4_story.html?utm_term=.c01b0eff3600\">what might happen</a> if companies try to use profit-sharing plans as a way to give employees de facto higher wages, without actually raising their base pay, and qualify for a tax break in the process. That said, there are few allegations on the part of profit-sharing beneficiaries today that they are being fobbed off with a benefit in lieu of a wage hike, and it\u2019s reasonable to suppose that a new Clinton administration would be looking hard for that kind of abuse.</p> <p> If there is to be any hope of salvaging some kind of capitalism from the ravages of the greedy 1980s and 1990s; the havoc wreaked by the increasing financialization of the last few decades; and the actions of CEOs from the likes of <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/02/business/dealbook/dennis-kozlowskis-path-from-infamy-to-obscurity.html\">Tyco\u2019s Dennis Kozlowski</a> and Enron\u2019s Jeff Skilling to Stumpf of Wells Fargo, it lies in ideas like profit-sharing.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/01/wells-fargo-investigations-lawsuits-john-stumpf\">Wells Fargo problems far from over as investigations and lawsuits expand</a> </p> </aside>  <p> It\u2019s not a perfect concept, but it can help to get managers and ordinary employees thinking and acting as if they are part of the same team \u2013 because they will be. At least the incentives will be on the right side of the scale.</p> <p>Hamdi Ulukaya, the CEO of Chobani, the yogurt company, earlier this year handed out Chobani shares to all his current employees. These <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-on-leadership-chobani-20160430-story.html\">could be worth as much as 10% of his company</a> if the business goes public or is sold, converting to either cash or stock as long as the company continues to hit certain performance metrics. </p> <p>There are plenty of incentives for employees to ensure the company thrives. If it does, some of them could end up millionaires, in exchange for having had confidence in Ulukaya\u2019s ability to get his startup business off the ground in a very competitive industry. </p> <p>Regardless of who wins the election and whetherwe end up with a tax policy prompting the creation of corporate profit-sharing plans, one thing is certain: the corporate world needs fewer John Stumpfs, and more Hamdi Ulukayas.</p>",

Unfortunately, I could not tell you what is being discussed; Trump\u2019s policies make more sense to me than the ins and outs of imaginary leagues. And it turns out, though, you can\u2019t even escape the nightmare of politics with the fantasy of football this year. Clinton is <a href=\"http://awfulannouncing.com/2016/hillary-clinton-runs-espn-ad-mocking-trump-as-fantasy-football-player.html\">running ads on fantasy football websites</a>, describing Trump as \u201clike that guy in your fantasy league who talks trash all week and forgets to set his lineup\u201d.</p> <h2><strong>The weather</strong></h2> <p>Ah, autumn. The leaves are changing colour, the air is crisp and the carbon dioxide is abundant. Environmental scientists recently <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/sep/28/the-world-passes-400ppm-carbon-dioxide-threshold-permanently\">announced</a> that climate change has reached the \u201cpoint of no return\u201d, with the levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere permanently passing the 400-parts-per-million threshold. Some people will tell you that this is a very real disaster of our own making. <a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/environment/2016/09/china-climate-change\">Others will tell you</a> that the concept of global warming was a conspiracy created by the Chinese to make US manufacturing non-competitive. Other people will post angry messages on social media asking: \u201cWhy doesn\u2019t everyone who is worked up about Harambe start getting worked up about climate change, which really matters!\u201d People have always enjoyed talking about the weather; it used to be a safe topic of conversation. Alas, this is no longer the case. Now if you tell someone \u201cGosh, it\u2019s got cold recently\u201d, there is a good chance they will reply with their unsolicited opinion on global warming. Which will lead you back to politics. Which will lead you back to the elections. There is really no escaping it, after all.</p>",
  "<p>In the 21st century, Saturday Night Live has lived or died by its presidential election coverage. For all the flak that the show receives for not living up to its \u201cglory days\u201d \u2013 and those glory days generally happen to line up with the speaker\u2019s teenage years \u2013 it redeems itself in the cultural landscape with presidential debate sketches that hit the mark and justify its existence.</p> <p>So it\u2019s understandable that the show\u2019s writers tilted so heavily in favor of election comedy for this season\u2019s premiere on Saturday. The opening sketch was, as is now de rigueur, a take on the first presidential debate. Recent Emmy-winner (and Ghostbusters scene-stealer) Kate McKinnon of course returned as an ecstatic Hillary Clinton, a shimmying, wide-eyed, over-prepared debater who can\u2019t believe how easy it all is.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.facebook.com/snl/videos/10154512969416303\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"400\" height=\"224\" src=\"https://www.facebook.com/video/embed?video_id=10154512969416303\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/snl/videos/10154512969416303/\">Donald Trump v Hillary Clinton debate</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Facing her was the show\u2019s latest take on Donald Trump, long-time SNL favorite Alec Baldwin, who had been teased earlier this week. </p> <p>Baldwin\u2019s Trump was technically flawless \u2013 the hair and make-up, the sneer, the bravado \u2013 but it felt somehow lifeless, as if the writers couldn\u2019t imagine, or get away with, a more over-the-top caricature than the man himself. (Baldwin is pegged to play Trump for the entire season, <a href=\"http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/alec-baldwin-snl-new-donald-trump-933435\">according to The Hollywood Reporter</a>.

Game show sketches are almost always lazy excuses for a string of impressions, and that was as true as ever, with Larry David reprising his Bernie Sanders impression while Robbie took on Ivanka Trump and Cecily Strong premiered an irritating take on next week\u2019s host, Lin Manuel-Miranda. The sketch\u2019s strongest gag was Chris Christie\u2019s inability to stop making bridge references; it ended with a non-joke about Jill Stein that implied that, perhaps more than ever, the SNL writers are taking a firm stand in who their viewers should (and shouldn\u2019t) vote for.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"df36d266811ab08c62a40d493cbf192701c1b5d8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/df36d266811ab08c62a40d493cbf192701c1b5d8/0_41_3000_1801/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Musical guest The Weeknd, host Margot Robbie, and Kenan Thompson on Saturday Night Live.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Musical guest The Weeknd, host Margot Robbie, and Kenan Thompson on Saturday Night Live.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: NBC/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Weekend Update, once a highlight of every episode, has not quite returned to its full-strength Seth Meyers days, but co-hosts Michael Che and Colin Jost are finally finding a groove. Their focus, of course, was on the recent debate and the upcoming election, but they eventually expanded to include <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/12/colin-kaepernick-anthem-protest-monday-night-football\">Colin Kaepernick\u2019s national anthem protest</a> in a bit that showcased their growing camaraderie.</p> <p>The last half-hour took some delightfully quirky turns. The show debuted Melania Moments, inane musings from Trump\u2019s wife that mirrored the show\u2019s classic Deep Thoughts by Jack Handey. It also had fun with a take on a \u201cwomen in film\u201d panel, which seemed to be taking advantage of its strong female cast but ended up being a showcase for McKinnon\u2019s delightful weirdness. She made the loosely structured sketch entirely worthwhile; any scene that allows a bewigged, bespectacled McKinnon to conclude with a phrase like \u201cthe little baboon ran off with my broaches\u201d is always welcome.</p> <p>And in its final moments, the show went meta, with Pete Davidson stepping into the lead role in a Mr Robot sketch to address cast member Leslie Jones\u2019 real-life hacking scandal. It was a cleverly done, if joke-light, sketch, and it ended the premiere in a genially amusing manner. Between Baldwin\u2019s Trump and Robbie as host, SNL certainly looks the part of a glamorous television show; now it needs to work more on the substance that once made it the go-to for political satire.</p>",
  "<p>How do voters select a candidate when no one they like is on the ballot?</p> <p>Behavioral scientists have studied decision-making \u2013 including voting \u2013 for decades. However, researchers usually give respondents at least one appealing option to choose from.</p> <p>This led us to wonder: what do voters do when they consider all of the options bad? Do they fall back on party affiliation, or simply toss a coin? This question is especially appropriate in the current presidential election because the two frontrunners have the <a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/americans-distaste-for-both-trump-and-clinton-is-record-breaking/\">lowest favorability ratings</a> ever.</p> <p>When we did research to answer this question, we learned that in situations where all of the choices are bad, people tend to vote by rejecting the choices they didn\u2019t like, rather than by affirmatively choosing the one they disliked least.</p> <p>Imagine there are two undesirable candidates named Tilly and Ron. Given this \u201ctwo bad choices\u201d option, voters will be more likely to select Tilly because they reject Ron, rather than select Tilly proactively.</p> <p>While the end result may be the same, the thought process that leads to this decision is quite different.</p> <p>As behavioral scientists who study how people make decisions, we think this distinction could affect the upcoming presidential election. If people select between Clinton and Trump by using rejection rather than choice, then the information they use to make their decisions will be different.</p> <p>In some ways, it may be better. Voters using rejection are more deliberate. They are less likely to be swayed by unimportant information about a candidate that they read or hear on radio, television or Facebook. They may pay less attention to rumors. In fact, conscientious voters may be well served to actively adopt a rejection strategy for their vote in order to make a choice more deliberately.</p> <p>In a study we ran online in April, we showed people only Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump as the two candidates for president. Those who found at least one of them attractive were more likely to select by choice, while those who disliked both were more likely to select by rejection.</p> <p>Having determined that people use rejection strategies to make their voting decisions in bad-option situations, we next wanted to test how rejection strategies would change the information people focus on.</p> <p>In nine separate studies we conducted, some of which will be published in an upcoming <a href=\"http://www.aradhnakrishna.com/uploads/4/7/8/8/4788965/how_choosing_versus_rejecting_alternatives_affects_information_processing.pdf\">Journal of Consumer Research</a>, we found that when people use rejection strategies, they also become more deliberate in their decision-making. In other words, they pay more attention to all information they have \u2013 both good and bad \u2013 and don\u2019t get swayed as much by one piece of information that sticks out.</p> <p>In our research, we saw more deliberation in rejection decisions and less of a tendency to be swayed by emotional, in-your-face information.</p> <p>For example, one of these studies determined that people were less likely to vote based on party affiliation if they voted by rejection, rather than by choice. Respondents also took less time to make their decision in the choice condition versus the rejection condition.</p> <p>We reached these results by revisiting a classic study known as the \u201cAsian disease problem\u201d.</p> <p>The Asian disease problem was first proposed by the behavioral economists <a href=\"http://www.jstor.org/stable/1685855?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents\">Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky in 1981</a>. It is well-studied because of the contradictory choices people make, and is one of the many conundrums that Kahneman proposed which later won him the Nobel prize.</p> <p>In the standard formulation of the Asian disease problem, people choose between two programs to combat an unusual Asian disease: program A, which offers certainty; and program B, which involves a risk.</p> <p>The original research showed that people change their preferences between the two programs depending on how the options are described.</p> <p>People tend to select the more certain program A if it is framed as a gain. Specifically, 72% of respondents preferred (A) \u201c200 people are saved out of 600\u201d while 28% picked the riskier (B) \u201c1/3 probability that 600 people are saved and 2/3 probability that no one is saved\u201d.</p> <p>That may seem rational. However, change the wording and the results also change \u2013 even though the theoretical loss of life remains the same.</p> <p>Program A was preferred by only 22% of the recipients when researchers framed the choice like this: (A) \u201c400 people will die out of 600\u201d versus (B) \u201c2/3 probability that 600 people will die and a 1/3 probability that no one will die\u201d. With this wording, 78% choose the riskier option. This is because people tend to focus on emotionally salient information like \u201csave\u201d and \u201cdie.\u201d</p> <p>Our new research revisits this classic problem to study what would happen if the respondents were choosing which program to reject instead of which one to choose. Would people be swayed less by the attention-grabbing words like \u201csave\u201d and \u201cdie\u201d?</p> <p>When we asked respondents which program would you reject, respondents\u2019 selections were affected less by the use of the emotional words. Program A was selected by 48% in the first pair and 43% selected it in the second. In other words, the decision between program A and program B was similar, whether \u201csave\u201d or \u201cdie\u201d was used to describe the programs.</p> <p>The study results indicate that wild in-your-face claims made by candidates will get less weight if people use rejection strategies to vote.</p> <p>Princeton psychology scholar Eldar Shafir <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.3758/BF03197186\">has also found</a> that rejection makes people focus on negative attributes. Perhaps the candidates\u2019 campaign managers know this already and that is why the negativity in this election has been so high. But, the point to remember is that this cannot be a shallow negative attribute like sounding bossy or having a spray-tanning habit. People voting by rejection will be more deliberate \u2013 and will look carefully at what makes a candidate bad. Emotional claims will not work. Voters will think carefully about why they want to reject one of the candidates.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 2 October to fix a grammatical error in the headline.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Counter\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://counter.theconversation.edu.au/content/65034/count.gif&quot; alt=&quot;The Conversation&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>",

But the uniquely polarising candidacy of Trump has raised the prospect that, with important faultlines such as age, gender, geography and race <a href=\"http://ropercenter.cornell.edu/polls/us-elections/how-groups-voted/how-groups-voted-2012/\">relatively settled from election to election</a>, socioeconomic class could swing the presidency in 2016.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4d2e9b3907d67f1653a1219f9f74a60f868acbf7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4d2e9b3907d67f1653a1219f9f74a60f868acbf7/0_221_4032_2419/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Allen Crawford and Pam Rutherford.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Allen Crawford and Pam Rutherford.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Smith/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>One marker is education. In 1992, Republican voters were much better educated than their Democratic counterparts, <a href=\"http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/09/15/educational-divide-in-vote-preferences-on-track-to-be-wider-than-in-recent-elections/\">according to the Pew Research Center</a>. Today registered voters with a college degree favour Clinton by 23 percentage points, while those without a college degree prefer Trump by five. This trend cuts across demographic groups, although it is most pronounced among whites. <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/09/trump_clinton_is_defined_by_an_educational_gap_among_white_voters.html\">The Slate website noted:</a> \u201cThe educational split among white voters is the defining characteristic of this election.\u201d If this holds in November, it will be the widest educational divide at the ballot box for several decades. </p> <p>Another marker is cultural and about optics. When Clinton recently referred to half of Trump\u2019s supporters as a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/10/hillary-clinton-trump-supporters--bigoted-deplorables\">\u201cbasket of deplorables\u201d</a>, critics also seized on the context: she was addressing millionaires at a fundraiser headlined by the singer Barbra Streisand at the New York restaurant Cipriani Wall Street. And her backers include those other temples of coastal privilege, Hollywood and Silicon Valley.</p> <p>Trump, by contrast, was anointed the \u201cblue-collar billionaire\u201d at the Republican national convention, where Willie Robertson of the TV reality show Duck Dynasty, wearing stars and stripes bandanna and bushy beard, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/07/18/duck-dynasty-star-willie-robertson-might-have-a-point-about-the-media/\">declared that media pundits</a> \u201cdon\u2019t hang out with regular folks like us, who like to hunt and fish and pray and actually work for a living. Heck, I don\u2019t even know that they know how to talk to people from middle America. I mean, when I tell \u2019em I\u2019m from Louisiana, they really start talking real slow and real loud.\u201d</p> <p>In Boonsboro, a town of 3,400 people steeped in revolutionary and civil war history, a giant Trump sign has been spraypainted with the word \u201clove\u201d. Opposite a Subway restaurant and closed-down bakery, the <a href=\"http://www.ttpbooks.com/\">Turn the Page Bookstore</a>, owned by the romance novelist Nora Roberts, sells soy candles, handmade soaps and organic coffee. Its employees make little secret of their allegiance to Clinton. Two doors away, at Crawfords Restaurant, Guns &amp; Ammo, a handwritten sign behind the laminated counter warns \u201cNo free refills on drinks\u201d and the staff are for Trump.</p> <p>As a reality show about hunting in the woods played on the TV, Rutherford, who is cashier, dishwasher, shelf stacker and much else, said of Clinton\u2019s supporters: \u201cI don\u2019t think they realise the importance of small-town America and they don\u2019t see the value of it. Everybody in this community loves this little store but big companies make it harder and harder for us.</p> <p>\u201cPeople say, \u2018You must be doing well with Obamacare\u2019. I say, actually, unless you have an astronomical salary or a company to pay for it, it\u2019s crippling. Our health insurance is $900 per month for the family; that\u2019s why I work.

But she moved to Boonsboro in 2002, where the family keeps horses, dogs and chickens on 30 acres of land and hunts 80% of their own food. Her daughters, aged 13, 14, 15 and 16, \u201call hunt and play volleyball\u201d.</p> <p>Displaying a phone picture of herself with a deer she bagged, Rutherford said: \u201cA lot of my friends don\u2019t agree with what I do but they don\u2019t have trouble wearing a full-length coyote coat to a fundraiser in January. They will wear leather shoes and carry an alligator handbag. The people of Washington don\u2019t want to go out to the rural areas; no one wants to go out of their comfort zone. But I would love to go to a Clinton rally just to eavesdrop and hear the interaction.\u201d</p> <p>Along the street, at Marly\u2019s Laundry, Wayne Stonesifer was waiting patiently as his clothes spun in a tumble dryer.

If you try to interrupt me when I\u2019m hunting, that\u2019s different.\u201d</p> <p>The country has a bigger divide now than ever, he added. \u201cYou\u2019ve got your gay rights, abortion laws, racism.

Times are getting nearer.\u201d</p> <p>Kevin Dobereiner, 36, owns two small businesses and complains that taxes are too high. He is also supporting Trump. \u201cHe\u2019s not a liberal and we\u2019re $20 trillion in debt and unemployment is too high and our healthcare is terrible. The community organiser-in-chief has no qualifications and Hillary Clinton is just an extension of that.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t care what Trump says; I care what he does and he\u2019s not a billionaire because he\u2019s stupid. I like a guy who puts his foot in his mouth because at least he tells the truth.\u201d</p> <p>Trump\u2019s plain speaking has been identified as one of the sources of his appeal to voters angry at the status quo in general and Republican establishment in particular. Even his outlandish gaffes are said to humanise him, emphasising his status as outsider and non-politician. His anti-Mexican and anti-Muslim diatribes have disgusted liberals and been cheered at raucous rallies, where he declares his love for \u201cthe poorly educated\u201d.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/experts/john-hudak/\">John Hudak</a>, a senior fellow in governance studies at the Brookings Institution thinktank in Washington, said: \u201cI think supporters look at Donald Trump and see a bit of an everyman, even though his biography completely opposes that worldview. Then they look at Hillary Clinton and see her as more elite than her background would actually suggest. Trump is the person you want to see on TLC; Clinton appears to live the way an average wealthy person lives.\u201d</p> <p>There is a crucial gender dimension, Hudak argues. \u201cA female candidate would not be allowed to ramble like Trump does or Bill Clinton did. Only in a race between a man and a woman could her polish be a liability and his freewheeling be an asset.\u201d</p> <p>Trump has scrambled the orthodoxy of class, for example by tweeting a picture of himself eating McDonald\u2019s fast food and drinking Coke on his luxurious private jet. He loves both boxing and golf. He has named Orson Welles\u2019s masterpiece Citizen Kane as his favourite film but also <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1997/05/19/trump-solo\">once told the New Yorker</a> that Bloodsport, a violent action flick starring Jean Claude Van Damme, is \u201can incredible, fantastic movie\u201d. The music at his rallies ranges from Nessun dorma, an aria from Giacomo Puccini\u2019s opera Turandot, to Elton John. His properties are crammed with chandeliers, gold leaf, mirrors and marble \u2013 tacky to some, aspirational to others. Both patrician and plebeian, his reading list is said to consist mainly of articles about himself.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"de463ffc89e6f9af955206d01524e1d9cb6c49bf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/de463ffc89e6f9af955206d01524e1d9cb6c49bf/0_153_2624_1575/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bloodsport, starring Jean Claude Van Damme\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bloodsport, starring Jean Claude Van Damme \u2026 right up there with Citizen Kane, according to Trump.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Everett Collection / Rex Feature</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Some would say he lacks class, in every sense. And there is a tenacious myth that, free of the ossified layers of agricultural and industrial Europe, America is a class-free land of opportunity, where someone born into poverty can become president. It is not so simple, according to sociologists. Arlie Hochschild of the University of California, Berkeley, and author of Strangers in Their Own Land: Anger and Mourning on the American Right, said: \u201cClass is profoundly important, imprinting all aspects of childhood, self, character and behind, and the denial of it is in the service of keeping alive the hope of lifting out of it. But America would be far better off talking about the realities of it.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.robert-h-frank.com/\">Robert H Frank</a>, a professor of economics at Cornell University and author of Success and Luck: Good Fortune and the Myth of Meritocracy, added: \u201cPeople here, if you ask them, will say they are \u2018middle class\u2019. Even relatively rich people will answer middle class because we deny there\u2019s such a thing as class here, which is of course preposterous. The barriers are different from England but they\u2019re real.\u201d<br></p> <p>Research suggests that Trump\u2019s core support should not be simply characterised as the white working class. Many earn an average of $70,000 but are caught in the downdraft of deindustrialisation, losing jobs to factory or mine closures, lacking the skills for a digital economy, anxious that their children will be worse off than they were. Joe Sims, a member of the national board of the <a href=\"http://www.cpusa.org/\">Communist Party USA</a>, said: \u201cMy sense is that Trump\u2019s support comes not so much from the white working class but the lower middle class and small business people who have been pushed into the ranks of the working class. The wages are flat and they\u2019re pissed off.\u201d</p> <p>But in a supposedly classless society, there is often a gap between perception and reality. Sims added: \u201cDuring the 1950s and 1960s there was a myth propagated about the American dream and the American way of life and the sense that everyone was middle class and upwardly mobile. Certainly during that period there was at least a steadiness in increase in income and their children were able to do a little better than them. But this idea of everyone being middle class has crashed on the rocks of reality. Wages have been stagnant since the 1970s.\u201d</p> <p>Numerous academic studies have found that the extent of social mobility was probably always exaggerated and, in the past generation, may have become deteriorated. The <a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/2015/06/16/why-college-costs-are-so-high-and-rising.html\">soaring cost of studying at university</a> has been blamed for stifling upward movement and allowing middle-class families to entrench their advantage. Pew\u2019s research, published last week, found a growing ideological divide, with highly educated adults holding increasingly liberal attitudes, while under a third of the less educated held liberal views.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.gqrr.com/stanley-b-greenberg\">Stanley Greenberg</a>, a veteran political consultant and senior pollster for Bill Clinton, said: \u201cI think we\u2019ll see the biggest divide between working-class voters and those with a college degree in this election. It\u2019s already there in the polls. Trump is reinforcing it by the nature of the campaign he\u2019s running and the issues he\u2019s running on. He\u2019s driving away college graduates as well as the whole Republican party.\u201d</p> <p>In the Republican primaries, Trump the class warrior made Ted Cruz, the conservative Christian ideologue, look quaint. Greenberg admits that he was surprised. \u201cThe college-educated Republicans keep moving year after year more to the Democrats but this election has really accelerated it because it\u2019s the first time we\u2019ve had a candidate running on a straight working-class campaign. [George W] Bush was very much centred on faith; that\u2019s legitimate but it wasn\u2019t an economic argument.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e5dc7a677059bc63c7fddeaebf61f57d116739e6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e5dc7a677059bc63c7fddeaebf61f57d116739e6/0_69_3000_1801/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bernie Sanders stressed income inequality in the primary campaign but Hillary Clinton has yet to emulate his success with the issue.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bernie Sanders stressed income inequality in the primary campaign but Hillary Clinton has yet to emulate his success with the issue.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Justin Sullivan/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>However, he warned against an oversimplified binary split, pointing to the success of Bernie Sanders, the senator from Vermont, in the Democratic primaries. Sanders stressed issues of economic inequality and access to college education, to the extent that he was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/03/bernie-sanders-failure-diversity-hispanic-black-voters\">criticised by some for neglecting race</a>.</p> <p>\u201cThere were a lot of Democrats who were voting for somebody who was a self-described socialist, running against big money, getting big money out of politics, going after Wall Street and big banks, attacking Hillary for being a creature of the big banks, so you need a third bucket,\u201d Greenberg said. \u201cThere are others who are not so focused on the racial and cultural issues who are quite ready to rally. Sanders, in the polls at least, was stronger than Hillary against Trump because he actually was winning both millennials and working-class voters.\u201d</p> <p>But now Sanders is out, there are two historically unpopular candidates and a fear of two classes, or tribes, or nations, mutually hostile and suspicious. Like the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum\">Brexit vote in Britain,</a> a painful rift has been exposed and polling day itself will not necessarily heal it. If diehard Clinton and Trump supporters sat down to dinner tonight, would they find much to talk about?</p> <p>In Chevy Chase, an affluent neighbourhood in north-west Washington DC, an area where deer roam audaciously in the gardens of multimillion-dollar houses, Trump fans are hard to find.

Trump is a regrettable example of the latter. He has no politics and caters to the worst part of the American psyche. He caters to people who don\u2019t know what fascism is.\u201d</p> <p>Asked his opinion of Trump\u2019s supporters, Avdoyan replied: \u201cThey\u2019re scared little people.\u201d</p> <p>And how would they regard him? \u201cI\u2019m gay.

Anderton said: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t want to talk to people who were Trump supporters. I wouldn\u2019t want to engage with them.\u201d </p> <p>Cohn responded: \u201cI would, even if they\u2019re \u2018deplorables\u2019. Bring them on. Those voting for Trump think it\u2019s two different countries and two different cultures. They see liberals and Democrats as alien life forms. I grew up in a rural environment and it\u2019s not like guns are totally alien to us. It\u2019s part of class, educational, geographical resentment: it\u2019s more their perception than my perception.\u201d</p> <p>America has been described as a split-screen nation and it is, of course, about much more than class: some polls show Trump <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/07/13/new-polls-in-pennsylvania-and-ohio-show-donald-trump-with-0-percent-of-the-black-vote/\">at 0% among African American voters</a>. But this is the year that a Republican, campaigning as an anti-intellectual vulgarian, won over many who feel neglected by what they view as the metropolitan intelligentsia.

  "<p>Donald Trump may have avoided paying federal income taxes in the US for up to 18 years after declaring a $916m (\u00a3706m) loss on his tax returns in the mid-1990s, according to reports. </p> <p>The Republican presidential candidate, who has throughout his campaign for the White House refused to release his tax returns, is said to have received the large tax benefit from business debts recorded in 1995. </p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/02/us/politics/donald-trump-taxes.html?hp&amp;action=click&amp;pgtype=Homepage&amp;clickSource=story-heading&amp;module=a-lede-package-region&amp;region=top-news&amp;WT.nav=top-news\">New York Times</a>, which claimed to have obtained Trump\u2019s tax return for that year, reported that tax experts hired to analyse the documents said US laws would have let Trump use the near-$1bn loss to cancel out an equivalent amount of taxable income until 2013. </p> <p>The Trump campaign said in response that the tax document was obtained illegally and that the New York Times was operating as \u201can extension\u201d of the presidential campaign of his Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton. </p> <p>The Times said that although Trump\u2019s taxable income in subsequent years is as yet unknown, a $916m loss in 1995 would have been large enough to wipe out more than $50m a year in taxable income over 18 years. </p> <p>Trump has declined to release his tax records, unlike previous presidential nominees in modern history, saying his taxes are under a federal audit. Experts say he could still release them publicly if he wished. <br></p> <p>\u201cMr Trump is a highly skilled businessman who has a fiduciary responsibility to his business, his family and his employees to pay no more tax than legally required,\u201d the Trump campaign statement said. </p> <p>\u201cThat being said, Mr Trump has paid hundreds of millions of dollars in property taxes, sales and excise taxes, real estate taxes, city taxes, state taxes, employee taxes and federal taxes, along with very substantial charitable contributions,\u201d it said. </p> <p>The revelations came as the Republican candidate attempted to reverse a week of negative headlines following his performance in the first of three debates with Clinton.

  "<p>No election has a global impact to match a US presidential contest. Few White House races have been more bitter than <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-elections-2016\" title=\"\">the current one</a> between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton. So any public official who intervenes in it, 11 days before polling, needs to be very sure what they are doing. Such interventions don\u2019t come bigger than the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/28/fbi-reopens-hillary-clinton-emails-investigation\" title=\"\">FBI director James Comey\u2019s announcement</a> that the bureau is reopening its probe of Mrs Clinton\u2019s private emails. The potential impact is huge. Until last Friday, Mrs Clinton was looking on course to hand Mr Trump a decisive beating. It may still happen. But that is now all up in the air.</p> <p>Mr Comey\u2019s defence appears to be that justice must be done and that he would be damned if he made the announcement and damned if he didn\u2019t. It is certainly true that US politics has become so polarised and so riddled with paranoia that the FBI director faced <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/29/fbi-guilty-political-act-crucial-moment\" title=\"\">an unenviable choice</a>. If he had carried out the new investigation behind closed doors and it had only become public after the election, whatever the result, one or both sides would be certain to cry foul. Conspiracy theorists would have had a field day. Yet by making it public now, he makes the investigation itself into a red-hot pre-election issue in a contest that will shape not just America but the world \u2013 and that\u2019s awful.</p> <p>This is precisely why the US Justice Department, with which the FBI works, has an established framework of rules designed to protect its impartiality from allegations of political bias. The department puts strict limits on disclosures about ongoing investigations and especially on anything that might be seen as influencing an election. A memorandum to this effect has been issued by a succession of US attorneys general every four years, including in 2016. Mr Comey has broken with this. Former Justice Department officials from both political parties have <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/james-comey-is-damaging-our-democracy/2016/10/29/894d0f5e-9e49-11e6-a0ed-ab0774c1eaa5_story.html?utm_term=.9ea156488389\" title=\"\">denounced him for this</a> over the weekend. The current attorney general is believed to have advised against it, too.</p> <p>Mr Comey has also compounded the potential abuse of power in two important ways. First, the investigation is at an embryonic stage. It may go no further. In his Friday announcement he spoke of emails \u201cthat appear to be pertinent\u201d to the previous investigation he completed \u2013 concluding then that there was no case to answer \u2013 in the summer. But the emails come from a separate investigation, may not even be from Mrs Clinton at all and the FBI chief has not read them. His phrasing was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/29/fury-fbi-director-cryptic-letter-clinton-emails-response\" title=\"\">extraordinarily vague</a>. Mr Comey has thus launched his missile with minimum facts and maximum innuendo. There are echoes of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/oct/13/operation-midland-report-due-met-police-alleged-vip-ring\" title=\"\">British police blunders</a> over child sex allegations. Even louder are the echoes of anti-Clinton fanatics like <a href=\"http://www.judicialwatch.org\" title=\"\">Judicial Watch</a>. This strikes at the democratic process, not just individuals.</p> <p>Second, Mr Comey should not have deferred to Congress, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/10/28/us/politics/fbi-letter.html?_r=0\" title=\"\">as he did last week</a>. The investigation and prosecution processes should be kept rigorously apart from politics. That\u2019s especially true at election time and even more necessary in such a polarised and acrimonious polity as the US Congress has become. One of the recipients of Mr Comey\u2019s report, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/house-republicans-are-already-preparing-for-years-of-investigations-of-clinton/2016/10/26/e153a714-9ac3-11e6-9980-50913d68eacb_story.html\" title=\"\">Jason Chaffetz</a>, announced even before the FBI director\u2019s move that he intends to begin oversight hearings into Mrs Clinton as soon as she is elected, if she is. Incredible though it may seem to the outside world and many Americans, impeachment efforts by Republicans against Mrs Clinton are already a serious possibility. Law enforcement officials have to be completely scrupulous in such a world. Mr Comey has not been. It is a step towards a lawless process.</p> <p>Mrs Clinton is in many respects the author of her own problems on the email row. But Mr Comey took exactly the wrong decision. If the emails needed investigation, he should have authorised one behind closed doors, carried it out thoroughly, reported it to prosecutors and made an announcement, if one was necessary, in the fullness of time. This is called due process and it is a bulwark of the rule of law, not rule by politicians \u2013 least of all rule by a potential tyrant like Mr Trump.</p> <p>Instead, Mr Comey has rocket-fuelled a venomous contest just when Mr Trump was desperate for a lifeline, just when Republican candidates in other races were craving something to energise their voters and just when some media were becoming bored with the predictability of the White House contest. His action was at best naive and at worst an abuse of office. It may, ultimately, have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/29/fbi-email-probe-election-clinton-presidency\" title=\"\">rather less effect on the election outcome</a> than some suppose. Yet it is no consolation that Mr Comey has also guaranteed that, if no charges are brought, he will inevitably be accused of rigging the outcome.</p>",

Choi has denied misappropriating some of the money for personal use.</p> <p>She is alleged to have secured her daughter a place at a prestigious university by forcing a change to the admission criteria \u2013 a claim that has provoked outrage in a country where students endure <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/jan/15/south-korea-students\">intense competition</a> to gain places at top schools.</p> <p>While prosecutors prepare to question Choi, who has never held public office and does not have security clearance, details emerged of her central role in Park\u2019s public and private lives.</p> <p>She is said to have become a close confidante of Park in the late 1970s, when Park was grieving over the assassination of her father, Park Chung-hee, a dictator who took power in a military coup in 1961 but who was credited with helping turn South Korea into an industrial powerhouse.</p> <p>Park Chung-hee was killed by his own chief of intelligence at the end of an alcohol-fuelled private dinner.</p> <p>Choi\u2019s father, Choi Tae-min, befriended Park after her mother, Yuk Young-soo, was killed by a North Korean spy with a bullet intended for her husband. The older Choi claimed that Yuk had appeared to him in a dream and asked him to help her traumatised daughter.</p> <p>Choi reportedly married six times, had numerous aliases and founded a shady pseudo-Christian cult called the Church of Eternal Life.</p> <p>Choi Soon-sil and Park grew closer still after the death of Choi\u2019s father in 1994, four years before Park was elected to the national assembly.</p> <p>Choi\u2019s ex-husband worked as a close aide to Park in the run-up to her successful presidential bid in 2012, and was allegedly with the president on the day of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/apr/16/rescuers-battle-to-save-476-passengers-after-ferry-sinks-off-south-korea\">Sewol ferry tragedy</a> in April 2014, in which 300 schoolchildren, teachers and crew drowned.</p> <p>At the weekend thousands of protesters accused Park of betraying public trust and of gross mismanagement, and one recent poll showed 70% of voters wanted her to resign or be impeached.</p> <p>Few observers believe the crisis will lead to her resignation, with little more than a year left of her single five-year term in the Blue House. Opposition parties have demanded an investigation, but have stopped short of calling for her impeachment.</p> <p>On Tuesday, Park offered the country a brief apology, but insisted Choi\u2019s influence had not extended beyond checking drafts of her speeches soon after she entered the presidential Blue House in early 2013. \u201cChoi is someone who helped me in a difficult time in the past, and I received her help on some of my speeches,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Files obtained from Choi\u2019s personal computer by the broadcaster JTBC TV, however, suggest Choi edited some of Park\u2019s key speeches and received confidential documents, including files relating to Japan and North Korea.</p> <p>In an interview with South Korea\u2019s Segye Ilbo newspaper last week, Choi confirmed she had received drafts of Park\u2019s speeches but denied she had influenced government policy or benefitted financially.</p> <p>Park sought to defuse the controversy by demanding the resignation of 10 of her senior secretaries and promising a cabinet reshuffle, but the move has done little to cool criticism of her conduct.</p> <p>Some observers believe that Park will ride out calls for her resignation, with opposition parties reluctant to plunge the country into the political uncertainty that would accompany a lengthy impeachment trial.</p> <p>Victor Cha, a senior adviser and Korea chair at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, said Park was unlikely to quit. \u201cDespite calls from the opposition parties for her resignation (which are only likely to grow during the Choi investigation), the more likely outcome is that she may heed demands to leave the Saenuri party, particularly if Saenuri wants to distance itself from Park in the 2017 presidential election year,\u201d Cha <a href=\"https://www.csis.org/analysis/controversy-roils-park-government\">wrote</a>.</p> <p>The Chosun Ilbo, South Korea\u2019s largest newspaper, said the scandal marked \u201c<a href=\"http://english.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2016/10/26/2016102601669.html\">a complete collapse</a> of a president\u2019s ability to run a government\u201d. The conservative newspaper called on Park\u2019s entire secretariat to resign and the appointment of a caretaker prime minister, effectively ending her role in running the country.</p> <p>\u201cThe only way open to her is to pull out of government and put the public good first,\u201d it said. \u201cMany people are ashamed for her. It is time she was, too.\u201d</p>",

Yet, while the Trump revelations have lately flowed thick and fast, there has been criticism (even in the Post) that much of the US media was initially slow to take Trump seriously, particularly early on in the Republican primaries.</p> <p>Baron vigorously defends his corner. \u201cAt the Post, we took the candidacy seriously from the very beginning,\u201d he insists, going on to cite reporting, among other things, on Trump Mortgage, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/mar/01/trump-university-claim-revisited-by-new-york-appeals-court\">Trump University</a>, and his <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2016/10/06/donald-trumps-greed-helped-ruin-atlantic-city-is-the-rest-of-the-country-next/?utm_term=.4d2a700971f6\">\u201cmultiple bankruptcies in Atlantic City\u201d</a>. </p> <p>\u201cOther people reacted in a different way.

I don\u2019t happen to think that was a wise decision on their part.\u201d</p> <p>Baron does concede, however, that Trump is \u201cskilful\u201d at using the media. \u201c[During the primaries] he would call into shows, which would normally require a candidate to show up in person, they would just take his phone call and he\u2019d be on the air, and then he\u2019d call the next show. He\u2019s been by far the most accessible presidential candidate ever.\u201d </p> <p>Indeed, even when the Trump campaign <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/06/13/donald-trump-just-banned-the-washington-post-from-covering-him-that-should-bother-everyone/\">barred</a> the Post\u2019s reporters from his events (for, they claimed, inaccurate reporting), he still made himself available to Baron\u2019s team. \u201cWe had actual published interviews with him, [even] while we were on the blacklist,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Born in 1954 and raised in Tampa, Florida, Baron, who\u2019s a fluent Spanish speaker, cut his teeth at the Miami Herald, which he first joined in 1976.

Beyond financial capital, the Amazon CEO has provided the Post with \u201cintellectual capital, too\u201d, Baron explains. \u201cHe\u2019s basically forced us to confront how the internet is different and how we have to adapt to it and embrace it. He\u2019s also given us what he calls \u2018runway\u2019, which is time to experiment. So, in funding the experiments, we have time to let them play out, without having to adhere to some strict timeline or strict requirements for profit.\u201d</p> <p>One area Bezos was especially keen that Baron address was the issue of aggregation. \u201cOne of the first questions he asked was: \u2018You do these long narratives, these deep investigations, but after you\u2019re published, within 15 minutes, half a dozen websites have decided to aggregate you \u2013 and they get more traffic than you do. How do you propose to deal with that?\u2019\u201d Baron\u2019s solution was, in effect, to fight fire with fire; hiring in-house bloggers, not only did the Post start aggregating itself, but it began aggregating other people\u2019s content too.</p> <p>Since acquiring the Post, Bezos \u2013 who\u2019s added 140 employees in three years \u2013 has held regular conference calls with senior staff. So how interested is he in the editorial side of the paper? The question isn\u2019t even complete before Baron jumps in: \u201cHe doesn\u2019t inject himself at all into our journalism. He doesn\u2019t suggest stories for us to do. He doesn\u2019t critique us in any way. Every once in a while, when he sees a story which delights him, he tells us.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/sep/04/washington-post-amazon-jeff-bezos\">The Washington Post embarks on Amazon adventure with Jeff Bezos | Dan Gillmor</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201c[The conference calls] are all about tactics and strategy. We talked about aggregation, way back when. We\u2019ve talked about our audience engagement team. But in terms of particular stories, particular projects, or particular avenues of coverage, he does not get involved at all.\u201d</p> <p>When asked what he thinks the Post\u2019s output and business model will look like in five years time, Baron concedes that he simply doesn\u2019t know. \u201cI always say the people who are most certain about what the model will be are the furthest removed from any responsibility for actually making that model occur,\u201d he says a touch world-wearily.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s so much that\u2019s happened so fast, and the pace of change has really accelerated. Today we\u2019re sitting here talking about what we are doing for Facebook Live. Or what we\u2019re doing for Snapchat. We\u2019re talking about using bots for Amazon Echo, which we did to provide scores during the Olympics. And during this election we\u2019ll be [using bots] to provide election results. [These aren\u2019t] things we talked about a year ago \u2013 maybe we should have, but we didn\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>Despite his ink-stained background, Baron believes that if institutions such as the Post are to survive, they have to think and behave like technology companies: they need to move fast, take risks, and accept that failure is an essential part of experimentation. \u201cI think people [at the Post] do feel free to propose new ideas and try new things,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd there\u2019s no penalty for failing. If it doesn\u2019t work, it doesn\u2019t work.\u201d But, he adds quickly, newspapers must always stick to their principles and values. \u201cWe can never violate that. If we do, then we destroy our entire argument for existence.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>CV</strong></h2> <p><strong>Age:</strong> 62</p> <p><strong>Education:</strong> Lehigh University, Pennsylvania.

  "<p>As Marco Rubio and Patrick Murphy squared off in the final debate of their Florida Senate race, the discussion turned to the Syrian civil war.

Murphy, a two-term congressman, reverted to a familiar line.<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/30/donald-trump-voters-rally-election-crowd\">Inside a Donald Trump rally: good people in a feedback loop of paranoia and hate</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cIt just goes back to the same point,\u201d he said, \u201cthat Senator Rubio continues to support Donald Trump, and it is shameful that he stands there with him.\u201d</p> <p>The audience laughed, faintly, at one of nearly 20 mentions of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/30/donald-trump-voters-rally-election-crowd\">the Republican presidential nominee</a> during the one-hour debate. When Murphy next mentioned Trump, Rubio was quick with a rejoinder based on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DteDRD6cbbM\">a famous Joe Biden rebuke of Rudy Giuliani</a>: \u201cA noun, a verb and Donald Trump: that\u2019s his answer to everything.\u201d</p> <p>The race in Florida, among the most closely watched in the country, could help determine whether Republicans keep control of the Senate. Democrats see the vote as a referendum on Trump. But Murphy\u2019s mentions of the businessman underscored the potential limitations of using the top of the ticket to mount attacks down the ballot.</p> <p>Murphy has questioned how Rubio can endorse Trump, whom Rubio has called \u201ca con man\u201d, untrustworthy with the nuclear codes, and \u201cthe most vulgar person ever to aspire to the presidency\u201d. In recent weeks, polls have given the Democrat hope, in part because Trump is trailing Hillary Clinton in Florida by around three points. But with nine days left before Election Day, Rubio is about seven points up on Trump in the state.</p> <h2><strong>\u2018Less than ideal choices\u2019</strong></h2> <p>This week, both candidates spoke to the Guardian. \u201cI\u2019ve said all along that these are less than ideal choices before us,\u201d Rubio said, \u201cand that\u2019s why we need a senator willing to stand up to the next president no matter who it is \u2013 even if it\u2019s from your own party.\u201d</p> <p>Rubio was speaking on the day the FBI director, James Comey, said the agency was reviewing emails that might be pertinent to the closed investigation into Clinton\u2019s use of a private server while secretary of state. </p> <p>\u201cThe question now is will Patrick Murphy still 100% trust Hillary Clinton, as he has said in the past,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Murphy, who spoke earlier in the week after appearing with Clinton at a rally in Coconut Creek, said there was no comparison between the Democratic and Republican presidential nominees.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m grateful that Senator Rubio\u2019s connecting me to Secretary Clinton,\u201d Murphy said. \u201cYou look at what she\u2019s been fighting for her entire life, and you contrast that to Donald Trump. You talk about a contrast of both qualifications and temperament for who our next world leader is going to be.\u201d</p> <p>Citing Trump\u2019s litany of inflammatory comments \u2013 against immigrants, Muslims, women, the Gold Star parents of an Iraq war hero, prisoners of war and more \u2013 Murphy said it was \u201cappalling to a lot of Floridians that Marco Rubio continues to stand by Donald Trump\u2019s side\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cA lot of people had the courage to stand up to Donald Trump,\u201d he added, noting the flurry of Republicans who withdrew their support earlier this month after a video was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/08/john-mccain-donald-trump-sex-boast-tape\">unearthed from 2005</a> in which the former reality TV star bragged about groping and kissing women without consent.</p> <p>Rubio, despite condemning Trump\u2019s comments, was not among them. He has kept Trump at a distance, however, making no campaign appearances with the nominee despite his frequent presence in Florida.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"281fee7cc4c65d703cf356526fa3bcb4b81df19d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/281fee7cc4c65d703cf356526fa3bcb4b81df19d/90_137_2285_2855/800.jpg\" alt=\"Hillary Clinton campaigns with Patrick Murphy\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hillary Clinton campaigns with Patrick Murphy in Coconut Creek.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Larry Marano/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Rubio\u2019s rationale rests primarily in the balance of the supreme court, where the vacancy left by Antonin Scalia remains. In the primary, Rubio doubted whether Trump would nominate a conservative. He told the Guardian a list of potential appointees released by Trump was \u201cencouraging\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ll have to wait and see who wins the election and whether he\u2019ll actually do that,\u201d Rubio said. \u201cBut they\u2019ll be held to the same standard, whether it\u2019s a Republican president or a Democrat president \u2026 I\u2019m looking for people that will apply the constitution according to the original intent of the words of the constitution.\u201d</p> <p>Rubio also expressed confidence that he would be judged on his own record. Saying his opponent lacked any legislative accomplishments despite having served in Congress for four years, Rubio touted his own work on issues such as human trafficking, sanctions against Venezuela and Hezbollah, and veterans affairs.</p> <p>Asked if he would be willing to work with Clinton, he stopped short of naming potential areas of agreement. \u201cI have a record of working with people across the aisle, and I\u2019ll work with anyone if they\u2019re pursuing ideas that I think are good for America,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Murphy, whose time in Congress has been been spent in the minority, denied he had little to show. He listed funding for the Everglades, preventing cuts to a key component of Medicare, and securing lower flood insurance rates, and stated his commitment to issues such as climate change, equal pay and raising the minimum wage.</p> <p>He has nonetheless struggled with a lack of name recognition, compounded by limited resources after national Democratic groups withdrew millions of dollars in reserved ad spending. </p> <p>The decision has drawn criticism from some observers, for its apparent abandonment of a race many believe is winnable. Others complain of a missed opportunity to deliver a fatal blow to Rubio, whom many believe will make another run for the presidency, potentially challenging Clinton in 2020. </p> <p>But some involved in Democrats\u2019 efforts to retake the Senate defended their move, citing Florida\u2019s expensive media markets in comparison to battlegrounds such as Indiana, Missouri, and North Carolina, where money can prove more influential. </p> <p>\u201cI do think the threat of him running for president in 2020 is real,\u201d a Senate Democratic strategist said of Rubio. \u201cBut our goal is to take back the Senate and win the White House right now. We\u2019re not running a campaign for 2020.\u201d </p> <h2><strong>\u2018The height of cynicism\u2019</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"21b31afa73452caf397e45eeb3e7899bb63f540e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/21b31afa73452caf397e45eeb3e7899bb63f540e/0_353_3408_2045/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rubio and Murphy\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rubio and Murphy meet to debate at Broward College in Davie, earlier this week.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Wilfredo Lee/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Another Democratic strategist familiar with the Florida Senate race said internal polling conducted by the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee and the Clinton campaign showed Murphy trailing Rubio by high single digits. On Thursday, <a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/senate-update-rubio-is-keeping-the-republicans-hopes-alive-in-the-senate\">FiveThirtyEight</a> gave Rubio an 81% chance of defeating Murphy, finding the sitting senator ahead in 48 of 50 public polls. On Sunday, two new polls showed Rubio up by eight and nine points.</p> <p>Pressure to reinvest in the race did pay some dividends last week, when a Super Pac affiliated with Senate minority leader Harry Reid confirmed it was transferring a seven-figure sum to a pro-Murphy super pac in Florida. Nonetheless, Murphy has largely had to rely on earned media coverage and high-profile surrogates.</p> <p>Among the most vocal has been Barack Obama, who called Rubio\u2019s support for Trump \u201cthe height of cynicism\u201d. </p> <p>\u201cHow can you call him a \u2018con artist\u2019 and \u2018dangerous\u2019 and object to all the controversial things he says and then say, \u2018But I\u2019m still gonna vote for him?\u2019 C\u2019mon, man!\u201d Obama said at a campaign stop in Miami Gardens.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s the sign of somebody who will say anything, do anything, pretend to be anybody, just to get elected. And you know what? If you\u2019re willing to be anybody just to be somebody, then you don\u2019t have the leadership that Florida needs in the United States Senate.\u201d</p> <p>Clinton has also urged voters to back Murphy and made a familiar connection: \u201cUnlike his opponent, Patrick Murphy has not been afraid to stand up to Donald Trump and his dangerous, divisive campaign.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/30/donald-trump-tony-schwartz-art-of-the-deal-out-of-control\">Donald Trump's ghostwriter on being the 'Dr Frankenstein' who made a monster</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Such high-profile support, however, may prove too little, too late. For one thing, Rubio has a solid base of support among Hispanic voters, many of whom identify with the Spanish-speaking son of Cuban immigrants and in 2012 accounted for 17% of Florida\u2019s electorate. </p> <p>Murphy ramped up his outreach to the Hispanic community \u2013 somewhat belatedly, some say. In doing so, he sought to revive Rubio\u2019s involvement in a comprehensive immigration reform bill in 2013, noting that the senator backed away from the issue when faced with backlash from conservatives.</p> <p>It has been an uphill battle. In Miami\u2019s Little Havana recently, at one of Clinton\u2019s 81 Florida field offices, volunteers labored to get out the vote. Dozens of voters, mostly Latino, entered and left the building.</p> <p>Among them were Azalia and Lucia Rodriguez. Originally from Nicaragua, they were motivated in part by resentment of Trump and said they would vote for Clinton. They did not support Rubio, they said. But they also did not plan to vote for Murphy. </p> <p>Their reason? They hadn\u2019t heard of him.</p>",
  "<p>The dealmakers behind the proposed mega-merger of AT&amp;T and Time Warner have accomplished the impossible: uniting Hillary Clinton, Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders in their condemnation of the deal.<br></p> <p>Trump, needless to say, has been the most vituperative. The merger would \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/23/trump-att-time-warner-deal-clinton-kaine\">destroy democracy</a>\u201d, he said. But pretty much everyone in Washington has publicly come out against it. Sanders, Clinton\u2019s opponent for the Democratic nomination and now campaigning on her behalf, is already <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2016/10/25/sanders-we-must-do-everything-possible-to-press-clinton-on-att-time-warner/\">preparing to battle a future Clinton administration</a> to ensure that anti-trust regulators turn thumbs-down on the deal. Lining up beside him? Powerhouse senator Elizabeth Warren.</p> <p>The two companies and their bankers must feel that they have walked straight into a buzzsaw. The Senate will hold a hearing on it on 7 December, after the election. Will tempers have cooled by then? Maybe, maybe not.</p> <p>So, what on earth drove Time Warner and AT&amp;T to sprint to the altar during an election season in which populist politicians are dominating the airwaves and the debate? Insanity? Desperation? A sense that there was an opportunity that was just too good to pass up? Or simply an urge to annoy the politicians?<br></p> <p>The word to bear in mind might simply be \u201cpanic\u201d.</p> <p>It\u2019s no shock to anyone who keeps an eye on these worlds that companies that distribute all the content that we consume, and the companies that produce it (translation: AT&amp;T as the party of the first part, and Time Warner as the party of the second part) have a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/25/att-time-warner-acquisition-customer-service-impact\">vested interest in forging alliances among themselves</a>. The closer and more seamless those alliances are, the faster and more creatively they can work on developing and delivering more of that content for all our devices, especially those smartphones and tablets from which we are unable to wean ourselves. </p> <p>Those that get it right have captive audiences simply because they are delivering a growing proportion of that content. It\u2019s an enticing prospect.</p> <p>Analysts have been expecting that we\u2019d see yet another wave of convergence \u2013 a buzzword in this media/telecommunications universe for the better part of two decades now, having been behind the merger that formed Time Warner itself in 1995 \u2013 for several years. </p> <p>This time, it\u2019s happening in different ways, not always via mergers. Apple and Time Warner\u2019s HBO have linked their brands already, with Apple distributing the HBO Now service. Imagine <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/stephen-rosa/apple-and-hbo-think-diffe_b_10279702.html\">what might happen</a> if Apple \u2013 with its cash mountain \u2013 decided to snap up HBO\u2019s parent company, Time Warner, and pursue the myriad potential synergies between its own platforms and Time Warner\u2019s content? </p> <p>I suspect it\u2019s safe to say that the folks at AT&amp;T did just that \u2013 and panicked. </p> <p>Or else they considered what might happen if another giant rival with the potential to build a mammoth platform and plenty of cash \u2013 like Google, which has already pushed into live-TV streaming \u2013 pre-empted them. Or they allowed companies like Amazon or Netflix to get further ahead with their own plans. </p> <p>Facing that kind of strategic risk, a little bit of political risk may not look like anything terribly threatening. Sure, the politicians may indulge in a lot of saber rattling for the benefit of voters, especially since the deal was announced in the final days of the presidential election campaign. But it will be many months before regulators will rule on it \u2013 even if a deep-pocketed rival doesn\u2019t muscle in and outbid AT&amp;T for Time Warner.</p> <p>Will the public outrage endure? The dealmakers and the board members at both companies seem to be making a calculated decision that the answer is \u201cno\u201d. </p> <p>That seems optimistic. We already <a href=\"http://www.pbs.org/newshour/updates/internet-u-s-compare-globally-hint-slower-expensive/\">pay far more</a> than citizens in most other parts of the world for basic broadband access, thanks to the fact that most communities offer very limited options to their citizens. Most telecommunications services are equally pricey, relative to those offered elsewhere, from <a href=\"https://www.billshark.com/u-s-mobile-plans-expensive/\">mobile phones</a> to cable television services. The number of <a href=\"http://www.economist.com/news/business/21702177-television-last-having-its-digital-revolution-moment-cutting-cord\">cord-cutters</a> continue to grow.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/25/att-time-warner-acquisition-customer-service-impact\">What will AT&amp;T's acquisition of Time Warner mean for customers?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The two companies have an idea of what they\u2019ll do to keep their own customers loyal. \u201cPremium content always wins,\u201d said Randall Stephenson, CEO and chairman of AT&amp;T, in the company\u2019s press release announcing the transaction. \u201cWe\u2019ll have the world\u2019s best premium content with the networks to deliver it to every screen. A big customer pain point is paying for content once but not being able to access it on any device, anywhere. Our goal is to solve that.\u201d</p> <p>At what price, though? Stephenson does refer to delivering \u201cvalue\u201d to customers, and certainly, you can expect to hear Time Warner and AT&amp;T insist that because their proposed match is a \u201cvertical\u201d merger rather than a \u201chorizontal\u201d one, this should pose less of an antitrust threat. In other words, consumers won\u2019t see prices soar as a result of reduced competition.</p> <p>In a horizontal transaction, two companies that compete to provide roughly the same kind of services or goods (think, Cox Communications and Comcast), merge and become one, meaning that there are fewer entities involved in setting prices for content as purchasers, or for services as providers. In a vertical transaction, such as the proposed merger, companies that are in different parts of the business (in this case, content and distribution) join forces.</p> <p>But in markets where competition is already restricted \u2013 such as, say, the internet \u2013 price increases could be a result of even vertical mergers. That\u2019s the conclusion of studies by one economist, John Kwoka of Northeastern University, who found that of the 1,000 mergers of all kinds that he evaluated over the last two decades, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://fortune.com/2016/10/25/att-time-warner-blocked/\">at least a third generated price increases in excess of 10%</a>. A remarkable 80% of them raised prices to consumers to some degree; the average increase was about 7%. </p> <p>Ponder that, antitrust regulators.</p> <p>There are plenty of ways in which this could happen. For instance, all of the programming that Time Warner produces could suddenly become unavailable to competitors to the newly merged entity\u2019s rival distributors, except at a much higher price. You have an AT&amp;T smartphone and want to watch the latest episode of Game of Thrones? Congrats \u2013 you can do so on any device you own for half the price you\u2019d pay if you have a Verizon phone and want to watch on your iPad. </p> <p>It\u2019s up to the politicians not just to be blowhards about the deal or threaten to axe it. Consumers may end up with great, efficiently delivered and fairly priced content as a result of mergers like the one that AT&amp;T and Time Warner are proposing. The trick is to ensure how that potential is realized. Will the regulators do their job?</p> <p>That\u2019s why what happens in the weeks following the election is going to be so crucial. Who will the new president choose to advise her (or him) on issues like commerce and telecommunications? Who will (s)he tap for membership on the Federal Trade Commission (which governs antitrust issues) and the Federal Communications Commission (which oversees telecommunications policy, and of which <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/26/technology/chief-who-sharpened-fccs-teeth-faces-final-hurdles.html\">the next president must name a new chairman</a>), two of the key regulators associated with this industry?</p> <p>Regulators have the ability to lay down the law and make the deal much more consumer-friendly in any number of ways, demanding (for instance) that the new company make HBO shows available more readily via apps or streaming, meaning that we wouldn\u2019t be forced to sign up for costly packages.</p> <p>For once, all the heated political rhetoric might come in useful, if it ensures that the regulators keep their eye on the ball. I wish I was confident that the attention span of outraged politicians was as long as that of the strategic thinkers and panicky dealmakers \u2013 but I\u2019m not.</p>",

As the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jul/19/trump-co-writer-says-candidate-could-end-civilisation-the-art-of-the-deal-tony-schwartz\">ghostwriter of Trump\u2019s bestselling 1987 book The Art of the Deal</a>, he did more than anyone to create the businessman\u2019s public persona.

It wasn\u2019t that consequential to the world.\u201d</p> <p>But building on the foundation of The Art of the Deal, Trump spent a decade hosting the reality TV show <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/12/mark-burnett-donald-trump-apprentice-tapes\">The Apprentice</a>, reinforcing his image as a preternatural businessman with the power to say \u201cYou\u2019re fired!\u201d (and blurring the boundaries between reality and reality television, just as he would throughout the presidential campaign). Many supporters say they trust him to run America like a company; the business of America is business.

It gave me such a profound experience of the wrongness the direction of my life was taking.

It will suggest the forces of progress and evolution hurled away the forces of hatred and fear.\u201d</p> <p>But how would Trump, whose entire personal mythology is based on winning with swagger, react to the devastating loss? Schwartz knows it won\u2019t be pretty. \u201cYou can tell he\u2019s terrified and angry about it and bewildered by it. It\u2019s hard to predict exactly how he\u2019s going to respond. It won\u2019t be in a healthy way.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s a chance he\u2019s going to do everything he can to blame this on someone other than himself. To insist it\u2019s a rigged election and to try to mobilise the angry people who are his base to do something violent and crazy, which he can then blame on the next administration.

  "<p>This is what greets you when you arrive at a Trump rally: two 18-wheelers parked outside the sports stadium where the Republican nominee will be speaking, placed end-to-end so that nobody can miss them. The front truck, painted white, has \u201cThe Donald for President\u201d scrawled across its side, above the slogans: \u201cAll lives matter\u201d, \u201cBuild the wall\u201d, and \u201cKeep Mexican dope in Mexico\u201d.</p> <p>It is a relatively gentle introduction to Trumpworld, a scattering of antagonism for the gathering crowd. If only the same could be said about the yellow truck parked right behind it.</p> <p>\u201cHillary for prison\u201d, it says beside a picture of Hillary Clinton behind bars. Another image of the Democratic presidential candidate has her brains spilling out of her skull with the caption: \u201cConcussion wired\u201d. Bill Clinton is seen laughing above the words: \u201cJust realized if Hillary wins \u2026 I get interns\u201d. A final shot of Hillary has her pointing at her husband and saying: \u201cBill! Monica gave you what?\u201d</p> <p>A couple of hundred feet away, in full view of the trucks, thousands of supporters patiently line up to hear their idol. Many of them have been here for hours. Many have small children in tow, including Jillian Major, a school food provider (\u201cI\u2019m a lunch lady\u201d) who has an eight-month-old son in her arms and her daughter, 10, standing by her side.</p> <p>What does Major think of the flood of revelations about Trump\u2019s sexual indiscretions?

Thousands lining up to Make America Great Again in the shadow of an 18-wheeler covered in crude sexual references.</p> <p>As the bewildering 2016 presidential election draws to a close, some basic questions are left hanging in the air. After we have spent months watching the impossible happen, of hearing the defense of the indefensible, of observing American values \u2013 one after another \u00ad\u2013 fall like bowling pins, it\u2019s time to ask: what has this sometimes maddening, bizarre, gruesome, hilarious, shocking, scary Trump phenomenon been about? More urgently, once the pall of this most baffling of presidential elections has cleared and 8 November fades into the background, what will the Donald have left behind?</p> <p>Some of the answers to those questions come easily, shared freely by Trump\u2019s supporters as they wait in line. Conspiracy theories are one aspect of the destruction wrought by Hurricane Donald likely to be with us for a long time.</p> <p>Here\u2019s Vjekoslav Grgas, a Croatian American, standing dutifully in the non-VIP line. In five short minutes, he rattles off a litany of horror stories. Did you know that three men were assassinated at the Democratic national convention in July to cover up the fact that they were the source of the WikiLeaks dump of hacked Democratic emails? Or that the liberal financier George Soros bankrolled several US foreign policy disasters, and that Hillary Clinton personally pocketed 99% of the donations to the Clinton Foundation following the 2010 Haiti earthquake? In a rare note of discordance with the Republican nominee, he even adds that Trump was wrong <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/sep/16/donald-trump-barack-obama-birther-video\">to finally admit</a> last month that Barack Obama is an American, as the US president\u2019s birth certificate was obviously Photoshopped.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ec3b4e951c427721a192bb9148bf263de64fa714\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ec3b4e951c427721a192bb9148bf263de64fa714/0_324_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"supporters cheer at the rally.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Trump\u2019s going to say what needs to be said\u2019: supporters cheer at the rally.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jessica Kourkounis/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Other elements of the Trump phenomenon are more difficult to tease out. Phrases are thrown out<strong> </strong>from the line with such repetitive frequency that they take on the blandness of cliches. One of the VIP Bikers for Trump, John Hearl, is among many at the rally who says he likes the reality TV star because unlike career politicians, Trump \u201cspeaks his own mind\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cTrump\u2019s going to say what needs to be said, and if that offends somebody, well then, they just have to understand the goal of all this.\u201d</p> <p>Which is?</p> <p>\u201cAmerica first.\u201d</p> <p>A little further ahead in the VIP line stands Carole Urban, wearing a sequined hat in the colors of the American flag. She says she is also looking forward to hearing Trump speaking, because \u201che\u2019s down to our level. He\u2019s not like past presidents who prepare a beautiful speech but it\u2019s not coming from the heart. He speaks it like it is.\u201d</p> <p>Beautiful speeches from past presidents. Is she referring to Obama?</p> <p>She pulls her shoulders back and with a note of indignation says: \u201cWhen I first heard Obama I was elected, I thought he could improve our country. I voted for him in 2008. I was so disillusioned in him \u2013 after four years, he helped ruin this country.\u201d</p> <p>Was part of that disillusionment to do with Obama\u2019s \u201cbeautiful speech\u201d, as she puts it? <br></p> <p>She shrugs a second time. \u201cYes, I was angry about his oratory. The way he was speaking, it touched my soul, it was so beautiful. A black person, everyone says, but he\u2019s actually mulatto. I thought he could do a great job helping American people, but it didn\u2019t happen like that.\u201d</p> <p>When I ask Urban about how, as a woman, she feels about Trump\u2019s self-confessed sexually predatory behavior, she gets indignant. \u201cI\u2019m sick and tired of this being brought up. Words come out in the wrong way at times; you put your foot in your mouth. I don\u2019t think Donald Trump is remotely derogatory to women.\u201d</p> <p>To follow Urban\u2019s train of thought: Trump is loved by his supporters not just because of the content of what he says, such as his seemingly endless ability to insult anyone from <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2015/06/16/trump_mexico_not_sending_us_their_best_criminals_drug_dealers_and_rapists_are_crossing_border.html\">Mexicans</a> to <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2015/12/07/politics/donald-trump-muslim-ban-immigration/\">Muslims</a> to <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/08/19/politics/donald-trump-african-american-voters/\">African Americans</a> to <a href=\"http://www.cosmopolitan.com/politics/news/a44629/donald-trump-insults-women/\">women</a>. It\u2019s also the way he says it. It\u2019s the language he uses: unscripted, unpolished, and not infrequently unintelligible. He is the antithesis of the fancy, considered Obama, with the Harvard law degree and the \u201cbeautiful speech\u201d.</p> <p>The contrast is worth exploring. Here is Obama speaking on the campaign trail at a similar end-game stage in the 2008 election: \u201cHope! That\u2019s what kept our parents going when times were tough. It\u2019s what led immigrants from distant lands to come to these shores against great odds and carve a new life for their families in America; what led those who couldn\u2019t vote to march and organize and stand for freedom, that led them to cry out: \u2018It may look dark tonight, but if I hold on to hope, tomorrow will be brighter.\u2019\u201d </p> <p></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwiVqCbizKg\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/AwiVqCbizKg?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>And here is Trump speaking tonight at the rally, reproduced verbatim: \u201cBikers love me. I will see these bikers, oftentimes on Harleys, not always, but a lot of times. I feel so safe with these bikers. A lot of times they don\u2019t want to come inside, they just want to make sure I feel safe. I love you guys, I love you guys.\u201d</p> <p>Or this on his rival: \u201cHillary lied. No, no, no, she lied. She\u2019s a liar. And she lied and she lied. She lied. It\u2019s so important we vote in November so that we get rid of these liars, these incompetent people, the Hillary Clintons.\u201d</p> <p>So what if Trump\u2019s diction is less than perfect? There are no rules on how a would-be president should communicate with the people, nor are there minimum standards of rhetorical prowess for the White House.</p> <p>What seems apparent is that Trump has given his followers the license to emulate him in throwing caution to the wind and saying things that previously were considered unacceptable. Trump has also opened a new era in American politics in which it doesn\u2019t matter what you say or how you say it. Be as offensive as you like. Speak your own mind.<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/28/hillary-clinton-poll-assuming-win-is-downright-dangerous\">Stop right there: assuming a Hillary Clinton victory is downright dangerous | Kate Aronoff</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Inside the sports stadium, the impact of the Republican presidential nominee\u2019s anti-oratory is all around us.

Lock her up! Lock her up!\u201d chants fill thestadium. </p> <p>The former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani comes on to introduce the main speaker and immediately launches into a story about locker rooms, turning the candidate\u2019s excuse for why he bragged about grabbing \u201cpussy\u201d into a joke. Then he turns his comments on Clinton, adding: \u201cI\u2019m going to get down off the stage with you into the basket of deplorables. Because unlike Clinton, you speak the truth. You\u2019re for real, she\u2019s a phoney.\u201d</p> <p>There\u2019s a disconnect between the ugly schoolyard name-calling coming from the speakers and the outward appearance of their audience. Yes, there are the usual smattering of patriotic followers in costume of the sort that frequent any Republican event: women robed in the Stars and Stripes; men posing as Uncle Sam with crooked top hats like wonky chimneys on their heads. But most Trump supporters wear the unassuming uniform of middle America: jeans, checked shirt and jacket.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0163838c5d8c6f8dff5d3a88ff5cd89afaccabc3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0163838c5d8c6f8dff5d3a88ff5cd89afaccabc3/0_111_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"trump supporters\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Until Trump and his surrogates get to work on them, the thousands filling the arena come across as a genial bunch intent on enjoying themselves for the night.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dominick Reuter/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Most, too, are in work, and their <a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-mythology-of-trumps-working-class-support/\">median income</a> is in fact above the national average.

She\u2019s unfit to be president.\u201d</p> <p>Trump enters the auditorium and the atmosphere rises to another level. Before he arrived it was already electric; now it\u2019s like one of those static balls that make your hair stand on end.</p> <p>The candidate launches into his routinely un-beautiful speech. \u201cIf you\u2019re talking about Crooked Hillary, what about the crooked media? CNN is a disgrace. CNN is a disgrace.\u201d</p> <p>A huge boo erupts from the stadium floor as the crowd turns towards the media compound where reporters and camera operators are penned in for the duration. Trump\u2019s invective has an immediate and chilling impact among the crowd. Men and women who only moments ago were pleasantly talking to us, sharing generously their reflections on the state of the nation, are now jabbing their fingers in our direction and spitting: \u201cCNN sucks! CNN sucks!

Appalled by the horrors of the first world war, an internationalist and pacifist, he was pushed left by the Great Depression, <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1927/03/the-case-of-sacco-and-vanzetti/306625/\">the executions of Sacco and Vanzetti</a> and President Hoover\u2019s brutal treatment of <a href=\"https://zinnedproject.org/materials/the-bonus-army/\">the Bonus Army</a>. Seeking to correct the repressive course he thought his country was on, to prevent another war, Field began to pass documents to Russia.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"ec11ad1ed2b76124bbf0ac875479c78e296b88bb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ec11ad1ed2b76124bbf0ac875479c78e296b88bb/165_0_756_945/400.jpg\" alt=\"Kati Marton: \u2018the intersections between my saga and Noel Field\u2019s saga are bizarre\u2019\" width=\"400\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kati Marton: \u2018the intersections between my saga and Noel Field\u2019s saga are bizarre.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Eric Stringer/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In Spain during the civil war, he worked for the League of Nations. During the second world war, he ran aid for the Unitarian Service Committee \u2013 and channelled it to communists first. He also worked for the Office of Strategic Services (OSS), a predecessor of the CIA. In peacetime, he went to Prague. He hoped to find new purpose but he was seized, taken to Hungary, imprisoned and brutally tortured.</p> <p>Field became a pawn in the last Stalinist purges, his name deployed in show trials to incriminate others though he was never tried himself. As Marton tells in shattering sequence, in the most extraordinary passages of an extraordinary book, family members went behind the Iron Curtain to find him. They paid a terrible cost. Field\u2019s faith never wavered, though, and in Budapest in 1970 he was buried with full Soviet honours.</p> <h2>\u2018The fixed point has always been Budapest\u2019</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0c38fda2ed1ec9e49157b947afb911d53c689bec\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0c38fda2ed1ec9e49157b947afb911d53c689bec/0_0_1200_857/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Noel Field\" width=\"1000\" height=\"714\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An identification card issued in 1946, by the US war department for Noel Field.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: US Government</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In Marton\u2019s last book but one, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/01/books/review/Furst-t.html\">Enemies of the People</a>, she told her parents\u2019 story: how they were taken from her when she was five, how they came back, how they fled to freedom. She then wrote <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/books/paris-a-love-story-by-kati-marton/2012/08/31/8b554d8c-f058-11e1-adc6-87dfa8eff430_story.html\">Paris: A Love Story</a>, a meditation on her marriage to the diplomat Richard Holbrooke and her grief <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/dec/14/richard-holbrooke-obituary\">after his sudden death</a> in 2010. Then she turned homewards once more.</p> <p>\u201cMy life has been a rather turbulent one,\u201d she says, after <a href=\"http://www.womanaroundtown.com/sections/woman-around-town/woman-around-town-kati-marton-her-own-person\">40 years or more</a> as an award-winning journalist and writer, \u201cbut the fixed point has always been Budapest and what happened in those years, because they were shrouded in mystery. My parents did not fancy talking about either the communist period or even less the one that preceded it.</p> <p>\u201cWhen I finished my last book I was looking for a way to get out of my own saga. And I picked up [the historian] Arthur Schlesinger\u2019s memoir, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/books/00/11/26/reviews/001126.26franket.html\">A Life in the 20th Century</a>, and up popped this name, Noel Field, as someone who had worked with Schlesinger and the OSS and whom Schlesinger had never trusted.\u201d</p> <p>Marton began work, quickly finding that \u201csurviving family members were very receptive to my research because they themselves didn\u2019t know very much\u201d. The Field family made available correspondence which \u201cforms very much the spine of this book\u201d.</p> <p>Marton discovered a truly extraordinary character, a man whose motives might genuinely be described as good who ended up working against his own country, in the service of a nightmare regime. Field suffered brutally for such loyalty. But he was directly implicated in the death of at least one person and his name was used to condemn many others. Throughout the book, the horrors of the Gulag loom large.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a human drama in a political context,\u201d Marton says, \u201cbut to me what\u2019s interesting is what motivates such a person \u2013 well-born, superbly educated with every privilege, poised on a dream career \u2013 to espouse one of the most violent, destructive ideologies?\u201d</p> <p>She cannot have imagined that her attempt to answer this question would be published at such a propitious time. For one thing, the book has come out in the midst of a presidential election in which one candidate\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/30/donald-trump-paul-manafort-ukraine-russia-putin-ties\">apparent ties to Russia and a brutal Russian leader</a> have been constantly, hotly and sensationally debated. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/30/donald-trump-paul-manafort-ukraine-russia-putin-ties\">Donald Trump and Russia: a web that grows more tangled all the time</a> </p> </aside>  <p>When the name \u201cDonald Trump\u201d comes up in conversation, Marton \u2013 a friend of the Clintons \u2013 grimaces and elides, though she alights on an issue nonetheless distinctly linked to the rise of the Republican presidential nominee.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m very involved with refugee issues,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m an overseer of the <a href=\"https://www.rescue.org/\">International Rescue Committee</a> and I\u2019m a refugee myself, having benefited from American largesse. And [in the 1930s] as now the country was showing its worst side, its least generous side to refugees, in that case fleeing Nazism. And this played a big role in Field\u2019s radicalisation.</p> <p>\u201cOf course the connection to today\u2019s world is very interesting to me, regarding the power of an idea to blind a man and how fanaticism works. And when I finished writing this, I thought: \u2018Holy cow, how am I ever going to get the public\u2019s attention when the public is obsessed with Trump and the \u2018war against terror\u2019?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo I thought, \u2018Well, I\u2019m going to write an essay and put it right at the front of the book, called The Capture of Minds, whereby I connect the capture of young, alienated, lost idealists today by a really destructive, toxic but addictive ideology, that is Islamic fundamentalism, with its 1930s equivalent, which was global communism and Stalinism, for another disenchanted generation which had basically given up on their own countries\u2019 ability to set things to rights.</p> <p>\u201cAmerica then was a nation that was deeply divided, and its youth had given up on politics as usual. So they were very susceptible to a messiah promising to right every wrong.\u201d</p> <h2>Witches in the government</h2> <p>Inevitably, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/11/books/review/true-believer-kati-marton.html?_r=0\">reviewers</a> of Marton\u2019s book have cited the novels of John Le Carr\u00e9, presenting Field as a spy who did not come in from the cold. The sheer naivety of her subject, however, sometimes brings the book closer, in a bizarre way, to the comedies of PG Wodehouse. In one extraordinary scene, Field, intoxicated on his faith, bounds up the steps of the Lincoln Memorial to sing the Internationale in Russian, horrified NKVD handlers milling embarrassedly about below. Imagine a great lost masterpiece \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2014/may/07/pg-wodehouse-creative-writing-leave-it-to-psmith-reading-group\">Psmith</a>: Stalinist Spy. </p> <p>But if there is comedy in Marton\u2019s larger story, it is pitch black. Somehow, while Field was spying for Stalin in 1930s Washington, he went undetected. Some suspected him in Europe but the story of how he went east \u2013 was arrested, jailed, tortured and finally released into carefully controlled retirement \u2013 is shot through with instances of remarkable human frailty.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b8c3835e099ecce059b5cf44806678d7edf3d66a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b8c3835e099ecce059b5cf44806678d7edf3d66a/82_0_4831_2900/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Alger Hiss\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Two police photographs, circa 1949, of former US state department official and accused communist spy Alger Hiss.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hulton Archive/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Orwell also looms over Marton\u2019s tale, in Spain and in the cells and torture chambers of eastern Europe.

And he was not alone, in his spying and in the terrible, contradictory price that he paid.</p> <p>By the time of the communist witch-hunts of the 1950s, Marton says, the reds under America\u2019s bed existed mostly in the tortured mind of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/21/donald-trump-on-terror-mccarthyism-for-new-age\">Senator Joe McCarthy</a>. \u201cBut in the 30s, in the highest reaches of the American government, I\u2019m talking in the White House, the state department, there <em>were</em> witches \u2026 I loved finding these super-weird nutcases who absolutely believed in Stalin and were then destroyed by him.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/28/cambridge-spy-guy-burgess-charmed-observer-files\">How Cambridge spy Guy Burgess charmed the Observer\u2019s man in Moscow</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cJ Edgar Hoover, who eventually came to run the reign of terror in Washington, when he knew everything about everybody\u2019s lives, was flat-footed when it came to members of the US government who were betraying their own country.\u201d</p> <p>Among Americans who spied for Russia, such as contemporaries and friends <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/oct/19/joan-brady-alger-hiss-was-framed-by-nixon\">Alger Hiss</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/books/99/01/03/reviews/990103.03persict.html\">Laurence Duggan</a>, Noel Field may indeed be a minor figure.

He was much less of a cynic than your lot, if I may call them that. He was needy of family, a larger family, and a sense of belonging, which the party offered even if he was not allowed to join that party until he was useless to Moscow as a spy.</p> <p>\u201cThen he joined, and typically for this man who never failed to make the wrong choice, he joined the Communist party in the year that it imploded, 1956, with Khrushchev denouncing Stalin followed by the Hungarian revolution, the first armed popular uprising against Soviet rule. That\u2019s when Field finally came in from the cold, as an open member of the Communist party.\u201d</p> <p>Marton\u2019s book may help bring Field to the light, alongside Hiss and Philby, Blunt and Maclean in the halls of Anglo-American infamy.</p> <ul> <li><em>True Believer: Stalin\u2019s Last American Spy, by Kati Marton, is out now in the US.

Cleveland has already announced that Corey Kluber will start Game 4 ... and then presumably Game 7 ... meaning the Cubs will have to beat him at least once if they fall down 2-0. There\u2019s a lot for Cubs fans to worry about and that\u2019s without wondering if they\u2019ll ever see a championship in their lifetimes.</em></p> <p>Well, here we are again. The Cubs didn\u2019t lose Game 2, but they did lose Game 3 and we\u2019re right back in the panic zone now for Cubs fans. Kluber is pitching and the Cubs will likely need to beat him at least once to win a World Series. </p> <p>But let\u2019s not always focus on Cubs fans. Cleveland is just two wins away from the city\u2019s second championship in less than five months. Either way, this World Series is a ton of fun because we\u2019re going to get an outcome we\u2019ll never forget.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5814d1f6e4b01c528432e02d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-29T16:45:44.373Z\">5.45pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><em>DJ will be here shortly. In the meantime, read how the World Series is trumping the election in Chicago and Cleveland:</em></p> <p>Cleveland, for a few golden hours, also felt like something of an antidote to, or at least a refuge from, arguably the most divisive and <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/07/world/americas/united-states-trump-clinton.html\">poisonous presidential election campaign</a> ever. It is oddly reassuring to discover that there is still a place in the US not transfixed by Clinton\u2019s reckless emails or Trump\u2019s 3am tweets. Here sports comes first, politics nowhere. A baseball cap is still a baseball cap, not a marketing prop for making America great again.</p> <p>Thom Majka, a sales rep who keeps his Indians cap on through every game for good luck, said: \u201cThese fans couldn\u2019t care less about the election. Every day it gets nastier and uglier, not even talking about the issues. It\u2019s a breath of fresh air to have something as easy as playing a baseball game. It\u2019s like taking a shower: you\u2019re all cleaned up.\u201d</p> <p>The Democratic and Republican nominees have historically high unpopularity ratings. Their contest has been extraordinary rancorous, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/10/presidential-debate-trump-bully-clinton\">including a tense debate</a>in which Clinton castigated Trump over allegations of sexual assault and Trump threatened to jail his opponent. The blowhard billionaire\u2019s appeal to authoritarianism and cries of rigging have led some to fear an existential threat to the republic.</p> <p>But baseball, as American as jazz, as regular as the seasons, goes on. It is the most <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/apr/09/american-exceptionalism-us-election-2016-baseball-lincoln-walt-whitman\">storied and soulful of US sports</a>. It survived the second world war when Franklin D Roosevelt declared: \u201cI honestly feel that it would be best for the country to keep baseball going.\u201d After reaching the World Series at last, Cubs manager Joe Maddon watched the Kevin Costner movie Field of Dreams and wept. While pro football is by far more popular, baseball is cultural bedrock, a social safety valve for a fractured nation.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/29/world-series-chicago-cubs-cleveland-indians\">World Series trumps presidential election in two title-starved midwest cities</a> </p> </aside> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-10-29T16:48:33.020Z\">at 5.48pm BST</time></p>  </div>"

We hope this situation changes, and that we are both willing to move forward together in the future.

He\u2019s undermining the entire democratic tradition.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/sep/21/born-to-run-by-bruce-springsteen-review\">Born to Run by Bruce Springsteen review \u2013 inside the mind of the Boss</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Springsteen was speaking at an invitation-only event for European press at the Institute of Contemporary Arts in London to promote his autobiography, Born to Run. When asked by host Antoine de Caunes to explain to Europeans the appeal of Trump, Springsteen replied: \u201cNobody\u2019s been able to explain that.\u201d<br></p> <p>Springsteen also paid further tribute to Bob Dylan, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/oct/13/bob-dylan-deserves-to-win-nobel-prize-literature\">following the latter winning the Nobel prize in literature</a>. \u201cLike a Rolling Stone was the first time I heard a version of my country that felt naggingly real,\u201d he said. \u201cLong after all of us are forgotten, Bob\u2019s work is going to be ringing out loud and clear.\u201d He contrasted Dylan\u2019s writing favourably with his own work: \u201cBob\u2019s certainly a poet. I\u2019m a hardworking journeyman.\u201d</p> <p>Born to Run dealt extensively with Springsteen\u2019s family, covering not just his relationship with his parents and grandparents, but also the changes parenthood had wrought on his own life. He said the final section of the book, \u201cwriting about everyone you know now\u201d, was the hardest to write. \u201cI showed my kids the things I wrote about them,\u201d he said. \u201cPatti [Scialfa, his wife] and I discussed that section of the book and she didn\u2019t change anything, [though] she wasn\u2019t necessarily comfortable with everything. There were some things I wasn\u2019t comfortable with myself. But she gave me a lot of room to explore.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/sep/25/bruce-springsteen-autobiography-born-to-run-book\">Bruce Springsteen \u2013 five things we learned from his autobiography, Born to Run</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Discussing how his troubled relationship with his father had affected his own parenting, he spoke of how people honour their own parents by trying to steer away from the things they had difficulty with and by passing on the things they did well. \u201cThe difficult thing was not having a role model to pass on what it meant to be a good parent,\u201d he said. That meant being a father \u201cdid not come naturally: the suspension of deep personal time; the giving over of yourself at any moment of the day. I was used to my work taking over my time. It was my sacred space. To have \u2018Hey! I need a ride to Billy\u2019s house,\u2019 was something it took me a while to get used to. But I have a good relationship with my kids. I wouldn\u2019t say I was perfect, but I did OK.\u201d</p> <p>He spoke, too, about how playing live had helped him cope with the depression that had struck him at intervals over the past 30 years. Playing such long sets \u2013 Springsteen routinely goes well past three hours when performing with the E Street Band \u2013 meant he would be \u201ctoo tired to be depressed. To be depressed you need to have certain amount of energy, to go hunting through the weeds. There\u2019s also a great centring element that wards off [the effects of depression]. It hardens your centre; that wards off self doubt and the unproductive questioning that comes with depression.\u201d</p>",

But the avalanche of revelations detailing Trump\u2019s behavior toward women, including a growing number allegations of sexual assault, appear to have pushed Porter over the edge \u2013 ready to cast a ballot for Hillary Clinton.<br></p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe I\u2019m saying that, but yes,\u201d she said. Without suburban women like her, Trump\u2019s route to the White House looks hard to navigate.</p> <p>Since the recording of Trump emerged, Republicans and right-leaning independents everywhere have found themselves soul-searching as they vacillate between party and principle. But in the battleground of New Hampshire, a state that holds the distinction of being the first in US history to have an all-female delegation of congresswomen and senators, Trump\u2019s latest controversy is, for some female voters, perhaps the final straw.</p> <p>A number of women who spoke with the Guardian at the strip malls of the Manchester suburbs said they were deeply troubled by Trump\u2019s remarks, even as they confessed to still being torn over their choices.</p> <p>Hope Grugnali, a 38-year-old resident of Amherst, contemplated what effect Trump\u2019s vulgar language might have on her three children.<br></p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m a woman and I have a daughter, and I don\u2019t want people to treat her disrespectfully,\u201d Grugnali said, as she clutched a pair of children\u2019s shoes in the aisles of a discount store.<br></p> <p>\u201cI also have sons,\u201d she added, \u201cand I don\u2019t want them to think they can go around treating a woman like that, either.\u201d<br></p> <p>Grugnali identified herself as an independent who was initially drawn to the former Florida governor Jeb Bush but ultimately voted for the Vermont senator Bernie Sanders in the state\u2019s open primary. She had not yet settled on voting for Clinton, but described the impact of the Trump tape as \u201cterrible\u201d.<br></p> <p>\u201cI think that Donald Trump is worse than anyone, so it\u2019s anyone but him.\u201d<br></p> <p>Laura Rexford, 37, offered a similar response. \u201cIf we condone what he\u2019s saying, what about that guy who raped an unconscious girl?\u201d she said, invoking the sexual assault of an unconscious woman by a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/jun/29/stanford-sex-assault-case-victim-blaming\">Stanford University swimmer</a> outside a fraternity house last year. \u201cDo Trump\u2019s comments make that OK?\u201d</p> <p>Rexford, too, is an independent who views neither major-party candidate favorably but said it would be wasting her vote not to cast a ballot for one of them. In spite of her trust issues with Clinton, she said she was beginning to lean toward her: \u201cI don\u2019t think he has the ability to be president.\u201d</p> <p>Following numerous shakeups in his campaign, Trump <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/17/donald-trump-stephen-bannon-breitbart-news-kellyanne-conway\">hired as his campaign manager Kellyanne Conway</a>, a Republican strategist whose background was heavy in its emphasis on helping the party communicate with female voters. Briefly, he showed signs of message discipline, bound mostly to a teleprompter in August and September, and embarking upon what his campaign described as outreach toward minorities.</p> <p>Republican operatives outside the Trump campaign said it was a shift in tone designed to make suburban women see past his inflammatory rhetoric and feel comfortable voting for him.<br></p> <p>But then came the tape. Dozens of Republican elected officials <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/08/donald-trump-list-of-republicans-reject-support-endorsement\">rescinded their endorsements of Trump</a>, with some even calling upon the nominee to step aside.<br></p> <p>The New Hampshire senator Kelly Ayotte, one of the more vulnerable Republicans facing re-election in November, was the first to withdraw her support for Trump after the tape emerged.<br></p> <p>But her opponent, the Democratic governor, Maggie Hassan, has cast Ayotte\u2019s decision to renounce Trump as one of \u201cpolitical calculation\u201d. \u201cShe stood by Donald Trump as he not only insulted women, but insulted a Gold Star family [who lost a son in the Iraq War], insulted people with disabilities,\u201d Hassan said on Wednesday after touring a pin manufacturing plant in Ayotte\u2019s hometown of Nashua.</p> <p>Hassan also seized upon Ayotte\u2019s response, in a debate just days before the release of the tape, when asked if Trump was a role model. After stumbling around her answer, Ayotte said he \u201cabsolutely\u201d was \u2013 a characterization she immediately retracted, but not before the damage had been done.</p> <p>Ayotte held her own conversation with reporters in Manchester on Wednesday, after attending a ceremony for fallen police officers. On a television screen behind her, an attack ad by Hassan tied her to Trump while featuring her \u201crole model\u201d comment.<br></p> <p>Ayotte, who spent much of the last year condemning Trump\u2019s statements, said she made the decision to revoke her support \u201cas a matter of principle\u201d. \u201cThat\u2019s more important to me than winning an election,\u201d the senator said.</p> <p>Clinton holds a five-point edge over Trump in New Hampshire based on <a href=\"http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/pollster/2016-new-hampshire-president-trump-vs-clinton\">the Huffington Post\u2019s pollster model</a>, which takes an average of publicly available surveys.</p> <p>A <a href=\"https://www.uml.edu/docs/TOPLINE%20-%20UMassLowell-7NEWS%20NH%20GENERAL%2020161013_tcm18-262711.pdf\">UMass Lowell/7 News poll</a> released in the wake of Trump\u2019s offensive tape found that more than four in five likely New Hampshire voters had either heard his comments or discussed them with others. While 66% said it did not make a difference, 30% said they were less likely to vote for Trump \u2013 with women more inclined than men to drop their support for the Republican nominee.<br></p> <p>Trump has spent the past week waging scorched earth warfare against the Republican lawmakers who spurned him, while also seeking to discredit the women who have accused him of sexual assault. He has also insulted the physical appearance of some of his accusers and questioned their motivations for coming forward now.</p> <p>While it\u2019s improbable that Trump\u2019s base would alone be enough to carry him over the finish line on 8 November, it may be all that he has.<br></p> <p>As dusk fell upon the historic downtown of Nashua, Jean and Lise Parent, a married couple, were wrapping up the day inside their property management office.

In February, Iowa held its caucuses, marking the traditional start to the primary process whereby each party chooses its candidate for president. Trump came second, losing to the Texas senator Ted Cruz. No one was very surprised. Cruz is a Christian conservative, and Iowa\u2019s Republicans often pick Christian conservatives. Trump was a thrice-married New Yorker more familiar with mammon than with God. But to Trump there could be only one explanation.</p> <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/694879900256354304\">\u201cTed Cruz didn\u2019t win Iowa, he stole it,\u201d</a> Trump tweeted. \u201cThat is why all of the polls were so wrong and why he got far more votes than anticipated. Bad!\u201d Forty-five minutes later, Trump <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/694890328273346560\">tweeted again</a>: \u201cBased on the fraud committed by Senator Ted Cruz during the Iowa Caucus, either a new election should take place or Cruz results nullified.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"ec3918044c146e5be6dbf464107176bfac0ad82d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ec3918044c146e5be6dbf464107176bfac0ad82d/0_0_1522_2048/743.jpg\" alt=\"Trump Taj Mahal in Atlantic City\" width=\"743\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018His assorted bankruptcies and collapses were never his fault\u2019 ... the Trump Taj Mahal in Atlantic City, New Jersey, one of the Republican candidate\u2019s many expensive failures.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ted Thai/Life Images Collection/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The basis of this claim was a release by the Cruz campaign falsely notifying Iowans that rival conservative candidate Ben Carson had dropped out of the race and urging Carson supporters to back Cruz instead. It might have been an innocent mistake or perhaps a dirty trick, typical of primary season. Either way, it was enough to allow Trump to claim he was robbed \u2013 and to give the US a glimpse of Trump\u2019s modus operandi. When he loses, he claims immediately that the game is rigged.</p> <p>He\u2019s doing it again now. His current stump speech alternates between claiming that the women accusing him of sexual assault were too unattractive for him to abuse and warning his supporters that the Democrats and the press are colluding to steal the presidency from him. As he <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/787699930718695425\">tweeted on Sunday</a>: \u201cThe election is absolutely being rigged by the dishonest and distorted media pushing Crooked Hillary \u2013 but also at many polling places \u2013 SAD.\u201d</p> <p>Some Democrats take a kind of perverse comfort in the fact that Trump is banging this drum again. It\u2019s a sure sign he thinks he\u2019s losing. (The last time he talked of ballot rigging was in August, when Hillary Clinton opened up a big lead.) It seems to be his way of getting his excuses in early, ensuring that no one brands him a loser on 9 November.</p> <p>Trump might also be laying the ground for a post-election career in which he sets himself up as the champion of a diehard Trumpian rump within the Republican party or perhaps as the head of a new media empire \u2013 Trump News Network \u2013 that will outflank Fox News on the hard right. Either way, he understands that there is no more potent variety of political rocketfuel than a righteous sense of grievance. Trump is priming those who are now crying \u201cLock her up!\u201d to bellow \u201cWe was robbed!\u201d</p> <p>But this comes at a cost that has made plenty of Americans \u2013 Republicans among them \u2013 anxious. Central to the self-image of the US is its status as a self-governing democracy. Election fraud is meant to be something that happens in other countries, with the US casting itself as monitor or even referee, determining which overseas ballots are free, fair and legitimate. Trump\u2019s claims, pre-emptively challenging the integrity of a presidential election, seek to upend that notion, challenging the legitimacy of America\u2019s own system. And they seem to be striking a chord: one survey released on Monday found that <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2016/10/poll-41-percent-of-voters-say-the-election-could-be-stolen-from-trump-229871\">41% of Americans</a> believe the election could be stolen from Trump.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e78ed80d246e2a53543c14062d086807c65ceab9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e78ed80d246e2a53543c14062d086807c65ceab9/0_0_4700_2918/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Trump supporter outside the CNN building in Hollywood, California\" width=\"1000\" height=\"621\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018If Trump wants to claim media bias in this election, he could make a strong case that the bias has been in his favour\u2019 \u2013 a Trump supporter outside the CNN building in Hollywood, California.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Frederic J Brown/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Despite the US\u2019s view of itself, this is not uncharted terrain. <a href=\"http://dailysignal.com/2016/08/08/rigged-election-a-history-of-presidential-candidates-whove-made-allegations/\">Claims of rigged contests have surfaced before</a>. In 1824, a narrow race was settled when the House of Representatives made John Quincy Adams president; partisans suspected behind-the-scenes dealmaking. In 1876, a similar dead heat left supporters of Samuel J Tilden furious when he won the popular vote but was denied the presidency thanks to the arcane mechanics of the electoral college. Amid allegations of multiple voting and shredded ballots, the incumbent president Ulysses Grant warned \u2013 in words that resonate today \u2013 that \u201ceither party can afford to be disappointed by the result, but the country cannot afford to have the result tainted by suspicion of illegal or false returns\u201d.</p> <p>More recently, some Republicans remained convinced that John F Kennedy was helped to his narrow victory over Richard Nixon in 1960 by ballot-tampering involving the mafia in Chicago, which helped him win the crucial state of Illinois. But what makes Trump\u2019s challenge different is that he is contesting the election before it has happened. This has made many fearful that the fury Trump is stoking could get out of control. They worry that, should the reality TV star lose, things could get violent. They point to the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SheriffClarke/status/787314656641712128\">tweet posted on Saturday by David Clarke Jr</a>, a vocal Trump supporter and the sheriff of Milwaukee county in Wisconsin. Alongside a picture of an angry mob wielding weapons, Clarke wrote: \u201cIt\u2019s incredible that our institutions of gov, WH, Congress, DOJ [Department of Justice], and big media are corrupt &amp; all we do is bitch. Pitchforks and torches time.\u201d In this climate, what if one crucial state is particularly close? Few have forgotten the photo-finish in Florida in 2000.

One legal scholar dedicated years to studying the issue and could find only 31 cases of voter fraud out of more than a billion votes cast. As the ThinkProgress thinktank <a href=\"https://thinkprogress.org/donald-trump-claims-polling-places-are-rigged-12ba70beb551#.bk0wz8ix8\">has noted</a>: \u201cIowa\u2019s Republican secretary of state uncovered zero cases of voter impersonation at the polls during a two-year investigation.\u201d Even the <a href=\"http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/10/16/election-rigged-not/\">hard right Breitbart website</a> \u2013 so close to Trump that its boss, Steve Bannon, is the chief executive of the Trump campaign \u2013 had to admit that, \u201cgiven the sheer variety of jurisdictions that run a typical presidential election, the nationwide effect of voter fraud may be much harder to measure, and probably small\u201d.</p> <p>Conceding that point, Breitbart then attempted to redefine \u201crigged\u201d away from the mechanics of ballot-stuffing and the like and on to the terrain of media bias. If the election is being stolen from Trump, runs the argument, it\u2019s because the press is, in effect, acting as an ally of Clinton by being so hostile to the Republican nominee. Just look at the chorus of women assembled by the Washington Post, the New York Times, the Palm Beach Post and People magazine last week, all of whom alleged that had Trump sexually assaulted them. Surely that represents a coordinated attack, weeks before election day, designed to damage Trump and help Clinton?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5d4842ee22fdb6878bf26154efe5838a156fe99c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5d4842ee22fdb6878bf26154efe5838a156fe99c/0_0_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Trump supports at a Hillary Clinton event in Miami, Florida\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Trump supports at a Hillary Clinton event in Miami, Florida.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Cristobal Herrera/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But it\u2019s a perilously thin argument, for the media all but created the Donald Trump candidacy. During the primary campaign, they lavished attention and airtime on him in a way that squeezed out all his rivals. He only had to pick up the phone to be on the air with Fox or MSNBC, a privilege not extended to Jeb Bush or Marco Rubio. His rallies were carried live and at length; theirs were lucky to get a 10-second clip. One study showed that while Bush spent tens of millions on TV ads, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/16/upshot/measuring-donald-trumps-mammoth-advantage-in-free-media.html\">Trump got $2bn-worth of airtime absolutely free</a>.</p> <p>But it was more than just quantity. The media allowed Trump to get away with lies they would have stamped on had Clinton been the culprit. For example, in recent weeks, Trump has been challenged on his wholly false claim to have opposed the invasion of Iraq. (At the time, he told shockjock Howard Stern on the record that he approved of it.) But, for many months, the supposedly liberal media, especially television, allowed him to get away with that fiction. If Trump wants to claim media bias in this election, he could make a strong case that the bias has been in his favour.</p> <p>The other limb of the \u201crigged\u201d argument is that the forces of Hillary have already fixed one contest this election season, corruptly engineering the Democratic primary race to defeat Bernie Sanders. There\u2019s no doubt that the rules \u2013 and the power given to party officials as \u201csuperdelegates\u201d \u2013 favoured Clinton, nor that Clinton had much of the party machine on her side. That\u2019s why Sanders, who wasn\u2019t even a Democrat a year before he sought the nomination \u2013 he sits in the Senate as an independent \u2013 was always the underdog. But even the most diligent hacking of Democrats\u2019 emails \u2013 undertaken, the FBI believes, by Russian intelligence and released in recent days by WikiLeaks \u2013 has not produced evidence that Sanders was defrauded of the nomination, rather than simply being outmuscled.</p> <p>Indeed, you could make a decent case that an attempt to rig the 2016 election is underway \u2013 one designed to hurt Clinton and help Trump. WikiLeaks would be a key exhibit in that case. Julian Assange has been consistent in leaking documents that embarrass the Democratic nominee, yet strangely reluctant to publish any paperwork that might discomfort Trump. You would have thought WikiLeaks might have been able to produce the elusive Trump tax returns, for example, but no luck.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8aefd75b63026831ca1f54e46a27b26d41dc5868\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8aefd75b63026831ca1f54e46a27b26d41dc5868/285_0_4087_2565/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Donald Trump\" width=\"1000\" height=\"628\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018During the primary campaign ... he only had to pick up the phone to be on the air with Fox or MSNBC.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chris Pizzello/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>You would put the media in the dock, too, replaying all the softball interviews <a href=\"http://www.usnews.com/opinion/articles/2016-09-08/nbcs-matt-lauer-receives-bad-reviews-for-his-forum-with-clinton-and-trump\">Trump has been granted</a> \u2013 glossing over his multiple lies, his bankruptcies and his overt bigotries \u2013 while Clinton was grilled again and again over her use of a private email server. But your argument would not need to end there. You would also look at what\u2019s actually set to happen \u2013 and already happening \u2013 at the heart of the matter: the ballot itself.</p> <p>There is a mountain of evidence, going back years, of voter suppression: the deliberate exclusion of large groups of voters from the electoral rolls. <a href=\"http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/features/the-gops-stealth-war-against-voters-w435890\">Rolling Stone magazine has reported</a> on a programme designed to purge rolls of voters wrongly eligible to vote in more than one state. It sounds technical, but it just so happens that the programme \u201cdisproportionately threatens solid Democratic constituencies: young, black, Hispanic and Asian-American voters \u2013 with some of the biggest possible purges underway in Ohio and North Carolina, two crucial swing states with tight Senate races.\u201d</p> <p>Few have been more vigilant on this subject than <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ariberman\">Ari Berman</a>, the author of Give us the Ballot: the Struggle for Voting Rights in America. Every week, he brings word of another scheme by Republican authorities at state level \u2013 and, remember, Republicans are in charge in most of the 50 states \u2013 to suppress voting among those likely to vote Democratic. Recently, he reported on Wisconsin\u2019s failure to issue <a href=\"https://www.thenation.com/article/wisconsin-is-systematically-failing-to-provide-the-photo-ids-required-to-vote-in-november/\">voter-identification documents</a> to people who needed them, a failure that disproportionately affects black voters. Some of his revelations are <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AriBerman/status/785894221349650432\">jaw-dropping</a>, among them the story of an Indian-American woman, a US citizen since she was eight years old, who was told she had to spend $345 on naturalisation papers just to be able to exercise her right to vote.</p> <p>Every four years there are incidents like this, such as polling places in African-American areas with too few voting machines, causing long lines. Were that not enough of a deterrent to voting, this year \u2013 thanks to Trump\u2019s call for groups of vigilante polling monitors to take up their positions in urban areas \u2013 plenty of minority voters might well feel intimidated as well as simply put off.</p> <p>So, Democrats could cry foul if they wanted to. They have the recent memory of Florida 2000, when Republican state officials stood in the way of a thorough recount, ensuring that George W Bush held on to a razor-thin lead. They could also point to Ohio 2004, where questions linger <a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/media/2005/11/recounting-ohio\">over Bush\u2019s defeat of John Kerry</a>.</p> <p>But most who cherish US democracy choose not to go there. They prefer to defend the integrity of the system. They know the peril that could befall the republic if nearly half the country believe the person occupying the White House is there fraudulently. Yet that is precisely the chaos Trump is seeking to create. He is proving that Donald Trump represents a threat to the stability of the US even if he loses. But we should remember: he never loses.</p>",

  "<p>A cook. An ornament. And perhaps something else depending on the mood. During a recent press conference with the German chancellor Angela Merkel, Nigeria\u2019s president, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/muhammadu-buhari\">Muhammadu Buhari</a>, was clearly miffed at being asked about <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-37642282\">criticism of his government\u2019s performance</a> by his wife, Aisha Buhari. He responded by reminding Nigeria\u2019s first lady where her place was: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/14/nigerias-president-says-wife-belongs-to-my-kitchen\">in his kitchen, his living room and \u201cthe other room\u201d</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/14/nigerias-president-says-wife-belongs-to-my-kitchen\">Nigeria's president says wife 'belongs to my kitchen'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There has been a lot of media focus on male entitlement and the treatment of women in recent weeks. From the former candidate for the Republican presidential nomination \u2013 the outwardly gentlemanly Ben Carson <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election-us-2016-37661793\">who sought to silence a female journalist</a> asking a question he found annoying \u2013 to the proudly abrasive Donald Trump, who obviously has no regard for women. In between these high-profile examples are the countless women whose voices are lost, silenced or taken away from them in societies such as Nigeria where there is less media and societal focus on gender equality.</p> <p>While Buhari\u2019s statement was swiftly excused by his spokesman as a joke, the issue of a woman\u2019s place in contemporary society hardly seems comedy material for a president. Besides, in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsPvZbq912s\">a later interview</a> Buhari boldly reiterated his stance, saying his wife\u2019s most important duty was to \u201clook after\u201d him and the home \u201ceven if she\u2019s working\u201d. The sad truth is that while the Nigerian president\u2019s comments could be dismissed as the rantings of a 73-year-old with outdated views, in reality his statements accurately reflect widely held beliefs in a stubbornly patriarchal society.</p> <p>His comments came just three days after the <a href=\"http://www.un.org/en/events/girlchild/background.shtml\">International Day of the Girl Child</a>, meant to focus on the plight of disadvantaged girls all over the world. Unicef statistics <a href=\"http://data.unicef.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/UNICEF-Child-Marriage-Brochure-High-Single_246.pdf\">reveal</a> Nigeria is home to the largest number of child brides in Africa, with 23 million girls and women having been <a href=\"http://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/top-news/212730-katsina-emirate-says-marriage-abducted-14-year-old-emirs-aide-irreversible.html\">married in childhood</a>.

No woman has ever been elected governor in any of Nigeria\u2019s 36 states, a female president or even vice-president remains unimaginable to most. Leadership is generally not associated with women. This sad reality is all the more reason Buhari should realise there are concrete implications for how his words could affect the aspirations of young Nigerian girls.</p> <p>Buhari, standing beside Merkel, one of the most prominent leaders in the world, who also happens to be a woman, squandered the opportunity to send a positive message to young Nigerian girls on the achievable. Furthermore, his assertion that his wife\u2019s major role is to \u201clook after\u201d him serves to validate the widespread perception in Nigerian society that women exist merely to make men\u2019s lives easier.</p> <p>As is often the case in strongly patriarchal societies, many women have internalised the male point of view and accepted it as common sense. On social media, some Nigerian women have even condemned Buhari\u2019s wife for daring to criticise him in public, saying she should stand by her man no matter what, the way Hillary Clinton did.</p> <p>Such logic is mind-boggling as these women fail to see Buhari\u2019s statements have wider-reaching implications that affect them as well. Whether they agree with Aisha Buhari\u2019s political views or not does not detract from the underlying disdain for a woman who dared to speak contentiously.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Any idea of feminism is still viewed very suspiciously in Nigeria \u2013 even by women</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Any idea of feminism is still viewed very suspiciously in Nigeria \u2013 even by women. I know some very well-educated professional females who view feminism as a western ideology aiming to usurp the rightful dominant role of the man in society. These women are sometimes highly successful in the corporate or business world, but still believe that once they get home, they need to dance around their husbands, be it in the kitchen or \u201cthe other room\u201d, just to keep them happy. I also know hardworking, uneducated women who do strenuous, grimy jobs outside the home and also undertake a second or even a third shift in the home, again, to keep the man happy. They believe this is their duty as women. I know many women who absolutely hate cooking, yet they do it out of fear they would be considered bad wives by society if they didn\u2019t.</p> <p>What\u2019s important to remember is that however Nigerians choose to interpret Buhari\u2019s comments, behind such statements that demean and relegate women to positions of servitude is a woman or girl belittled. The statements of the most powerful man in the country also have an impact on how millions of impressionable boys will tailor their expectations of women. Millions of Nigerian girls struggle every day to find their place in a male-dominated society where they are constantly told they need to stifle and adapt their dreams to the expectations of an unashamedly patriarchal society. The last thing they need are flippant statements from their president.</p>",

  "<p>In any other election year, a massive battle involving US force to seize a city of hundreds of thousands from the Islamic State might affect how voters choose their next president. But 2016, defense analysts and political advisers observing the mid-October campaign for Mosul point out, is no normal election year.<br></p> <p>Two years after senior US officers described the fight for Mosul as \u201c<a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2014/10/12/politics/isis-baghdad-martin-dempsey/\">decisive</a>\u201d \u2013 something experts have become wary of predicting in Iraq \u2013 the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/17/us-lloyd-austin-iraq-emphasis-airstrikes-isis-syria-kobani\">frequently delayed </a>battle for Iraq\u2019s second city is under way. Should Iraqi ground forces and US warplanes prove successful, Isis will lose its final stronghold in the country.</p> <p>The fight is expected to be the toughest in Iraq since Isis conquered the city in June 2014. Isis is estimated to have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/14/last-battle-against-isis-in-iraq-forces-mass-for-mosul-assault\">6,000 fighters</a> prepared for close urban combat. The US military\u2019s spokesman for the war called Mosul \u201cby far the largest challenge the [Iraqis] have undertaken to date\u201d, far outstripping the battles to retake Ramadi and Fallujah in 2015 and 2016. Already civilians are fleeing the northern Iraqi city, and the United Nations is bracing for <a href=\"http://www.middleeasteye.net/news/battle-mosul-aid-agencies-warn-humanitarian-disaster-241710471\">as many as 1 million refugees</a>.</p> <p>The American public is expected to pay minimal attention.</p> <p>\u201cCompared to domestic issues, the electorate doesn\u2019t really care very much about this and probably is not following what\u2019s going on in Mosul in particular,\u201d said Steven Simon, who was mideast director for Barack Obama\u2019s National Security Council from 2011 to 2012.</p> <p>The election calendar has been a factor in previous wars, even previous wars in Iraq. Only after George W Bush secured reelection in 2004 did the second battle of Fallujah unfold. But this time, according to a former Iraq adviser to both George W Bush and Obama, the differences between the second and third US wars in Iraq overwhelm their similarities, as do their electoral implications.</p> <p>While the US is providing a significant advisory presence for the Iraqi military, as well as a special-operations presence in the shadows, its primary combat contribution is aerial. With Iraqi forces on the ground doing the bleeding and dying, the American public does not consider the Iraq issue urgent, despite anxieties about the group known as Isis, Isil or Daesh featuring significantly in the 2016 election.</p> <p>\u201cThis time, it\u2019s not a divisive issue. There\u2019s not a huge lobby in the US for not having the Iraqis fight Isil in Iraq,\u201d said Doug Ollivant, a former NSC staffer and army veteran of the second Iraq war, who discloses that he has business interests in southern Iraq.</p> <p>\u201cWhile the two candidates would tell you they probably approach the battle of Mosul differently, I don\u2019t think anyone takes this seriously. There are not going to be, at least, many publicly acknowledged Americans directly involved, so it\u2019s difficult for me to see this taking a turn that has a significant impact on the presidential election.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>If Trump were arguing to do nothing, then a protracted campaign would help him.

A Trump rally would be great, and quite possibly dangerous.\u201d</p> <p>What about Hillary Clinton art? Apart from a few pieces in the Steiner exhibition, the Democratic nominee has not seen a flood of artworks created out of inspiration or dread of her presidency. She\u2019s too much of a politician to inspire artists, says Steiner. \u201cI think Bernie Sanders probably would have inspired more, almost fan art,\u201d he added.</p>",

A poll by Emerson University and conducted between October 4 and 8, putting the two candidates at a dead heat on 43% each, though a new GOP poll conducted October 11-12 showing Clinton with a six point lead implies that recent allegations of sexual assault made against Trump may be hurting him; early voting begins here in just over a week, on October 22.</p> <p>The so-called rurals, which is the term loosely used by locals to mean everywhere outside of Clark and Washoe counties \u2013 within which lie Las Vegas and Reno/Sparks, and therefore most of the state\u2019s population \u2013 are as solidly Republican as can be. </p> <p>There is a way it plays out, one Republican party insider said, in which Washoe County would be the fulcrum on which the whole election balances.</p> <p>\u201cThis county makes all the difference in the world for the state,\u201d said Kim Bacchus, the president of the Northern Nevada Republican Women\u2019s Pac. \u201cThe rurals are always solidly conservative; Clark County, with two thirds of our population, is fairly solidly Democrat. So \u2026 Washoe County has always been the determiner.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy is Washoe a big deal for the presidential election?\u201d she continued. \u201cBecause without Washoe County, Trump loses. Period.\u201d</p> <p>In 2012, Washoe County went blue, voting for Barack Obama over Mitt Romney by a slim margin of around 6,000 votes. But since then, the town has seen an influx of people moving in along the I-80 corridor from California, many of them conservatives looking to escape the Golden State\u2019s liberal politics. In other parts of town, attitudes toward Washington DC have degraded from distrust to contempt.</p> <p>The polarization is especially glaring within the Republican party. The Washoe County party is barely on speaking terms with the state party, insiders told the Guardian. \u201cIt\u2019s October of a presidential election year and they\u2019re doing nothing to elect candidates,\u201d Bacchus said of the county party.</p> <p>\u201cThey can\u2019t raise money, have no message, they have no volunteers, they have no plan for getting the vote out, they\u2019re doing nothing. It\u2019s just a little club, and they have a little clubhouse to meet in until they run out of money for rent,\u201d she continued. </p> <p>Her Pac deals with the candidates directly now; she circumvents the county party entirely. Many others do the same. \u201cSome Democrats I talk to say \u2018I\u2019m just not gonna vote for that candidate,\u2019\u201d Bacchus said. \u201cSome Republicans I speak to say the same \u2013 \u2018I\u2019m not gonna vote for that candidate.\u2019\u201d </p> <p>She shrugged. \u201cPeople are sick of politics,\u201d she said.</p> <p>As for Sanguinetti, the manager of Duds and Suds, his disgust with the toxicity of 2016\u2019s political discourse has driven him, for the first time in his life, to abandon mainstream politics entirely. He\u2019s planning on voting Libertarian in November.</p>",

As we speak the Labor left is having a specially convened caucus meeting to deal with tensions that have boiled over since <strong>Bill Shorten</strong> last Friday night backed his friend and factional ally, the controversial lawyer <strong>Kimberley Kitching</strong>, to replace the departing <strong>Stephen Conroy</strong>.<br></p> <p>Let\u2019s keep this as simple as possible. Tensions in the Victorian left have been bubbling away for months, ever since the majority of the faction tried to run the veteran leftwing powerbroker, <strong>Kim Carr</strong>, off the front bench. Folks aligned with Carr have been cranky that some of their Victorian colleagues lined up with colleagues in Sydney to try and remove Carr from the frontbench after the election.</p> <p>Let\u2019s call that a pre-existing condition.</p> <p>Then there was the Kitching transaction last week. Victorian Labor has been absolutely off the long run since Shorten decided he wanted Kitching in the Senate. Normally sedate people were quite literally tearing their hair out over that turn of events. Shorten was advised in the strongest possible terms not to bring Kitching to Canberra, that it would stir up animosities in the Labor caucus.</p> <p>It appears to have done exactly that. <strong>Gavin Marshall</strong> (a long time Carr ally) decided to tell Fairfax Media early on Monday that he might come after a couple of sitting MPs in the left when preselection time rolled around. He named <strong>Andrew Giles</strong> and <strong>Catherine King</strong>, the shadow health minister. </p> <p>Folks should know by way of background that Marshall lost a position he held in the last parliament, deputy Senate president, in the fight over Carr and the front bench. Clearly he\u2019s not that happy about it, and thought he might have a vent about people he views as being disloyal.</p> <p>The non-Carr left is now unhappy to put it mildly, hence tonight\u2019s special caucus meeting to determine whether peace can be declared, or whether things escalate.<br></p> <p>We can cut to the chase here, now all the background has been declared.<strong> Bill Shorten is the leader of the Labor party because he was underpinned institutionally by support from Conroy (now departed) and Carr (now the subject of acrimony from his factional fellow travellers).</strong><br></p> <p>That underpinning has been eroded since Conroy\u2019s departure. The caucus is something of a tinderbox after the Kitching decision. That might sound like an exaggeration, but it isn\u2019t. <strong>Malcolm Turnbull</strong> once talked about exciting times. Seems, they are catching.<br></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-10-17T07:06:52.933Z\">at 8.06am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-58046ba7e4b01ffb8ffcc70b\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-17T06:12:49.816Z\">7.12am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Xenophon to Abbott on 18c: no, no and no</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Nick Xenophon</strong> has responded to <strong>Tony Abbott</strong>\u2019s suggestion that changes to section 18C would \u201creadily\u201d pass if the Nick Xenophon Team supported them.<br></p> <p>Asked if his party was considering supporting a change, Xenophon told Guardian Australia: \u201cthe answer is no, no and no.

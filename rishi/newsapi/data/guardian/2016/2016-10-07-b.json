  "<p>Donald Trump faces a must-win presidential debate on Sunday night after a torrid 10 days left him trailing Hillary Clinton in opinion polls in key battleground states.<br></p> <p>With early voting already under way, the Republican candidate <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/us/general_election_trump_vs_clinton-5491.html\">has seen his September polling gains wiped out</a> and is fast running out of time to shift momentum back his way in the race for the White House.</p> <p>A live debate always raises the prospect of the ill-disciplined Trump allowing Clinton to get under his skin and making a gaffe that could throw his campaign into disarray. The bombastic billionaire stirred fresh controversy on Friday when, in a meeting with a union representing border patrol agents, he floated a new conspiracy theory, saying that immigration officials were trying to expand the pool of American voters.</p> <p>Trump directly challenged the media to report his remarks, which followed comments by union vice-president Art Del Cueto in a meeting in Trump Tower in New York. Del Cueto told the celebrity businessman: \u201cImmigration is so tied up with trying to get the people who are on the waiting list to hurry up and get them their immigration status corrected ... so they can go ahead and vote before the election.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBig statement, fellas,\u201d Trump said, motioning to reporters. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to write it. That\u2019s huge. But they\u2019re letting people pour into the country so they can go and vote.\u201d</p> <p>Clinton was widely judged the winner of the first debate. Both candidates face a test of stagecraft on Sunday in what has become popularly known as a \u201ctown hall\u201d format for their second showdown in St Louis, Missouri, moving around a stage with handheld microphones as they field questions from voters.</p> <p>The first town hall debate was held during the 1992 election. As a voter stood to ask George H W Bush about the national debt, the president glanced down at his watch, an image that seemed to reinforce criticism that he lacked empathy. Clinton\u2019s husband Bill won the election.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/25/us-presidential-debates-famous-moments\">Make or break: the defining moments of presidential debates</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In 2000 George W Bush was answering a question on leadership during such a forum when Vice-President Al Gore rose from his chair and walked peculiarly close to his Republican rival. Bush turned and gave Gore a nod and a smile, prompting audience laughter. </p> <p>Rick Tyler, a political analyst and former spokesperson for Republican primary candidate Ted Cruz, said of Trump: \u201cFrom what I can tell from the polls, his prospects in the election are bleak. He\u2019s going to need a game-changing win in the debate if he\u2019s going to stand any chance in November.\u201d </p> <p>But the town hall format will not necessarily suit him. \u201cHe\u2019s just not an impressive performer when it comes to answering people\u2019s questions,\u201d Tyler added. \u201cHe\u2019s not grounded in policy, foreign or domestic. He doesn\u2019t give a lot of thought to issues. He\u2019s missing empathy; when someone asks a question, he has trouble connecting at their level.</p> <p>\u201cI think she\u2019ll win it. She has so much more experience at this. She comes across as cold, but she has more skills than he does.\u201d</p> <p>According to the <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/2016_elections_electoral_college_map.html\">Real Clear Politics polling average</a>, Clinton is currently 4.5 points ahead of her Republican opponent in a two-way race, a poll position that would <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/2016_elections_electoral_college_map.html\">translate to</a> at least 237 of the 270 electoral college votes she needs to win firmly in the bag, with 165 for Trump and 136 to play for. </p> <p>There is a glimmer of hope for Trump, however, in polls that show him down but not out in the key swing states that are likely to determine the election outcome, and that suggest his dismal showing in the first debate had only a marginal impact.</p> <p>A survey by Quinnipiac University on 8 September, taking smaller parties into account, gave Clinton a 46-41% lead over Trump in Florida, 46-43% in North Carolina and 45-41% in Pennsylvania. It had Trump up by 47-42% in Ohio.</p> <p>Peter Brown, assistant director of the Quinnipiac University Polling Institute, told a conference call on Friday: \u201cDebates are obviously the kind of events that make it possible to have election-changing influence. Right now it\u2019s a pretty fair consensus of our polls and other people\u2019s polls that Secretary Clinton seems to have a small lead, maybe three, four, five points nationally.</p> <p>\u201cIn some of the swing states, there\u2019s some results that are just plain different. So we enter the next debate with Mrs Clinton slightly ahead but not gigantically ahead. The other interesting question is how the debates will affect the presidential race.\u201d</p> <p>The Quinnipiac survey found that likely voters said by margins of more than two-to-one that Clinton won the first debate. Brown added: \u201cThe poll taken right after that debate happened found there had been a relatively small increase in support for Mrs Clinton, not nearly as large as one might expected given the overwhelming consensus that Mrs Clinton won that debate.\u201d</p> <p>Brown noted that a large percentage of the electorate in states such as Florida and Ohio will have voted by election day due to early-voting provisions in those states. This is likely to intensify pressure on Trump to arrest Clinton\u2019s momentum.</p> <p>Ahead of Sunday, Trump has reportedly reviewed video of the first presidential debate, and his aides have stressed a need to stay calm and not get riled. He limbered up at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/07/donald-trump-the-clear-winner-in-town-hall-debate-featuring-only-himself\">a real town hall on Thursday night in New Hampshire</a> but did not interact directly with the audience, taking questions only from a moderator.</p> <p>Trump told the small crowd: \u201cThis isn\u2019t practice; this has nothing to do with Sunday. This isn\u2019t practice, we just wanted to be here.\u201d<br></p> <p>And he made fun of Clinton for preparing in depth. \u201cI said, \u2018Forget debate prep.\u2019 I mean, give me a break. She\u2019s resting. She wants to build up her energy for Sunday night. And you know what? That\u2019s fine.

There\u2019s even a \u201cMovement to classify Idiocracy as documentary\u201d with its own <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/MovementToClassifyIdiocracyFilmAsDocumentary/\">Facebook page</a>. </p> <p>On Tuesday night, while the vice-presidential candidates debated, Alamo Drafthouse screened Idiocracy in 45 theaters to packed houses across the country. \u201cIt is all right there, staring you in the face,\u201d Tim League, the founder and CEO of the chain said. \u201cWe are clearly awash in an \u2018Ow, my balls\u2019 electorate\u201d \u2013 a reference to the hit reality TV show within the movie, an assemblage of clips of men getting hit in the testicles.</p> <p>Last week, MASA held their own screening of Idiocracy. Fairey moderated a discussion with Judge (who also co-created HBO\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/apr/29/silicon-valley-satire-mark-zuckerberg-san-francisco-tech-bay-startup\">Silicon Valley</a>), Crews and Dax Shepard, who plays Frito, Joe\u2019s Costco-trained lawyer.</p> <p>\u201cI love the way humor is used in Idiocracy to make the social critique more digestible,\u201d Fairey says. \u201cThe movie is a harsh but necessary indictment of the anti-intellectual culture and politics that seem to become the norm more and more every day.\u201d</p> <p>The artist says that the film\u2019s irony is that it\u2019s \u201ca somewhat lowbrow piece of entertainment about the perils of succumbing to a cultural rejection of anything intellectual or highbrow. In other words, the genius of the film is that it may actually get through to the audience it should reach, rather than just preaching to the intellectual elite.\u201d</p> <p>Asked how Make America Smart Again can promote Idiocracy as cautionary tale if it is a non-partisan group, Fairley said, \u201cMASA is pro-truth and anti-stupidity, which one could argue is partisan in this election because of Trump\u2019s behavior. But let\u2019s face it, members of both parties have lied and appealed to the lowest common denominator. The point is that as voters we need to demand better from all the parties and all the candidates.\u201d</p>",

Earlier, the system reported a trade at $1.1378 \u2013 wildly below the other big platforms. That has since been scrubbed from the system. It is however standing by an absolute low of $1.1491 in a trade at 23.07 GMT \u2013 or 7.07am Hong Kong time, which is when the plunge began.</p> \n   <p>That is not all. Reuters is also publishing a \u201cmarket low\u201d where a \u201cgood amount\u201d \u2013 ie, \u00a35m or more, was traded within a 3 minute window.

Last week, 249,000 people applied for unemployment benefits. The number of people currently receiving unemployment benefits is just a little over 2 million \u2013 levels last seen in 2000.</p> <p>The US labor market and the pace of the country\u2019s economic recovery have come into the spotlight during the presidential election. With wages finally showing some signs of growth after years of being stagnant, many people are still feeling left behind. </p> <p>The energy sector has been hit especially hard over the last year in the wake of low oil prices. Since reaching peak employment in September 2014, employment in the energy sector dropped by more than 220,000 to 632,000. Mining sector employment remain unchanged in September, according to the labor department. </p> <p>This September, US employers announced plans to cut 44,324 jobs \u2013 a 38% increase from August, according to outplacement firm <a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/2016/10/06/us-layoffs-increase-in-september-by-38-percent-from-august-according-to-challenger.html\">Challenger, Gray and Christmas</a>.

In September, average hourly earnings went up by 6 cents to $25.79. Over the year, average hourly earnings have risen by 2.6%. The Obama administration has previously referred to wages as the unfinished part of the economic recovery. </p> <p>Slowing job growth paired with low wages could delay an interest rate hike, according to Paul Ashworth, chief US economist at Capital Economics.</p> <p>\u201cThe Fed isn\u2019t going to be rushing into action when wage growth is that tepid,\u201d he said.</p>",

That we could make this happen without embarrassing ourselves. Instead, we chose to confront the possibility of a historic moment for women with a candidate whose misogyny is so mythic he could have sprung fully-formed from Freud\u2019s skull. Trump is more symbol than person at this point, representing just how juvenile and ridiculous America is when it comes to the way we think about women and leadership.</p> <p>I\u2019m not too hard on myself for the early error in judgment, though. After all, a few years ago Republicans were proactively trying to downplay the party\u2019s sexism.

  "<h2><strong>Unreported World </strong><br>7.30pm, Channel 4</h2> <p>Two episodes into its 32nd series, Unreported World has lost none of its knack for spotting those stories that are engaging in and of themselves, and also reflective of wider trends. Tonight\u2019s documentary sees Marcel Theroux, accompanied by director Daniel Bogado, travel to India to report on the matchmaking enterprises being established by people who have a disability \u2013 an added pressure in a marriage&#xa0;market already warped by a&#xa0;combination of caste, faith and parental expectations. <em>Andrew&#xa0;Mueller</em></p> <h2><strong>Have I Got News for You </strong><br>9pm, BBC1</h2> <p>Arriving for a 52nd series, HIGNFY has rarely been more welcome. Over the next 11 weeks, Ian Hislop and Paul Merton will, as ever, captain the teams skewering the increasing ludicrousness of world affairs. They\u2019ll be running over the US presidential election, too, which is likely to provide ample quarry for some terrifying hilarity. Nick&#xa0;Clegg has a go in the host\u2019s chair, while Kevin Bridges is one of the week\u2019s&#xa0;guest panellists. <em>Ben&#xa0;Arnold</em></p> <h2><strong>People\u2019s History of Pop </strong><br>9pm, BBC4</h2> <p>Pop didn\u2019t hang about in the old days: as host Pauline Black recalls, the Selecter had been away just six weeks on their 1980 US tour, but on their return the new romantics were already in full swing. Tribalism is the watchword for this episode, looking at 1976 to 1985. We meet Clash fans, Durannies&#xa0;and a young girl whose destiny was changed by the Smiths. It\u2019s followed by a documentary on the making of the Wailers\u2019 classic Catch a Fire. <em>Ali&#xa0;Catterall</em></p> <h2>Bob\u2019s Burgers <br>9pm, Comedy Central</h2> <p>Loren Bouchard\u2019s animated sitcom continues to balance snark with sensitivity as the sixth season continues. The first episode of this double-bill concentrates on that childhood staple, the shopping mall Santa. This Claus is a spectacularly grumpy one and needs plenty of convincing to shelve his naughty list. In the second episode, the family unite, fall apart and then just about unite again during an eventful dinner. <em>Phil Harrison</em></p> <h2>Aquarius <br>9pm, Sky Atlantic</h2> <p>Tonight\u2019s double-bill begins with episode seven, in which the tension is eminently bearable following the buildup to a 1969 murder we know David Duchovny\u2019s Sam has no chance of thwarting. Rewind to a year earlier, however, and there\u2019s a needlessly unpleasant scene involving his interrogation of a black maid he suspects of murder. Meanwhile, the Family has a new arrival: Sadie is pregnant. And in episode eight, Sam is confronted by Manson.<em> David Stubbs</em></p> <h2><strong>Still Game </strong><br>9.30pm, BBC1</h2> <p>Another of the recent zombie sitcoms, which is to say a comedy genre looking surprisingly lively after being thought long dead. Ford Kiernan and Greg Hemphill reprise their roles as Scottish pensioners Jack and Victor, two elderly gents occupying themselves with pub and newspaper and Summer Wine-style farce. Tonight, the Futuroo gadget&#xa0;catalogue arrives with the promise of attractive labour-saving devices. But will it create more problems than it solves? <em>John Robinson</em></p> <h2>The Last Leg <br>10pm, Channel 4</h2> <p>Following its daily primetime slot during the Rio Paralympics \u2013 which culminated in Aussie host Adam Hills losing a medals-related bet and getting a rather wonky union jack dyed on his head \u2013 the irreverent news review show returns. Flanked by co-hosts Josh Widdicombe and Alex Brooker, Hills ensures that the humour is pointed but never mean, while the #isitok hashtag remains an object lesson in leveraging social media for laughs. <em>Graeme Virtue</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"497a00a44ad04f7821c75e01029d7cc90853b16d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/497a00a44ad04f7821c75e01029d7cc90853b16d/0_0_1920_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Johnny Depp in Black Mass.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"563\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Johnny Depp in Black Mass.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Warner</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Film choice</h2> <p><strong>Black Mass</strong> (Scott Cooper, 2015) 9.45am, 8pm, Sky Movies Premiere</p> <p>Johnny Depp is all but unrecognisable as the quietly ferocious Boston crime kingpin James \u201cWhitey\u201d Bulger, given licence to do pretty much as he likes thanks to the influence of his senator brother Billy (Benedict Cumberbatch). <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/sep/04/black-mass-review-compelling-true-drama-is-mighty-comeback-for-johnny-depp\" title=\"\">This true-life crime saga makes for a lurid, violent movie</a>, with director Cooper overly reverential towards the work of Scorsese, capo di tutti capi in these matters. <em>Paul Howlett</em></p> <p><strong>London River</strong> (Rachid Bouchareb, 2009) 12.10am, BBC2</p> <p>In the aftermath of the 7/7 London bombings, Brenda Blethyn\u2019s well-to-do Guernsey smallholder and Sotigui Kouyat\u00e9\u2019s Malian migrant worker are parents who meet in search of their missing children: two sad and pained souls looking to make sense of a life-shattering event.

Vote-by-mail requests among Hispanics in Florida, for example, were up 77% since this juncture four years ago, Mook said. </p> <p>The trend of more vote-by-mail requests extended to other demographics who have increasingly voted Democrat and might feel alienated by Trump, such as Asian Americans.

While Clinton\u2019s campaign acknowledged Democrats were unlikely to overtake their opponents overall in early voting this cycle, they were optimistic about closing the gap.</p> <p>Mook also said the campaign was requesting that officials in Florida extend its Oct. 11 voter registration deadline in light of Hurricane Matthew. The Category 4 deadly storm, which is making its up up the Florida coast, prompted its governor to declare a state of emergency. </p> <p>Mook additionally previewed the next presidential debate, slated for Sunday evening in St. Louis, Missouri.

The state of emergency declared by Governor Pat McCrory ahead of the expected arrival of Hurricane Matthew this weekend follows similar civil measures in September when the police killing of a black man set off a wave of angry protests on the streets of the state\u2019s largest city, Charlotte.</p> <p>Few of the tempests to sweep by in 2016 have defined the national mood quite as much, though, as the political maelstrom battering this state. A vital battleground in the presidential election, North Carolina could determine whether <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\">Donald Trump</a> manages to assemble enough angry white voters to make it all the way to the White House. A \u201cbathroom ban\u201d preventing transgender students from using toilets not matching the gender on their birth certificates has reopened the wounds of America\u2019s culture wars, leading to a boycott by college sport authorities and protests from leading employers such as Apple, American Airlines and Bank of America.</p> <p>But the conservative wave that allowed Republicans to take control of all layers of local government in the state is now threatening to drown the party itself. The fervour stoked by battles over gay rights, voter registration laws, and immigration is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/29/donald-trump-nascar-north-carolina-republicans\">putting off many moderates</a> and could yet see Democrats win presidential, Senate and gubernatorial races here in November.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/06/battleground-states-north-carolina-trump-clinton-sharp-divisions\">Battleground states: North Carolina's sharp divides put election on knife-edge</a> </p> </aside>  <p>What has made such controversies so shocking to many outsiders is that the Tar Heel state had long since stopped conforming to any easy stereotypes of a politically conservative southern backwater. The recent protests against the killing of Keith Lamont Scott in Charlotte took place among gleaming downtown high-rises of the New South \u2013 race riots shattering the calm of what otherwise appears a diverse and progressive boomtown at the heart of one of America\u2019s major transport and financial hubs.</p> <p>Pride in North Carolina\u2019s modern and open economy is still visible, despite the high-profile battles over sexual and racial equality.

He casts his guests in a burlesque he scripts for them, and cattle-prods them into playing their parts, first fawning over them until they feel like celebrities, then bringing down the hammer of humiliation. He\u2019s a diabolically domineering scene partner. No interviewer has ever been as adroit with treacherous leading questions in the vein of \u201cWhen did you stop beating your wife?\u201d Stern, in other words, gets people to publicly embrace their worst selves\u2014and say things they live to regret.</p> <p>That\u2019s exactly what happened with Trump. Today, as the Republican nominee, he may fashion himself as a boss and a master of the universe. But what comes across in old tapes of the show, resurfaced recently by BuzzFeed and other outlets, is that Trump, like many of Stern\u2019s guests, was often the one being played. By nailing him as a buffoon and then\u2014unkindest cut\u2014forcing him to kiss the Howard Stern ring, Stern and his co-anchor, Robin Quivers, created a series of broadcasts that today showcase not just Trump\u2019s misogyny but his ready submission to sharper minds.</p> </blockquote> <p>Read the <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/10/howard-stern-donald-trump-2016-214322#ixzz4MK5DCjOP\">full piece here</a>.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57f674cae4b03b0685c083de\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-06T16:06:40.025Z\">5.06pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Paul Ryan to campaign with Donald Trump</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>So much for every Republican running away from Trump.

  "<p>Hillary Clinton\u2019s immediate FBI woes ended on Sunday with a letter whose five sentences signaled that James Comey\u2019s troubles have only begun.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/06/fbi-director-hillary-clinton-email-investigation-criminal-james-comey\">FBI director: new Hillary Clinton emails show no criminal wrongdoing</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The director of the FBI has come under withering, escalating and relentless criticism since he sent Congress a vague letter, on 28 October, heralding a potential re-examination of the investigation into Clinton\u2019s private email server. The original inquiry ended in July, after months of officials scouring Clinton\u2019s communications while secretary of state, with the conclusion that her practices were \u201cextremely careless\u201d but not criminal.</p> <p>On Sunday, Comey brought what many viewed as a frightening FBI intervention into a presidential election <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/06/fbi-director-hillary-clinton-email-investigation-criminal-james-comey\">to a close</a>. The Democratic presidential nominee will not face an FBI recommendation for indictment over her stewardship of classified information.</p> <p>Whether or not Comey endangered his position at the head of the FBI, the episode has cost him his chief asset: his reputation, cultivated assiduously in the media, for probity and judgment. Beyond the director himself, the coda to the Clinton email inquiry has exposed the FBI as a politicized agency, a development with serious repercussions over the next several years. </p> <p>Donald Trump spent much of the summer and fall attacking the FBI as \u201ccorrupt\u201d for failing to recommend indictment, only to reverse himself entirely after Comey\u2019s October letter. Now that Comey has ended the issue ahead of the election, the director has demonstrated himself to be an unreliable ally to Trump, who has <a href=\"http://bigstory.ap.org/article/fe4c21e8e44146b2abcaba857563d11f/trump-touts-his-loyalty-defending-campaign-manager\">loudly insisted</a> on complete loyalty around him. Should Trump win the election, Comey is likely to find himself either marginalized or unemployed. </p> <p>If Clinton wins, Comey\u2019s position is unlikely to be much better. </p> <p>Sources within the FBI have pointed to a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/03/fbi-leaks-hillary-clinton-james-comey-donald-trump\">deep, visceral antipathy to Clinton</a> within the bureau, as well as substantial support for Trump. Comey\u2019s earlier decision to publicly recommend no charges had spurred anger among FBI employees disposed negatively toward her, and Comey\u2019s newest letter changes none of that sentiment. Now Comey has restored that status quo ante, again frustrating anti-Clinton sentiments in his workforce. This time, however, he has seen his allies in Washington <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/30/democratic-senators-fbi-director-comey-clinton-emails-letter\">abandon him</a>, depriving Comey of a bulwark against his rank-and-file.</p> <p>The loss of that bulwark is critical, and will likely become visible in the near future. Beyond the email inquiry, the FBI also has had the Clinton Foundation, the family\u2019s charity, under some form of scrutiny.</p> <p>Once again, Comey is in a bind. FBI sources have already leaked that allegations against the foundation are <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trumps-claims-evidence-fbis-clinton-foundation-probe-impressive/story?id=43282736\">weak</a>, given their source in a book by a far-right author who provides little evidence. Should the FBI fail to recommend another indictment, Trump\u2019s voters and congressional Republicans will presume bias in the bureau \u2013 particularly since those Republicans have already stated intentions to keep a hypothetical Clinton White House <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/house-republicans-are-already-preparing-for-years-of-investigations-of-clinton/2016/10/26/e153a714-9ac3-11e6-9980-50913d68eacb_story.html\">under persistent investigation</a>. Should the FBI recommend indictment, Clinton\u2019s voters and congressional Democrats will presume Comey acted for political reasons, or caved to such motives within the bureau. </p> <p>Comey may very soon himself be under investigation. Al Franken, a Minnesota senator on the judiciary committee with direct oversight of the FBI, said early Sunday he was \u201c<a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/06/politics/al-franken-fbi-james-comey-hearings/index.html\">certain</a>\u201d of forthcoming hearings into Comey\u2019s actions. After the latest letter, Senator Dianne Feinstein, another judiciary committee Democrat and a consistent ally of the security agencies, said she found Comey\u2019s intervention \u201ceven more troubling\u201d. Feinstein also called for a justice department review.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/nov/06/donald-trump-fbi-hillary-clinton-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/5aqff\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2873409\"            data-video-name=\"Donald Trump on Hillary Clinton and the FBI: \u2018She\u2019s protected\u2019 \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"AP/Reuters\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-581fb62be4b0d073c27d214c\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/11/06/161106TrumpOnFBI_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/11/06/161106TrumpOnFBI.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/11/06/161106TrumpOnFBI_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/nov/06/donald-trump-fbi-hillary-clinton-video\">Donald Trump on Hillary Clinton and the FBI: \u2018She\u2019s protected\u2019</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Clinton herself has pointedly declined to say whether she would retain Comey if she is elected. She too faces a political dilemma, even in the event of victory on Tuesday, since firing Comey could turn the director into a martyr for opponents on the right. Clinton\u2019s chief aides are notorious for their long memories, however, and her White House would likely view the FBI as a threat, or at least with extreme distrust. Her appointment of an attorney general would consequently fall under intense questioning about any tacit mandate to contain the bureau. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/30/james-comey-fbi-director-hillary-clinton-email\">James Comey: Hillary Clinton email inquiry is FBI chief's latest controversy</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Comey\u2019s political imbroglio coincides with his attempt to persuade Congress that sophisticated commercial encryption poses a security threat. He has now lost his chief weapon in that debate, the benefit of the doubt: FBI intervention into a presidential election has made fears of an assertive law enforcement and intelligence agency deciding the national agenda more salient than any PR campaign from privacy advocates ever could. </p> <p>It is a spectacular fall for Comey. He built his public persona as the man who stood up to pressure from George W Bush\u2019s White House over mass surveillance. The real story, hidden from public view until Edward Snowden\u2019s leaks, showed Comey to be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/27/james-comey-justice-department-data-monitoring\">significantly less heroic</a>, but the persona was enough to persuade Barack Obama to elevate him to run the FBI weeks after the Guardian began publishing material Snowden disclosed. After Comey <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/feb/17/inside-the-fbis-encryption-battle-with-apple\">picked a fight with Apple</a> over encryption and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/mar/28/apple-fbi-case-dropped-san-bernardino-iphone\">lost</a>, his judgment appeared shaky.</p> <p>Now Comey has committed an unforced error that has drained his reservoir of goodwill in Washington. With the FBI\u2019s integrity in the balance, Comey faces several difficult months, if not years, in Washington, regardless of the country\u2019s vote in two days.</p>",
  "<p>When I was a girl of 11 I had an argument with my father that left my psyche maimed. It was about whether a woman could be the president of the US.</p> <p>How did it even start? I was no <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/feminism\">feminist</a> prodigy, just a shy kid who preferred reading to talking; politics weren\u2019t my destiny. Probably, I was trying to work out what was possible for my category of person \u2013 legally, logistically \u2013 as one might ask which kinds of terrain are navigable for a newly purchased bicycle. Up until then, gender hadn\u2019t darkened my mental doorway as I followed my older brother into our daily adventures wearing hand-me-down jeans.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/06/fbi-director-hillary-clinton-email-investigation-criminal-james-comey\">James Comey: FBI has found no criminal wrongdoing in new Clinton emails</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But in adolescence it dawned on me I\u2019d be spending my future as a woman, and when I looked around, alarm bells rang. My mother was a capable, intelligent, deeply unhappy woman who aspired to fulfilment as a housewife but clearly disliked the job. I saw most of my friends\u2019 mothers packed into that same dreary boat. My father was a country physician, admired and rewarded for work he loved. In my primordial search for a life coach, he was the natural choice.</p> <p>I probably started by asking him if girls could go to college, have jobs, be doctors, tentatively working my way up the ladder. His answers grew more equivocal until finally we faced off, Dad saying, \u201cNo\u201d and me saying, \u201cBut why not?\u201d A female president would be dangerous. His reasons vaguely referenced menstruation and emotional instability, innate female attraction to maternity and aversion to power, and a general implied ickyness that was beneath polite conversation.</p> <p>I ended that evening curled in bed with my fingernails digging into my palms and a silent howl tearing through me that lasted hours and left me numb. The next day I saw life at a remove, as if my skull had been jarred. What changed for me was not a dashing of specific hopes, but an understanding of what my father \u2013 the person whose respect I craved \u2013 really saw when he looked at me. I was tainted. I would grow up to be a lesser person, confined to an obliquely shameful life.</p> <p>But I didn\u2019t stop asking what a woman gets to do, and so began a lifelong confrontation with that internal howl. The slap-downs were often unexpected. Play drums in the band? No. Sign up for the science team? Go camping with the guys? Go jogging in shorts and a tank top without fear of being assaulted? Experiment boldly, have a career, command a moral authority of my own? Walk home safely after dark? No, no, no.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/nov/06/why-do-we-love-a-trainwreck\">Why do successful women like Hillary Clinton get under so many people's skin?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Eventually, I wrestled my way to yes on most of these things, except of course the last one.

Their form at the King Power Stadium has been fine, with three wins and a draw against Southampton, and most will expect them to beat West Brom today.</p> <p>Tony Pulis\u2019s side drew here last season, and their innate solidity gives them a chance in any game.

  "<p>Someone threw a dildo on to the playing&#xa0;field. It happened last Sunday, during the third quarter of&#xa0;<a href=\"http://mashable.com/2016/10/30/dildo-buffalo-bills-patriots-nfl/\" title=\"\">a&#xa0;nationally televised NFL game between the Buffalo Bills and the New England Patriots</a>. Millions of Americans watched, rolled their eyes and thought to themselves: \u201cWell, that about sums it up.\u201d</p> <p>So, who threw it? A Hillary supporter, obviously. Someone fed up with all the degradation women have been subjected to in this election: infidelity, groping, sexting, the whole septic undertow of alpha-male sludge currently spewing into the Atlantic and Pacific. And, finally, one lone heroine stood up and hurled an allegorical Johnson on to a football field, where it got trampled by 22 pairs of male feet.</p> <p>Or \u2026 was it a Trumpster? A lifelong blue-collar Buffaloan who has watched his city\u2019s industrial prowess wane? Maybe his daddy made dildos and his granddaddy made dildos, and then Hillary became senator and all those dildo jobs moved overseas. And now these New England Patriots \u2013&#xa0;east coast intellectual elites \u2013 show up with their&#xa0;crooked, <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/us-sport/national-football-league/tom-brady-superstar-or-cheat-or-both-10255442.html\" title=\"\">ball-deflating quarterback, Tom Brady</a>, and humiliate Buffalo on their home field.&#xa0;So, in&#xa0;a&#xa0;desperate act of defiance, an angry&#xa0;man hurls&#xa0;an inferior Chinese-made dildo at&#xa0;the Patriots\u2019 offence. A way of saying: \u201cThe Revolution Has Begun.\u201d</p> <p>Make no mistake: it was a political event. Americans are frustrated and they are throwing dildos. They\u2019re fed up and they don\u2019t give a rat\u2019s ass if the rest of the world is laughing at them. The air of \u201cfresh start\u201d is no longer alive in most places in America. We are sleepwalking into oblivion and for those, like me, raised in the twilight of a world where being president was still&#xa0;a noble thing, it cuts pretty deep. History has&#xa0;always been able to extract some shred of sacrosanctity from the electoral process, no matter how awful it turned out. But it\u2019s looking as if that warranty has expired and our republic is now an ageing Maytag churning through its final rinse cycle. Whatever comes out is going to be damp, foetid and reeking of effluviant. And we\u2019re gonna have to wear it.</p> <p>If Trump wins, I\u2019m going to enjoy the spectacle of a man wrestling within himself. Driven by inherent narcissism, he would strive to be The Greatest President Ever, a trait we look for in our leaders. But if his itchy-finger temperament prevails, he might nuke Egypt simply because they lied about the cotton threadcount in his bedsheets.</p> <p>Hillary, on the other hand, is a dead-eyed cyborg, held together with rivets and WD-40. She has been encamped in our lives for so long that handing her the presidency somehow feels like a&#xa0;lifetime achievement award. But she\u2019s dirty and corrupt and contemptuous of national security. These are our choices, folks: a pair of assholes. What is an asshole? A person who thinks they\u2019re entitled to an advantage. A person who has immunised themselves against all criticism.</p> <p>They can\u2019t hear your complaints. They\u2019re too caught up in their own ambition. It\u2019s OK to be an asshole if you have talent. Pablo Picasso and Miles Davis were assholes, but we forgave them because they gave something back. And the reason they were assholes was because they couldn\u2019t abide anything that got in the way of their talent or vision. But Trump has no talent. And Hillary has no vision. No fresh vision, anyway. So the American voter has a dilemma. \u201cLet\u2019s see, should I go with <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2016/live-updates/general-election/real-time-fact-checking-and-analysis-of-the-first-presidential-debate/fact-check-has-trump-declared-bankruptcy-four-or-six-times/\" title=\"\">a six-times-bankrupt businessman</a> who once thought it was a genius idea to sell steaks at The Sharper Image?

America\u2019s greatest attribute has always been its ability to mythologise its stupid mistakes, to turn world-class blunders into cultural gold. We glorify our exceptionalism. We downplay our history of slavery, segregation, nativism and violence until we can find a way to&#xa0;turn it into a Hollywood blockbuster starring Chiwetel Ejiofor. Unlike Brits, we always forgive ourselves. But I don\u2019t know how we\u2019re ever going to illuminate Trump or Clinton with any kind of flattering historical rewrite.</p> <p>Besides, they have already been encapsulated perfectly in films: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/oct/23/back-to-the-future-writer-bad-guy-biff-was-based-on-donald-trump\" title=\"\">Biff in Back to the Future</a> and Mary Tyler Moore in Ordinary People.</p> <p>Who am I going to vote for? Hillary. Only because she lies 30% less than Trump. I\u2019m tempted to sit this whole thing out, but I can\u2019t. I still believe in the antiquated currency of the ballot. I am grateful, as an American, that two useful idiots have offered themselves up as scapegoats for everything wrong with my country. That\u2019s the beauty of having a president. When the world isn\u2019t treating us right, when the creepy kid at school goes out and shoots up the mall, when we\u2019re up to our asses in floodwater and raw sewage because the county commissioners didn\u2019t buy enough sandbags to shore up the levee, who has to show up and apologise? The president, that\u2019s who.</p> <p>Every night, the president crawls into bed and says: \u201cGuess what, honey?

  "<p>Mention the name Trevor Noah in the US, and you might be met with a shrug, a sigh or a scoff. Many consider the South African comic\u2019s first year as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2015/sep/29/the-daily-show-trevor-noah-clears-first-night-hurdles-as-host-but-only-just\">Jon Stewart\u2019s successor at The Daily Show</a> to have been a flop, a particularly excruciating one given the current political environment.

He has always been an exceptional performer, possessed of a charismatic glow that makes it hard to look away. At the second of two performances on Saturday night at the Beacon Theatre, he could have won over many of his detractors. </p> <p>Clad all in black, he was making a clear sartorial break from his Daily Show suits, and only rarely veered into politics. Instead, he talked about the possibilities and problems of a black James Bond, an epic night of drinking in Edinburgh, and his love and wonder at getting around New York City, where pedestrians are exceptionally trusting of the traffic signals because \u201cin America, if you\u2019ve got the white man on your side, you can do whatever you want\u201d.</p> <p>This type of material is where he excels. An extended bit about his time in Scotland was a reminder that the bread and butter of his standup has been his enthusiastic stories about travel and the people he\u2019s met. His greatest skill remains his ability with accents \u2013 he flipped through nearly a dozen foreign voices in the 75-minute show. A bit about Barack Obama\u2019s speaking style gave a peek into his process for producing such spot-on mimicry. </p> <p>But if there is one disappointment about Noah\u2019s show, it\u2019s the writing. A bit about the hypocrisy of anti-immigration nationalists in the UK and the US felt unsophisticated, while other jokes were clearly pandering to a liberal audience. He\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2015/10/15/did_trevor_noah_steal_dave_chappelles_joke_noahs_bit_on_the_racism_connoisseur_is_too_close_for_comfort/\">been accused of joke thievery</a> in the past, but his real crime seems to be that he\u2019s less interested in developing original material and more invested in using his talents to put on a good show.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/jul/06/political-comedy-election-donald-trump-stephen-colbert\">Is the 2016 presidential campaign beyond satire?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>And that puts him in a difficult spot. American standup, particularly in New York, is all about writing: there\u2019s not much appreciation for a mediocre joke told brilliantly. And The Daily Show may not be the best fit for him: he seems better suited to a big-tent network late-night show, where his gentle demeanor and genuine curiosity would be seen as assets rather than deficits. </p> <p>These shows were recorded for an upcoming Netflix special, but whether this apolitical hour of standup will win over his Daily Show doubters is uncertain \u2013 he\u2019ll never be the political whiz kid that some want him to be, and he really needs to be seen live in order to appreciate his charms. But maybe this will be a chance for America to see what Trevor Noah does best. </p>",

Clinton would be the first spouse of a president to reach the White House. Trump, at 70, would be the oldest person to assume the office.</p> <p>As both candidates and their surrogates set out on a whirlwind final 48 hours on the trail, the wild card nature of Trump\u2019s candidacy made the map harder to read than usual.

Clinton, however, lost both states to Bernie Sanders in the Democratic primary.</p> <p>Van Jones, a former adviser to Obama, told CNN\u2019s State of the Union: \u201cBeds are damp. There is a crack in the blue wall and it has to do with trade. This is the ghost of Bernie Sanders.\u201d</p> <p>The Trump campaign claimed \u201can enormous surge in momentum and enthusiasm\u201d in recent days, citing Minnesota, where the campaign said that in less than 24 hours it had 18,000 RSVPs for a event that could hold 5,000 people. It now sees \u201cat least six different paths\u201d to victory, aides said.</p> <p>Dave Bossie, deputy campaign manager, told reporters: \u201cWe have expanded the map. We are on offence.

It may yet influence how governments are formed. Recent reports suggest that many of Donald Trump\u2019s most fervent online supporters are not themselves Americans, but Russians being paid by their government to help him win. <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/russian-online-troll-tells-samantha-bee-why-she-prefers-donald-trump_us_58184cafe4b0990edc3340d2\">One told Samantha Bee</a> that she pretends to be a housewife from Nebraska.

Even the <a href=\"http://www.globaltimes.cn/special/2010-02/503820.html\">state-owned Global Times</a> reported with approval on the practice in 2010, citing Changsha\u2019s party office as the source of the name after it paid a team of commenters 600 yuan a month in 2004, plus half a yuan \u2013 hence \u201c50 cent\u201d \u2013 for each glowing post they made.</p> <p>Since then, paying stooges to praise your work online has become about as routine for local government in China as hiring traffic wardens. <a href=\"http://gking.harvard.edu/files/gking/files/50c.pdf?m=1463683069\">A recent study at Harvard University</a> found that the Chinese authorities were placing <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/20/chinese-officials-create-488m-social-media-posts-a-year-study-finds\">448m phony comments on the internet each year</a>. In an analysis of 43,800 pro-regime comments, the researchers concluded that 99.3% of them were made by civil servants from a wide variety of government departments. The postings tended to come in bursts at testing times, such as during protests or party meetings.</p> <p>Interestingly, few of the comments qualify as trolling, in the strict sense. Rather than attacking unbelievers, they focus on swamping the doubters with a flood of positive messages, or cleverly diverting the conversation. As with any job, some practitioners are laughably bad at it.

The young man, whose own family knew nothing of his work, estimated that 10-20% of the comments he saw were left by the 50 Cent Party. He described creating several identities in one forum, and structuring arguments between them so that the most authoritative voice could ultimately settle matters in the government\u2019s favour. Another tactic was to be deliberately provocative, and thus draw public anger on to himself and away from the authorities. \u201cSometimes I feel like I have a split personality,\u201d he said. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say I like it or hate it.

On Twitter, they had to have at least 10 accounts, on which they would tweet 50 times.

Accordingly there are around 350 official Israeli online channels, covering the full range of social media. For instance, besides its well-known Twitter accounts in English, Hebrew and Arabic, the Israeli Defence Force <a href=\"https://www.pinterest.com/idfonline/\">even has its own Pinterest page</a>, featuring photo collections with themes such as \u201cSoldiers\u2019 Stories\u201d and \u201cIDF Style\u201d.</p> <p>In 2013, the Israeli government revealed that it would also recruit \u201ccovert units\u201d however. These would be staffed by a mixture of international supporters and domestic students, whose high intelligence, low income and familiarity with social media make them generally well suited to professional trolling. \u201cWe need a unified effort to explain why we have a legal right to be here in Israel,\u201d the <a href=\"http://www.jpost.com/Diplomacy-and-Politics/Government-to-use-citizens-as-army-in-social-media-war-322972\">Knesset member Dov Lipman told the Jerusalem Post</a>. \u201cThat is key to defeat the movements pushing to boycott, divest and sanction Israel.\u201d Those who signed up would get quick access to government information, and leaders of student groups would also be awarded scholarships.</p> <p>Sure enough, during the war in Gaza the following summer, a student group called <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jul/16/israel-hamas-clash-social-media\">Israel Under Fire</a> emerged as one of many voices promoting the Israeli side of the story. \u201cWe counter Palestinian propaganda and explain the Israeli perspective,\u201d the group\u2019s leader, Yarden Ben-Yosef, said. \u201cSocial media is another place where the war goes on.

The i-army.org site itself, where volunteers can join, is certainly <a href=\"https://meduza.io/\">not very appealing to outsiders</a>. It is a crazed and relentless jumble of unflattering stories about Russia \u2013 from details about the MH17 air crash, to doping by its athletes, to unsubstantiated allegations from the western media that Putin is a paedophile. \u201cDo not let yourself be deceived \u2013 spread the truth!\u201d the site says, rousingly.</p> <p>More obvious signs of life can be found on the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/i_army_org\">i-army\u2019s Twitter page</a>. This is very active, with 12,800 followers, which isn\u2019t bad, and retweets regularly runs into dozens or hundreds. Clearly some of its followers have been arguing Ukraine\u2019s case online, but the tweets themselves are not very persuasive, offering photographs of captured Russian military hardware, dry political statements and sudden comic memes about Russia\u2019s federal reserves, for example.</p> <p>The account\u2019s wallpaper perhaps tells you everything you need to know about the Information Policy Ministry \u2013 or the \u201cMinistry of Truth\u201d, as some Ukrainian wags prefer. It depicts a group of noble white knights carrying the ministry\u2019s logo into battle against, literally, an army of fantastical trolls (who rather incongruously carry the logos of RT television and Russia 24). No matter how sympathetic one might feel towards the Ukrainian cause, it is hard not to feel that this particular region of the conflict needs a lighter touch.</p> <p><strong>Estimated troops</strong> A few hundred.</p> <p><strong>Favourite subjects</strong> Russia, Russia, Russia, Russia, Russia.</p> <h2> UK</h2> <p>The so-called \u201cTwitter Troops\u201d of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/jan/31/british-army-facebook-warriors-77th-brigade\">the 77th Brigade</a> were somewhat misunderstood by the media when the new army unit was created last year. In fact social media was just one example of many non-military skills that the specialist soldiers were intended to bring to the army. And in any case, the MoD informs me, it would not be a soldier\u2019s job to launch a disinformation campaign on the battlefield, even if they had the time.</p> <p>You don\u2019t hear much about JTRIG in Britain, however, and they do just this kind of thing. Indeed the very existence of the Joint Threat Research Intelligence Group was a national secret until documents from Edward Snowden were published <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2015/06/22/controversial-gchq-unit-domestic-law-enforcement-propaganda\">by Glenn Greenwald and Andrew Fishman in 2014</a>. And they reveal a very busy group of people, whose work within GCHQ was intended to help everyone from the police and MI5 to the Department for Children, Schools and Families and the Bank of England.</p> <p><a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2014/02/24/jtrig-manipulation/\">Some of JTRIG\u2019s tactics</a>, such as hacking into websites and setting up sexual \u201choneypot\u201d stings, sound more or less like conventional spying.

Domestically, there is thus no online opinion for the regime to bother about controlling. (Unless they <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-36416970\">launch their own version of Facebook</a>, as some <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2013/03/13/a-rare-glimpse-of-north-koreas-version-of-facebook/\">believe they plan to</a>.) Across the border, however, just about all South Koreans have smartphones, KakaoTalk and the fastest internet in the world. They also have <a href=\"http://english.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2013/08/13/2013081300891.html\">about 200 North Korean trolls to contend with</a>, according to a report published by a South Korean think-tank, the Police Policy Institute, in 2013. In total the report estimated that North Korean agents had posted 41,373 pieces of propaganda in 2012. (That\u2019s about one every two days per agent, which is hardly Stakhanovite.)</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"ae12b9bde9fa8009aed49a29c0a29076e02257e8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ae12b9bde9fa8009aed49a29c0a29076e02257e8/0_0_2362_3283/719.jpg\" alt=\"Illustration: Joe Magee\" width=\"719\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Illustration: Joe Magee</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: Joe Magee</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Given the extreme strangeness of the regime in Pyongyang, it is easy to presume that they would not know how to talk to a sophisticated southern audience. In fact their approach, as revealed in the report, is rather clever. Instead of hammering people with outlandish and unconvincing Juche propaganda in the usual North Korean way, Pyongyang\u2019s trolls focus on areas that are still debated in the south \u2013 such as whether to give southerners access to sites (currently blocked) that praise the northern regime. Aware that recently started accounts with little background often arouse suspicion, northern agents also tend to work behind identities stolen from real southern users.</p> <p>Clearly the problem has been serious enough for South Korea to react, and indeed to overreact. For years the country\u2019s National Intelligence Service has been routinely posting messages of its own to attack those coming from the north, and at times these have allegedly <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/15/world/asia/south-korean-agents-accused-of-tarring-opposition-before-election.html?_r=0\">strayed into attacks on South Korea\u2019s own opposition parties</a>. Last year the country\u2019s former intelligence chief Won Sei-hoon was convicted of trying to influence the outcome of the 2012 presidential election in favour of the incumbent Park Geun-hye. A retrial has since been ordered, but in the original Won was alleged to be running a team of nine agents who used at least 658 Twitter identities to post many thousands of messages to discredit the north \u2013 and also, in the case of 274,800 messages, <a href=\"https://revolution-news.com/south-korea-50k-protest-national-intelligence-service-election-rigging\">to smear President Park\u2019s opponents</a>, who were described as, among other things, \u201cleftist followers of North Korea\u201d.</p> <p><strong>Estimated troops</strong> 200 (north) 9 (south).</p> <p><strong>Favourite subject</strong> Whether North Korea is a) paradise b) paranoid.</p> <h2> Turkey</h2> <p>President Erdo\u011fan was taught a lesson by the Gezi Park protests of 2013. Not, unfortunately, that Turks should be allowed to live more freely, but that he should take control of social media, with which they had organised themselves against him. By the end of the summer, the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) had begun recruiting <a href=\"http://www.dailysabah.com/elections/2015/05/11/ak-party-founded-new-turkey-digital-office-for-the-general-elections-on-june-7\">a team of 6,000 social media operatives</a>. \u201cWe aim at developing a positive political language which we are teaching to our volunteers,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887323527004579079151479634742\">a party official told the Wall Street Journal at the time</a>. \u201cAnd when the opposing camp spreads disinformation about the party, we correct them with valid information, always using positive language.\u201d But not always being open about it. When asked to name some of the people who would be correcting this misinformation, the official declined.</p> <p>Sadly for Erdo\u011fan and the AKP, <a href=\"http://www.dailydot.com/politics/turkey-twitter-trolls/\">their new army of volunteers proved overenthusiastic and, let\u2019s say, under-subtle</a>. In the months that followed it became common for those who even mildly criticised the government to be <a href=\"http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2015/09/turkey-elections-akp-mulls-dumping-social-media-trolls.html#\">showered with far from positive remarks</a>. Often the abuse arrived in bursts, from people with not very convincing profiles, making accusations that were not only bizarre but bizarrely similar. For instance when the journalist <a href=\"http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2013/11/akp-social-media-twitter-facebook.html\">Emre Kizilkaya criticised the government\u2019s handling of a hostage negotiation</a> in October, he found himself repeatedly accused of \u201cZionism\u201d.</p> <p>At times the \u201cAK Trolls\u201d, as they became known, spread false stories. In July 2014, it was reported that they started a fake Twitter account supposedly from the musician Erkan Ogur, used it to tweet controversial comments about the state intelligence services, then complained about \u201chis\u201d tweets to the AKP authorities in Sakarya, who promptly cancelled Ogur\u2019s forthcoming concert there. Later, Erdo\u011fan\u2019s own daughter Sumeyye was apparently recorded asking one of his advisers for help from \u201cour trolls\u201d. When recordings allegedly showing Erdo\u011fan\u2019s own corruption began to spread on Twitter in the spring of 2014, he simply (but not very effectively) shut Twitter down.</p> <p>Perhaps aware that this Putinesque farce wasn\u2019t making the AKP more popular, the party changed tack just before the general elections last spring, launching the <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/turkish-president-s-social-media-campaigners-deny-being-a-troll-army-10301599.html\">New Turkey Digital Office</a>, which would henceforth dish out more conventional online propaganda. \u201cAll of our accounts will be officially announced,\u201d spokesman Besir Atalay told the Turkish media. \u201cOur messages will be determined at the party headquarters. None of the other accounts would be related to us, including those ones [the trolls].\u201d Nevertheless the AKP lost its majority in the elections.

  "<p>In the beginning, Donald Trump simply wouldn\u2019t allow the press to eat cold meats from the buffet.<br></p> <p>Trump was holding a house party in suburban New Hampshire in late June 2015. The main event was around a backyard swimming pool under a fickle summer sky. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/gallery/2016/nov/02/a-z-of-trump-26-illustrators-picture-a-ghastly-future-in-pictures\">A-Z of Trump: 26 illustrators imagine a 'ghastly' future \u2013\u00a0in pictures</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The family hosting the presidential candidate had a 22-year-old son who was a Trump superfan. He had somehow coaxed the candidate to appear at the backyard event. Before the speech, there would be a reception for invited guests with hors d\u2019oeuvres stacked on the family\u2019s dining room table. But this was for invited guests only. Reporters, let alone more plebeian Trump supporters, were not permitted to partake. </p> <p>Otherwise, there were no press pens as reporters stood intermingled in the crowd with ardent Tea Partiers and curious onlookers there to see a television celebrity who had somehow ended up in Bedford, New Hampshire, for the evening.</p> <p>Trump delivered a long, winding monologue of the sort that would later become his trademark as he veered from dire warnings about illegal immigrants to praise for executives at Comcast and an extended and impassioned anecdote about how professional politicians couldn\u2019t recognize low-quality highway guardrails.</p> <p>The event, with more than 200 people was one of the rare times that Trump attempted anything approaching traditional retail politics. As he soared in the polls, Trump became a phenomenon who packed arenas and stadiums across much of the south. By September 2015, even the gesture of a retail stop at a tailgate outside an Iowa v Iowa State football game turned into a mob scene. The candidate was swarmed by people chanting his name and reaching out to somehow touch him as a pack of bodyguards protected Trump from getting too close to the masses outside the stadium.</p> <p>It was during this period that the Guardian interviewed Trump in a New Hampshire hotel conference room after he had addressed a non-partisan event designed to focus on \u201cproblem solving\u201d. He was gracious and soft-spoken if vague on policy detail. He broadly endorsed several progressive priorities like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2015/oct/13/donald-trump-police-body-cameras-video\">federal funding for police body cameras</a> and rail transit while striking his typical isolationist notes on foreign policy.

Once or twice a day in high school gyms or a convention center in Iowa or New Hampshire, the Republican nominee would put on his show. By the autumn of 2015, Trump had acquired secret service protection and all the other accoutrements of a general election candidate, despite the fact that he was a political novice who had never appeared on a ballot. Reporters were caged in a press pen, unable to freely roam and mingle with voters once the nominee was in the vicinity. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4770e9233e6284dba23b775f979df83acbaace39\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4770e9233e6284dba23b775f979df83acbaace39/0_57_2500_1501/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Trump supporters jeer at protesters during a campaign rally in Burlington, Vermont, on 7 January.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Trump supporters jeer at protesters during a campaign rally in Burlington, Vermont, on 7 January.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Erin Siegal/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>His campaign stops became must-see events, especially in states where visits from presidential candidates were rarities. Trump rallies seemed to resemble rock concerts more than anything previously seen in presidential politics. In a January 2016 rally in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jan/08/donald-trump-burlington-vermont-bernie-sanders-home-turf\">Bernie Sanders heartland of Burlington, Vermont,</a> lines stretched for blocks in the bitter cold as thousands of people congregated to see Trump in a downtown theater. Many were taking their minds off the weather by drinking steadily as they waited and the street was soon littered with empty beer cans. </p> <p>The atmosphere was just as unusual inside the Trump rallies. The Republican candidate\u2019s events became ground zero for protests over a variety of issues, ranging from his vehement anti-immigrant rhetoric to his advocacy of a ban on Muslims entering the United States. In Burlington, a liberal college town, Trump staffers were eagle-eyed at the door, requiring attendees to take loyalty pledges to enter. That wasn\u2019t enough to stop the event from being repeatedly interrupted, with the candidate urging: \u201cTake him out. Get him out of here. Don\u2019t give him his coat!\u201d as one heckler was ejected. </p> <p>Repeated disruptions became routine, along with actual outbreaks of violence. The disturbing trend culminated in a cancelled rally in Chicago, which descended into chaos. The candidate didn\u2019t take the stage as the venue in the heart of deep Democratic blue, ethnically diverse Chicago was filled with protesters. When the announcement came that Trump was not taking the stage, fights quickly broke out throughout the arena. Such scenes of political violence had not been seen in decades in the United States.</p> <p>The next day, Trump\u2019s rally in Cleveland had about a dozen interruptions from protesters, something which would have been astonishing had it happened in any other year to any other candidate. Instead, there was no violence and no attempt by Trump to encourage violence and it just seemed like the new normal as he sneered at those who were escorted out, claiming that they were sent by \u201cour communist friend\u201d, Bernie Sanders.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"74deab6dfdee962f34212028ceb834ba8ec4863f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/74deab6dfdee962f34212028ceb834ba8ec4863f/0_233_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Donald Trump holds forth in Miami, Florida.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Donald Trump holds forth in Miami.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Carlo Allegri/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But it wasn\u2019t just the crowds at Trump\u2019s events, which were unusual. It was the candidate\u2019s rhetoric. On a daily basis, Trump made statements that were just astonishing by any traditional standard, comparing a rival to a child molester, or linking another\u2019s father to a plot to kill President Kennedy. In the course of a single day on the campaign trail in South Carolina, Trump both <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/feb/18/donald-trump-pope-francis-christian-wall-mexico-border\">attacked the pope</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/feb/19/trump-appears-to-endorse-executing-terrorists-citing-questionable-history\">accused</a> one of the most decorated American soldiers in history of committing war crimes. The statements had no effect on his standing in the polls and he won a commanding victory only a few days later in the South Carolina primary. </p> <p>Trump finally clinched the Republican nomination in early May when Ted Cruz dropped out after the Indiana primary. His next event was a raucous rally in a grim brutalist arena in Charleston, West Virginia. It had been scheduled in advance of the state\u2019s primary. Hours before it started, the crowd outside formed a disorderly horde in red and white Make America Great Again hats. Once Trump finally took the stage in the dank 60s-era construction in the dilapidated downtown, he strutted about the stage triumphantly, suggesting to attendees that they didn\u2019t need to bother to vote in the primary any more as he boasted about his abiding love and affection for coal and coalminers.</p> <p>In the weeks that followed, there was no pivot to a general election. Instead, Trump seemed nostalgic for the intra-Republican contest as he travelled the length of California in advance of the state\u2019s June primary, as well as taking a bizarre trip to Scotland to see his golf course in the aftermath of the Brexit referendum. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"38a80d8bb302532b77a4f7c25bdc0b5fb18b29cb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/38a80d8bb302532b77a4f7c25bdc0b5fb18b29cb/17_0_3884_2331/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Donald Trump at the Republican national convention in Cleveland\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Donald Trump at the Republican national convention in Cleveland: a grim, depressing slog.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Patrick Semansky/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When Trump officially became the nominee in July, it was at a convention in Cleveland that was more banal than anyone could have imagined. Although Trump had promised star-studded festivities and there were fears that protests in the surrounding streets would rival the dramatic scenes outside the 1968 Democratic convention in Chicago, it was instead a grim, depressing slog. </p> <p>In lieu of celebrities, there was former Happy Days actor Scott Baio and, instead of graceful concession speeches, former rival Ted Cruz urged Republicans to \u201cvote their conscience\u201d in what was widely viewed as a snub to Trump. Much of the effort seemed to be focused on stopping anti-Trump rebels from forcing any vote or coming close to any open display of dissatisfaction. No one had any illusions that Trump could somehow be thwarted. </p> <p>The nomination was secured after more than a week of grinding procedural warfare replete with the type of tactical chicanery that one would have expected from smoke- not iPhone-filled rooms. Anti-Trump petitions mysteriously disappeared, wavering delegates were subjected to intense pressure and every available scrap of procedure was put to good use. For a moment, he was just like any other candidate overseeing a political organization.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"1cade843148294df123422a9b0da647847a1ccf1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1cade843148294df123422a9b0da647847a1ccf1/0_0_2203_1322/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Steve Bannon, Trump\u2019s campaign CEO, attends a rally in Eau Claire, Wisconsin.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Steve Bannon, Trump\u2019s campaign CEO and Breitbart editor, attends a rally in Eau Claire, Wisconsin.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Paul Manafort, the shadowy veteran campaign aide who had finally elbowed out Trump\u2019s longtime campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, after an intense turf war, oversaw all of these efforts.

Working in concert with veteran GOP pollster Kellyanne Conway, Trump abandoned his unscripted rallies and began using a teleprompter exclusively. He also hunkered down, avoiding the media outside of deeply conservative talk radio and Fox News.</p> <p>In personal unguarded interactions, Trump was genial with the press. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/11/donald-trump-campaign-ohio-fair-plane-media\">When the Guardian accompanied him on his personal plane</a> in September as a pool reporter, he chatted freely with handful of journalists who accompanied him and went out of his way to be gracious.

There was no more open violence or unruliness. Protesters had become rare. Instead, they became venues for Trump to share his rage over the \u201crigged system\u201d and stir up an angry crowd \u2013 against the media, against Hillary Clinton, against \u201cglobalists\u201d and a host of other villains.</p> <p>Attendees showed up in bitter T-shirts proclaiming that they were \u201cdeplorable\u201d and took up Trump\u2019s invitation to deride reporters.</p> <p>At one rally in Cincinnati in October, the traveling press was booed by a crowd of roughly 15,000 as it entered the arena. </p> <p>Trump had stopped trying to be a normal candidate but he was no longer being Trump. It was a dark hybrid. He had lost much of the freewheeling joie de vivre that had taken him to strange, albeit controversial places. Instead, he had become a relatively coherent figure, articulating a clear world view \u2013 but one that was deeply paranoid and out of the mainstream, where the press was no longer a stalking horse but simply the enemy.<br></p>",

Facebook and Twitter\u2019s systems for reporting abuse are garbage, by the way,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Hayhoe is the director of the Climate Science Center at Texas Tech University in Lubbock, where she teaches and conducts research as an atmospheric scientist and an associate professor of political science.</p> <p>As a Texas-dwelling, evangelical Christian, atmospheric scientist, Hayhoe can often win the ears of many religious communities, receive invitations to address students at Christian colleges, or have conversations with mega-church-going Republican climate cynics she otherwise mightn\u2019t meet or who wouldn\u2019t listen.</p> <p>Her faith and, now, her web series, has led many people to tell her they had believed or suspected that human-influenced climate change was a liberal hoax but that she has changed their minds, she said.</p> <p>But Global Weirding has also brought increased hate mail.</p> <p>\u201cI did have, a few years ago, a death threat, which I reported to the police,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Now new floods of insults are pouring in since she launched the web series last month.</p> <p>She\u2019s coping partly by seeing it as a \u201csort of encouraging, in a strange way\u201d sign that she\u2019s hitting new audiences, drawing contrarians and environmental converts alike.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fd7bc637031f629e6451ee891d7c5794fb756026\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fd7bc637031f629e6451ee891d7c5794fb756026/0_23_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Katharine Hayhoe speaks about climate change to students and faculty at Wayland Baptist University in Plainview, Texas.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Katharine Hayhoe speaks about climate change to students and faculty at Wayland Baptist University in Plainview, Texas.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chicago Tribune/MCT via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Hayhoe has made <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=global+weirding\">Global Weirding</a> in conjunction with her local PBS TV station, KTTZ, and it\u2019s released via YouTube.</p> <p>The short installments are released every other Wednesday, with the fourth one of the inaugural season due the day after the 8 November presidential election.</p> <p> The series delivers a carefully calibrated, humorous, light-hearted lecture underpinned with serious science, featuring cartoons and Hayhoe talking on screen.</p> <p>The first episode sought to \u201cbust the myth\u201d of stereotypical \u201cgreen liberals\u201d having a monopoly on environmentalism. The second explained the history of climate science and why global warming isn\u2019t a blip, a natural cycle or a leftwing conspiracy.</p> <p>And the third pointed out that while Texas emits more carbon than Germany, it\u2019s also the US\u2019s leading producer of wind energy and \u201chas the potential to lead the nation in solar energy\u201d.</p> <p>Forthcoming episodes explore themes such as \u201cit\u2019s not just polar bears\u201d, \u201cwhat happened in Paris?\u201d and \u201creligion in relation to climate change\u201d.</p> <p>Evangelical Christians in the US are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/mar/11/climatechange.religion\">split</a> on whether climate change is real and whether it\u2019s mankind\u2019s fault.</p> <p>The National Association of Evangelicals (NAE) supports the science but that body only represents a portion of the born-again faithful in America.</p> <p>\u201cWe have to draw a very clear line between US evangelicals and those in the rest of the world,\u201d said Hayhoe.</p> <p>\u201cI went to the Paris climate talks last December and the head of the World Evangelical Alliance, Efraim Tendero, was an official delegate.

  "<p>The restaurant at the new <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/13/trump-international-hotel-washington-opening-protests\">Trump International Hotel</a> in Washington wasn\u2019t empty on Thursday night. But it wasn\u2019t full either. The handful of diners could look down on the marbled lobby and bar and see four TVs: two tuned to American football, one to basketball and a fourth to conservative Fox News \u2013 including election ads for the final days of Donald Trump\u2019s presidential campaign.</p> <p>\u201cThe style is jubilant,\u201d said <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dominicvorvlaw1\">Dominic Vorv</a>, 50, a lawyer with a cowboy hat who dined on ribeye steak as banal pop music wafted through the former post office. \u201cMy clients are impressed. My voice does not reverberate here because it\u2019s a large place. You can talk and no one listens to your business to find out: are you a Republican, are you a Democrat?\u201d</p> <p><a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/26/donald-trump-opens-international-hotel-campaign-trail-brand\">The glitzy hotel</a> on Pennsylvania Avenue stands 723 short steps from the White House. Vorv, a Latino from New Mexico who says his legal clients include strippers, hopes that Trump will add the Oval Office to his portfolio on Tuesday. \u201cThe city has been waiting for a leader,\u201d he said. \u201cAll we get is politicians.\u201d</p> <p>Washington has been home to every US president since <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/1600/presidents/johnadams\">John Adams</a>, the second president, in 1800. He and his successors have variously embraced the city or seldom ventured beyond the mansion grounds. George W Bush was rarely seen out at night, whereas Barack Obama has helped DC unbutton its collar. So how would Trump or Hillary Clinton fit in?</p> <p>Politically, at least, one would feel right at home while the other would be a square peg in a round hole. Nine in 10 residents of the District of Columbia <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/2012-election/results/president/district-of-columbia/\">vote Democratic</a>. \u201cTrump would be at war with the city and the population of the city,\u201d said one party stalwart, who did not wish to be named. \u201cThis would be an occupied capital. People in Washington would be regarded as Parisians under the Nazis, with fewer collaborators.\u201d</p> <p>Culturally, it is less certain how Washington would reflect the personality of either would-be commander-in-chief. The brash New York businessman\u2019s travelling circus of celebrity, braggadocio and vulgarity would not be likely to impress the capital\u2019s liberal intellectuals, and Trump\u2019s aesthetic taste clashes with the city\u2019s austere marble and concrete. Even his $212m hotel, with its share of chandeliers and gold leaf, is relatively toned down from the faux Versailles aspirations of his properties in Florida and New York.</p> <p>Nor would Trump find similarities between his voters and the city\u2019s demographics: almost half the population of Washington is African American, part of a group that has <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/07/13/new-polls-in-pennsylvania-and-ohio-show-donald-trump-with-0-percent-of-the-black-vote/\">for months</a> rejected him.

Got to do something to pump up excitement but not certain how to do that.\u201d</p> <p>Tanden assented: \u201cAlmost no one knows better [than] me that her instincts can be terrible.\u201d</p> <p>When the seemingly innocuous leftwing senator Bernie Sanders came out of nowhere to challenge Clinton in the Democratic primary, there were fears of a repeat of her shock defeat by Obama in 2008. Tanden warned Podesta against attacking Sanders too aggressively.</p> <p>\u201cJust game out what that does to Hillary,\u201d <a href=\"https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/3193\">she wrote in August last year.</a> \u201cWhen we went after Obama, she got killed for it. Reaffirmed all her negatives, strengthened him. We had no idea it was kryptonite for us to do that, but it was. I don\u2019t know if it was Obama or Hillary (I suspected Hillary), but it\u2019s really something to focus group beforehand.\u201d</p> <p>In December, when Tanden wrote in praise of the Paris climate deal, <a href=\"https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/35133\">Podesta responded:</a> \u201cCan you believe that doofus Bernie attacked it?\u201d</p> <p>Then, in March this year, Clinton strategist <a href=\"https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/33579\">Minyon Moore opined:</a> \u201cI think Sanders is a rule breaker and has no institutional loyalty to the Democratic Party; we should expect him to ignore the rules and persist in his quest to flip superdelegates despite overwhelming evidence that reflects his considerable weaknesses with the Democratic base and no doubt in the general.\u201d</p> <p>Tanden, meanwhile, pulled no punches when Clinton\u2019s campaign hesitated over whether to condemn Democratic activist David Brock for demanding Sanders\u2019 medical records. She wrote: \u201cHillary. God. Her instincts are suboptimal.\u201d</p> <p>A stout defender of Clinton in public, in private Tanden injects some bracing honesty that suggests the candidate is not surrounded by sycophants. After the former first lady described herself as a moderate, <a href=\"https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/41455\">Tanden asked of Podesta:</a> \u201cWhy did she call herself a moderate?\u201d</p> <p>He wrote back: \u201cI pushed her on this on Sunday night. She claims she didn\u2019t remember saying it. Not sure I believe her.\u201d</p> <p>Tanden replied: \u201cI mean it makes my life more difficult after telling every reporter I know she\u2019s actually progressive but that is really the smallest of issues. It worries me more that she doesn\u2019t seem to know what planet we are all living in at the moment.\u201d</p> <p>The daily dump of stolen emails has uncovered Clinton\u2019s lucrative Wall Street speeches, lists of <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/19/us/politics/clinton-vice-president-wikileaks.html\">39 potential vice-presidents</a> and 84 potential campaign slogans, fresh questions over a conflict of interest with the Clinton Foundation and alleged advance warnings of debate questions. But there have been few revelations likely to alter the course of the race for the White House.</p> <p>In fact, just as WikiLeaks\u2019 release of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/the-us-embassy-cables\">US embassy cables</a> often showed diplomats\u2019 judgment in a flattering light, so the Podesta emails have illuminated a micromanaged campaign operation with a laser-like focus and little by way of ill-discipline or even foul language. The nerve centre is, however, all too aware of its candidate\u2019s weaknesses and sensitive to media criticism, and as prone as any other office to personality clashes, terse exchanges and mutual exasperation.</p> <p>The email treasure trove also lifts the lid on the complications of celebrity endorsements. In August 2015, Betsy Jones, assistant to the hip-hop star Q-Tip, <a href=\"https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/39998\">wrote to Podesta</a> to propose a meeting with Clinton \u201cto discuss ways he can be used as bridge to the hip-hop generation during the 2016 presidential campaign\u201d. Q-Tip \u201ceven served as DJ for Chelsea Clinton\u2019s 25th birthday party in 2005\u201d, she noted.</p> <p>Podesta forwarded the email to colleagues, one of whom was Weiner\u2019s wife Huma Abedin. \u201cQ-Tip? Seriously?\u201d she wrote. \u201cI am so old.\u201d</p> <p>Another, Kristina Schake, weighed in: \u201cI\u2019ve actually seen Q-tip in concert and if this meeting happens I would like to staff her.\u201d She elaborated: \u201cWith both the Beastie Boys and the Chemical Brothers!\u201d</p> <p>But then the conversation took a darker turn when another member of Clinton staff, presumably responsible for background checks, raised concerns over Q-Tip: \u201cThere are a couple of altercations he pleaded guilty to, but they were from a while back. However, more recently shouted \u2018pigs\u2019 at NYPD officers while protesting the grand jury decision not to indict Darren Wilson.\u201d</p> <p>It took a while, but the meeting did go ahead.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/nov/05/beyonce-jay-z-back-clinton-ohio-cleveland-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/5azaz\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2871825\"            data-video-name=\"'Vote for someone who cares': Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay Z back Clinton as woman for job \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"AP\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-581d7fc2e4b0d073c27d1b2e\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/11/05/161105BeyonceClinton_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/11/05/161105BeyonceClinton_V3.webm\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/11/05/161105BeyonceClinton.m3u8\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/nov/05/beyonce-jay-z-back-clinton-ohio-cleveland-video\">\u2018Vote for someone who cares\u2019: Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay Z back Clinton as woman for job</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Then there are campaign surrogates who go rogue. Lanny Davis, a lawyer and former special counsel to Bill Clinton during his presidency, put his foot in it when talking about Clinton\u2019s email server on TV. Later that day Robby Mook, now the campaign manager, <a href=\"https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/41556\">emailed Podesta:</a> \u201cWe gotta zap Lanny out of our universe. Can\u2019t believe he committed her to a private review of her hard drive on TV.\u201d</p> <p>In May last year, <a href=\"https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/6370\">Podesta wrote</a> of longtime Clinton family friend Sidney Blumenthal: \u201cIt always amazes me that people like Sid either completely lack self awareness or self respect. Maybe both. Will you promise to shoot me if I ever end up like that?\u201d</p> <p>Podesta, 67, runs a tight ship and has an unenviable job. Countless people want to give him advice or meet him for dinner. In September last year, columnist Brent Budowsky wrote <a href=\"https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/40328\">a long, panicked email</a> about visiting a university campus where Sanders had a booth but Clinton did not. \u201cThis is happening at every major campus in America,\u201d he warned darkly.</p> <p>Referring to a <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2015/09/hillary-clinton-2016-proxies-attack-bernie-sanders-213359\">Politico story</a> about attacks on Sanders by Clinton surrogates, Budowsky went on: \u201cThe way NOT to handle Bernie is to telegraph how afraid the Clinton campaign is of him, and then dispense covert talking points that cannot be put in writing that embody the oldest politics that will only infuriate many liberal Democrats and give an already-biased media a legitimate story line to push.\u201d</p> <p>Podesta gave a characterically brisk response that ended: \u201cWhy do you think that story is not just a bunch of hyped up BS intended to have exactly the kind of reaction you are exhibiting?\u201d </p>",

An election in which the leading candidates have been a protectionist nationalist, an avowed socialist and a Democrat who can\u2019t explain how she is not a socialist has put an end to such talk. Still, Gallup finds <a href=\"https://www.cato.org/blog/gallup-finds-more-libertarians-electorate\">rising numbers</a> of <a href=\"https://www.cato.org/blog/libertarian-vote-ebook-shows-libertarian-growth\">libertarian-leaning voters</a> in the electorate, which should put some constraints on the next president\u2019s agenda. </p> <p>Eight years after the financial crisis, Barack Obama\u2019s policies of more taxes, debt, and regulation have understandably kept GDP growth very slow. Neither Donald Trump\u2019s promise of trade war and immigration cutoffs nor Hillary Clinton\u2019s doubling down on Obama\u2019s policies will help. Meanwhile, Washington hawks think that Obama, who has bombed seven countries, hasn\u2019t been aggressive enough. They\u2019re looking forward to a more assertive Clinton foreign policy. But Trump proved that you can get the Republican nomination by opposing the Iraq war and global interventionism, and that may lead to more resistance to endless war and more congressional constraints on presidential war powers.</p> <h2>Supreme court: <a href=\"http://www.heritage.org/about/staff/m/john-malcolm\">John Malcolm</a></h2> <p><em>Director, Center for Legal and Judicial Studies at the Heritage Foundation</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"787ee3be60fbab8780b706b758d990f728b39e2d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/787ee3be60fbab8780b706b758d990f728b39e2d/0_0_500_700/357.jpg\" alt=\"John Malcolm.\" width=\"357\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">John Malcolm.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Hills</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There is no question that the future of the supreme court is on the ballot.

The stakes are therefore quite high in terms of who will fill his seat. Beyond that, three other justices \u2013 Ginsburg, Kennedy and Breyer \u2013 have already surpassed the average life expectancy for men and women in this country. Additional vacancies are thus likely to occur over the next four to eight years.</p> <p>And who sits in the Oval Office makes a big difference. Ronald Reagan looked for judges who would \u201cprotect the integrity of the constitution, not \u2026 add to it or subtract from it \u2013 certainly not \u2026 rewrite it\u201d.

Median incomes have gone up and the poverty rate is falling. People are not wrong that there has been a long period of economic stagnation and increasing inequality, but we seem to be turning a corner. This is exactly the wrong time to adopt policies that are going to throw the economy into a tailspin.</p> <p>Threatening to shut down trade negotiations or promising to renegotiate settled trade agreements, for example the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), makes no sense if the imperative is to build on the gathering momentum of the US economy. The case for the TPP has as much to do with America\u2019s political influence and interest in Asia as it does with economics. Abandoning the TPP would be a huge gift to China. The other Asian countries will make accommodations to China, and America\u2019s influence will plummet.</p> <p>That is the situation Hillary Clinton will inherit if she wins. The question, then, is how to reconcile the need to tap into those growing Asian markets with her shift on trade during the campaign.</p> <h2>Middle East: <a href=\"https://www.csis.org/people/anthony-h-cordesman\">Anthony Cordesman</a></h2> <p><em>Arleigh Burke chair in strategy, Center for Strategic and International Studies</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"6361bbf82c998f93f92b4509093356aa58b95cdf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6361bbf82c998f93f92b4509093356aa58b95cdf/61_0_403_504/400.jpg\" alt=\"Anthony Cordesman.\" width=\"400\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Anthony Cordesman.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Center for Strategic &amp; International\u200b Studies</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The next administration will confront serious security challenges across the Middle East. Some are obvious and longstanding: the rise of Islamic State, the impact of the US invasion of Iraq, the fighting and instability in Iraq, Syria, Libya and Yemen.</p> <p>It is also true that by the time the next president takes office, the game will probably have a changed. If Isis is defeated in Iraq, which it may well be by the time the next administration is in place, that immediately means he or she will have to decide how to secure Iraq and how to proceed in Syria. </p> <p>Isis has never been the only \u2013 or even the dominant \u2013 terrorist threat in the region. In 2015, estimates indicate that Isis accounted for about 20% of the terrorist incidents in the region. So when Isis is defeated as a proto-state, we will have to consider new threats. Do people migrate to other extremist movements? Do we see al-Qaida, which has made serious gains in Yemen and has a strong affiliate in Syria, grow? Does this expose new sectarian, ethnic or tribal tensions?</p> <p>There is a need to restructure US-Arab cooperation, with a consideration toward creating lasting civil stability. The Arab spring showed how civil forces \u2013 poor governance, lagging economic development, high youth unemployment \u2013 exacerbated regional upheaval and violence.

This shift has been under way for some time but will be more marked in the coming years.</p> <p>The No 1 challenge a President Trump or a President Clinton will face is Russia. Mr Trump thinks he can get a \u201cdeal\u201d but there is reason to believe that will prove far more challenging that he anticipates, and in the process he could upend a lot of relationships with US allies.</p> <p>For Secretary Clinton, given the series of hacks on the Democratic party and her campaign, she will probably take a very different position. The question then is: how much tougher will she get and how specifically she will engage with Russia? This will probably result in much more of an emphasis on countering disinformation and lead to much more intelligence gathering in collaboration with Europeans.</p> <p>Another major challenge for the US will be to get Europe to focus on something other than its own internal affairs: Brexit, slow economic growth and domestic politics, which have taken a sharp turn to the right.</p> <p>Next year, the Netherlands, France and Germany hold elections. If Mr Trump is elected, I believe there is more of a chance that rightwing parties will come to power. In a sense, his election gives permission to these movements to become more anti-American, creating a political dynamic in Europe that is more rightwing and more hostile to the US.</p> <p>Brexit has put the US in a position of trying to remain friends with both parties in a messy divorce. The US will have to build new relationships with Europe and with the UK, and this will take effort.</p> <h2>Women\u2019s healthcare: Heather Boonstra</h2> <p><em>Director of public policy, Guttmacher Institute</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"96043a37130998bd79d1037b43e94eefa770cd2c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/96043a37130998bd79d1037b43e94eefa770cd2c/0_0_288_360/288.jpg\" alt=\"Heather Boonstra\" width=\"288\" height=\"360\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Heather Boonstra.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Guttmacher Institute</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Abortion has been legal throughout the US for more than 40 years, but it remains one of the country\u2019s hottest political flashpoints.

The Democratic platform supports a woman\u2019s ability to obtain an abortion \u201cregardless of where she lives, how much money she makes, or how she is insured\u201d.</p> <p>In addition to abortion, access to contraceptive services and reproductive healthcare generally is also at stake. The Republicans have called for the repeal of the Affordable Care Act and have also targeted the Title X national family planning program and Planned Parenthood health clinics. Hillary Clinton is a lifelong champion for the reproductive health and rights of women. We should recall that she coined a now famous phrase \u201cwomen\u2019s rights are human rights\u201d.</p> <h2>Poverty: Caroline Ratcliffe</h2> <p><em>Senior fellow and economist, Center on Labor, Human Services and Population at the Urban Institute</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"7d68254cee48d7b29e69f306c69e746e854bdfde\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7d68254cee48d7b29e69f306c69e746e854bdfde/18_0_264_330/264.jpg\" alt=\"Caroline Ratcliffe\" width=\"264\" height=\"330\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Caroline Ratcliffe.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Urban Institute</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Almost 14% of all Americans, and nearly 20% of American children, are poor. <a href=\"http://www.urban.org/policy-centers/cross-center-initiatives/low-income-working-families/projects/children-persistent-poverty\">Child poverty can have lifelong consequences</a> for health, education, earnings and more. <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.urban.org/urban-wire/seven-things-you-should-know-about-childhood-poverty\">Addressing the needs of poor young children and their parents is key</a>.</p> <p>Hillary Clinton\u2019s proposal <a href=\"https://www.hillaryclinton.com/briefing/factsheets/2015/06/14/fact-sheet-universal-preschool/\">to double the investment in Early Head Start</a> would expand the reach of educational and other supports for younger children and their families, such as home-visiting programs for new mothers.

The next president will also have to set a foreign policy agenda that will reduce the risk of conflict and migration in a warming world.</p> <p>The question before us this election is: who is the most fit to take these crucial domestic and international steps? Hillary Clinton understands the very real and costly threat of climate change. She has committed to implement an \u201caggressive response\u201d that will support clean energy innovation and jobs in the US.</p> <p>Donald Trump, on the other hand, believes extreme weather does not hurt people and that climate change is a \u201choax\u201d created by the Chinese. He has also said he would \u201ccancel\u201d the Paris agreement and aggressively pursue fossil fuel extraction.</p> <p>The US and the world need an American president who will continue to lead domestic and international efforts to prevent dangerous climate changes.

Santi said he would worry about M5S\u2019s response to economic challenges if they came into power, particularly since they seem to oppose any public intervention when it comes to saving troubled banks, and that their anti-austerity policies would put Italy on a collision course with the European commission.</p> <p>\u201cI think the Five Star movement didn\u2019t come out of nowhere.

  "<p>From the day that she stepped into Number 10, it has been a no-brainer to some of her colleagues that Theresa May ought to call an early general election. As it has also been to many MPs on the other side of the Commons. Her majority in parliament is slender and just became slimmer with the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/nov/04/stephen-phillips-resigns-over-undemocratic-brexit-process\" title=\"\">resignation of the Tory MP Stephen Phillips</a>, a disillusioned Outer. The Conservatives are favourites to retake his seat, but they won\u2019t be so fortunate with other byelections. John Major started with a larger majority in the parliament that began in 1992 and had lost it by the time he was done. Another reason for her to go to the country early is that the Tory majority doesn\u2019t really belong to Mrs May. It was won by Whatshisname, that bloke who used to live at Number 10. She lacks the personal mandate that flows to a prime minister who has won an election in her own right.</p> <p>The way she has behaved towards senior members of the old regime has created a big club of enemies on her backbenches. Asked recently what he was up to, one very senior figure in the Cameron cabinet smiled: \u201cBiding my time.\u201d Then there is Brexit. At some point in this parliament, probably at several points, there will be torrid political and constitutional crises over Britain\u2019s departure from the European Union. There will be resignations by ministers. There will be deadlocks and breakdowns in the negotiations. It is highly likely that there will be serious economic convulsions as well. Better, so goes an argument popular with Tory MPs, for Mrs May to armour herself with the much larger majority that the opinion polls indicate can be hers for the asking. That would give her five clear years to get through Brexit and all its havocs.</p> <p>Mrs May has heard those arguments \u2013 and used to dismiss them. She said the voters weren\u2019t clamouring for an election. She thought that what the country most wanted was stability. It didn\u2019t fit with her image of herself to do something that would look opportunistic. Nor did it suit her risk-averse temperament. Her team calculated that Labour was in such a dreadful state that the Tories didn\u2019t need to rush for a quick kill.</p> <p>Has that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/nov/03/ruling-on-brexit-opens-way-to-mps-revolt\" title=\"\">calculus been changed</a> by the high court ruling that the government must secure parliamentary approval before it can formally trigger divorce proceedings with the European Union? It has. The court ruling was not, as the more hysterical Brextremists have been frothing, an example of elitist judges frustrating the will of the people. The court was reasserting the fundamental principle that the executive cannot rule by monarchical decree, but must seek the consent of parliament if it wants to change the law. There is an alternative to the rule of law \u2013 it is called dictatorship. Those who campaigned to leave the EU in the name of restoring parliamentary sovereignty ought to be able to grasp this.</p> <p>The government might overturn the ruling with a successful appeal to the supreme court, but that looks unlikely. If the supremes agree that the government has to ask parliament before it can activate Article 50, it is as yet unclear how Mrs May intends to conform to the instruction. Some in government seem to think that they might get away with tabling a crude take-it-or-leave-it motion demanding that parliament simply rubber-stamps her decision. That would be defiant of the spirit of the court ruling and perhaps also of its letter. Which is why some ministers think they will have to bring forward legislation.</p> <p>Parliament would not take that as an opportunity to block Brexit. Most MPs were Remainers and so were the majority of peers, but they are not going to flatly defy the referendum result. Parliament might have something to say about the timing of the departure. March is a lousy choice of month to start the countdown to withdrawal. There is a presidential election in France next spring and German elections are due in the early autumn. Nothing meaningful will be negotiated until these are over, which means Mrs May\u2019s current plan simply diminishes the time available to try to make a success of it. MPs and peers could be doing both her and Britain a favour if they slowed her down by a few months.</p> <p>What parliament will definitely do is demand to know more about the government\u2019s exit strategy, if I am not being naive in imagining that such a thing exists. For more than a hundred days, Mrs May has sheltered behind the meaningless mantra \u201cBrexit means Brexit\u201d. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jul/17/theresa-may-brexit-early-general-election\" title=\"\">As one of the first to mock</a> the vacuity of that tautology, I have to confess that it has proved a more durable blocking mechanism than I anticipated, a testimony to the potency of stubborn repetition. One explanation for this long silence could be that the government has an exit plan of such elegance that it is being kept concealed to build up the suspense and increase our collective awe when it is revealed in all its brilliance. No, me neither.</p> <p>I was at the <em>Spectator</em> parliamentary awards dinner when Boris Johnson had the audience in involuntary spasms by declaring that the government would make <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/nov/03/brexit-will-be-titanic-success-says-boris-johnson\" title=\"\">a \u201ctitanic success\u201d of Brexit.</a> There are some deckchairs over there that need rearranging, foreign secretary. The prime minister responded with a threat that was no less vicious for coming in the guise of a joke. Mr Johnson had unwisely compared himself with the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/nov/01/michael-heseltine-confesses-strangling-mothers-dog-to-death-kim-alsatian\" title=\"\">alsatian throttled by Michael Heseltine.</a> Mrs May said: <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-37863003\" title=\"\">\u201cBoris, the dog was put down when its master decided it wasn\u2019t needed any more.\u201d</a> Yes. She really did. In a room crowded with senior politicians and journalists, the prime minister told her foreign secretary that she would kill him when it pleased her.</p> <p>The government is concealing its intentions not to keep the EU guessing but to try to hide its internal confusions and divisions.</p> <p>When the negotiations begin, and that will be in less than six months\u2019 time if Mrs May preserves her timetable, a lot of it will become very public anyway. She will have to tell all the key actors in the EU, including the commission and the heads of government, what sort of deal she is looking for. It will not stay secret for five minutes. The big trade-off at the heart of the negotiation will be between immigration and trade. That is already known, as are the various permutations of a deal. One of the arguments for not calling an election was that it would force an early reveal of precisely what Mrs May wants from the negotiation and that would inflame Tory divisions. If the consequence of the court ruling is that she has to show more of her hand anyway, that reason for avoiding an early election falls away. The Fixed Term Parliament Act is often cited as an obstacle. Written into the statute book during the coalition years to stop the Tories doing the dirty on the Lib Dems or vice-versa, the legislation does make it more laborious to trigger an election. In the old days, the prime minister could just pop down to Buck House to ask for a dissolution and her majesty would oblige. To get an early election, the government would have to engineer a confidence vote and deliberately lose it. That would look strange. It might try to repeal the Act, but that could run into trouble in the Lords. Alternatively, an election can be triggered if two-thirds of MPs vote to have one. That would be hard for the opposition parties to frustrate. As one senior Labour figure puts it: \u201cOppositions don\u2019t vote against elections.\u201d</p> <p>Labour and the Lib Dems, having both called for an election when Mrs May became prime minister, would find it difficult to explain why they didn\u2019t want one. You might think that Labour would nevertheless try to prevent an election when its poll rating is so dire and the Tories <a href=\"https://www.icmunlimited.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/2016_oct2_guardian.pdf\" title=\"\">have a robust lead</a> often in double figures. Mrs May is <a href=\"https://www.the guardian.com/politics/2016/oct/22/twice-voters-theresa-may-jeremy-corbyn-economy-brexit%E2%80%94opinium-observer-poll\" title=\"\">trusted by more than twice as many voters</a> as Jeremy Corbyn to run the economy successfully and handle Brexit effectively.</p> <p>That suggests an election would see the obliteration of a substantial chunk of Labour MPs. Yet such is the state of the party that a surprisingly large number of its MPs ache for an election, if only to be put out of their misery. \u201cI guess about half of my colleagues secretly want an early election,\u201d says one Labour MP. \u201cThey think, \u2018What the hell, let\u2019s roll the dice, things couldn\u2019t be any worse.\u2019\u201d Though they could, you know. An election in the first half of next year is not yet a certainty, but it has become quite a lot likelier. And, unusually, although for very different reasons, it would be welcome to many MPs on both sides of the Commons.</p> <p>I also detect a subtle, but significant, change in the language coming out of Downing Street when it is asked the question. On Friday, a Number 10 spokesperson declared: \u201cWe have been very clear: there is no requirement for a general election before 2020.\u201d That\u2019s not really clear at all. That\u2019s not the same as saying that there definitely won\u2019t be one. There\u2019s no requirement for me to have steak and chips for my dinner, but I might choose to do so all the same.</p>",
  "<p>He has lurched from crisis to crisis, insulted the world and been repeatedly accused of racism and sexual assault \u2013 but more than one in 10 Britons would still vote for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\" title=\"\">Donald Trump</a>, a new poll has revealed.</p> <p>An Opinium/Observer poll has found 12% of UK adults would vote for the Republican candidate if they were able to take part in next Tuesday\u2019s presidential election, compared with 49% for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton\" title=\"\">Hillary Clinton</a>.</p> <p>Opinium surveyed 2,001 adults between 1 and 4 November, a week in which polls narrowed amid the fallout from the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/03/fbi-leaks-hillary-clinton-james-comey-donald-trump\" title=\"\">FBI\u2019s decision to review a new batch of Clinton\u2019s staff\u2019s emails</a>.</p> <p>Perhaps unsurprisingly, men are more than twice as likely to support Trump, with 16% expressing a preference for him compared with just 8% of women. However, in a reflection of both candidates\u2019 underlying unpopularity, almost a third of respondents (32%) said they would not vote for either.</p> <p>The findings also suggest that the election is widely considered a foregone conclusion despite a late surge in support for Trump: 48% of UK adults expect Clinton to win the presidency, while 18% think a Trump victory is most likely.</p> <p>Of supporters of the major UK parties, only among Ukip voters did supporters of Trump outnumber those of Clinton: 43% of the party\u2019s voters would back the divisive billionaire, who has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/09/nigel-farage-defends-donald-trump-over-alpha-male-boasting\" title=\"\">enlisted the support of Nigel Farage</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/24/donald-trump-hails-eu-referendum-result-as-he-arrives-in-uk\" title=\"\">compared his campaign to the Brexit movement.</a></p> <p>The survey shows the Democratic candidate soundly beating Trump on a range of issues, including relations with Britain and global security. The Republican candidate, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/08/hillary-clinton-trump-unpatriotic-scary-putin\" title=\"\">who has praised Vladimir Putin</a> and suggested the US could withdraw from Nato under his presidency, is deemed a risk to international stability by 62% of Britons.</p> <p>Similarly, few voters believe a Trump victory would be good for Britain\u2019s so-called special relationship with the US. Just 16% of those surveyed said he would be a friend to the UK as president, compared with 41% for Clinton. Meanwhile, 53% think the British government should seek to improve its relationships with countries other than the US if Trump wins.</p> <p>Widespread dislike for Trump among the British public is also reflected by the words most commonly associated with the candidate. Dangerous (71%) was the most common word, followed by hate (61%) and fear (60%). Clinton inspires a more positive reaction. According to the poll, she is most associated with intelligence (58%), maturity (55%), and competence (50%).</p>",
  "<p>Once upon a time, a long, long, long time ago, small children might get told off for being loud or unruly or, as we called it then, \u201cdisruptive\u201d. Now? Not so much. In 2016, it\u2019s cool to be disruptive. It\u2019s what every startup in Silicon Valley is straining to do.</p> <p>It\u2019s what Airbnb has done \u2013 disrupting the hotel industry as Uber has disrupted taxis and Amazon has disrupted bookshops and almost everything else. Two years ago I went to a conference in San Francisco, TechCrunch Disrupt, and met many people claiming to disrupt many things, including, in one case, socks.</p> <p>But what no one anticipated was that, though it may be convenient to summon a motor vehicle to one\u2019s home with a tap of a button or to buy things online while wearing pyjamas and possibly drunk, it might also lead to where we are now: 6 November 2016. Two days, potentially, before the world changes forever.</p> <p>Because Donald Trump is not just an over-tanned reality-TV star gone rogue. He is not a weaponised version of Lord Sugar. He is what happens when technology changes everything. \u201cDisruption,\u201d wrote Clayton Christensen, the professor at Harvard Business School who coined the idea, is the \u201ctechnology mudslide hypothesis\u201d. It\u2019s how some scrappy little upstart like Microsoft overthrew the colossus that once was IBM. It\u2019s how some small new technological breakthrough can have huge, unexpected, world-changing consequences.</p> <p>It\u2019s Donald Trump. The living, breathing version of the scrappy little upstart that overturns an entire industry. Only this time it\u2019s not an industry, it\u2019s democracy.</p> <p>We have fetishised \u201cdisruption\u201d. Governments have stood by and watched it take down all industries in its path \u2013 the market must do what the market must do. Only now, the wave is breaking on its shore.</p> <p>Because what the last week of this presidential campaign has shown us is that technology has disrupted, is disrupting, is threatening to upturn the democratic process itself \u2013 the best, most stable, most equitable form of governance the world has yet come up with.</p> <p>In many crucial ways, it doesn\u2019t even matter who wins on Tuesday because perhaps the best thing you can say about Trump is that if it hadn\u2019t been him it would have been someone else. It\u2019s the opposite of the Great Man theory of history: a misogynistic ex-reality TV star is not the game-changer here, it\u2019s technology.</p> <p>Two days ago, the same hackers who took down Twitter and Netflix and the <em>Guardian</em> and Reddit and CNN last week in the biggest attack of its kind that the world has ever seen, started practising on a country. Computer malware had been used to infect inanimate objects in our homes \u2013 the connected devices that comprise the so-called internet of things and that, it\u2019s been discovered, a bit late, are hopelessly insecure.</p> <p>It has harnessed these to create a gigantic internet-destroying machine, the so-called Mirai botnet, and it\u2019s honing its power. Last week it took aim at an entire country \u2013 Liberia. A huge attack was launched against the two companies that own the only fibre going into the west African country \u2014 bringing its entire internet infrastructure to a halt.</p> <p>The worst case scenario? That the hackers behind it are \u201cpractising\u201d for Tuesday, when they\u2019ll aim their massed computing power against America.</p> <p>This is everyday objects in our own homes, \u201csmart\u201d objects, intenet-enabled toasters and refrigerators. Because this is where we are: our toasters and refrigerators may be about to be used to subvert the democratic process of the greatest democracy on Earth.</p> <p>And if that reads like the most lunatic sentence you\u2019ve ever read, you maybe haven\u2019t been paying close enough attention to 2016.</p> <p>Because this is possibly, finally, the year when it hits home that technology is not just some cool titanium-coloured gadget in our pockets. It\u2019s the facilitator of the degraded news space that treats facts and lies the same. That has enabled thousands of Twitterbots \u2013 algorithms \u2013 to scrape the internet for stories about Trump and then retweet them.</p> <p>It was robot accounts that caused \u201c#TrumpWon\u201d to trend after each TV debate and allowed Trump to claim \u201cvictory\u201d.</p> <p>It\u2019s how a man who hasn\u2019t set foot on the street for four years, can, with just his laptop, create havoc in the critical last week of the campaign. By leaking emails that potentially implicate Hillary Clinton, Julian Assange has inserted himself \u2013 like computer malware \u2014 into the heart of the American democratic process. He\u2019s infected it. He is, like Donald Trump, the law of unintended consequences writ large, in human form.</p> <p>In 2010, we didn\u2019t mind the fact that the data he leaked was stolen. Here in the liberal press, we championed it. Because it was stolen data that served to underscore our liberal sensibilities. Or, at least mine. And now? Not so much.</p> <p>But then technology is neutral. There is no left or right. There is only hackers and Twitterbots and 16-year-olds in Macedonia who, Buzzfeed reported last week, earn money via Google AdSense for writing made-up stories about Trump and making them go viral on Facebook.</p> <p>In a single Macedonian town \u2014 Veles \u2013 there are at least 140 websites about American politics run by Macedonian kids who make money from fabricated stories. Teenagers can earn up to $5,000 a month by making up things about Trump. They don\u2019t care about Trump or Clinton or anyone else. They\u2019ve just worked out what the US public wants to read and have found a way of serving it up to them whether it\u2019s true or not.</p> <p>The best way of making money via Google is to write clickbait, and the best clickbait they\u2019ve discovered, the stories that are spread widest and furthest in Facebook and Twitter, are stories about Trump. More specifically, false stories about Trump.</p> <p>Because in 2016 we read the news we want to read. The so-called \u201cfilter bubble\u201d, the means by which Google and Facebook give us more of what we want, or what we already know \u2013 our searches and our newsfeeds are programmed to reflect our previous searches and newsfeeds \u2014 is becoming not so much a bubble as a ghetto. Walled in, closed off, airless.</p> <p>It\u2019s not just that search engines have been shown to influence election results \u2013 the higher up a candidate\u2019s name is listed in any search, the more likely they are to win. It\u2019s also that the less we know about how other people think, the less we know.</p> <p>We\u2019re increasingly living in an echo chamber, exposed only to views which chime with our own. The impression this gives is that everyone is like us, thinks like us, wants to be like us.</p> <p>Yet most people are not like us. Maybe that\u2019s what 2016 has come to teach us. That and the idea that Google and Facebook are out to make the world a better place is both absurd and irrelevant.</p> <p>It doesn\u2019t matter what Mark Zuckerberg wants or what Sergey Brin intends. The people who donated to WikiLeaks didn\u2019t intend to get the first potential female US president investigated by the FBI. Nobody wanted their fridge to bring down CNN.</p> <p>Google didn\u2019t intend to drive all newspapers out of business. It\u2019s just something that is happening along the way.</p> <p>And this time, it\u2019s the big one. The Great Disruption. With Trump the Great Disruptor.</p> <p>Will democracy survive? Will Nato? Is a free and fair election possible in a post-truth world when every word any candidate has ever written can be stolen and exposed and distorted? Who knows?</p> <p>It\u2019s a crapshoot from here on in. Go tell that to your filter bubble. Because that\u2019s all you can do. No one else is listening.</p>",
  "<h2>Latin America<br></h2> <p>Governments have often preferred Republican presidential candidates because they historically put an emphasis on free trade, but this time, politicians and commentators are lining up to express doubts about Donald Trump, who has alarmed many with his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jun/16/donald-trump-mexico-presidential-speech-latino-hispanic\">dismissive comments about Latinos</a>, plans to build a wall on the Mexican border, and his unpredictable behaviour.</p> <p>Dem\u00e9trio Magnoli, a sociologist and prominent voice of Brazil\u2019s \u201cnew right\u201d, said a Trump victory would be a geopolitical earthquake. \u201cTrump is the closest the US has gotten to fascism. You would have an American president that is nationalist and nativist and we would see mass deportations, and a wall being built, which is likely since he will most likely not deport 11 million people.\u201d</p> <p>He predicted this would force Mexico to turn more towards Latin America and could upset free trade agreements and hurt economic growth.</p> <p>\u201cTrump is so unpredictable and politically inexperienced. We have no idea what he will do, but he seems authoritarian, sexist and contemptuous about Latinos,\u201d said Violeta Granera, of the opposition alliance in Nicaragua.</p> <p>By comparison, Hillary Clinton is seen as a safe pair of hands who is likely to continue the relatively benign policies of the Obama administration.</p> <p>Carlos Lins da Silva, a senior consultant for the S\u00e3o Paulo Research Foundation, said US regional policies were unlikely to see a major change, but added: \u201cThe election of Trump would \u2013 at least in the short term \u2013 cause dramatic impacts on the international system \u2026 if he puts into practice some of the programmes he is advocating. Brazil won\u2019t come away unscathed. For example, if he makes the entrance of Muslim people more difficult, builds a wall between Mexico and the US, has Nato members pay for US defence, encourages Japan to have a nuclear bomb, gets tougher on Nafta and other free trade deals. All of these ideas would have negative consequences for many countries.</p> <p>Diplomats said they did not expect a major shift in Washington\u2019s Latin American policy regardless of the outcome.</p> <p>\u201cHillary Clinton knows Brazil better than Trump, as she has been here before and knows people here, but there will not be any substantial change in relations either way because external relations with South America are a low priority for the US,\u201d said Rubens Barbosa, former Brazilian ambassador to Washington.</p> <p>The country with most at stake may be Cuba, which has enjoyed a reconciliation with the US under Barack Obama. Former Cuban president Fidel Castro weighed in with an article last month in the <em>Granma</em> newspaper in which he awarded Trump \u201cthe medal of mud\u201d, but the old revolutionary also had nothing good to say about the Democrats.</p> <h2>Middle East<br></h2> <p>Trump outraged the Arab world with his comments on Muslim immigration \u2013 and regional public opinion certainly reflects this. A survey of 3,017 people in the Middle East and North Africa found that \u2013 if they had a vote \u2013 half would snub both Trump and Clinton.</p> <p>On the fight against Islamic State, Clinton has pledged to never send troops back to Iraq, and ruled out boots on the ground in Syria. Trump has been less specific about his plan to fight Isis, but said in March that the US has \u201cno choice\u201d but to send 20,000 to 30,000 combat troops to the region.</p> <p>In the survey, from the Jeddah-based daily <em>Arab News</em> and pollsters YouGov, 46% said the US should send troops to fight Isis and collaborate closely with Russia on Syria. The rest did not want a US presence on the ground but did feel that Washington should be more involved in the humanitarian efforts for Syrian refugees, arm moderate groups and increase air strikes on Isis. Clinton was most popular, with 78% saying she would be the best for the Arab world.</p> <p>On the candidates\u2019 policies, Arab opinion is much more balanced. Clinton\u2019s stance on climate change and US Israel policy found strong support in the poll. But Arabs overwhelmingly back Trump\u2019s stance on abortion and, ironically perhaps, border controls.</p> <h2>Russia</h2> <p>Vladimir Putin <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/08/trump-putin-senate-republicans-marco-rubio-john-mccain\">was thrust into an unexpected starring role in this election,</a> and whatever the result, it will please the Kremlin that it has been able to cause so much mischief. How much of this was down to direct Kremlin meddling, we will perhaps never know, although the state media\u2019s bias towards Trump has been fairly clear.</p> <p>Most Russian analysts believe the US is systemically set up to oppose Russia, and while there is an understanding that Trump is an unusual candidate, many believe a Trump presidency would not change things much. Other more sober heads are well aware that for all Trump\u2019s friendly rhetoric, as president he would be a much more unpredictable quantity than Clinton, the devil they know.</p> <p>To go on the public rhetoric alone, the casual observer would think the Russian establishment is banking on Trump. Russian television has been giving airtime to many of Trump\u2019s claims that the election could be rigged, but this is as much to help discredit the US system in the eyes of viewers as it is sincere backing for Trump. He has been backed not because of his politics, but because he is the chaos candidate; in the same way Russia was also keen on Brexit. Even if Clinton wins, Russia knows that after this divisive campaign, US democracy is in for a period of soul-searching which will leave less energy and focus for meeting external threats.</p> <h2>Africa</h2> <p>If Africa has barely featured in the campaign, then the continent has, in part, returned the compliment. But though many experts believe the result may not imply any drastic change in US policies in Africa, there is still widespread anxiety and Trump has already alienated many, particularly with his apparently racist rhetoric.</p> <p>\u201cFew Africans are putting any store on Trump if he wins the election, that is if he remembers we exist once he\u2019s done with Mexicans and illegal immigrants,\u201d wrote Gitau Warigi, in Kenya\u2019s <em>Daily Nation</em>.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s call for a ban on Muslims entering the US received widespread coverage and provoked outrage. The Somalia-based Islamic militant group, al-Shabaab, included a clip of Trump proposing the temporary ban in one of its recruiting videos.</p> <p>The tycoon does have supporters. <a href=\"http://www.wingia.com/web/files/richeditor/filemanager/WINGIA_Global_Poll_on_US_Election_-_FINALIZED_Revised_Global_Press_Release.pdf\">Although a poll </a>in Nigeria found that 77% would vote Clinton and only 19% Trump, while in South Africa the proportion was 59% to 15%, some African commentators see Trump as an anti-establishment candidate of a sort they would welcome: one who could disrupt an unjust status quo.</p> <p>\u201cThe world and nations don\u2019t reform when they are comfortable. They only do so when they are afraid or have been severely injured \u2026 <a href=\"http://www.africareview.com/opinion/Bring-on-Donald-Trump-he-will-change-our-rotten-ways-/979188-3184656-rs3h5n/index.html\">bring on Trump</a>,\u201d wrote Charles Onyango-Obbo, a Kenyan publisher and columnist.</p> <p>However, neither candidate has given any real clues to their attitude on Africa. On trade, there is speculation that Trump\u2019s support for greater protection of US industries could mean higher tariffs that would <a href=\"http://www.nation.co.ke/news/world/Africa-unsure-how-a-post-Obama-regime-will-treat-Agoa/1068-3434786-x65cxy/index.html\">damage some African economies</a>, local analysts say. Nearly 40 countries in sub-Saharan Africa can export goods to the US duty-free under legislation from 2000. In some, the regime has served as a catalyst for industrial production.</p> <p>On aid, there are fears for the funding of projects to prevent and treat HIV and Aids which have helped millions. Clinton is seen as backing continued, or enhanced, public health assistance.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s allegations of vote rigging in the US have prompted strong reactions in a continent where manipulation of electoral process is widespread.</p> <p>\u201cDonald Trump is a gift to all tin-pot dictators on the African continent. He is giving currency and legitimacy to rigging because if it can exist in America, it can exist anywhere,\u201d Zimbabwean opposition leader Tendai Biti told Reuters news agency last week. However, it is a fake quote which has caused the biggest stir. Trump has been widely reported to have pledged to \u201clock up\u201d both Robert Mugabe, the veteran president of Zimbabwe, and Museveni. The false comment was not questioned and prompted anger, hope, ridicule, excitement and hilarity \u2013 as well as a small demonstration of support in Uganda where five protesters waved placards outside the US embassy.</p> <h2>Germany</h2> <p>A new video by German comedian Jan B\u00f6hmermann was released last week, entitled Grab US by the Pussy. It waxes lyrical about the foreign policy that Washington might pursue if Trump were in the White House.</p> <p>\u201cWe like the new spirit of your nation / Let\u2019s walk hand in hand into isolation\u201d goes one of the lines.</p> <p>In reality, the majority of Germans view the prospect of a Republican victory on Tuesday with fear. Some 65% of respondents in a YouGov survey released last week said that they were afraid of such an outcome. If Germans could vote, a poll by the magazine <em>Stern</em> found that only 5% would cast their vote for Trump.</p> <p>In political circles, Germany\u2019s biggest concerns relate to how much damage a Trump presidency would do to the transatlantic alliance. The US is the key contributor to the UN budget and has the highest military budget within Nato, yet during his campaign Trump has described Nato as \u201cobsolete\u201d and indicated that he would, at the very least, seek to renegotiate its framework.</p> <p>If the Republican wins and lives up to his own words, Germany and France would, after Brexit, be the two countries expected to try to fill the geopolitical vacuum in Europe. Hope remains that Trump\u2019s rhetoric would prove more dramatic than his actions.</p> <p>\u201cIn Berlin government circles,\u201d <em>Der Spiegel</em> recently wrote, \u201cofficials are more concerned about Trump\u2019s character than the radical political about-face he might introduce.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>As the markets tremble, the polls tighten, the bookies scramble to adjust the odds, and the US presidential race enters its final, frantic days, the rhetoric \u2013 from the president down \u2013 grows more hysterical by the hour. If we are to believe Barack Obama, the fate of the civilised world hangs in the balance as America faces an imminent electoral apocalypse after the \u201cdirtiest campaign ever\u201d.</p> <p>To the uninitiated, the Donald Trump insurgency must look like the nadir of democracy, more about \u201cpussy\u201d than politics. How, you might ask, could a powerful, multi-ethnic country, where women voters outnumber men by several million, seriously consider electing a man whose name is synonymous with xenophobia, racism and misogyny? As this vituperative and volatile encounter approaches its climax on Tuesday, you might think: Is this not the worst?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2012/may/31/us-presidential-portraits-pictures\">US presidential portraits - in pictures</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Actually, the US electorate has been here before, many times, going back to the 1780s, in elections replete with assassination, corruption, rhetorical vitriol, and good old \u201cdirty tricks\u201d. The meat-grinding process by which the American democratic sausage is made has always fallen a long way short of edifying.</p> <p>In <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/mar/13/donald-trump-1968-election-violence-chicago-richard-nixon\" title=\"\">1968</a>, the primary season was scarred by the violent deaths of Martin Luther King and Bobby Kennedy. On election day itself, Hubert Humphrey, who had trailed Richard Nixon in the polls for weeks, ran Tricky Dicky so close that the networks could not declare the result until morning.</p> <p>Closer still was the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/26/presidential-debates-nixon-kennedy-1960\" title=\"\">Nixon-Kennedy contest of 1960</a>. John F Kennedy scraped 112,827 (0.17%) more votes than Nixon nationwide, <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/history_lesson/2000/10/was_nixon_robbed.html\" title=\"\">allegedly through the corrupt intervention</a> of the mayor of Chicago, Richard Daley. Although Nixon won the popular vote in more individual states (26 to 22), Kennedy won an electoral college victory of 303 to 219. Overall, 1960 was the closest election <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2012/nov/06/us-president-election-woodrow-wilson-1916\" title=\"\">since 1916</a> and remains famously suspenseful. It too was held on 8 November.</p> <p>Trump may have plumbed the depths of vulgarity, sleaze and pig-ignorance, but he is anticipated by the politics of the 1850s, in the decade before Abraham Lincoln\u2019s presidency. Not many now remember <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/aug/18/donald-trump-immigration-know-nothing-dangerous-republicans\" title=\"\">Millard Fillmore</a> or his supporters, the self-styled \u201cKnow Nothings\u201d, but these wild patriots, the forefathers of the angry white males who chant \u201clock her up\u201d, prefigure many aspects of the Trump campaign, promising to \u201cpurify\u201d American politics.</p> <p>The Know Nothings exploited popular fears that the country was being overwhelmed by immigrants, who were seen as enemies of the republic and, more sinister still, controlled by the pope. The party was most active from 1854 to 1856 and had a champion in Fillmore (one of the worst US presidents). <a href=\"http://www.abrahamlincolnonline.org/lincoln/speeches/speed.htm\" title=\"\">Lincoln himself wrote</a> to a friend, \u201cI am not a Know Nothing. How could I be? \u2026 Our progress in degeneracy appears to me to be pretty rapid. As a nation, we began by declaring that \u2018All men are created equal\u2019 \u2026 When the Know Nothings get control, it will read \u2018All men are created equal, except negroes and foreigners and Catholics.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Ordinary, decent Americans were aghast when Trump appeared to encourage the gun lobby to defend \u201cthe second amendment\u201d by directing their protest (and their weapons) against Hillary Clinton. At least he did not, as Aaron Burr did in 1804, actually fight a duel with one of his political adversaries. Burr, who was Thomas Jefferson\u2019s vice-president at the time, mortally wounded Alexander Hamilton, and charged with murder had to flee to safety in the south.</p> <p>Rhetorically, the mudslinging inspired by Jefferson\u2019s two successful campaigns for the presidency was often as ugly as anything heard on the stump with Trump and \u201ccrooked Hillary\u201d. In the 1800 presidential election, Jefferson fought John Adams, whose supporters charged that Jefferson was a godless libertine in thrall to the French. This election was said to have been \u201cone of the most acrimonious in the annals of American history\u201d.</p> <p>More than 200 years later, many commentators believe that the US system is broken. But it has seemed broken before and somehow staggers on. From some points of view, the ferocity of Trump v Clinton is evidence of vigour not breakdown. However, some observers are wondering if the shock that would reform the system might destroy it.</p>",
  "<p>It has become painfully clear since June\u2019s vote to leave the European Union that Theresa May\u2019s government and its supporters have little or no idea where the country is heading.

Their hysterical reaction to last week\u2019s unanimous high court ruling that Britain cannot quit the EU without parliament\u2019s consent also reveals extraordinary ignorance about where we, as a country, have come from.

Parliament\u2019s ascendancy was legally established in the Glorious Revolution of 1688, which spawned the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/civil_war_revolution/glorious_revolution_01.shtml\" title=\"\">landmark Bill of Rights</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"56dbbd362bff8a1f5bb814465fa4fda69312df70\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/56dbbd362bff8a1f5bb814465fa4fda69312df70/0_0_4810_3433/1000.jpg\" alt=\"George Jeffreys, the infamous lord chief justice of England is caught and beaten by a London mob during the Glorious Revolution, December 1688.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"714\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">George Jeffreys, the infamous lord chief justice of England is caught and beaten by a London mob during the Glorious Revolution, December 1688.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Edward Gooch/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It is also a long-established fact of British constitutional life that the country\u2019s senior judges do not make domestic law. Their independent role is to interpret laws agreed by parliament, say what they mean and how and if they may be legally implemented. When Britain joined what was then the EEC, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/02/theresa-may-great-repeal-bill-eu-british-law\" title=\"\">European Communities Act</a>, passed by parliament in 1972, incorporated many European laws into domestic law. Thus it is both illogical and ignorant to castigate the high court for doing its job and stating the constitutionally obvious: that having passed the act, only parliament can override it by consenting <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/25/article-50-brexit-debate-britain-eu\" title=\"\">to activate article 50 of the Lisbon treaty</a>.</p> <p>Yet castigating the judges and by extension, anybody who has the effrontery to agree with them, is exactly what the hard Tory Brexiters and their accomplices in the lie factories of Fleet Street have resorted to with a venom, vindictiveness and vituperation remarkable even by their standards. The will of the people has been thwarted by an \u201cactivist\u201d judiciary. These bewigged, closet Remainers, members of the fabled \u201cwell-heeled liberal metropolitan elite\u201d, are \u201cenemies of the people\u201d, they shriek. Some of these sleaze-peddlers even dipped into homophobia, <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3903436/Enemies-people-Fury-touch-judges-defied-17-4m-Brexit-voters-trigger-constitutional-crisis.html\" title=\"\">highlighting the sexual orientation of one of the judges.

It wilfully misunderstands the relationship between parliament, government and the judiciary. Partisanship is understandable, but this level of stupidity is unforgivable. It misleads and distorts \u2013 either deliberately or out of ignorance. As Hilary Benn pointed out yesterday, the high court judgment has nothing to do with defying the \u201cwill of the people\u201d. As he explained, \u201cthe judgment is not to do with the fact that we will be leaving the European Union. It was a ruling on who starts the process, who fires the starting gun and in upholding the principle of parliamentary sovereignty\u2026 the judges said that since it was legislation that took us in, it should be parliament that takes the decision to start that process and not the government.\u201d</p> <p>Or here is Conservative MP and ex-attorney general Dominic Grieve speaking on <em>Newsnight </em>on Friday: \u201cI was horrified at the newspaper coverage, which reminded me of Robert Mugabe\u2019s Zimbabwe. The judges did exactly what was asked of them \u2013 they highlighted that our constitution does not allow you to overturn statute law by decree.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/nov/03/ruling-on-brexit-opens-way-to-mps-revolt\">Article 50 ruling leaves Theresa May facing potential MP revolt</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The judiciary are at the heart of our commitment to the rule of law and those who question their legitimacy (because they disagree with their view) threaten to undermine a critical institution vital to our democracy. Yesterday, the Bar Council took the extraordinary step of asking the lord chancellor, Liz Truss, to condemn the \u201cserious and unjustified\u201d attacks on senior judges over the Brexit court ruling. Senior judges having to appeal to the lord chancellor to defend them from unjustified attacks, in Britain, in 2016?</p> <p>Since 23 June, the country has loosed itself from tolerant, civil discourse - on both sides. The world has often looked to Britain as an example of a pluralist, inclusive democracy and a cultured, ordered and civil society. But that is changing. As the world looked at the response of politicians and the popular press to last week\u2019s court judgment, many will have concluded that it had more in common with Sisi\u2019s Egypt or Erdo\u011fan\u2019s Turkey than the Britain they thought they knew. A&#xa0;country that hounds, demonises and implicitly threatens its independent judiciary is one that toys menacingly with the very tenets of democracy.</p> <p>We noted in these columns some weeks ago that Theresa May, who coined the phrase the \u201cnasty party\u201d to describe the Conservatives some years ago, was threatening to turn Britain into the nasty country. That is increasingly the message being sent across the world. It is also the message being sent to foreigners living here, including long-resident EU nationals now afraid to speak openly for fear of rebuke or worse.</p> <p>Many more reasonable Brexit supporters have rightly distanced themselves from campaign to demonise the judges responsible for last week\u2019s ruling. But the government\u2019s ill-advised decision to appeal to the supreme court means judges sitting on England\u2019s highest bench, who will consider the matter next month, may now also be subject to overt political pressure and similarly contemptuous, intimidatory invective. In Turkey or Burundi, such tactics by the state and its surrogates <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/nov/04/labour-condemns-newspaper-attacks-on-judges-after-brexit-ruling\" title=\"\">might not be considered surprising</a>. But here?</p> <p>What sort of country is Britain becoming that this sort of menacing behaviour is not only tolerated but implicitly encouraged by senior government ministers who fear, correctly, they are losing the argument? As has been repeated ad nauseam, the issue is not about reversing or somehow sabotaging the referendum result. It is about ensuring proper democratic scrutiny of the government\u2019s negotiating positions, about ascertaining whether its approach advances the national interest rather than sectional, business and City interests. It is about getting the best deal for Britain.</p> <p>The concerted assault on the judiciary comes in the context of wider institutional vandalism indulged by the hard Tory Brexiters and their international sympathisers and emulators. They would recklessly tear up nearly 45 years of carefully navigated British relationships with our European neighbours. The resulting damage to the economy and living standards is mounting fast.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"947bbe3f971f2bd3c44479d312582db829155d59\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/947bbe3f971f2bd3c44479d312582db829155d59/0_0_4919_3264/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Gina Miller, the businesswoman at the centre of the high court case, speaks after the judgment on Thursday.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"664\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gina Miller, the businesswoman at the centre of the high court case, speaks after the judgment on Thursday.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Johnny Armstead/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Much worse is to come. In America, Donald Trump runs a presidential campaign based on fear, prejudice, ignorance and xenophobia, which he claims represents change, not abject regression, and threatens to reject the election outcome if it goes against him. The dire cost of Trumpism to America\u2019s national unity and cohesion is already plain.</p> <p>Across Europe, iconoclastic extremist and nationalist parties compete to demonstrate who is most intolerant, most hateful and best at scaring people. In France, their vile message may be working as presidential elections approach and the Front National gains ground. But hard Tory Brexiters do not see the link, deny any crossover, cannot understand how their institutional dumpster fire stokes nihilism and chauvinism. They dwell in their Little England bubble, detached from the real world or, as the high court said of their article 50 arguments, \u201cdivorced from reality\u201d. Anybody who disturbs their narrative, such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/nov/04/stephen-phillips-resigns-over-undemocratic-brexit-process\" title=\"\">Stephen Phillips, who resigned as a Conservative MP on Friday</a>, is shunned as a blood foe. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/nov/01/legally-protected-uk-food-products-brexit-threat-nick-clegg\" title=\"\">Nick Clegg</a>, for daring to add his voice to the democratic debate over Brexit, is ridiculed. Will these people who hound reasonable public figures ever understand what a mature democracy involves? Formidable, robust, intelligent and reasoned debate.</p> <p>As <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/nov/04/theresa-may-told-to-act-to-calm-brexit-mob-anger\" title=\"\">Dominic Grieve</a> said: \u201cDebate helps outcomes, suppressing it destroys it.\u201d Would they rather our public discourse \u2013 and hence, public life \u2013 be characterised by childish slurs, homophobia, distortions and vicious rhetoric? That is where Britain is being driven by a new hard Brexit elite.</p> <p>It behoves any sensible, reasonable public figure to recognise that a 52-48 referendum result is one where national cohesiveness matters. And while it delivered a mandate to exit the European Union, it did not give sweeping powers to brush aside challenges on the nature, timing and texture of that exit. There is a lack of reason on both sides of this debate and there is a danger that the public fissures that have opened up since June 23rd become wider still. We all have a responsibility to ensure that does not happen. As Iain Martin says elsewhere on these pages, \u201cNeither set of extremists is representative of, nor has a majority in, parliament or the country. What becomes ever more apparent over Brexit is that there is a need for an alliance between moderate (of which there are many) Leavers and moderate Remainers, those who regret the result on 23 June but accept it.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ce9dde605695bbc948a496efe99c9e03952ec483\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ce9dde605695bbc948a496efe99c9e03952ec483/0_93_2944_1767/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The prime minister, Theresa May\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The prime minister, Theresa May: \u2018She has already shown a talent for wrong-headedness, an unerring instinct for the bad call.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kirsty Wigglesworth/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The truth is, hard Tory Brexiters are fearful of losing the argument. The truth is there is little confidence that May can keep her head and rein in the irresponsible fantasies of her more wild-eyed colleagues. The truth is, May has already shown a talent for wrong-headedness, an instinct for the bad call, as seen with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/sep/15/hinkley-point-c-nuclear-power-station-gets-go-ahead\" title=\"\">Hinkley Point</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/sep/09/theresa-may-to-end-ban-on-new-grammar-schools\" title=\"\">grammar schools</a>, child obesity and Nissan subsidies. She appears unable to grasp the EU\u2019s blunt insistence that access to the single market cannot be divorced from freedom of movement.</p> <p>The disdain, scepticism and bewilderment of Britain\u2019s EU partners is wounding. At last month\u2019s Brussels summit, her first, May was kept waiting until the early morning before being allowed to deliver a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/21/theresa-may-awkward-eu-meeting-sees-little-progress-on-brexit\" title=\"\">short statement on Brexit</a>. She was listened to in silence. Nobody deigned to respond. On Friday, her calls to Germany\u2019s Angela Merkel and the commission president, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/13/jean-claude-juncker-eu-is-facing-existential-crisis\" title=\"\">Jean-Claude Juncker</a>, when she tried to persuade them, implausibly, that her March deadline for article 50 still stood, were embarrassingly brief. Few in Europe now believe Britain\u2019s government has a roadmap.</p> <p>In such circumstances, it is imperative that parliament, now given its chance \u2013 and reminded of its duty \u2013 to shape Britain\u2019s future course by the high court, steps up to the mark. For too long, too many MPs who support continued EU membership (a majority overall) have been cowering in silence, fearful that any expression of unease over the Brexit process will be misrepresented as a bid to overturn the referendum result. No one disputes the result of the referendum, or the social, cultural and political tensions that delivered it, but it is right that the manner of our exit are properly scrutinised. That has yet to be decided. And parliament, rightly, has a role to play.</p> <p>To be worthy of its sovereign status, both Houses of Parliament should now inject themselves into the Brexit process. This means cross-examining ministers and demanding a green paper on the government\u2019s plans. It means proposing alternative strategies. It means amending and, if need be, discarding wrong-headed approaches. And it means the holding of binding votes not only on when article 50 should be triggered but also on the final terms of any eventual exit agreement.</p> <p>In short, parliament must be ready to exercise veto power over any Brexit deal that does not ultimately serve the national interest \u2013 because this government simply cannot be trusted not to deliver serious economic self-harm on the altar of blind ideology. It is a tall order. The growing prospect of an early general election, should May continue to trip, fumble and flop, presents many MPs with an existential dilemma: whether to vote with their conscience and uphold the democratic rights of parliament and their constituents or be pushed and pulled along by a populist tide, propelled by lies. Most Labour MPs, for example, represent constituencies where a majority voted Leave. It is still likely that last week\u2019s ruling proves a pyrrhic victory, by provoking an early election that, with the current dire state of the Labour party, will give May an enhanced majority. Thus, we will have a parliament with fewer teeth and providing less scrutiny or push-back than is required.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/nov/03/nicola-sturgeon-scotland-mps-joining-article-50-legal-battle-brexit-high-court\">Nicola Sturgeon deciding whether to join article 50 legal battle</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Perhaps prodded by the shadow Brexit minister, Keir Starmer, the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, could be stirred from his lethargic ambivalence over Europe.

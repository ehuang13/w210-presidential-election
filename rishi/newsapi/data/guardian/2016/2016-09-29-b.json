  "<p>After months of bashing the German chancellor on the campaign trail, Donald Trump declared that Angela Merkel was his favorite world leader.</p> <p>In an interview with a local reporter in New Hampshire, the Republican presidential nominee proclaimed: \u201cI think Merkel is a really great world leader.\u201d Though, he added, \u201cI was very disappointed that, when she, this move with the whole thing on immigration, I think it\u2019s a big problem and really, you know, to look at what she\u2019s done in the last year and a half. I was always a Merkel person. I thought really fantastic. But I think she made a very tragic mistake a year and a half ago.\u201d </p> <p>Trump was criticizing the German chancellor\u2019s openness to taking refugees from Syria. Despite the ongoing civil war and humanitarian crisis in that country, Trump has long warned of the danger of taking in refugees, whom he has compared to the Trojan Horse.</p> <p>The statement marks a change in tone from Trump, who has repeatedly attacked Merkel on the campaign trail. </p> <p>In December, after Merkel bested him to be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/dec/09/angela-merkel-time-magazine-person-of-the-year-2015\">Time\u2019s Person of the Year</a>, Trump <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/674587800835092480\">tweeted</a> she was \u201cruining Germany\u201d.

  "<p>Pepe the Frog originated as an innocuous cartoon character in 2005. This week, he was <a href=\"http://www.adl.org/press-center/press-releases/extremism/adl-adds-pepe-the-frog-online-hate-symbols-database.html#.V-wKyvkrLcs\">added</a> to the Anti-Defamation League\u2019s database of hate symbols. At first glance, it may seem more than a little strange that the <a href=\"http://www.adl.org/combating-hate/hate-on-display/c/pepe-the-frog.html#.V-wK4_krLcs\">image of a cartoon frog</a> could end up alongside such infamous symbols as the <a href=\"http://www.adl.org/combating-hate/hate-on-display/c/blood-drop-cross.html\">Blood Drop Cross</a> of the Ku Klux Klan. But the evolution of Pepe the Frog actually illustrates a key aspect of hate symbols: many such images do not actually begin as hate symbols. </p> <p>We maintain this database as part of our work to track hate groups and help law enforcement, educators and other members of the public to identify those symbols that serve as potential calling cards of extremists and antisemites. What we have learned is that, often, symbols slowly evolve in that direction or are appropriated by extremists from their original context and assigned a new, more hateful meaning.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.adl.org/combating-hate/hate-on-display/c/swastika.html#.V-wK__krLcs\">swastika</a>, reviled in western cultures as a hateful symbol of the Nazi regime, was originally so innocuous that it was a common graphic design element in American advertising. Even today, the swastika is a popular symbol of good fortune across much of Asia. Context matters.</p> <p>Pepe the Frog came to life in an online comic called Boy\u2019s Club, created by artist Matt Furie. However, the frog soon escaped Furie\u2019s control as fans created their own Pepe images and shared them online, turning the character into a popular internet meme.</p> <p>One of the attractions of Pepe as a meme was that people could place the cartoon frog in virtually any circumstance, depicting him as Shakespeare or a superhero or modern celebrities. </p> <p>This universality, however, was what also soon gave Pepe the Frog a dark side. Pepe appearances were not always innocuous, as people drew him in various sexual, tasteless or otherwise offensive poses and contexts. Some called such images \u201cdark Pepes\u201d.</p> <p>Many of these images appeared first in online discussion forums such as Reddit, 4chan and 8chan. Parts of those forums have well-deserved reputations for antisemitism and bigotry, so it was almost inevitable that racist and antisemitic Pepe images would join other offensive depictions. </p> <p>But many pop culture images, from Bart Simpson to <a href=\"https://newrepublic.com/minutes/128099/yes-theres-connection-little-pony-donald-trump-white-identity-politics\">My Little Pony</a>, have been appropriated by white supremacists from time to time, without those pop culture images ever developing reputations as hate symbols. In another universe, Pepe the Frog might have had a similar history. </p> <p>Two developments gave it a very different path. The first was the rise of the so-called \u2018alt right\u2019, a loose network of white supremacists, mostly online, who seek to infuse American conservatism with racism and antisemitism. Pepe the Frog became an unofficial mascot for many on the alt right.</p> <p>The second development was the contentious and controversial 2016 presidential election, which the alt right has vigorously exploited in order to draw attention to itself. Pepe images became a part of this exploitation.</p> <p>Many of these Pepe depictions were not bigoted in nature, but merely supportive of candidate Trump. But offensive Pepe images also grew in number \u2013 and were sometimes even sent to journalists or others who had written or said negative things about Trump. Such usages went part and parcel with the alt right\u2019s use of triple parentheses <a href=\"http://www.adl.org/press-center/press-releases/anti-semitism-usa/adl-to-add-echo-symbol-used-by-anti-semites-on-twitter-to-online-hate-symbol-database.html#.V-wLVvkrLcs\">\u2018echo\u2019 punctuation</a> to single out Jewish journalists.</p> <p>By now, racist and antisemitic Pepe the Frog images have entrenched themselves in the iconography of the alt right. They are used as in-jokes and references among alt right activists or displayed to others in attempts to harass or shock. </p> <p>It is at this point in a symbol\u2019s evolution towards contexts of prejudice and hate that we often consider it for inclusion in our <a href=\"http://www.adl.org/combating-hate/hate-on-display/#.V-wLfvkrLcs\">Hate on Display</a> database. In the case of the Pepe image, we decided that inclusion was warranted.</p> <p>This does not mean that all uses of Pepe images should thus be considered racist or antisemitic. Though white supremacists have appropriated the symbol, its usage in other contexts has not stopped. Consequently, we must always be careful never to assume that someone is racist or antisemitic simply because they used a Pepe image that itself is devoid of racism or bigotry. We must always interpret symbols only in the contexts in which they occur.</p> <p>Some Pepe lovers on the Internet have even called for Pepe to be \u201csaved\u201d \u2013 myself included \u2013 to be taken back from the haters. Though not very common, this sort of re-appropriation actually has happened from time to time. The most prominent example is the <a href=\"http://www.adl.org/combating-hate/hate-on-display/c/iron-cross.html#.V-wLnvkrLcs\">Iron Cross</a> symbol, once rarely used outside of white supremacist or outlaw biker circles, but now a very popular symbol used in clothing and accessories. </p> <p>Perhaps something similar can happen with Pepe. For the near future, unfortunately, the cartoon is likely to continue to be exploited by racists and antisemites.</p>",

Since then, he has made the tricky crossover from teenage heartthrob to respected actor and producer, and at first glance, Wahlberg now looks like a typical Hollywood A-lister. His gently feathered hair, which brushes his shoulders, looks like it was cut by a stylist who charges three figures, and his deep tan and muscles suggest a man whose time is his own. But Wahlberg has always been a more surprising prospect than appearances suggest. For a start, the reason he seems so bored is because, he says, right off the bat, \u201cI never really like talking about myself,\u201d which is not something you hear often from a celebrity. He perks up any time he can deflect the conversation to an anecdote about someone else in his life. One of those people, it turns out, is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\">Donald Trump</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b3dbf050b8f80a7c58bf001beb2e6058d8a56298\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b3dbf050b8f80a7c58bf001beb2e6058d8a56298/0_0_946_1422/665.jpg\" alt=\"Wahlberg Trump golf\" width=\"665\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mark Wahlberg plays golf as Donald Trump watches on.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: The Golf Channel</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>He was very Trump-like, talking business, properties and stuff.

How was he, I ask?</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s an OK golfer,\u201d he says, and the faint praise is damning. \u201cI\u2019ve gotten to know him a little bit since, at various occasions. I\u2019ve never met <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton\">Hillary Clinton</a>.\u201d</p> <p>It turns out that Wahlberg and Trump met almost a decade ago at one of those weird celebrity golf events that always seem to be happening in California or Florida. What did they talk about? \u201cHe was very Donald Trump-like, talking about the things that he does, things that he has, business interests, properties, stuff like that. But he wasn\u2019t ever mean or rude. I don\u2019t think he asked me too many personal questions, or about what I do.\u201d</p> <p>Perhaps Ivanka explained to her dad who Wahlberg is, because Trump has since invited him back to play golf at his own events. \u201cYeah, it\u2019s a little crazy where we are now,\u201d is all Wahlberg says about the election in which his golf buddy is barely a breath away from the White House.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yASbM8M2vg\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/8yASbM8M2vg?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Click here to watch the trailer for Deepwater Horizon.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Wahlberg is in London, suffering the weather and talking Trump, because he is promoting his latest film, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/deepwater-horizon\">Deepwater Horizon</a>, the true story of the 2010 oil-rig explosion and spill crisis, the worst ever in the US. Wahlberg plays Mike Williams, the heroic lead character based on a real person, alongside <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/kurt-russell\">Kurt Russell</a> as the gruff ol\u2019 boss and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/john-malkovich\">John Malkovich</a>, who hams it up enjoyably as the BP rep, evil to an almost southern gothic extent. It is a strikingly harrowing disaster film and Wahlberg is in classic Wahlberg mode: the blue-collar hero, standing his ground against, on the one side, Malkovich\u2019s scenery chewing and, on the other, the pyrotechnic special effects.</p> <p>Wahlberg\u2019s career is remarkable in two respects: first, the sheer range of films he has made. There are the intense dramas (The Basketball Diaries, Boogie Nights, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/the-fighter\">The Fighter</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/mar/03/broken-city-review\">Broken City</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2006/oct/06/thriller.mattdamon\">The Departed</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2007/dec/14/thriller\">We Own the Night</a>), the comedies (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2004/nov/04/londonfilmfestival2004.londonfilmfestival\">I Heart Huckabees</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/sep/16/the-other-guys-review\">The Other Guys</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/ted\">Ted</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/apr/22/date-night-review\">Date Night</a>), the action movies (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/jul/10/transformers-age-of-extinction-review-michael-bay\">Transformers: Age of Extinction</a>,<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/jan/30/lone-survivor-review\"> Lone Survivor</a>, Deepwater Horizon).</p> <p>Wahlberg sinks himself so deeply into a role that you can easily forget who you are actually watching, which is not something you can say of most big-name actors (on some level I\u2019d forgotten that the same guy who played Dirk Diggler was also the one who larked around with a talking teddy bear). This relates to the second point about Wahlberg: it is rarely noted how excellent he is at being the calm centre of a movie, often surrounded by flashier performers, from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/christianbale\">Christian Bale</a> smoking crack in The Fighter to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/jacknicholson\">Jack Nicholson</a> being Jack Nicholson in The Departed to that talking bear in Ted \u2013 and neither competing with them nor being overshadowed.</p> <p>\u201cI just do my thing,\u201d he says, most comfortable with self-deprecation when talking about his acting. But then he loosens up as he switches to producer mode (he produced, among others, The Fighter and Deepwater Horizon): \u201cI\u2019m thinking about the big picture, not my individual experience as an actor. I\u2019ve seen actors who are like: \u2018Oh God, this is my moment,\u2019 and I don\u2019t think it services the movie. You have to put the movie first.\u201d</p> <p>Largely, I suspect, for this reason, Wahlberg has a tendency to be overlooked by critics and accolades, which shine instead upon his co-stars. He was nominated for a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7i7tUNXSj7M\">supporting actor Oscar for The Departed</a>, but he was almost completely ignored for The Fighter, even though he\u2019d spent four years training as a boxer for the role; the awards instead went to his co-stars, Bale and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/melissa-leo\">Melissa Leo</a>. Does that not bug him?</p> <p>\u201cWell, I come from the real world and you\u2019re only as good as the people around you,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s always been my philosophy. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s because of my background in sports, but I want the whole team to be good.\u201d</p> <p>It is partly this lack of look-at-me starriness that has helped him retain a relative kind of normality in the eyes of the public, and there is a loose, \u201chey-I\u2019m-just-a-guy\u201d attitude to him in person. Whereas fellow Massachusetts boy <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/mattdamon\">Matt Damon</a> is covered in Hollywood glitter, Wahlberg \u2013 despite being a celebrity for far longer \u2013 still has a coating of grit.</p> <p>\u201cLook, I live in a big house, I drive a fancy car,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I still feel like I\u2019m gonna end up where I came from and as long as I can go there with my head held high and I\u2019m welcomed back with open arms, then I\u2019m OK.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9QoTyPDLuo\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Y9QoTyPDLuo?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Click here to watch a trailer for Wahlburgers.</figcaption> </figure>   <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Everything good happened when I started focusing on my faith. I sound like I\u2019m in the recruiting office, don\u2019t I?</p> <footer> <cite>Mark Wahlberg</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Wahlberg, who grew up in the working-class area of Dorchester in Boston, is the youngest of nine siblings. If you want to see how close this family is then allow me to direct you to their rather extroardinary reality TV show called - what else? - Wahlburgers, which you almost certainly have never watched. Ostensibly made to promote the family\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.wahlburgersrestaurant.com/\">restaurant franchise</a>, Wahlburgers, now in its sixth series, is a rather pleasing antidote to Keeping Up with the Kardashians because, with the exception of the shots of Wahlberg\u2019s LA house \u2013 which is, indeed, big and fancy \u2013 there is little here that\u2019s aspirational. Whereas the Kardashians go shopping on Rodeo Drive, the Wahlberg matriarch, Alma, hunts for bargain shoes at a store called <a href=\"http://www.frugalfannies.com/\">Frugal Fannies</a>. It is more than a little odd to see Wahlberg, an A-lister, on this shonky reality show, but, he says simply: \u201cIt was an opportunity for the family to spend time together.\u201d</p> <p>He talks about his childhood fondly, with his dad, a truck driver, taking him to see <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/steve-mcqueen\">Steve McQueen</a> movies on weekends. The full picture, however, was more complicated, to put it mildly. Wahlberg was suffering from drug addiction by the age of 13 and, while still a teenager, racially abused a group of black schoolchildren and beat a Vietnamese man with a stick. He also assaulted another Vietnamese man, punching him in the face. He pleaded guilty to assault and battery and served 45 days in prison. He sums up that period of his life as one in which \u201ca lot of things happened and I made a lot of mistakes. But you try to live in the moment and look to the future.\u201d</p> <p>The good thing that came out of it, he says, is that he connected with his Catholicism. \u201cEverybody goes to jail and gets on their hands and knees and says: \u2018Please God, if you get me out I promise I\u2019ll never do it again.\u2019 And of course, by the time you\u2019re out, you fall back into the same habits. But something just kept me wanting to go a little bit more into it,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Catholicism is still a major part of his life. He has a daily prayer routine \u201cwhich I absolutely cannot miss\u201d and any movie shooting schedules must accommodate his weekly trip to mass. \u201cEverything good that has happened to me in my life, whether it\u2019s meeting my wife or the births of my children, happened when I started focusing on my faith,\u201d he says. He grins: \u201cI sound like I\u2019m in the recruiting office, don\u2019t I? Here, I\u2019ve got some brochures for you.\u201d</p> <p>You\u2019d have to work hard to recruit a New York Jew, I say.</p> <p>\u201cJesus was a Jew,\u201d he replies with mock solemnity, enjoying switching from talking about himself to teasing banter. \u201cI got a lotta New York Jews with me on this trip. Where\u2019s Mr Weinstein? Bring him in! He\u2019s my bubelah!\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"83f481b6ac3d5d4303500e5054f6d5d5018c9d2d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/83f481b6ac3d5d4303500e5054f6d5d5018c9d2d/0_0_845_1255/673.jpg\" alt=\"Wahlberg Kate Moss Calvin Klein\" width=\"673\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Indecent exposure: the 21-year-old Wahlberg poses with a \u201817 or 18\u2019-year-old Kate Moss.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Calvin Klein</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But if finding religion is a common path trod by ex-cons, the other route Wahlberg took after leaving prison was a little more unusual: he became a hugely successful model. Back in 1992 he posed, in full muscular glory, with <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlyUuCEEQUc\">Kate Moss for Calvin Klein</a> in one of the most celebrated campaigns of all time. Moss has since said she deeply regretted the shoot. \u201cI had a nervous breakdown when I was 17 or 18, when I had to go and work with Marky Mark,\u201d she <a href=\"http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2012/10/kate-moss-years-of-crying-johnny-depp\">told Vanity Fair in 2012</a>. \u201cIt didn\u2019t feel like me at all. I felt really bad about straddling this buff guy. I didn\u2019t like it. I couldn\u2019t get out of bed for two weeks. I thought I was going to die.\u201d</p> <p>Wahlberg was only 21 with no experience of the fashion world at the time. Did he feel similarly exploited?</p> <p>\u201cWell, for me it was different,\u201d he says. \u201cThe frustration that I felt was that when we talked about doing that, I was doing my music and they were like: \u2018OK, it will be about what you\u2019re doing,\u2019 but then it became just about [the image].</p> <p>\u201cBut you know, I still signed up for it, it was what it was and I think there were pros and cons. And Kate\u2019s had a good career,\u201d he concludes, which seems a tad dismissive of an 18-year-old\u2019s nervous breakdown, but, as Wahlberg says, he is not really one for introspection or reflection.</p> <p>There is a distinct smack of the guy\u2019s guy about Wahlberg, the one who still raves about his mother\u2019s bolognese and keeps his friends from home close. So close that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/feb/17/mark-wahlberg-hustling-entire-life\">two of them are on this trip to London with him</a>. Does he always travel with his buddies? \u201cYeah! They may get fired for a short amount of time but they always come back. We\u2019re not the most professional group,\u201d Wahlberg says proudly. This part of his life was, of course, memorialised in the TV show and film <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jun/21/entourage-film-review-hatefully-unfunny-jeremy-piven-hollywood-satire\">Entourage</a>, which he co-produced (\u201cYou take a swing and hope to hit a home run and sometimes you miss,\u201d is how he sums up the widely panned <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jun/21/entourage-film-review-hatefully-unfunny-jeremy-piven-hollywood-satire\">film</a> version.) But is it difficult when your life is so different from those of your friends that you can fire them?</p> <p>\u201cDifficult?\u201d he repeats, baffled.</p> <p>Yes, isn\u2019t it awkward?</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, you\u2019d have to ask them,\u201d he shoots back, a little grumpily.</p> <p>He pauses for a few seconds: \u201cNo. Look, I think, my real friends are certainly happy for the success I\u2019ve had. But I try to spread and share as much as possible.\u201d</p> <p>On cue, one of his buddies comes back into the room with a salad and a drink for Wahlberg. Any remnants of Wahlberg\u2019s boredom and glumness are gone. Instead, he becomes downright larky.</p> <p>\u201cI have a major issue with adolescent behaviour with my friends,\u201d says the Hollywood mogul, punching his patiently smiling friend in the shoulder, and I realise I am basically in Entourage. And suddenly, Wahlberg surprises me by being so unsurprising.</p> <p><em>Deepwater Horizon is released in the UK on 30 September</em></p>",
  "<p>Hillary Clinton needs millennials, and her best hope at winning them over might be the septuagenarian they tried to elect.</p> <p>Bernie Sanders, the beloved leader of the nation\u2019s leftwing movement, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/28/bernie-sanders-hillary-clinton-new-hampshire-rally\">appeared alongside his former rival</a> at a university gymnasium in New Hampshire on Wednesday and issued an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/28/bernie-sanders-hillary-clinton-new-hampshire-rally\">urgent appeal to disillusioned young voters</a>: \u201cIt is imperative that we elect Hillary Clinton.\u201d<br></p> <p>Millennials have long eluded Clinton, who lost the youth vote in the primaries to Sanders by blowout margins.

We\u2019d be getting someone efficient, right? Someone used to doing deals \u2013 someone who insists that the organization they oversee functions smoothly and efficiently, not chaotically and wastefully.</p> <p> But as Monday night\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/27/clinton-trump-debate-analysis\">first presidential debate</a> between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump reminded us, in electing the latter, we\u2019d be getting a businessman, but one who appears to possess a very distinct set of ideas about what being a businessman means and whose interests take priority. Perhaps what motivates Trump the businessman may not make him a wonderful president after all.</p> <p> The first hint came relatively early on in Monday\u2019s debate, when Clinton reminded the audience that Trump had been hoping for the housing market to collapse and that he had said in 2006 that he wished it would break down so that he could go and buy some properties and make some money.</p> <p> \u201cThat\u2019s called business, by the way,\u201d Trump interjected, defending himself.</p> <p> \u201cNine million people lost their jobs,\u201d Clinton continued. \u201cFive million people lost their homes. And $13tn in family wealth was wiped out.\u201d </p> <p> What she left unsaid, and didn\u2019t need to say, was that that was the price of Trump\u2019s \u201cbusiness\u201d opportunity. Nor did Trump feel the need to defend himself from the implicit suggestion that he was indifferent to the connection between pain for the ordinary American citizen \u2013 pain that has amounted to a kind of national trauma that has contributed to his support \u2013 anywhere else in the evening. He left many viewers with a clear sense that \u201cbusiness is business\u201d.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/sep/27/presidential-debate-highlights-clinton-and-trump-trade-blows-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/54q33\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2754975\"            data-video-name=\"Presidential debate highlights: Clinton and Trump trade blows \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"Reuters / AP\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57ea1adfe4b0a785ec48bdc4\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/09/27/160926wrap_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/09/27/160926wrap.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/09/27/160926wrap_V3.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/sep/27/presidential-debate-highlights-clinton-and-trump-trade-blows-video\">Presidential debate highlights: Clinton and Trump trade blows</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p> Indeed, late in the evening, he came right out and said as much. \u201cMy obligation right now is to do well for myself, my family, my employees, for my companies,\u201d Trump said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s what I do.\u201d</p> <p> Trump\u2019s order of priorities is clear. He and his family come first, then his employees, and then his companies. His country? Any not-for-profit causes that are close to his heart? In that statement, he showed the same tone-deafness that was on display when he equated his sacrifice of time and money building his company and amassing wealth to that of Khizr and Ghazala Khan, whose son, Capt <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/07/humayun-khan-donald-trump-military-arlington-national-cemetery\">Humayun Khan</a>, was killed in Iraq.

There are a lot of great businesspeople that have never taken bankruptcy once,\u201d Clinton challenged Trump. </p> <p> For his part, Trump can\u2019t even agree with Clinton on the number of bankruptcies (he appears <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2016/09/27/fact-checking-the-first-clinton-trump-presidential-debate/\">to consider three separate bankruptcies as a single event</a>, according to debate fact-checkers), and shrugged the whole discussion off as a tempest in a teapot anyway. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/02/donald-trump-atlantic-city-casinos-taj-mahal-plaza-bankruptcy\">Trump and Atlantic City: the lessons behind the demise of his casino empire</a> </p> </aside>  <p> The bankruptcy laws exist for a purpose, he noted. If you don\u2019t like the laws \u2013 well, change them. \u201cWe used certain laws that are there,\u201d he said. \u201cI take advantage of the laws of the nation because I\u2019m running a company.\u201d And, you know, his obligation isn\u2019t to keep paying his business creditors until he has no more money left at all in his bank account and he\u2019s on the street, if there is a law that enables him to put that business into bankruptcy. Which, of course, there is. And that he has used on six occasions between 1990 and 2009. </p> <p> Trump also bragged about being ahead of schedule and under budget. Part of the reason that the country\u2019s own budget is in dire shape, he suggested, is that \u201cwe have people who have no idea as to what to do and how to buy\u201d. He dismissed out of hand Clinton\u2019s suggestions that <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-trump-bills-specialrepor-idUSKCN0T214Q20151113\">he tramples on small vendors</a>. \u201cThey did get paid a lot,\u201d he insisted, but also hinted they took advantage of the laws of the nation, too, in some unspecified way. An architect who designed a clubhouse at one of Trump\u2019s golf courses that Clinton said was immediately put into use? \u201cMaybe he didn\u2019t do a good job and I was unsatisfied with his work,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWhich our country should do, too,\u201d he added, referring to the refusal to pay the amount owed for the work. </p> <p> Do we want a president who picks and chooses which bills to pay?</p> <p> Of course, for many of those watching the debate, the moment that the businessman-like approach by Trump <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/a-lean-toward-clinton-among-one-group-of-undecided-north-carolina-voters/2016/09/27/ff271b2e-8469-11e6-92c2-14b64f3d453f_story.html?tid=hybrid_collaborative_3_na\">caused their jaws to drop</a> was during the discussion of his personal taxes. </p> <p> Trump has said repeatedly that he plans to break with a 40-year tradition of presidential candidates and won\u2019t release his tax returns while he\u2019s being audited.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/sep/27/-trump-tax-returns-video-clinton-presidential-debate\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/54py9\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2754738\"            data-video-name=\"Clinton corners Trump over refusal to release tax returns \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"Reuters\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57e9f924e4b0a785ec48bd68\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/09/27/160926taxes2_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/09/27/160926taxes2.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11903794&amp;format=video/webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/sep/27/-trump-tax-returns-video-clinton-presidential-debate\">Clinton corners Trump over refusal to release tax returns</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p> Translation: unless he changes his mind, we won\u2019t be seeing those documents, with all the information they would provide about his actual income and its sources, his cash donations to charity (as opposed to simply donations of rounds of golf at his courses) and, of course, what percentage of his income actually is paid in taxes.</p> <p> Leaving those questions unanswered left Clinton free to speculate on Monday evening. Maybe, she wondered, Trump isn\u2019t as rich as he\u2019d like us to believe; maybe he isn\u2019t as charitable as he\u2019d like us to think he is. In both cases, there has been plenty of media coverage, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/21/trump-foundation-charity-settle-legal-disputes-reporting\">most recently about the Trump Foundation</a>. Or perhaps, Clinton suggested, he is trying to cover up the fact that he has paid almost nothing in federal income tax. </p> <p> \u201cIf he\u2019s paid zero, that means zero for troops, zero for vets, zero for health,\u201d she added.</p> <p> \u201cThat makes me smart,\u201d said Trump, responding as businessman, and a goaded businessman. He went on to claim that \u201cI have a tremendous income.\u201d</p> <p> Later, Trump argued that a businessman like himself was needed to take the lead to solve the country\u2019s infrastructure problems, and he lamented the fact that the United States doesn\u2019t have the money it needs to tackle the challenge because past administrations have squandered the resources. Clinton responded immediately. Maybe, she suggested, the money wasn\u2019t there \u201cbecause you haven\u2019t paid any federal tax for a lot of years\u201d.</p> <p> While that was met with applause from the Hofstra University audience, Trump\u2019s answer was greeted only with an isolated gasp or two. Had he done so, he suggested, \u201cIt would [have been] squandered too, believe me.\u201d</p> <p> Trump didn\u2019t make a compelling case for electing a businessman as president come November \u2013 or at least not for electing this particular businessman, someone who seems to put a priority on serving himself rather than serving others, and enriching himself rather than sharing his riches. </p> <p> As CEO of the Trump Organization, The Donald could fire his employees and had no bosses. As CEO of the United States of America, he can\u2019t fire us; we\u2019re simultaneously his shareholders and his bosses. We\u2019d be hiring him, not vice versa. And it\u2019s about how he can serve us, not how well he can look out for his own interests. </p> <p> Does anything from Monday night\u2019s debate show that he has grasped that yet?</p>",

  "<p>Aides to Donald Trump <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2016/09/donald-trump-campaign-self-fund-228801\">suggested this week</a> that the presidential candidate might self-fund an end-of-campaign advertising blitz to counter Hillary Clinton\u2019s rise in the polls. His contributions should give us serious pause. Is this how we want our republic to function? Do we want to live in a country where candidates can rise or fall based on their pocketbooks or the financial backing of their rich friends?</p> <p>Wealthy donors like Trump have donated the vast majority of campaign funds for both political parties in 2016. That should scare a lot of Americans. But there\u2019s one bright spot in the 2016 cycle that offers a path forward.</p> <p>Bernie Sanders\u2019 revolutionary campaign shocked the political establishment and demonstrated the immense power of movement politics, raising $232m from more than 8 million individual contributions. Nearly 3 million Americans coming together to support a progressive vision, donating $27 at a time, showed that a serious campaign could run on grassroots dollars alone.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/27/alicia-machado-miss-universe-weight-shame-trump-speaks-out-clinton\">Alicia Machado, Miss Universe weight-shamed by Trump, speaks out for Hillary Clinton</a> </p> </aside>  <p>For those concerned about the undue influence of the ultra-wealthy in US. politics, Bernie\u2019s success offers a glimmer of hope that we might be able to halt the country\u2019s march toward plutocracy.</p> <p>Our campaign finance system encourages rich donors to pour billions of dollars into American elections. This cash flow threatens to disempower the electorate and corrupt our republic.</p> <p>When politicians like Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama and Mitt Romney run traditional campaigns, they replace public-facing campaign stops with private affairs for large-scale donors. There\u2019s a loss here for both the candidates and voters. Candidates lose valuable perspective gained only from listening to the diversity of voices that represent the vast majority of Americans who are not in the upper echelons of the economy. Voters lose the opportunity to hear from politicians about their campaign platform and vision.</p> <p>Politicians are influenced by the company they keep. When constantly attending intimate gatherings with the United States\u2019 richest, they often adopt their perspectives and agendas. Candidates don\u2019t get to hear from those who can\u2019t afford to be in the room. They develop policies to protect the interests of their friends. </p> <p>After the election, the richest donors are the ones who receive the meetings and telephone calls. It\u2019s a form of simple payback. It means that our politicians are too often insulated from the opinions of the bottom 99% who can\u2019t afford to buy that time.</p> <p>What about running for office in the first place? Increasingly, that\u2019s a privilege only afforded to the wealthy as well. House of Representatives candidates must raise an average of more than $2,000 each and every day to run a winning campaign. The vast majority of Americans don\u2019t have access to that kind of capital which means they\u2019re often de facto excluded from our ruling bodies.</p> <p>Our rigged system leads us to plutocracy: a system of government controlled directly by the wealthy few that serves the interests of the wealthy few. In 2014, Princeton researchers concluded that the US has already lost its democratic roots and transitioned slowly into a form of oligarchy that caters to the preferences of elites.</p> <p>We need a political revolution in this country to fix what is broken, and I\u2019m grateful to Bernie for showing us the way forward. He raised a quarter of a billion dollars in a primary campaign with 94% of it coming in online. Now we should follow his example.</p>",
  "<h2>Heather, 48 \u2013 Austin, TX: \u2018Clinton will say anything to get power, Trump will just say anything\u2019</h2> <p>The reason I am undecided is because no candidate deserves my vote. </p> <p>I\u2019m a single mother of two, full-time employed, yet living paycheck to paycheck. I\u2019m insulted that women think I\u2019m obligated to vote for Clinton because she\u2019s a woman, just as I bristled at Sarah Palin as a viable choice. </p> <p>I am frustrated by the lack of candid discussion about the real issues my family and I face. Instead we waste time on gender-neutral bathrooms and whether Trump is a rude man. I lived in New York for years. He\u2019s obnoxious like a lot of New Yorkers. She\u2019s smug and patronizing, implying that I, a female voter, should just trust that she knows what is best for me. </p> <p>Neither deserves my trust (Clinton because she\u2019ll say anything to get power, Trump because he\u2019ll just say anything) and I\u2019m thinking of abstaining. It\u2019s so depressing. There should be more quality options. </p> <p>Skipping election day is an awful example to my children (both teens), but I can\u2019t stomach either candidate. As they say in sports, it\u2019ll likely be a game-day decision. </p> <h2>Drew, 33 \u2013 Brevard County, FL: \u2018Is it my fault the Democrats chose Clinton over Bernie?\u2019</h2> <p>I\u2019m not undecided between Trump and Clinton. My indecisiveness lies between Clinton and Jill Stein. </p> <p>I consider myself very progressive. I agree with 97% of Stein\u2019s policies (that number is verified by multiple tries of an online quiz \u2013 haha). According to the same quiz I agree over 90% with Clinton, but I can\u2019t bring myself to vote for her. I simply don\u2019t believe her. </p> <p>I believe her instincts are slanted towards conservatism. I believe she\u2019ll say anything to get elected. Deep down, I don\u2019t believe she\u2019s liberal enough and in the end, she won\u2019t come through on what she promised. </p> <p>My indecision stems from living in Florida and knowing my vote is important. </p> <p>I hate Trump and his band of racist drones. He personifies everything that\u2019s wrong with America. If I vote for Stein that could ultimately mean victory for Trump. But then, is it my fault the Democrats chose Clinton over Bernie?</p> <p>Is my vote a wasted one if I vote for Stein \u2013 or are progressive votes for Hillary the truly wasted ones?</p> <h2>Brexton, 19 \u2013 San Diego, CA: \u2018Since Bernie was defeated I have been trying really hard to like Hillary\u2019</h2> <p>I\u2019m undecided because I want to vote for a viable candidate but right now, I can\u2019t do that in good conscience. </p> <p>Climate change is far and away the number one issue and Jill Stein is obviously the best candidate to address that. In terms of policy proposals and electability however, Clinton has the lead. </p> <p>Since Bernie was defeated I have been trying really hard to like Hillary. Every time I come to terms with voting for her despite her long and discouraging past, she does one more thing that\u2019s exactly opposite of what liberals and progressives want, like her choice for vice-president or her continual ignoring of the #1 issue, climate change.</p> <p>Everyone always says a vote for Stein is a vote for Trump and that if he gets elected it would be third-party voters\u2019 faults. I ask why is it not Hillary\u2019s fault for not taking the few steps necessary to earn our vote. Bernie did it, now Stein\u2019s doing it. It\u2019s not hard.</p> <p>Hillary needs to make climate change and the environment a focal point of her campaign. She needs to prove that she isn\u2019t still in the hands of big money. She has only been proving the opposite again and again. I want to vote for Hillary. I just need a reason to do so.</p> <h2>Kate, 51 \u2013 Los Angeles, CA: \u2018I don\u2019t believe there\u2019s anything that can convince me to vote for any of the above\u2019</h2> <p>There is no one for whom I can vote with a clear conscience. <br></p> <p>To me, Hillary Clinton represents the establishment, and her election will, at best, bring four more years of government of Goldman, by Goldman, and for Goldman. Clinton is a vote for more of the same, a vote for the post-2008 status quo. Clinton is a vote for more wasted years. </p> <p>Trump, of course, isn\u2019t even remotely qualified to be president. Trump would be, I believe, a disaster, and we\u2019d finish up even worse off than we are today. Not to mention the racism, sexism and viciousness he\u2019s actively encouraged in his supporters, traits that would be amplified with his ascension to the White House. Trump is a vote for chaos. I won\u2019t vote for Trump.</p> <p>So, who\u2019s left? Jill Stein? No, too frivolous.</p> <p>Gary Johnson? No. </p> <p>I don\u2019t have a candidate in this race, but I feel like I have to vote because 2016 demands it. And it\u2019s so late in the cycle, now, I don\u2019t believe there\u2019s anything that can convince me to vote for any of the above. Most likely I\u2019ll vote for Bernie, writing his name next to \u201cOther\u201d with a bold, black sharpie. </p> <h2>Chris, 50 \u2013 New York, NY: \u2018Clinton needs to swing more to the left and really speak to the supporters of Bernie Sanders\u2019</h2> <p>I\u2019ve always leaned \u201cprogressive\u201d even when it wasn\u2019t in vogue. I identify loosely as a democratic socialist. So when Elizabeth Warren failed to run and Bernie Sanders picked up the mantle I was ecstatic. My enthusiasm grew the better Bernie did. I\u2019m very proud of him fighting for the $15 minimum wage, fighting for universal healthcare, making public universities free for students, putting a stop to fossil fuels, and taking climate change seriously. Perhaps most important of all, taking to task the one percenters and making them pay their fair share of taxes. Even though Bernie Sanders had difficulty connecting with the African American voter, his overall message resonated with me. It seemed quite clear that helping the economic working class would by default be helping African Americans and all minorities in this country.</p> <p>Unfortunately Bernie came up short. However, he did much better than <em>anyone</em> expected him to. One point of contention with Hillary Clinton is that she seems to take progressives and millennials for granted. Yes, she\u2019s absorbed some of Sanders\u2019 rhetoric and for that I\u2019m grateful, but there seems no conscious effort to capture the progressive zeitgeist that has captured the energy and passion of at least half the party. Also as an African American I would be remiss if I didn\u2019t take her husband\u2019s policies to task. \u201cSuper-predator\u201d comments aside, they\u2019ve been incredibly damaging to African American families, from welfare to prison reform. I don\u2019t care about emails. </p> <p>Trump is a racist fascist so I can\u2019t vote for him. But Hillary comes across as untrustworthy, elitist where the rules don\u2019t apply and a insincere panderer.</p> <p>Clinton needs to swing more to the left and really speak to the supporters of Bernie Sanders.</p> <p>Clinton needs to come up with clear solutions to stop rampant police assassinations of black lives in this country. </p> <p>Maybe then she\u2019ll get my vote. Because I\u2019m liable to Just. Stay. Home.</p> <h2>Buck, 62 \u2013 Houston, TX: \u2018I want a government that does what a government should do, and nothing else\u2019</h2> <p>We live so far below our potential because most American voters are ignorant and apathetic about their government. And they vote for a person instead of an idea. I want a government that does what a government should do for its citizens, and does that fully and well, but nothing else.</p> <p>To me that is somewhere between Libertarian and the Green party. Libertarian in general but with futuristic education, healthcare, and welfare systems covering all citizens while proactively protecting our environment. We could afford that, and a fantastic national infrastructure too, if we got out of the war business, brought all our troops home, and stopped subsidizing everyone else\u2019s foreign wars that cost us trillions.</p> <p>Most of these conflicts revolve around whose imaginary friend is the best (religion), so there\u2019s nothing really being resolved by them anyway. The money we have wasted, and continue to waste on them could be put to much better use here, and we could really lead by example, but neither the Dems or GOP are \u2013 they\u2019re still just talking.</p> <h2>Bo, 22 \u2013 Los Angeles, CA: \u2018People say a vote for Jill is a vote for the GOP. I don\u2019t know what to do\u2019</h2> <p>I am afraid of voting for someone I genuinely support \u2013 Jill Stein. She is woefully underrepresented in the media, and there is endless fear-mongering to dissuade anyone from expressing interest in third-party candidates. Our votes get dubbed \u201cwasted\u201d or \u201cspoiler\u201d votes. </p> <p>I am at a loss. People say a vote for Jill is a vote for the GOP. I don\u2019t know what to do. No other candidate addresses the enslavement of millennials (via student debt) and the debilitating social conditions of everyday life (racism, corporate domination, low-income wage slavery, police brutality, a world of total-work, inadequate healthcare, etc) as comprehensively as Stein. Her emergency Green New Deal is just about the only thing that gives me hope for any kind of future.</p> <h2>Julian, 40 \u2013 China, TX: \u2018I am torn between Gary Johnson and Jill Stein\u2019</h2> <p>Here\u2019s the dilemma \u2013 I don\u2019t live in a swing state and due to the electoral college, my presidential vote is basically meaningless when it comes to casting for a Democrat or Republican. It might be hard to understand, especially to outsiders, but I am torn between Gary Johnson and Jill Stein. It\u2019s not because I prefer Johnson, but because the vote would have greater visibility than Stein.</p> <p>Being the two major party candidates are so incredibly disliked, I felt that for the first time, alternate parties could finally break through to the mainstream and end the two-party system that has been so disastrous for the nation; both major parties put the interests of the power elites and Wall Street above the rest of the country.</p> <p>I was very enthusiastic about Bernie Sanders\u2019 campaign. Despite his history of calling third-party candidates spoilers for the presidential races, I really hoped he would join the Green ticket if he lost the Democratic nomination as Stein offered, or at least endorse her. I think his campaign did massive damage to a huge number of his younger followers in regards to future voter participation by endorsing Clinton. He had the perfect opportunity to break up the Democratic party if he\u2019d only fought on after he lost the nomination.</p> <p>If Bernie advocated for the Green party, far more aligned with his policies and mine than the Democrats, then I would vote for the Green party candidate this year.</p> <h2>Olivia, 27 \u2013 San Antonio, TX: \u2018Hillary, show me that you are not a \u2018My way or the highway\u2019 candidate</h2> <p>I\u2019m a millennial allied to no specific party. Both candidates seem determined to alienate \u2013 even demonize \u2013 moderate and independent voters like myself.</p> <p>Future Madame or Mr President, here are my terms:</p> <p>Donald, prove to me that you are not eager to incite a war with our neighbors, or relive the mistakes of Hoover\u2019s isolationist policies which led up to World War II.</p> <p>Hillary, show me that you are not a \u201cmy way or the highway\u201d candidate, as some of your virulent advocates make you appear. Demonstrate that those who do not share all your views on a specific topic such as gun control will nevertheless be respected as equals.</p> <p>Donald, prove that you and your physically violent advocates will not spawn violent, racially charged chaos across the country and world.</p> <p>Donald and Hillary, both of you repeatedly demonstrated a shocking disdain for the integrity and even sacred role of the freedom of the press. Prove to me that you will entrust journalists with truth, and not \u201cspin\u201d. The day independent journalists are encouraged, even empowered, to question your authority is the day I may trust you. </p> <h2><br></h2>",
  "<p>The 2016 presidential race could easily be decided in Colorado\u2019s Jefferson County. The suburbs west of Denver have long been considered a political bellwether for any candidate seeking election to the White House.</p> <p>Yet that does not appear to have discouraged Donald Trump\u2019s campaign entrusting its outreach in the critical county to a 12-year-old.</p> <p>Weston Imer, co-chair of Republican nominee\u2019s campaign in Jefferson County, dismissed the suggestion that his age should be an impediment.<br></p> <p>\u201cI know what I\u2019m doing,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve been in politics since I was very young.

  "<p>Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton today disparaged her Republican rival as a tool of the racist, radical right, a man who foments \u201cparanoia and prejudice\u201d and ushers hate groups into the mainstream.</p> <p>Donald Trump is \u201ca man with a long history of racial discrimination\u201d, Clinton said during a Thursday rally in the flag-festooned student center at Truckee Meadows Community College. He is a man \u201cwho traffics in dark conspiracy theories drawn from the pages of supermarket tabloids and the far reaches of the internet\u201d.</p> <p>Positioning herself as the true representative of a tolerant and open-minded United States, Clinton derided the real estate mogul as a darling of the \u201calt-right\u201d and a soulmate of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/feb/28/donald-trump-former-kkk-leader-david-duke\">David Duke, a former grand wizard of the Ku Klux Klan</a>.</p> <p>The speech, a kind of throwing down of the patriotic gauntlet, came eight days after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/20/steve-bannon-profile-breitbart-trump-campaign-manager\">Trump named Steve Bannon as the new chief of his struggling campaign</a>.

Until now.\u201d<br></p> <p>By billing the speech as a takedown of \u201cTrump\u2019s divisive \u2018alt-right\u2019 candidacy\u201d, her campaign shone a light on a <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/23/alt-right-movement-white-identity-breitbart-donald-trump\">little-known slice of the political spectrum</a>: an amorphous, largely online movement that prefers the label \u201crace realist\u201d to \u201cwhite supremacist\u201d.</p> <p>Not only has Trump insulted African Americans and Latinos from the campaign trail, but by aligning himself with Brietbart, Clinton said on Thursday, he hooked up with a media outlet that the Southern Poverty Law Center says \u201cembraces ideas on the extremist fringe of the conservative right\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThis is not conservatism as we have known it,\u201d she continued. \u201cThis is not Republicanism as we have known it. These are racist ideas, race-baiting ideas, anti-Muslim, anti-immigrant, anti-women, all key tenets making up the emerging racist ideology known as the alt-right.\u201d</p> <p>Trump turned to Twitter shortly after Clinton\u2019s rally ended. He said her \u201cshort speech is pandering to the worst instincts in our society.

Her comments at Jackson Hole in the US on Friday afternoon will be scrutinised for hints about when the central bank could raise interest rates, with various analysts expecting her to be hawkish, dovish or neutral. With that uncertainty it is no surprise that investors have been erring on the side of caution. And after recent falls in the oil price, along with a drop in pharmaceutical shares following comments on excessive pricing by US presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, stock markets ended the day in negative territory. The final scores showed:</p> <ul> <li><strong>The FTSE 100 finished 18.88 points or 0.28% lower at 6816.90</strong></li> <li><strong>Germany\u2019s Dax dropped 0.88% to 10529.59</strong></li> <li><strong>France\u2019s Cac closed down 0.65% at 4406.61</strong></li> <li><strong>Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB fell 1.07% to 16710.78</strong></li> <li><strong>Spain\u2019s Ibex ended down 0.65% at 8599.5</strong></li> <li><strong>In Greece, the Athens market slipped 0.37% to 565.83</strong></li> </ul> <p>On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently fairly stable, down just 6 points or 0.04%.</p> <p><em>On that note, we\u2019ll close for the evening.

After appearances from Dudley and Fischer last week, today\u2019s input from voting member George adds yet another voice to the increasingly deafening push for a rate hike in the coming months. With the election looking unpredictable, the likeliness is that members will see December as the month to press the button once more, one year on from the contentious 2015 rise. It is hard to see Janet Yellen delivering anything other than a relatively hawkish outlook tomorrow [at Jackson Hole] and with the dollar having suffered heavily in recent weeks, tomorrow could be a turning point for foreign exchange markets.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57bf0813e4b0568600c043aa\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-25T15:08:16.331Z\">4.08pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Another comment suggesting that the Jackson Hole gathering of central bankers in the US could be a damp squib, despite expectations that Fed chair Janet Yellen could hint at future rate rises. David Morrison, senior market strategist at Spreadco, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Investors continue to hold back from taking on additional market exposure ahead of tomorrow\u2019s speech from Janet Yellen at the Jackson Hole Economic Symposium. Few expect the Fed Chairman to say anything explicit about the likelihood or timing of what would be the US central bank\u2019s first rate hike since December last year. Nevertheless, there are hopes that she may give some clues as to the Fed\u2019s thinking over the state of the US economy, and indeed any risks facing the global economy as well.</p> <p>Last week we heard hawkish rhetoric from three Fed members. Then on Sunday Fed Vice Chairman Stanley Fischer provided an upbeat outlook for the US economy saying that he expected growth to pick up following a particularly weak second quarter. Not only that, but he said that the Fed\u2019s targets for inflation and unemployment (the dual mandate) were close to being hit. If Yellen is similarly upbeat in her speech tomorrow, then investors will price in an increased possibility of a September hike.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a50a3b0195a5e2b38fe60a4075ed6a990ed708ae\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a50a3b0195a5e2b38fe60a4075ed6a990ed708ae/0_329_4500_2700/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Uncertainty over Federal Reserve rate outlook\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Uncertainty over Federal Reserve rate outlook</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <blockquote> <p>But despite all this chatter and speculation, it seems unlikely that Yellen will want to paint herself into a corner over the future direction of US monetary policy.</p> <p>Consequently, it could be that there\u2019s little of substance in the speech. While we\u2019ve had a clutch of Fed-heads out there trying to persuade investors that September is still \u201clive\u201d when it comes to a rate hike, the minutes from the last meeting in July showed that only one out of ten FOMC-voting members was in favour of tightening monetary policy. In addition, we\u2019ll get a stack of fresh economic data ahead of the Fed\u2019s next meeting, including Non-Farm Payrolls, Manufacturing and Non-Manufacturing PMIs and inflation numbers. There\u2019s really no point in committing to any course of action until the Fed sees these reports.</p> <p>Finally, I don\u2019t believe that the FOMC has the faintest idea what they should do at the next meeting. And unfortunately we now have a central bank which pays too much attention to stock market movements and appears to relish its ability to influence short-term investor behaviour.</p> <p>Overall, I think there\u2019s just too much importance being attached to this speech. Jackson Hole was a fairly obscure event in years gone by. It only attained its current significance when Ben Bernanke used it as a forum for market manipulation in the wake of the 2008/9 financial crisis. It would be better for all if it went back to being a boring conference for boring people.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ed5eca4865718fa53980560041b6321ab3353884\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ed5eca4865718fa53980560041b6321ab3353884/0_225_1704_1021/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The road to Jackson Hole, Wyoming.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The road to Jackson Hole, Wyoming.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Finn Dempsey/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>   </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57bef773e4b0568600c0434b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-25T14:33:27.015Z\">3.33pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Back with the UK, and the strong retail sales figures from the CBI back up the idea that any negative effects of Brexit on the economy will only appear slowly, writes economic editor Larry Elliott:</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/25/uk-retail-sales-brexit-slow-puncture-not-car-crash\">UK retail sales show Brexit effect will be more slow puncture than car crash | Larry Elliott</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57befc81e4b0fe30498a4aff\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-25T14:16:08.579Z\">3.16pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">US rates could rise shortly - Fed board member</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>While we wait for Fed chair Janet Yellen on Friday, and any hints she gives on US interest rates, there is at least one board member of the US central bank suggesting a rise could be imminent.</p> <p>Speaking on CNBC, Dallas Federal Reserve president Robert Kaplan said the bank should be able to hike rates in the not too distant future, and the case for a rise was strengthening.</p> <p>He said progress was being made on employment and - more slowly - inflation. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Accendo_Mike/status/768812018560303104\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Fed&#39;s Kaplan on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CNBC\">@CNBC</a> I&#39;m focused on fundamental drivers;

  "<p>Whenever I think about the dysfunctional horror of the looming presidential election in America \u2013 so weird that<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/24/nigel-farage-donald-trump-rally-hillary-clinton\"> Nigel Farage can pop up in Mississippi</a> on the Trump campaign \u2013 I can\u2019t get Susan Sarandon or Plato out of my mind. Let\u2019s talk first about the actor. When did Plato make a decent movie, eh?</p> <p>A few weeks ago Sarandon gave a magazine interview to an overawed writer in which she set out her well-known political stall as a radical feminist who backed Bernie Sanders and doesn\u2019t think much of Hillary Clinton. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing about her I find feminist except that she\u2019s a woman,\u201d she said.</p> <p>That betrays a casual, right-on ignorance of Clinton\u2019s record over many decades, but never mind, Sarandon\u2019s distaste is shared by many educated American women. \u201cShe\u2019s a hawk, she\u2019ll probably get us into another war,\u201d etc etc, all good Islington-to-Santa Monica stuff. What was startling to me was that yet again Sarandon declined to say she\u2019d vote for Clinton in November.</p> <p>\u201cI go by issues, I don\u2019t vote with my vagina,\u201d Sarandon tells audiences. She did it again <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-3728085/Susan-Sarandon-says-s-not-convinced-Hillary-Clinton-won-t-vote-vagina-Republican-Sarah-Michelle-Gellar-says-her.html\">in Australia the other day</a>. She\u2019s even hinted that she might vote Trump on the grounds that his election \u201cwill bring the revolution immediately\u201d. How flakey is that?</p> <p>All right, she\u2019s only an actor, they get paid to read other people\u2019s lines. But even though Bernie Sanders himself has finally backed Clinton with grumpy ill-grace, I keep hearing Americans \u2013 particularly younger, educated women \u2013 saying similar things: that they\u2019ll vote Trump against the \u201cWashington elite\u201d or just abstain.</p> <p>The Observer\u2019s Nick Cohen recently wrote <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jul/30/donlad-trump-republicans-us-elections-dictatorship \">a belter of a column</a> mocking leading American Republicans who keep busts of Churchill on their desks as a symbol of defiant courage but don\u2019t have the guts to denounce and disown Trump, who has captured the ugly, angry party they spent decades creating for short-term gain.</p> <p>That\u2019s not quite fair on many Republicans. The Bush family and some other notables are standing aloof. Other figures have publicly stated \u2013 at political or personal risk to themselves \u2013 that they will vote for Clinton rather than for a man whose dangerous and volatile unsuitability makes him a threat to constitutional government.</p> <p>There is a pretty disheartening <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/08/where-republicans-stand-on-donald-trump-a-cheat-sheet/481449/\">list of rebels and appeasers</a>. At the party convention, Trump\u2019s beaten rival, Senator Ted Cruz, was booed for telling people to \u201cvote your conscience\u201d. Since he\u2019s called Trump \u201ca pathological liar, utterly amoral, a narcissist \u2026 and a serial philanderer,\u201d we can take him as a no.</p> <p>That makes Cruz and rejectionist Republicans better Americans than Susan Sarandon. Her arrogant emphasis on what matters to Susan seems \u2013 so far \u2013 to obscure her view of the bigger political picture, possibly to link her more closely than she might wish to the \u201cTrump the Selfie\u201d mood that is drawing millions of resentful Americans into a dark and angry narcissism.</p> <p>Which brings me to Plato. Concerned friends in the US sent me some extracts from a <a href=\"http://chironpublications.com/shop/trump/\">newly published book</a>, A Clear and Present Danger: Narcissism in the Era of Donald Trump \u2013 essays by prominent writers, academics and doctors on the polarising disorder they see sweeping their own country \u2013 while noting, as both Trump and Farage have done, that Britain\u2019s Brexit vote serves to remind us that the revolt against elites and globalisation exists in Europe too.</p> <p>A lot of this stuff has been around for decades. As a student 50 years ago I read the American historian Richard Hofstadter\u2019s essay The Paranoid Style of American Politics, in which anti-foreigner nativism could easily be harnessed against newcomers, outsiders, black people, capitalism, Jews, the usual suspects. The leftwing social critic <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Lasch\">Christopher Lasch</a> published The Culture of Narcissism as a consequence of post-war consumer capitalism as long ago as 1979. In Willie Loman, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Miller\">Arthur Miller\u2019s</a> Death of a Salesman created a Trump voter in 1949.</p> <p>Lasch and Miller lived long enough to experience the Reagan presidency, its negative impacts softened by the incumbent\u2019s relaxed and sunny disposition. The prospect of a Trump victory against Clinton \u2013 always a vulnerable candidate in my book \u2013 would seriously have frightened, though possibly not surprised, them. It\u2019s been a long time coming and the Reagan/Goldwater wing of the Republican party has made the bouffant-haired Frankenstein possible.</p> <p>Ted Cruz is not alone in identifying Trump\u2019s very obvious self-absorption, the quality so grotesque it rendered him almost a stealth candidate until too late. What no one understood at first was how much his excesses would appeal to voters \u2013 not all of them poor white people whose jobs, prospects and traditions have been attacked or destroyed \u2013 who feel marginalised or threatened.</p> <p>It\u2019s part-cultural, part-economic, but it thrives in the celebrity culture we now inhabit, vastly enhanced by 24/7 social media. As harsh reality becomes more unpleasant, the temptation is to blur the edges between reality and illusion, to retreat into a magic world and the cult of self. Facebook, Google and YouTube make it ever more possible. Even the TV networks are making money out of Trump.</p> <p>Of course, Plato didn\u2019t do Twitter or have a presence on Facebook. But Andrew Sullivan, the British expat writer in the US, <a href=\"http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2016/04/america-tyranny-donald-trump.html\">wrote a piece</a> reminding New York magazine\u2019s readers how the great man had warned that \u201ctyranny is probably established out of no other regime than democracy,\u201d in terms that describe the Trump scenario very well.</p> <p>Plato was no friend of democracy (as pandering classics professors routinely fail to tell us in their TV series on Greek democracy), not least because it killed his hero Socrates. He saw it as a system that gradually expanded freedom and equality to the point where authority imploded and its ensuing disorders allow a demagogue to seize power, promising to \u201ctake back control\u201d or \u201cget our country back\u201d.</p> <p>Being of the elite himself, Plato explained, but with a populist touch, the emerging tyrant forces the now defenceless elite to compromise, flee or face retribution. Sound familiar? It certainly does. Watch those wobbling Republican millionaires shaking behind their locked gates. In an age that has delivered painful inequality in most advanced societies (unadvanced ones always have it), anger against elite wealth is very real and understandable. Which of us would not see more bankers jailed?</p> <p>Yet Trump supporters seem even more blind to his faults than Susan Sarandon or Nigel Farage. Trump still hasn\u2019t published his tax return, as all candidates have done for 40 years, and evidence emerges daily of strange financial ties/debts to Russian and Chinese interests. </p> <p>The distinction between fact and fantasy is fast eroding. Trump is behind in most polls and may be rightly thrashed in November, a fading nightmare by Christmas. He may just \u201cdo a Brexit\u201d and win. Does Farage get any of this, do you suppose? As a Poundland Trump, Farage tapped into suppressed resentment over \u201cpolitically incorrect\u201d feelings, but never provided any answers beyond that magic word: Brexit.</p> <p>Yet on Wednesday night in Mississippi we saw a man whose creed is self-governing \u201csovereign\u201d states interfering in another country\u2019s sovereignty (he complained when Obama did it in the referendum), not against a candidate whose toxic rage so clearly threatens us all, but on his side. I wish I could say Susan Sarandon showed a better grip on reality. There\u2019s still time.</p>",

Hence the uniquely awkward situation.</p> <p>Bill Clinton launched the public charity after leaving the White House in 2001. It sought to bring together governments, businesses and social groups to tackle the world\u2019s most pressing problems: health, climate change, economic development and opportunities for girls and women.<br></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/the-inside-story-of-how-the-clintons-built-a-2-billion-global-empire/2015/06/02/b6eab638-0957-11e5-a7ad-b430fc1d3f5c_story.html\">The Washington Post</a> wrote last year: \u201cThe Clinton Foundation is an ingenious machine that can turn something intangible \u2013 the Clintons\u2019 global goodwill \u2013 into something tangible: money. For the Clintons\u2019 charitable causes. For their aides and allies. And, indirectly, for the Clintons themselves.\u201d</p> <p>More than 6,000 donors who have already provided the Clinton charity with more than $2bn in funding since its creation, <a href=\"http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/U/US_CAMPAIGN_2016_CLINTON_FOUNDATION?SITE=AP\">the Associated Press reported</a>. It has a staff of nearly 500 people.</p> <p>The foundation clearly means a lot to the 42nd president. Addressing staff recently, Bill Clinton commented: \u201cI\u2019ve done a lot of interesting things in my life, and I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever done anything that I\u2019ve loved this much as this foundation.\u201d He admitted the prospect of scaling it down \u201cis like a root canal for me\u201d.</p> <h2>Has the foundation succeeded?</h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.campaignlegalcenter.org/team/lawrence-m-noble\">Larry Noble</a>, general counsel of the Campaign Legal Center, says: \u201cThe foundation does real work. It\u2019s not a sham organisation.\u201d</p> <p>It claims to have \u201cdramatically improved\u201d the lives of millions of people around the world. Clinton\u2019s supporters say it enabled the number of people receiving HIV/Aids medication to soar from 200,000 to 11.5 million and supported physical education programmes that helped more than 18 million students.</p> <p><a href=\"https://lauraseay.wordpress.com/bio/\">Laura Seay</a>, an academic who witnessed the foundation\u2019s work firsthand in east Africa, said: \u201cThe perspective that it is some kind of slush fund is based on a real misunderstanding of what the Clinton Foundation does. The Clintons don\u2019t take a salary from it.\u201d<br></p> <p>Seay was researching a PhD from 2005 to 2007 in eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/feb/05/congo-child-soldiers-ntaganda-monuc\">where militias roamed</a> and few aid organisations ventured. She recalled how, with Clinton Foundation funding, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jan/27/democratic-republic-congo-optimism\">Heal Africa hospital</a> in Goma treated 60 HIV-positive Congolese children, most of whom survived. \u201cI know teens &amp; young adults who were kids then &amp; are alive today because the Clinton Foundation saved their lives when no one else would,\u201d <a href=\"https://twitter.com/texasinafrica/status/767779911696261120\">she tweeted</a>.</p> <p>Seay, assistant professor of government at Colby College in Waterville, Maine, adds in an interview: \u201cThe Clinton Foundation was the organisation that took the risk on this. What it showed was that in really difficult circumstances you can save a lot of lives and change the way a lot of NGOs think about conflict zones. It really was remarkable.\u201d</p> <p>Clinton also used his name to negotiate with international pharmaceutical giants to slash the price of HIV/Aids drugs, Seay argues.</p> <p>The foundation has been particularly active in Rwanda but not without criticism. <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/19/us/politics/rwanda-bill-hillary-clinton-foundation.html?_r=0\">According to the New York Times</a>, in 2011 it successfully lobbied Hillary Clinton\u2019s state department to approve an unconventional medical training programme there. A dispute over the plan was mediated by Cheryl Mills, who spent five years on the foundation board before switching to the state department.</p> <p>The foundation\u2019s banner event, the annual Clinton Global Initiative meeting, is a forum for philanthropists to announce funding commitments including, in 2007, $2m to help build the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/nov/23/how-africas-fastest-solar-power-project-is-lighting-up-rwanda\">Agahozo-Shalom Youth Village</a> for orphans of the genocide and Aids.</p> <p>Speaking by phone from Rwanda, its director, Jean-Claude Nkulikiyimfura, says of the foundation: \u201cIt seems to be doing some very good work in the country.

One Clinton ally, noting Trump\u2019s demands for <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-trump-idUSKCN10X18W\">a special prosecutor</a> to look into the foundation, says: \u201cAs a donor, Trump is calling for an investigation of himself.\u201d</p> <p>However, <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/aug/24/jennifer-granholm/clinton-surrogate-spins-clinton-foundation-defense/\">the Politifact website contends</a> that the foundation violated its memorandum of understanding with the state department with three significant omissions, including not reporting a <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/foreign-governments-gave-millions-to-foundation-while-clinton-was-at-state-dept/2015/02/25/31937c1e-bc3f-11e4-8668-4e7ba8439ca6_story.html\">$500,000 donation from Algeria</a> in 2010.</p> <h2>What is the main allegation now?</h2> <p>Pay for play. Donors to the foundation are said to have jumped the queue and gained special access to the state department. <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://bigstory.ap.org/article/82df550e1ec646098b434f7d5771f625/many-donors-clinton-foundation-met-her-state\">The AP wrote this week</a>: \u201cMore than half the people outside the government who met with Hillary Clinton while she was secretary of state gave money \u2013 either personally or through companies or groups \u2013 to the Clinton Foundation. It\u2019s an extraordinary proportion indicating her possible ethics challenges if elected president.\u201d</p> <p>The AP found that at least 85 of 154 people<strong> </strong>with private interests who either met or had phone conversations scheduled with Clinton also gave a combined total of $156m to her family\u2019s charities. Trump, struggling in the polls, sensed an opening and piled on. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to tell where the Clinton Foundation ends and the state department begins,\u201d he told a rally on Wednesday night.</p> <p>Giuliani fumed: \u201cIt is now abundantly clear that the Clintons set up a business to profit from public office. They sold access and specific actions for money. This makes a mockery of her promise to Congress and the president to keep the Clinton Foundation and the state department entirely separate. In other words, they merged the two into the Clinton family racketeering enterprise.\u201d</p> <p>But Hillary Clinton insists that the data was cherry picked from a subset of her schedule. She told CNN on Wednesday: \u201cI know there\u2019s a lot of smoke and there\u2019s no fire. This AP report? Put it in context, excludes nearly 2,000 meetings I had with world leaders, plus countless other meetings with government officials when I was secretary of state. It looked at a small portion of my time.</p> <p>\u201cIt drew the conclusion and made the suggestion that my meetings with people like the late, great, Elie Wiesel, or Melinda Gates, or the Nobel prize winner, Muhammad Yunus were somehow due to connections with the foundation instead of their status as highly respected global leaders. That is absurd. These are people I was proud to meet with, who any secretary of state would have been proud to meet with and hear about their work and their insight.\u201d</p> <p>However, there has also been a steady trickle of emails into the public domain that reveal how <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2016/08/clinton-foundation-huma-abedin-doug-band-227275\">donors sought meetings with Clinton</a> by trying to call in favours from the foundation.

Elizabeth Trudeau, a spokesperson for the state department, says: \u201cThe state department is not aware of any actions that were influenced by the Clinton Foundation.\u201d There is no proof of a quid pro quo or anything illegal.</p> <p>But <a href=\"http://www.breitbart.com/tag/peter-schweizer/\">Peter Schweizer</a>, author of the book Clinton Cash and a senior editor-at-large at Breitbart News, said: \u201cIt\u2019s naive to believe that people throw money at politics and don\u2019t expect something in return. They claimed there was going to be a wall between the Clinton Foundation and state department and this clearly shows there was communication between people at the Clinton Foundation and state department. There needs to be an investigation into exactly what happened and we also need legislation.

I don\u2019t think \u2018inevitable overlap\u2019 involves dual payrolls.\u201d</p> <h2>So how does the issue look?</h2> <p>Not good, especially as it fills a new vacuum in the dog days of August in which Trump has managed to avoid his usual attention-grabbing gaffes. It gives the appearance, at least, of a blurred line and intersecting interests between the Clinton Foundation and state department.</p> <p>\u201cThe frequency of the overlaps shows the intermingling of access and donations, and fuels perceptions that giving the foundation money was a price of admission for face time with Clinton,\u201d the AP report said.</p> <p>Scott Amey, general counsel at the <a href=\"http://www.pogo.org/\">Project on Government Oversight</a>, said: \u201cI think this is an example that may not be illegal but certainly should have been handled with more communication to show there was no actual or apparent conflicts of interest.</p> <p>\u201cThe question is, in giving money to the Clinton Foundation, did donors feel they deserved or were going to receive special access to Hillary at the state department? We don\u2019t know. Only time will tell. It seems some favours were called in and some minor efforts were made to provide access.\u201d</p> <p>Perhaps some overlap between between the entities was inevitable. But Amey adds: \u201cOne of the biggest mistakes here is they didn\u2019t set up proper firewalls to prevent those blurred lines. I would be less sceptical if I had seen emails back from the state department saying: \u2018We can\u2019t do this, you should go through the official channels.\u2019\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2485f2df79181a91d5b712f23ecec23f3611591f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2485f2df79181a91d5b712f23ecec23f3611591f/0_122_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Hillary Clinton and Bill Clinton address the audience during the opening of the Clinton Global Initiative on 22 September 2014 in New York City.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hillary Clinton and Bill Clinton address the audience during the opening of the Clinton Global Initiative in September 2014 in New York City.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michael Loccisano/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Bill Clinton announced that, if Hillary wins the presidency, he will step down from the board of the foundation and it will stop accepting foreign and corporate donations.

Noble says of Clinton: \u201cI don\u2019t know if you have to shut it down. If you look at it like a business, what you have to do is totally separate yourself from it.

It\u2019s a very, very hard thing.\u201d</p> <p>The remarks are the strongest evidence yet that Trump is softening his previous stance on illegal immigration, after a meeting with Latino Republicans over the weekend led multiple outlets to report that Trump had vowed to move beyond his pledge to deport all undocumented immigrants from the country, as well as US citizens born to undocumented immigrants.</p> <p>But the Trump campaign threw cold water on those reports at the time. Steven Cheung, a spokesman for Trump, said on Saturday: \u201cTrump said nothing today that he hasn\u2019t said many times before, including in his convention speech \u2013 enforce our immigration laws, uphold the constitution and be fair and humane while putting American workers first.\u201d</p> <p>Since fall of last year, Trump vowed to create a \u201cdeportation force\u201d to eject undocumented migrants from the US, but campaign manager Kellyanne Conway, a new addition to the campaign after a leadership shakeup earlier this month, waffled on whether the candidate still embraced that idea on Sunday.</p> <p>\u201cAs the weeks unfold, as the weeks unfold, he will lay out the specifics of that plan that he would implement as president of the United States,\u201d Conway told CNN. Asked about whether those specifics included a \u201cdeportation force,\u201d Conway replied: \u201cTo be determined.\u201d</p> <p>John Weaver, former senior strategist for the presidential campaign of Ohio governor John Kasich, told the Guardian\u2019s Ben Jacobs that Trump\u2019s newfound openness to legal status for undocumented immigrants reads highly familiar - despite Trump decrying the position as tantamount to amnesty during the Republican presidential primaries.</p> <p>\u201cHe has jack rabbit trailed his way to John Kasich\u2019s correct view on immigration,\u201d Weaver said. \u201cBut, alas it won\u2019t last.

Using his prepared remarks in the same way John Coltrane used the sheet music to My Favorite Things, the Republican nominee went on a number of memorable riffs. Voters learned that many of the Hollywood celebrities supporting Hillary Clinton \u201cweren\u2019t very hot any more,\u201d that Trump\u2019s much vaunted border wall would also have \u201cprotection for tunnels\u201d and that in a succinct summation of his message \u201ceverything is bad.\u201d</p> <p>With the hire of new campaign manager Kellyanne Conway last week, Trump had started to resemble a more traditional candidate. The teleprompters which he once disdained became a staple of rallies and the campaign\u2019s press office would send out prepared remarks for every speech. It was a far cry from the \u201clet Trump be Trump\u201d philosophy which guided the nominee\u2019s first campaign manager Corey Lewandowski and it was far more effective than efforts of replacement Paul Manafort to rein the outspoken real estate developer. Trump even <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/19/donald-trump-tries-out-a-new-campaign-tactic-saying-sorry\">expressed a statement of regret</a> last week in North Carolina, the closest he has ever come to an apology for his multitude of controversial remarks in the course of his campaign.</p> <p>However, Trump\u2019s remarks Wednesday were classic unscripted statements from the candidate. He stoked controversy by hinting at unfounded rumors about Hillary Clinton\u2019s health when he apparently misspoke that his Democratic rival was \u201cpremedicated\u201d in lieu of saying \u201cpremeditated\u201d as was in his prepared remarks. Trump dwelled on the phrase and suggested that he liked \u201cpremedicated\u201d better. It was a return to form for the Republican nominee and one that was received to cheers from his supportive crowd. The question as Trump moves forward with yet another reinvented campaign team is whether this was a brief lapse in style or if it simply further evidence that no operative can tame the bombastic populist on the stump.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57be0c60e4b0fe30498a473f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-24T21:11:28.665Z\">10.11pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The director of Donald Trump\u2019s Maryland and Northern Virginia campaigns has suggested that Hillary Clinton is severely ill and would not survive a year in office during a \u201cMoms 4 Trump\u201d event in Loudoun County, Virginia.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"69aa6007102949ca4c53ad9e5a5fdfa8db53f0a1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/69aa6007102949ca4c53ad9e5a5fdfa8db53f0a1/0_0_5184_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Donald Trump.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Donald Trump.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gerald Herbert/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cHow many of you would wear a wool coat in August?\u201d John Jaggers asked the a crowd of Trump supporters at Salamander Resort in Middleburg, Virginia, <a href=\"http://www.loudountimes.com/news/article/trump_campaign_operative_suggests_clinton_will_die_during_first432\">according to the Loudoun Times-Mirror</a>. \u201cThe woman who seeks to be the first female president of the United States wears a wool coat at every single thing.

Clinton\u2019s personal physician, <a href=\"https://m.hrc.onl/secretary/10-documents/01-health-financial-records/2015-07-28_Statement_of_Health_-_LBardack.pdf\">Dr Lisa Bardack, has repeatedly said</a>: \u201cSecretary Clinton is in excellent health and fit to serve as president of the United States.\u201d Meanwhile, <a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/nightly-news/video/clinton-responds-to-deranged-conspiracy-theories-about-her-health-746921539976\">conspiracy theories</a> about Clinton\u2019s supposed ill health have gone viral. There\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.vox.com/2016/8/18/12505078/hillary-clinton-health-stroke-conspiracy-fake\">no evidence</a> these claims are true.</p> <p>I\u2019m a doctor. I don\u2019t play at being a doctor. I don\u2019t diagnose patients in the absence of unbiased, reliable information, such as performing a physical exam or reviewing tests. When I write or am interviewed on television or the radio, I\u2019ll talk about what new research will mean for patients and the science behind the latest guidelines. I\u2019ll explain why we\u2019re seeing increasing rates of certain diseases and whether policies to combat them make sense. I don\u2019t talk about individuals except to say what one might expect more generally with regard to a particular medical illness.</p> <p>But the scientist in me understands that the real issue here isn\u2019t Clinton\u2019s health. Conspiracy theories signal fear; in this case, Trump\u2019s realization that Clinton may well be the next president of the United States.</p> <p>This is not the first time rumors of illness have been deployed to attack a seemingly untouchable political adversary. At a time when Massachusetts governor Michael Dukakis had a 10-point lead over then vice-president George HW Bush in the polls, <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/videos/tv/2016/03/15/exp-rftwh-bush-vs-dukakis-1-1.cnn/video/playlists/race-to-the-white-house--original-series/\">reports circulated</a> that Dukakis suffered severe depression after losing his first re-election campaign. When asked if Dukakis should release his complete medical records, Ronald Reagan did little to dispel those rumors,<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1988/08/04/us/dukakis-releases-medical-details-to-stop-rumors-on-mental-health.html\">saying</a>: \u201cLook, I\u2019m not going to pick on an invalid.\u201d</p> <p>Some Trump surrogates are also <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DrMarcSiegel/status/764541927152820225\">calling</a> on Clinton to release her medical records. Trump has not released his, and a <a href=\"https://www.donaldjtrump.com/images/uploads/trump_health_record.pdf\">letter from his physician</a> reads as if Trump had written it himself: little in the way of detail but plenty of superlatives like \u201castonishingly excellent\u201d and \u201cextraordinary\u201d. Meanwhile, in contrast to Clinton and every other presidential candidate in the last 40 years except Gerald R Ford, Trump has yet to release his tax returns.</p> <p>The scientist in me knows that attempts to debunk conspiracy theories \u2013 whether they\u2019re about Clinton\u2019s health or the myth that vaccines cause autism \u2013 are at best futile and may in fact <a href=\"http://www.uky.edu/AS/PoliSci/Peffley/pdf/nyhan-reifler%202007%20When%20Predictions%20Fail.pdf\">backfire</a>. We pick and choose those facts that add up to the truth we\u2019ve already chosen to believe. The more someone tries to disprove the reality we\u2019ve constructed, the more we dig in our heels.</p> <p>In 2008, questions about <a href=\"http://www.usnews.com/opinion/blogs/robert-schlesinger/2010/03/24/party-of-nuts-poll-shows-gop-thinks-obama-is-muslim-socialist\">President Obama\u2019s citizenship</a> intensified with his likelihood of clinching the Democratic nomination. So long as the odds of winning the election remain in Clinton\u2019s favor, we can expect to see more conspiracy theories emerge between now and November.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/24/hillary-clinton-health-rumors-doctor-column\">I'm a doctor.

Donald Trump son Eric Trump has said<strong> it would be \u201cfoolish\u201d for the presidential candidate to release his tax return</strong>s. It was not clear why the Trump scion thinks that. Trump\u2019s tax returns could hold central truths about who Trump is and how he operates. Trump\u2019s campaign manager in April called on him to release his tax returns. Trump in 2012 called on Mitt Romney to release his tax returns. Every major presidential nominee from either party since 1976 released his tax returns. Hillary Clinton has released hers. Is it foolish for the public to demand that Trump release his tax returns? Or would it be foolish to elect Trump president without putting him through the kind of basic vetting banks perform for the average home loan? </p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/carlquintanilla/status/768413219845185537\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">&quot;It would be foolish to do.

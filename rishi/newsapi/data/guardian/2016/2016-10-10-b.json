  "<p>Lest there be any doubt, Donald Trump made clear Monday that he is running a scorched earth campaign for the next month.<br></p> <p>Speaking in a high school gym in Beaver County, Pennsylvania, his first public event since the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/07/donald-trump-leaked-recording-women\">leak on Friday of his 2005 comments about</a> groping women without their consent, Trump amplified <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/10/debate-donald-trump-threatens-to-jail-hillary-clinton\">his rhetoric from Sunday night\u2019s debate</a> and attacked rival Hillary Clinton and her husband \u2013 former president Bill Clinton \u2013 in starkly personal terms. </p> <p>Trump, who <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/09/donald-trump-women-bill-clinton-sex-scandal-hillary-debate\">invited four women</a> who claimed to be the victims of misconduct by the Clintons to be his guests at the debate on Sunday, renewed his offensive against his Democratic opponent. </p> <p>The Republican nominee called Bill Clinton \u201ca predator\u201d and said his wife enabled him \u201cinstead of trying to stop it, she made possible for him to take advantage of more women, she put more women into harm\u2019s way\u201d.</p> <p>He also threatened that \u201cif they want to release more tapes saying inappropriate things, we\u2019ll continue to talk about Bill and Hillary doing inappropriate things.\u201d</p> <p>Trump also referenced the Chappaquiddick incident \u2013 in which a woman died after a car being driven by the late senator Ted Kennedy went off a bridge in 1969. Trump cited the incident as another example of Democratic scandals covered up by the media. </p> <p>The speech came as Republican leaders <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/10/paul-ryan-ends-support-trump-campaign-endorsement-republicans\">increase their efforts</a> to distance themselves from their party\u2019s nominee. Speaker Paul Ryan told members of the House GOP caucus on Monday \u201cyou all need to do what\u2019s best for your district\u201d and seemed to write off Trump\u2019s chances of winning, saying he would \u201cspend his entire energy making sure that Hillary Clinton does not get a blank check with a Democrat-controlled Congress\u201d. </p> <p>After widespread condemnation over his debate threat to jail his political rival, Trump did not explicitly renew his calls to jail Hillary Clinton if he was elected. Instead, he took a somewhat milder tone and merely called for a special prosecutor to investigate Clinton. Trump also suggested \u2013 without evidence \u2013 that the NSA might have the missing emails that Clinton deleted from her personal email server.</p> <p>But Trump also attacked Clinton on policy grounds. He railed against the Democratic nominee from the left on entitlement reform and claimed that she wants to \u201cknock the hell out of Medicare and Medicaid\u201d. The former secretary of state has committed to expanding both programs. </p> <p>He also attacked Clinton for her support for \u201copen trade\u201d. \u201cYou know what that does to your community,\u201d Trump asked the crowd. \u201cIt\u2019s the end.\u201d He also returned to familiar attacks and falsely claimed Clinton is \u201cfor radical unlimited immigration\u201d.</p> <p>Trump <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/02/donald-trump-renews-voter-warning-and-says-clinton-could-be-crazy\">once again offered a</a> vague, evidence-free warning of voter fraud in Pennsylvania. He told the almost entirely all-white crowd \u201cit\u2019s so important that you watch other communities because we don\u2019t want this election stolen from us\u201d. He has made this statement several times in the past in the Keystone state, seemingly based on a popular <a href=\"http://billypenn.com/2016/08/08/what-sean-hannity-got-wrong-about-philly-election-fraud/\">rightwing conspiracy theory</a> that Mitt Romney was the victim of voter fraud in Philadelphia in 2012. The theory, which is a dogwhistle reference to African American voters, is premised on the fact that in 59 precincts in majority black neighborhoods, Romney did not receive a single vote. There are 1,687 precincts in the city and Obama received over 85% of the vote there in 2012.</p> <p>While a <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/first-read/poll-after-trump-tape-revelation-clinton-s-lead-double-digits-n663691\">new NBC/WSJ poll</a> showed the Republican nominee falling behind Clinton by 14 points in a two-way race, Trump supporters in Pennsylvania were unfazed by the nominee\u2019s growing woes. Instead they took heart in what they saw as a dominating debate performance, one which former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani told the crowd was \u201cthe best performance any presidential candidate had in the history of debates\u201d.</p> <p>Joe Tedeski, a Trump supporter who watched the debate, thought his candidate won while Clinton was \u201cthe greatest liar I\u2019ve ever seen\u201d. He dismissed concerns about Trump\u2019s remarks saying \u201cpeople change, attitudes change\u201d and insisting that Trump\u2019s graphic description of groping women without their consent was \u201cjust talk\u201d and that he had never actually engaged in that behavior. </p> <p>This was echoed by Isaac Foldi of Bloomingdale, Ohio, who was decked out in Trump merchandise for the event and praised his candidate\u2019s performance. In particular, Foldi pointed to Trump\u2019s line that Clinton was \u201cno honest Abe\u201d as an effective zinger. While the Trump supporter thought the nominee\u2019s 2005 comments were \u201cnot acceptable\u201d, he found them insignificant compared to Clinton\u2019s sins. \u201cIt makes little sense to go after him for saying some crude things when Hillary humiliated women raped and assaulted by her husband.\u201d</p> <p>Trump is scheduled to hold another rally in Pennsylvania on Monday night before spending the next two days in Florida.</p>",

Fuck that guy!\u201d Oliver said. \u201cIt is gross enough that he\u2019s serving as Donald Trump\u2019s hug pimp, but let\u2019s not gloss over the fact that he just said: \u2018How about a little hug for the Bushy,\u2019 a phrase that, if it\u2019s not already, should be a felony offense in all 50 states.\u201d</p> <p>As for Trump\u2019s rambling late-night apology, during which he dismissed his sexist comments as \u201clocker room talk\u201d and said his words \u201cdon\u2019t reflect who I am\u201d, Oliver shot back: \u201cThey could not capture his essence more if they were spoken by a spray-tanned Furby eating KFC and screaming at a Gold Star family.\u201d</p> <p>Oliver didn\u2019t go soft on the speaker of the House, Paul Ryan, who has denounced Trump\u2019s remarks by releasing a statement saying: \u201cWomen are to be championed and revered, not objectified. I hope Mr Trump treats this situation with the seriousness it deserves and works to demonstrate to the country that he has greater respect for women than this clip suggests.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cChampioned and revered? You do know that women are human beings and not pedigreed show dogs, right?\u201d Oliver said. \u201cYou hope he works to demonstrate respect for women? What are you talking about? It\u2019s too late in absolutely every way. First, it\u2019s October of an election year, and second, he\u2019s fucking 70!\u201d</p> <p>Oliver also criticized John McCain, despite the senator\u2019s decision to no longer vote for Trump in wake of the controversy (\u201cHe alone bears the burden of his conduct and alone should suffer the consequences\u201d). <br></p> <p>Trump \u201calone does not bear the burden of his conduct, because he alone did not make himself your party\u2019s nominee\u201d, responded Oliver. \u201cAll of you have consistently supported him through some absolutely heinous shit.

Anything less than that, and this is on you too.\u201d<br></p> <p>Oliver concluded by reiterating what Clinton argued in the debate: that the contents of the video are \u201centirely in character\u201d for Trump. Oliver warned that Trump isn\u2019t going anywhere, even as GOP members flee his ticket. </p> <p>\u201cThis is happening,\u201d Oliver said. \u201cAnd, in a way, perhaps we have been always heading towards this historic moment. The first female presidential nominee versus the human embodiment of every backwards, condescending, Mad Men-esque boys\u2019 club attitude that has ever existed, rolled into one giant, salivating dick-size-referencing, pussy-grabbing warthog in a red power tie.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll put it this way: if American democracy is a computer game, and Hillary is completing women\u2019s 100-year quest to get to the Oval Office, it kind of makes sense that this would be the final boss.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>We are on the brink of seeing three of the world\u2019s richest democracies be led by women. This is a moment to take stock, to measure how attitudes have changed to women in power, and what that means for the licence that they now have to define themselves.</p> <p>It is always harder on the way to power: Clinton\u2019s <a href=\"http://nytlive.nytimes.com/womenintheworld/2016/09/08/clinton-criticized-for-not-smiling-enough-during-commander-in-chief-forum/\">battles with how to present herself as a woman aspiring to be commander in chief</a> \u2013 strong or compliant, outspoken or measured \u2013 have threaded through the presidential campaign. In office, it would be what she does that counts. Long ago, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/angela-merkel\">Angela Merkel</a> became the most powerful politician in Europe, a standing that made a virtue out of ordinariness. It is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/theresamay\">Theresa May</a> who seems most interesting, and interested, in how she can use her personal brand to sell a political message.</p> <p>May has an acute sense of how to manage her public image. Track her trajectory to the top and you track what is acceptable to mainstream opinion, or sometimes what is only just acceptable \u2013 one of her skills is her judgment of where people are, and how far it is possible to shift them in her direction, or at least enough of them for her to win the argument. She often does it in policy development: she has been ahead of Conservative opinion on matters ranging from the pressing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/12/theresa-may-set-to-fill-key-cabinet-positions-with-female-allies\">need to recruit more female MPs</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/mar/27/police-failures-domestic-violence-damning-report\">domestic violence</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/jul/22/fgm-unit-theresa-may-forced-marriage-girl-summit\">female genital mutilation</a> to the conduct of the police and the need for a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/apr/27/hillsborough-disaster-those-responsible-could-face-charges-theresa-may\">full investigation into the Hillsborough disaster</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"495497ec6ceb6c69802e06e65664553fd9733c3b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/495497ec6ceb6c69802e06e65664553fd9733c3b/826_335_3430_2058/1000.jpg\" alt=\"May in red at this year\u2019s budget.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">May in red at this year\u2019s budget.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jessica Taylor/UK Parliament/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>May is hardly a slave to fashion. But as a Tory MP and now leader and prime minister, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2016/jul/18/theresa-may-does-it-matter-what-the-new-prime-minister-wears\">she embodies it</a>. What she wears embodies what she wants the party to be. Her wardrobe is an object lesson in brand management.</p> <p>May was first elected as an MP in 1997, the year of the Labour landslide, the year when there were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2007/apr/22/women.labour1\">101 Labour female MPs</a>. That year, precisely <a href=\"http://conservativewomen.uk/content/women-parliament\">13 Conservative women were elected</a>. And, in an 1998 interview after she became one of the first new MPs to be given a frontbench job, she was confident that gender was irrelevant. How she has changed.</p> <p>Back then, the Tories were in shock and in decline after 18 years in power. Recovery seemed distant. Yet, for Conservatives, office is always the principle ambition, and that means it often makes a very unconservative accommodation with social trends. After the 1997 defeat, powerful figures in the party grasped that appearing more female-friendly would be at the heart of modernisation. Soon, May was speaking on women\u2019s issues. In 2002, after the second election defeat, she became the first woman to chair the party. That was the year she <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2002/oct/08/uk.conservatives2002\">described the Tories as the \u201cnasty party\u201d</a>. It was the year <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/oct/09/gender.fashion\">she wore kitten heels</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"35bf3a0c3e5b77f043e2670559f0092d2ca44466\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/35bf3a0c3e5b77f043e2670559f0092d2ca44466/237_139_2104_3258/646.jpg\" alt=\"May dons a colour-block coat on her first day as prime minister.\" width=\"646\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">May dons a colour-block coat on her first day as prime minister.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gareth Fuller/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The kitten heels gave May an identity that was separate from her politics. In popular imagination, they were so ... well, unTory. They were a little quirky. They were almost cheeky. They were animal print, for heaven\u2019s sake! It was as if every other woman in the party was still in shiny leather brogues. What May said about herself with those shoes, she came also to say about the party. The shoes helped to identify where the change in public perception had to come; they began to lay the ground for a party leader who really was modernising. Only it was David Cameron who capitalised on it, not May.</p> <p>Fashion writers applaud May as a woman who treats the frontbench in the Commons like the front row at a fashion show. It\u2019s much more than that \u2013 since that day at the 2002 party conference, May has never stopped using how she looks to indicate what she is thinking.</p> <p>She dresses strikingly when she intends to make a striking intervention; as emphasis, not distraction. Last autumn, at the first party conference after the 2015 election victory, May made a deeply controversial speech about <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/politics/theresa-may-boutique/\">immigration in a zip-backed black Roland Mouret dress</a>. A few years earlier, she had been equally provocative about the Human Rights Act in another party conference speech, in a <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2045156/Theresa-May-Ken-Clarke-clash-catgate-Human-Rights-Act.html\">waisted navy jacket and a dress with an asymmetric hemline</a>. During what turned out to be George Osborne\u2019s last budget in March, she <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3495666/Put-yer-baps-away-darling-Theresa-steals-budget-dress-divides-Twitter.html\">sat beside the chancellor in a scarlet dress</a>. Soon afterwards, she had a dramatic haircut, following Clinton, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/nicola-sturgeon\">Nicola Sturgeon</a> and Merkel with the power bob (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2016/jul/26/pob-power-haircut-women-theresa-may-political-bob\">AKA the Pob</a>). At that point, it occurred to me she thought the Brexit vote might not go the government\u2019s way and that, if so, it would be her chance for the top. She was not going to lose out to the Camerons again. Picture the tortoise sturdily marching past the snoozing hare. Then remember last July\u2019s steps-of-Downing-Street colour-blocked coat and skirt by Amanda Wakeley, and <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/fashion/people/theresa-may-wears-amanda-wakeley-coat-to-enter-downing-street/\">read the wardrobe of triumph</a>.</p> <p>May can do this because wearing interesting clothes is at last a legitimate \u2013 maybe even a desirable \u2013 attribute for women in power, and she can take some of the credit for that. When she began her career in Westminster 20 years ago, an interest in fashion was taken as an indication of a woman who can read nothing more challenging than the captions to magazine fashion shoots. Labour women who took part in photo shoots soon after the election in 1997 were told they had destroyed their political credibility. When Sturgeon did the same thing in September last year, <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3225121/Sturgeon-attacks-hideous-cruel-focus-appearance-posing-glamorous-Vogue-photoshoot.html\">even the Daily Mail let it pass</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"92d976941a0b8b6307520de4ff0ba0862747426a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/92d976941a0b8b6307520de4ff0ba0862747426a/228_1298_1489_1860/801.jpg\" alt=\"At the 2015 Conservative party conference.\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">At the 2015 Conservative party conference.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ray Tang/REX Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>May has played a part in making style a legitimate part of a political personality. She uses what she wears to underline her wider message: every public appearance announces that she is in touch with a reality outside Westminster (even if it is limited to prosperous southern England), and that she shares ordinary people\u2019s \u2013 or at least well-off people\u2019s \u2013 interests in the quotidian concerns of life. But her appearance says something else about her, too. From statement haircut to shiny toe cap, her appearance represents her freedom from anxiety about what other people think \u2013 a quality that, May\u2019s friends say, is one of her defining characteristics.</p> <p>May pushes boundaries with clothes as well as policies. Female MPs who reveal that, in fact, they \u2013 along with other women \u2013 do have breasts still get trolled on Twitter (when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/alison-mcgovern\">Alison McGovern</a> wore a low-cut dress on Channel 4 News last year, she was <a href=\"http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/mp-accused-flashing-cleavage-channel-6315978\">accused of deliberately trying to distract male viewers from the interview</a>). When May wore that red dress behind Osborne, I\u2019m not sure she thought she was reclaiming breasts from sexploitation. But she was saying that she will wear exactly what she likes.</p> <p>Contrast this with the Thatcher era. Margaret Thatcher made a Thatcher-shaped hole in the glass ceiling. Apart from the significant fact of being there, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/apr/09/margaret-thatcher-no-feminist\">she did nothing to make it different for women</a>. Her lack of interest in feminist revolution was exemplified by many things she did, and also by her outfits.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"fd7647f62dd965fe222b8272aa09b4fd0c953fff\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fd7647f62dd965fe222b8272aa09b4fd0c953fff/0_0_1646_3000/549.jpg\" alt=\"May\u2019s 2011 waisted jacket and dress.\" width=\"549\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">May\u2019s 2011 waisted jacket and dress.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Toby Melville/REUTERS</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Thatcher wore clothes to make her look less threatening than she was: her attitude to gender was far more fully described by her wardrobe than anything that she said (<a href=\"http://www.margaretthatcher.org/document/101687\">a speech to the 1969 party conference archly quoting Socrates</a> \u2013 \u201cwhen woman is made equal to man she becomes his superior, and I would not dissent from anyone as wise as Socrates\u201d \u2013 may be the best indication of her fey approach). In Thatcher\u2019s view, women could share power only if they let men think that they were still making the tea.</p> <p>One of the more odd developments in feminist politics is the motherhood divide. In last year\u2019s Labour leadership contest, <a href=\"http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/2015/07/does-it-matter-liz-kendalls-not-mother-row-reveals-more-you-think\">Helen Goodman suggested Yvette Cooper\u2019s experience as a mother made her the best candidate</a>. It is a terrifying thought that if Andrea Leadsom, a mother, had not tried the same line against the childless May, Leadsom might now be prime minister.</p> <p>But it has become much more likely that men will face similar random tests of their familiarity with voters\u2019 experiences. Women are no longer obliged to pretend to be domestic goddesses. It\u2019s hard to imagine May bothering to perpetuate the myth that she cooks for Philip every night the way <a href=\"http://voices.nationalgeographic.com/2013/04/08/5-surprising-things-you-didnt-know-about-margaret-thatcher/\">Thatcher apparently cooked for Denis</a>. Mr May has already been objectified as Maidenhead man, and <a href=\"http://www.marieclaire.co.uk/news/fashion-news/theresa-may-s-husband-peter-may-the-style-file-3581\">his choice of outfits is almost as scrutinised as hers</a>.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/1686925/theresa-may-reveals-she-hates-her-nose-and-compares-herself-to-elizabeth-i-in-an-astonishingly-candid-interview/\">May says her heroine is Elizabeth I</a>: head of a buccaneering nation; queen of Galleon Britain.

Wealthy and abashed GOP-ers gulped $29 glasses of Silver Oak cabernet and sidled up next to self-righteous silver-haired Democrat hippies to ask sheepishly for a toke off their joints, and we all, CEOs and chakra readers, dads and daughters, young and old, disappeared into the music.</p> <p>When golden gods of rock are your escorts, of course, that escape comes at a price: tickets alone already generated a cool $160m from the estimated 75,000 attendees.

At 73, Mick Jagger strutted down the catwalk better than Cara Delevingne, who was watching the Rolling Stones\u2019 ecstatic set of nonstop hits.

Neil Young delivered the best line of the festival (\u201cCome back tomorrow night \u2013 Roger\u2019s gonna build a wall and make Mexico great again\u201d) and ripped into a 20-plus-minute rendition of Down by the River. <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/paulmccartney\">Paul McCartney</a> stayed on stage for almost three hours, the Who roared what seemed to be the loudest set of the festival and Waters saved the whole thing from being stuck in the past by using the stage as a political platform. Dylan elicited some grumbles by not saying a word to the audience or allowing his face to be shown on the big screens, but a fan plugging up his phone to a charging station shrugged and said he\u2019d been the same way when he saw him play in 1978.</p> <p>When news of Desert Trip\u2019s two-show-per-night lineup and cushy seating options broke in mid-April, it coincided with Coachella, the sweaty, frantic festival that squeezes in nearly 60 shows and 100,000 partiers per day.

Ben Carson, a former primary season rival of the Republican nominee, insisted that when Trump made those remarks \u201cthat was a very different time in his life and at that time he was a billionaire playboy and the language that he used was consistent with that\u201d.</p> <p>Former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani also dismissed the wave of Republicans who had announced in the past 48 hours that they were no longer voting for Trump. \u201cSometimes Republicans get a little weak-kneed,\u201d said Giuliani. \u201cI happen to be a Republican with very strong knees.\u201d</p> <p>Only two Republican officials were in the spin room to praise Trump\u2019s performance: longtime Trump ally Senator Jeff Sessions and congressman Jason Smith of Missouri.

Simple,\u201d said Farage.</p> <p>An hour before the debate started, Trump sought to distract attention away a newly released recording of him boasting of molesting women by staging a surprise stunt to highlight claims once made against his opponent\u2019s husband.</p> <p>Despite recently claiming that he would rather the second presidential debate be about \u201cpolicy\u201d rather than \u201cin the gutter\u201d, the Republican nominee held the extraordinary three-minute press event with four women who have accused Bill and Hillary Clinton of wrongdoing. One of them claimed: \u201cBill Clinton raped me and Hillary Clinton threatened me.\u201d</p> <p>Speaking in a conference room to handful of reporters in an event aired on Facebook Live, Trump appeared with Paula Jones, Juanita Broaddrick, Kathy Shelton and Kathleen Willey. Three of the four women have claimed inappropriate sexual contact with Bill Clinton, which he has denied. Shelton was the victim of a 1975 rape where Hillary Clinton was assigned by an Arkansas court to represent her assailant.</p> <p>The women took turns in speaking after Trump praised them as very courageous.

I just start kissing them. It\u2019s like a magnet. Just kiss, I don\u2019t even wait \u2026 and when you\u2019re a star they let you do it.

I would go back and lean up against my stool, but he was very present.\u201d</p> <p>She added: \u201cI was surprised by the absolute avalanche of falsehoods.

  "<p>We all know what an \u201calpha male\u201d is. An alpha male is a man who takes charge, one who imposes his will on others, not the other way round. Other men want to be him, women want to be with him. An alpha male intimidates, he\u2019s unquestionably in charge, no matter what the situation. An alpha male is loud, brash, doesn\u2019t care what anybody else thinks. An alpha male says what he wants, does what he wants, wears what he wants, as long as those clothes are roomy enough in the trousers to accommodate his gargantuan gonads and don\u2019t dissolve in response to all the testosterone constantly leaking from his pores. </p> <p>That\u2019s the general idea, anyway. But the idea that human men can be alpha males is actually far from scientifically accepted. This may come as a surprise, given how common and widespread the notion is. The most recent example would be Donald Trump in his presidential debates. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/09/alpha-males-run-politics-donald-trump-misogyny\">People have labelled him an alpha male</a>, Nigel Farage even defended Trump\u2019s obscene comments about women as \u201c<a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-37601422\">alpha male boasting</a>\u201d and compared him to a silverback gorilla, which for those familiar with primate anatomy is <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://twitter.com/Nick_Pettigrew/status/785354647687032832\">actually quite an insult</a>. So what, scientifically, is the case for alpha males among humans?

Species like chimps and gorillas do have social structures and hierarchies with a dominant individual at the top, typically a male who has achieved that positon via displays of strength and physical prowess. The fact that alpha males exist isn\u2019t disputed, it\u2019s whether humans can actually be such a thing.</p> <p>The term started being applied to humans with the publication of Frans de Waal\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Chimpanzee-Politics-Power-among-Apes/dp/0801886562\">Chimpanzee Politics</a>, which made direct comparisons between human and chimp behaviour, including the dominant behaviour of males. It became more mainstream when used in <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1999/11/05/us/naomi-wolf-feminist-consultant-to-gore-clarifies-her-campaign-role.html?_r=0\">the context of Al Gore\u2019s presidential campaign</a>. </p> <p>It really became accepted as something men <em>should want to be</em> with the success of Neil Strauss\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Game-Undercover-Secret-Society-Artists/dp/184767237X\">The Game</a>, based on lessons he acquired from the Pick Up Artist community. This should trigger alarm bells for many; <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/brain-flapping/2014/nov/14/how-to-be-a-pickup-artist-science-dapper-laughs-julien-blanc\">terms and methods acquired from Pick Up Artists should be treated with extreme scepticism at the very least</a>. But, sex being the powerful motivator that it is, the idea that being an alpha male would improve your life and make you more successful with women proved incredibly beguiling, so acceptance and use of the term has now become the norm. But this doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s valid, just that it\u2019s common.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"46c78541a9179e3e103ccbe238cb57aedec70dfc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/46c78541a9179e3e103ccbe238cb57aedec70dfc/0_71_2121_1273/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mature couple having relationship difficultiesAnnoyed woman with her husband standing in background at home.

The big, loud, brash guys who swagger and dominate and bully have been part of our society for as long as it\u2019s existed, so it\u2019s nice to have a convenient label for them if nothing else. </p> <p>It\u2019s hard to deny that humans are very susceptible to <a href=\"http://intergroup.uconn.edu/socialdominance.html\">the process of social dominance</a>; we exist in unequal hierarchies with inferior and superior individuals in almost every context, so it\u2019s not far-fetched to assume that some men rise to the top of these hierarchies due to a combination of physical and psychological qualities (such as <a href=\"https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/head-games/201412/are-alpha-males-myth-or-reality\">height, a deep voice, and so on</a>).</p> <p>Humans are, for better or worse, very easily influenced by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/brain-flapping/2015/apr/02/democracy-psychology-idiots-election\">displays of confidence, after all</a>. And by acting confident, men could well find they get their way more often, and thus be compelled to continue.

Because while human do share a number of features and behaviours with our primate cousins, we are invariably far more complex. </p> <p>People can belong to different hierarchies, for example; a guy who is the most vocal, dominant person in his amateur football team might be under the heel of an aggressive boss during his day job. Is he an alpha male, or not? It depends on context, obviously. Humans have many different social groups and varying roles within them, because we\u2019re more complex. A universal \u201calpha\u201d seems unlikely. </p> <p>Rather than relying on aggressive dominance, humans are actually far more cooperative and social. Some evidence suggests that our <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19575315\">friendliness and sociability is what made us so smart to begin with</a>, so rather than being the top humans, you could argue that alpha males are something of an evolutionary throwback, the civilizational equivalent of an appendix; no longer used, just hangs around and occasionally <a href=\"http://www.everydayhealth.com/appendicitis/guide/appendix/ruptured/\">fills everything with poison</a>. </p> <p>Supposed human alpha male behaviour also often doesn\u2019t match alpha male behaviour in other species. Many non-human alpha males also have a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_(ethology)\">corresponding alpha female</a> who exerts similar levels of dominance and control, whereas human alpha males invariably have a \u201cless respectful\u201d attitude towards women, shall we say. Also, the fact that many communities of men (particularly online) are seemingly convinced that they can all be alpha males is a contradiction in terms; there should only be one alpha male per community, that\u2019s sort of the whole point. The rest should try and depose him as and when the opportunity presents itself, but until then they are, at best, \u201cbeta males\u201d, a term often used as an insult by members of said community with no sense of irony. </p> <p>It\u2019s as if the idea of being an alpha male is very reassuring to those who lack confidence and are scared by the wider world and people in it, so want to turn the tables.</p> <p>This may be key. Supposed alpha males may always get their way not because of to some evolved tendency in humans to respect and obey men who display a specific set of characteristics, as if people were video games that respond to certain cheat codes, but simply because they\u2019re scary. If a large, shouty man starts bellowing in your face, that\u2019s very unsettling, so people may do what he says to stop him from becoming violent, or just to make him go away. Said man would obviously perceive this as evidence for his own superiority.</p> <p>Maybe the supposed human alpha male is a combination of disgruntled male wish fulfilment and borderline-pseudoscientific justification for resorting to bullying, intimidation and generally all-round unpleasant behaviour by men hoping to impose their will on a world they find too complex and unnerving so revert to their baser instincts to get what they want, despite knowing deep down they don\u2019t deserve it and shouldn\u2019t have it?</p> <p>In fairness, \u201calpha male\u201d is a lot more succinct. </p> <p><em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/garwboy\">Dean Burnett</a>\u2019s debut book</em><em> </em><em><a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Idiot-Brain-Neuroscientist-Explains-Really/dp/1783350814/ref=sr_1_1_twi_pap_2?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1461961162&amp;sr=1-1\">The Idiot Brain</a></em><em> </em><em>is available now in</em><em> </em><em><a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/370462/s/idiot-brain/\">the UK</a>,</em><em> </em><em><a href=\"http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/idiot-brain-dean-burnett/1122688091?ean=9780393253788#productInfoTabs\">USA</a></em><em> </em><em>and <a href=\"http://www.harpercollins.ca/9781443450065/the-idiot-brain\">Canada</a>.</em></p>",

His asinine attempts to dismiss his piggish behavior by distracting viewers with talk of Bill Clinton and Isis were a failure.</p> <p>But the real losers in tonight\u2019s debate, and in this election, are the American people. When Donald Trump answers a serious question about his (lack of) healthcare proposals, he says simply, \u201cThe plans are going to be so good.\u201d When asked about his (lack of) morals, he says randomly, \u201cI\u2019m gonna knock the hell out of Isis.\u201d He won\u2019t answer questions.</p> <p>Part of that is a deliberate diversion strategy. To avoid talking about the video clip where he appears to condone sexual assault, he slams Bill Clinton or resorts to fear-mongering. But most of Trump\u2019s answers lack depth because he simply doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s talking about. When Anderson Cooper pressed him on how he could possibly reconcile his policy on preconditions with a repeal of Obamacare, he had absolutely nothing to say. He just doesn\u2019t know.</p> <p>When it comes to the Syrian civil war and the millions of victims it\u2019s claimed, his policy also remains to be seen. This is a man who decides consequential policy positions on the stage because he hasn\u2019t thought of them ahead of time. When he threw Mike Pence under the bus on Syria, it appeared to be the first time he\u2019d even considered the question at hand.</p> <p>Sadly, his lack of depth means our country has lost a valuable opportunity to engage in a desperately needed public discussion about the differing viewpoints in America on consequential issues. America needs Hillary Clinton to face off with an opponent who will challenge her viewpoints, not a hollow-headed clown with zero depth.</p> <p>How can we fight climate change, raise incomes for the middle class, reform our ailing democracy, educate our children or champion world peace without serious and deep debate? We\u2019ll never make headway on our serious challenges without robust national discourse.

Whether sparring over Obamacare or foreign policy or tax reform or job creation, he effectively kept hammering her on her 30-year record.</p> <p>Instead of a debate that was focused on Trump\u2019s vulgar comments, the debate was focused on policy issues, and despite all of Clinton\u2019s \u201cpreparation\u201d when it came to the nuts and bolts of policy, Trump managed to not only go toe-to-toe with Clinton, he often got the best of her.</p> <p>Trump needed to win tonight to stay alive. Clinton did not. Trump won, and he lives to fight another day. This race is far from over.</p>",
  "<p>Towards the end of Sunday\u2019s second televised <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-elections-2016\" title=\"\">US presidential debate</a>, Hillary Clinton said something that political candidates often say, but which in 2016 is no longer the usual banality. \u201cThis is not an ordinary time,\u201d said Mrs Clinton. \u201cAnd this is not an ordinary election.\u201d If anything, this was an understatement. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/09/presidential-debate-reactions-trump-clinton\" title=\"\">The second debate</a> between her and Donald Trump, and the days running up to it, have been extraordinary living and livid proof of that.</p> <p>Rarely in any democratic country, never mind in the world\u2019s most powerful democracy, can the substance and the temper of the debate have been so low, so dark, so personal and so damaging as it has now become in the US race. The responsibility for this cannot be dismissed as six of one and half a dozen of the other. The responsibility for it rests squarely with Mr Trump, his campaign and his personality. To take just one example: in most democracies, the tape that exploded into the public arena <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-recorded-having-extremely-lewd-conversation-about-women-in-2005/2016/10/07/3b9ce776-8cb4-11e6-bf8a-3d26847eeed4_story.html\" title=\"\">at the end of last week</a>, in which Mr Trump was heard boasting about his sexual aggression towards women, would have destroyed his candidacy. He would have been forced to quit, partly because of the offensiveness of his words and views, and partly so his party\u2019s other candidates can save their electoral skins.</p> <p>Yet not only did Mr Trump brazen the tape out at the weekend, but on Sunday night he deliberately went lower and darker still. Shortly before the debate, Mr Trump held a press conference championing women who claim to have been Bill Clinton\u2019s past sexual targets. This attempt to fan the stone-cold embers of arguments that distracted and demeaned America nearly 20 years ago was a clear signal. It showed that Mr Trump will fight as dirty as he can, all the way to November. It also suggested that his focus is on firing up the angriest and most paranoid parts of the Republican vote. This was confirmed once the debate was under way, when Mr Trump insulted, abused and patronised Mrs Clinton at every opportunity, both in his words and by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/10/presidential-debate-trump-bully-clinton\" title=\"\">intimidatory platform manner</a> that his admirer Nigel Farage revealingly likened to the dominant behaviour of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/10/nigel-farage-fights-donald-trumps-corner-in-post-debate-spin-room\" title=\"\">a silverback gorilla</a>.</p> <p>There have been other bitter presidential contests in the US. Yet this contest has become a break with the past that will not be easily repaired and for which America will pay a price at home and abroad, whatever the outcome next month. When before did one candidate say of another in debate that they have \u201ctremendous hate\u201d in their heart? Or refer to his opponent as the devil? And when before did one candidate say, as Mr Trump did, that, if elected, he would try to see his opponent <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/10/debate-donald-trump-threatens-to-jail-hillary-clinton\" title=\"\">prosecuted and put in jail</a>. That\u2019s what happens in autocracies and dictatorships. It\u2019s the way leaders behave in countries with no respect for the rule of law or the separation of powers. But it has not been the way, until now, in America.</p> <p>Mr Trump does all this partly because that is the kind of person he is: impulsive, rude, aggressive, extreme. He does it partly because there has always been something violent and vengeful about the white right in the US. And he does it partly because his rise has been one manifestation of a global anger against democracy\u2019s failures to control the rich and compensate the poor.</p> <p>But it is no accident that this is happening in the first US presidential race in which a woman may win. Of course, Mr Trump would behave aggressively if his Democratic opponent were a man too. He\u2019s that kind of bully. But his anger through the campaign, and in Sunday\u2019s debate, is the anger of a man who cannot treat women as equals. In another remark in the debate Mrs Clinton said her vision of America is of somewhere where everyone has a place. Mr Trump\u2019s view of women\u2019s place does not bear thinking about \u2013 and should not be voted for.</p>",

Gun deaths have declined, though only slightly, between the administrations. Police fatalities have in general declined in the last 40 years: from 1991 to 2000, an average of 162 officers were killed each year; from 1981 to 1990, an average of 186; from 1971 to 1980, an average of 230.</p> <p>The deadliest era for police in the US was prohibition.

Her Attacks on Hillary Clinton Are Not.</strong></a></p> <p>To be clear, I\u2019ve always found Broaddrick\u2019s claims about Bill Clinton credible, though only the two of them know the truth. Five people say she told them about the assault right after it allegedly happened. She denied the rape in a 1997 affidavit filed with Paula Jones\u2019 lawyers but changed her story the next year, when she was interviewed by the FBI in the course of Kenneth Starr\u2019s investigation. At the time, some Clinton defenders treated her changing story as evidence of her untrustworthiness, but it seems perfectly plausible that, as she <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/24/us/on-tortuous-route-sexual-assault-accusation-against-clinton-resurfaces.html?pagewanted=all\">told</a> the <em>New York Times</em>, she hadn\u2019t wanted to go public but also felt she couldn\u2019t lie to federal investigators. In the 1990s, Clinton defenders sometimes pointed to the fact that Broaddrick attended a Clinton fundraiser three weeks after she says he raped her. But we know it\u2019s not uncommon for rape victims to blame themselves and continue to seek their rapists\u2019 favor. After all, I also believe <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/09/opinion/sunday/donald-trump-groper-in-chief.html\">Jill Harth</a>, who accused Donald Trump of sexual harassment and attempted rape, even though later, reeling from a divorce, she became his girlfriend.</p> <p>Far less credible, however, is Broaddrick\u2019s claim that Hillary Clinton tried to intimidate her into silence. </p> <p><strong>Click through above to read the full piece.</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2016/10/09/trumps-lawsuits-include-20-involving-allegations-mistreating-women-president-republican/91832012/\"><strong>Trump, companies accused of mistreating women in at least 20 lawsuits</strong></a></p> <p>One woman sued Donald Trump\u2019s Miami resort saying she lost her job because she got pregnant.</p> <p>Two others claimed they were fired after complaining that co-workers sexually harassed them.</p> <p>And a number of women testified in a lawsuit that Trump himself repeatedly instructed managers to hire younger, prettier workers at his Los Angeles golf club.</p> <p>The release of a video Friday showing Trump\u2019s sexist remarks in 2005 has created a firestorm of controversy that threatens to derail his campaign.

  "<h2>Donald Trump\u2019s claims</h2> <h2><strong><br>\u2018The US is giving back $150bn to a terrorist state\u2019</strong></h2> <p>The US is not giving any of its own money to Iran as part of an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jul/14/iran-nuclear-deal-expected-to-be-announced-in-vienna\">international nuclear arms deal</a> meant to prevent the construction of weapons. The deal <a href=\"https://www.iaea.org/newscenter/statements/iaea-director-general%E2%80%99s-statement-iran\">gradually unfreezes assets</a> that belong to Iran but were frozen under sanctions related to the nation\u2019s nuclear programme. Sanctions related to human rights, terrorism and other issues remain in place and still lock Iran out of billions.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s guess of how much Iran will benefit by unfrozen assets is far higher than most experts\u2019 estimates, though not inconceivable. Treasury secretary Jack Lew has <a href=\"http://www.c-span.org/video/?327246-1/secretaries-kerry-moniz-lew-testimony-iran-nuclear-agreement\">put the number at $56bn</a>; Iranian officials have said between <a href=\"http://www.presstv.com/Detail/2016/01/19/446415/Iran-32bn-unfrozen-assets\">$32bn</a> and <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/iran-claims-100-billion-now-freed-in-major-step-as-sanctions-roll-back/2016/02/01/edfc23ca-c8e5-11e5-a7b2-5a2f824b02c9_story.html\">$100bn</a>. Independent economists have calculated that Iran will free up anything <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/world/middleeast/la-fg-iran-frozen-assets-20160120-story.html\">between $30bn to $100bn</a>. Complicating the calculations are Iran\u2019s debts: it will have to pay off tens of billions to countries <a href=\"http://www.cfr.org/world/getting-china-sanction-iran/p24212\">such as China</a>.</p> <h2><strong>\u2018Just today, policemen were shot, two killed, and this is happening on a weekly basis\u2019</strong></h2> <p>Two police officers were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/08/three-police-officers-shot-palm-springs-california\">shot dead on Saturday in Palm Springs.</a></p> <p>Trump\u2019s claim is only one slice of a much larger story that does not support his argument. His campaign cited <a href=\"http://www.nleomf.org/facts/officer-fatalities-data/causes.html\">data from the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund</a> (NLEOMF), which does show <a href=\"http://www.nleomf.org/facts/officer-fatalities-data/\">a 56% increase</a> in officers killed by guns between 1 January and 16 July 2016 (28) compared with the same span in 2015 (18). But according to the non-profit group, officer deaths overall, including from traffic accidents and job-related illnesses, are roughly on par with figures from this point in 2015: 60 deaths this year to 61 the year before.</p> <p>The non-profit\u2019s data also shows that police fatalities overall <a href=\"http://www.nleomf.org/facts/officer-fatalities-data/year.html?referrer=http://www.nleomf.org/facts/officer-fatalities-data/\">have declined</a> in the last 15 years: in the last seven years of Barack Obama\u2019s presidency theaverage number of police deaths was 135, , a 17% decline on the final seven years of George W Bush\u2019s administration, when there were an average of 162 a year. Gun deaths have declined, though only slightly, between the administrations. Police fatalities have in general declined in the last 40 years: from 1991 to 2000, an average of 162 officers were killed each year; from 1981 to 1990, an average of 186; from 1971 to 1980, an average of 230.</p> <p>The deadliest era for police in the US was prohibition. In the years between its enactment and repeal, from 1920 to 1933, an average of 250 officers were killed each year. Gun-related deaths were <a href=\"http://www.nleomf.org/facts/research-bulletins/?referrer=http://www.nleomf.org/facts/officer-fatalities-data/causes.html?referrer=http://www.nleomf.org/facts/officer-fatalities-data/year.html?referrer=https://www.google.com/\">highest in 1973</a>, according to the NLEOMF figures, when 156 officers were killed.</p> <p>The FBI also <a href=\"https://www.fbi.gov/news/pressrel/press-releases/fbi-releases-2014-statistics-on-law-enforcement-officers-killed-and-assaulted\">reports</a> police deaths with information submitted to it from various law enforcement agencies, though its most recent figures date from 2014. According to such data, that year 96 law enforcement officers were killed, 51 by \u201cfelonious acts\u201d and 45 in accidents, and 48,315 officers were assaulted while on duty.

In the months before the Iraq war began in 2003, Trump tepidly endorsed invasion to <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/buzzfeedandrew/trump-on-the-howard-stern-show-on-sept-11-2002?utm_source=soundcloud&amp;utm_campaign=share&amp;utm_medium=twitter\">radio host Howard Stern</a>, who asked him whether he thought the US should attack Saddam Hussein. \u201cYeah, I guess so,\u201d Trump said.</p> <p>A few weeks later he told Fox News that George W Bush was \u201cdoing a very good job\u201d.

The US has probably the most intensive screening process in the world for refugees: it requires they register and interview with the United Nations, which then must refer them to the US; refugees who pass this test then interview with state department contractors and have at least two background checks; then they have three fingerprint and photo screenings; then US immigration reviews the case; then homeland security interviews the refugee; then a doctor examines the refugee; and finally several security agencies perform one last check after the refugee has been matched with a resettlement agency. </p> <p>The process <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/02/donald-trump-syria-refugees-us-immigration-security-terrorism\">takes 18 months</a> to two years.

Meanwhile, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton\">Hillary Clinton</a>, sometimes a bit too eager to defend herself or display her foreign policy knowledge, enabled Trump by engaging him wherever he went.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/09/presidential-debate-reactions-trump-clinton\">'A Red Bull display of madness': reactions to the Trump-Clinton presidential debate</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Asked for an opinion on the way forward in Aleppo, Trump, who clearly had nothing to say about the war-torn city, merely repeated the word a couple of times, before redirecting the conversation entirely with a non sequitur, \u201cLet me tell you about Mosul.\u201d</p> <p>A similar diversion happened with questions regarding Hillary Clinton\u2019s private email server, which Trump always manages to make a centerpiece of debates. Trump\u2019s threat to use the power of the presidency to prosecute his political rival \u2013 \u201cbecause there\u2019s never been so many lies, so much deception\u201d \u2013 wasn\u2019t strong enough of a statement. He also had to threaten her with incarceration, quipping, when Clinton replied with a comment about how it\u2019s a good thing someone with his temperament is not currently in charge of the law in our country: \u201cBecause you\u2019d be in jail!\u201d</p> <p>When the conversation finally did move on from Clinton\u2019s email scandal, Trump reprimanded the moderator for not following up about the emails, a topic that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/08/clinton-trump-veterans-forum-debate-preview-moderators-elections-2016\">already dominated</a> the commander-in-chief forum in September, an event nominally about foreign policy. As for his repeated insistence that there\u2019s \u201cnever been so many lies\u201d? That isn\u2019t true, according to Politifact, which finds Clinton is an unusually truthful candidate.</p> <p>Not that that\u2019s much of an advantage in our current debate climate.</p> <p>Pithy redirections of substance and reason have resurfaced again and again over the course of the election cycle. It\u2019s become endemic to the way we do debates, as Trump\u2019s rise in the primaries has proved, and it is deleterious to our democracy. We punish the candidates who are honest about what they don\u2019t know (Gary Johnson\u2019s \u201cwhat\u2019s Aleppo\u201d moment comes to mind here), and reward the best bullshitters.</p> <p>In the internet era, and the rise-of-Trump era, society must be able to do better. While it\u2019s important for a potential president to be able to deftly pivot away from uncomfortable questions and set the course of conversation on their terms, these are also the skills of a master propagandist. They are not the most important skills in a leader, who should be able to identify what they don\u2019t know and, in the right context, occasionally admit it.</p> <p>Trump doesn\u2019t bother. Rather he draws blanks in huge areas of policy but he\u2019s never held to account for it, because in debates, as in politics everywhere this year, authenticity is king, even Trump\u2019s authentic disregard for the truth.</p> <p>So it\u2019s hard to say what anyone learned from the second debate, not because it was conspicuously less substantive than previous ones, but because it was presidential debates as usual.</p> <p>The truth, and knowledge specifically, is simply not that valuable in a debate format as it exists; voters are simply unable to evaluate it in the framework provided.</p> <p>Experts and the media learned nothing, but that\u2019s less of an indictment of the system \u2013 they\u2019ve heard it all before. But low-information voters could have learned worse than nothing. As in previous debates and pre-debates, they might have come away from thinking Trump was against the war in Iraq (he wasn\u2019t), that Clinton should have done more to reform healthcare (she never had the relevant job description), and that Clinton was somehow the reason Trump was able to dodge paying federal taxes (everyone who can do it does do it). </p> <p>Why should our democracy\u2019s debate system put an emphasis on spontaneity and authenticity at the expense of truth and knowledge? There has to be something better than this at this late date, whether it\u2019s a real-time fact check displayed on screen, a sidebar of data-informed commentary, prepared videos that are vetted for accuracy and submitted in advance.</p> <p>I doubt that authenticity-loving Americans will go for it, but perhaps the public should reconsider. It\u2019s a format that could benefit Trump as much as it would benefit Clinton \u2013 he would have the advantage of not having a meltdown on stage, as he\u2019s constantly in danger of having. Meanwhile Clinton and the rest of us would hear a whole lot fewer lies.</p> <p>We already know enough about Trump\u2019s temperament from the way he uses his Twitter account, and it would certainly be an improvement on the current situation, which seems to be an exercise chiefly in spreading voter misinformation.</p> <p>But don\u2019t expect Trump to lead the charge to reform presidential debates. As his campaign manager Kellyanne Conway put it shortly after the town-hall style debate drew to a close, it\u2019s \u201ca great format for him\u201d.</p> <p>The entire 2016 presidential election thus far is the proof that she\u2019s right.</p>",

  "<p>The second presidential debate is in the can. Here\u2019s a summary of what happened:</p> <ul> <li><strong>It was a nasty affair </strong>without perhaps being quite as sordid or raw as might have been expected, given Donald Trump\u2019s signal beforehand that he would attack Hillary Clinton as an enabler of her husband\u2019s infidelities in the 1980s and 90s.</li> <li><strong>Challenged to defend his recently uncovered hot mic remarks </strong>about grabbing women \u201cby the pussy\u201d, Trump said they amounted to \u201clocker room talk\u201d, and that he was embarrassed and apologetic. But he denied he had assaulted women, whereas, he said, Bill Clinton had been \u201cso abusive to women\u201d.</li> <li><strong>Clinton did not respond to Trump\u2019s catalog </strong>of her husband\u2019s alleged assaults, apart to say it was inaccurate. \u201cWhen they go low, you go high,\u201d she said.</li> <li><strong>Clinton placed Trump\u2019s hot mic remarks in context</strong> with others \u2013 she listed his attack on the family of Humayan Khan, a US soldier killed in the Iraq war, his \u201cbirther\u201d attack on Barack Obama, his attack on a disabled reporter and his attack on an American federal judge of Mexican descent \u2013 to paint Trump as an unreformed bully. She said Trump \u201cowes the country an apology\u201d.</li> <li><strong>Trump projected intense hostility for Clinton</strong>. He repeatedly called her a liar, leered at her, scoffed, said she had accomplished nothing in her career. Physically, he loomed behind her as she spoke with audience members. He also told her if he were president, \u201cyou\u2019d be in jail\u201d. He pointed at her, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2016/oct/09/debate-live-fact-check-trump-tape-presidential-election-republican-critics?page=with:block-57fafaa2e4b0e4aaeaa8db62#block-57fafaa2e4b0e4aaeaa8db62\">said</a>, \u201cshe has tremendous hate in her heart\u201d.</li> <li><strong>\u201cI know you\u2019re into big diversion tonight,\u201d</strong> Clinton told Trump. \u201cAnything to avoid talking about your campaign and its explosion and how Republicans are leaving it.\u201d At least 36 elected Republicans had either rescinded endorsements of Trump or explicitly stated rejections of him in the wake of the 2005 video. </li> <li><strong>More than one snap analyst \u2013 for what that\u2019s worth </strong>\u2013 thought Trump had \u201cshored up his base\u201d of supporters by attacking Clinton over deleted emails, the 2012 Benghazi attack that killed four Americans, and other issues. Few asserted that he had broadened his appeal.</li> <li><strong>Twice Clinton said that Russia was seeking to influence </strong>the election, and not on her behalf, citing US intelligence officials who accused the Kremlin of attacks on Friday.</li> <li><strong>Trump said he disagreed with running mate</strong> Mike Pence\u2019s assertion that the US should consider military force to oppose Russian aggression in Syria. Pence tweeted congratulations after the debate.<br></li> <li><strong>Trump also said there\u2019s no Muslim ban plan any more, despite his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/dec/07/donald-trump-ban-all-muslims-entering-us-san-bernardino-shooting\">call for one</a> in December 2015</strong>. \u201cThe Muslim ban is something that in some form has morphed into extreme vetting.\u201d</li> <li><strong>A few times, Trump seemed to shock Clinton. </strong>He said that Capt Humayun Khan would still be alive if he, Trump, were president at the time \u2013 when George W Bush, a Republican, was commander-in-chief.</li> <li><strong>Trump admitted unapologetically</strong> that he had applied almost $1bn in personal losses to not pay federal income tax. \u201cOf course I do.\u201d</li> <li><strong>Trump staged a media event before the debate </strong>with three women who have accused Bill Clinton of sexual assault or rape and one woman, raped as a child, whose assailant Hillary Clinton defended, as ordered by a judge, as a 27-year-old lawyer.</li> <li><strong>Clinton was asked about a line from a WikiLeaks version</strong> of a purported paid speech in which she describe a president\u2019s need to have separate public and private faces. She said she was talking about Abraham Lincoln.</li> <li><strong>The candidates did not shake hands</strong> when they arrived at the town hall. Trump had the sniffles. And he complained a lot about the moderators letting Clinton talk more than him. A time clock count afterwards showed the time was split almost evenly.</li> </ul>",
  "<p><br></p> <p>Less than two hours before appearing on stage for the second presidential debate, Donald Trump staged a surprise event with women who have accused Bill and Hillary Clinton of wrongdoing.</p> <p>Just days after he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/07/donald-trump-the-clear-winner-in-town-hall-debate-featuring-only-himself\">told a crowd</a> in New Hampshire he would rather make the second debate about \u201cpolicy\u201d rather than \u201cin the gutter\u201d he held a three-minute press conference with four women.<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2016/oct/09/debate-live-fact-check-trump-tape-presidential-election-republican-critics\">Trump holds debate press conference with Bill Clinton accusers\u00a0\u2013\u00a0live</a> </p> </aside>  <p>One of them bluntly stated: \u201cBill Clinton raped me and Hillary Clinton threatened me.\u201d</p> <p>In a statement issued in response, Clinton campaign spokeswoman Jennifer Palmieri said: \u201cWe\u2019re not surprised to see Donald Trump continue his destructive race to the bottom.\u201d</p> <p>Speaking in a conference room to a handful of reporters in an event aired on Facebook Live, Trump appeared with Paula Jones, Juanita Broaddrick, Kathy Shelton and Kathleen Willey. </p> <p>Three of the four women have claimed inappropriate sexual contact with Bill Clinton. Shelton was the victim in a 1975 rape case in which Hillary Clinton, in her capacity as a lawyer, was assigned by an Arkansas court to represent her alleged assailant. All four were subsequently Trump\u2019s guests in the debate hall.</p> <p>Both Jones and Willey have alleged inappropriate sexual conduct by Bill Clinton in the 1990s. Jones claimed in a civil law suit in 1994 that the then Arkansas governor propositioned her and exposed himself to her in a hotel room in 1991. Clinton denied the accusations. Jones\u2019s case was settled without admission of guilt, with Clinton paying her $850,000. </p> <p>Willey, a former White House aide, accused Clinton in 1998 on 60 Minutes that the president had sexually harassed her during a meeting in the Oval Office in 1993. The Office Of Independent Counsel <a href=\"https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/GPO-ICREPORT-LEWINSKY/pdf/GPO-ICREPORT-LEWINSKY-12.pdf\">reviewed</a> Willey\u2019s claims and found them inconclusive, saying Clinton and Willey were the only witnesses to the allegation and that Willey gave false evidence to the FBI. Through lawyers, Clinton denied the accusation.</p> <p>The women took turns in speaking, after Trump had praised their courage. Broaddrick, who has alleged that the former president raped her in 1978, when he was Arkansas attorney general, spoke in the most stark terms.</p> <p>Trump has mentioned her on social media several times in the run-up to the debate, tweeting several times. He even retweeted her tweets, a step rarely taken by the candidate who normally manually quotes tweets.</p> <p>Broaddrick alleges that Clinton raped her in a hotel room while violently biting her upper lip. Clinton has flatly denied the claims, which emerged publicly in 1999 during the investigation of the former president by the independent counsel Ken Starr. The year earlier, Broaddrick had filed a sworn affidavit saying that the allegations against Clinton were untrue. Starr ruled that Broaddrick\u2019s testimony about the incident was \u201cinconclusive\u201d and did not use it. Friends of Broaddrick <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/2016/10/09/497291071/a-brief-history-of-juanita-broaddrick-the-woman-accusing-bill-clinton-of-rape\">say she told them</a> about the alleged incident at the time. </p> <p>At the press conference, Shelton said: \u201cHillary put me through something you should never put a 12-year-old through.\u201d<br></p> <p>The former secretary of state served as the lawyer for an alleged rapist, Thomas Alfred Taylor in 1975. She was<a href=\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/06/20/exclusive-hillary-clinton-took-me-through-hell-rape-victim-says.html\"> appointed by the court</a> to represent the man, one of two accused of raping Shelton, who was then 12. Taylor eventually took a plea bargain for a lesser charge. </p> <p>In her statement, Palmieri continued: \u201cHillary Clinton understands the opportunity in this town hall is to talk to voters on stage and in the audience about the issues that matter to them, and this stunt doesn\u2019t change that. </p> <p>\u201cIf Donald Trump doesn\u2019t see that, that\u2019s his loss.

  "<p>Fighting to stay in the European Union may seem a hopeless cause if you look at the political situation today. The British people have voted to leave the EU. Theresa May is committed to deliver Brexit. David Davis, the Brexit secretary, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/05/david-davis-vows-to-build-national-consensus-on-brexit\">rammed this home in a speech in parliament on Monday</a>, saying there would be no second referendum. Jeremy Corbyn, the leader of the opposition, has also accepted that we will quit.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/05/david-davis-vows-to-build-national-consensus-on-brexit\">David Davis vows to build national consensus on Brexit</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But what if a significant number of leave voters change their minds? This is not pie in the sky. After all, we were all lied to during the campaign. Brexiteers told us that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/26/eu-referendum-brexit-vote-leave-iain-duncan-smith-nhs\">Britain sends \u00a3350m a week to Brussels</a> and that Turkey is scheduled to join the EU in 2020, when neither is true. They promised we could have our cake and eat it \u2013 access to the single market, control of our laws, no budget contributions, an end to free movement and so forth.</p> <p>But on her way to the G20 summit, the prime minister refused to endorse some of Vote Leave\u2019s pledges \u2013 an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/sep/05/no-10-theresa-may-rules-out-points-based-immigration-system-for-britain-brexit\">Australian-style points system to control migration</a>, no more contributions to the EU budget, and an extra \u00a3100m a week for the NHS. Meanwhile, the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/05/japanese-ambassador-warns-companies-could-leave-uk-over-brexit\">Japanese government warned that its firms may shift activities from Britain</a> to the EU if we botch the Brexit process.</p> <p>More politicians may even follow Gordon Brown in arguing that Britain can help lead the EU if it stays. The failure to make any positive case for our membership was one of David Cameron\u2019s many sins. We need such a vision if we are to persuade the electorate that we should stay in the EU.</p> <p>We also need to show that many of the genuine problems that troubled leave voters \u2013 stagnant wages, crowded schools and GP surgeries, not enough homes \u2013 are the fault of our government, not the EU.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>A significant number of leave voters need to change their minds</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>This is why I and some others who wished to remain have launched a new group, <a href=\"http://www.commongrounduk.com/\">CommonGround</a>, that promotes a broad vision for Britain, rather than simply wanting to stay in the EU. We have to find common ground with leave voters on the need for a fair and open society and for honest politics, which was in short supply on both sides of the referendum debate.</p> <p>Now, of course, even if some leave voters change their minds, the people may still not get a chance to vote on the Brexit terms. But let\u2019s peer into the crystal ball and consider a series of admittedly slim possibilities. The prime minister has craftily put<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/sep/05/david-davis-brexit-commons-statement-leaving-uk-since-brexit-vote-poll-suggests-politics-live\"> two Brexiteers \u2013 Davis and Liam Fox</a> \u2013 in charge of negotiating Brexit. If they come up with a terrible deal, she may be able to dissociate herself from it.</p> <p>Alternatively, Labour may get a new pro-European leader or a chunk of its MPs may split off and form their own party. Although Corbyn seems to have the leadership sewn up and most MPs are too scared to leave the mother ship now, things may change in the next couple of years. If so, enough pro-European Tories may join forces with Labour to require the government to hold a referendum on the Brexit deal.</p> <p>It\u2019s also possible that such a plebiscite is already legally required. Under the so-called <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-uk-leaves-the-eu-36749304\">referendum lock legislation</a> passed in 2011, the people have to authorise any treaty that replaces the existing EU treaties. A Brexit deal is likely to involve a new treaty. A clever lawyer could say this would replace the existing ones. If this argument holds water, we may have a new referendum whether May likes it or not.</p> <p>Finally, something may change in the EU that gives May a good excuse to consult the people again \u2013 either with a referendum or an election. In particular, if the EU was prepared to reform free movement, the prime minister might modify her mantra that Brexit means Brexit.</p> <p>Now, of course, the EU isn\u2019t remotely close to making such a change. But next year there is a French presidential election followed by a German general election. The far right is on the march pretty much everywhere, playing on people\u2019s fears over immigration. Germany\u2019s Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/04/mecklenburg-vorpommern-german-anti-immigrant-party-strong-regional-election-exit-polls-merkel\">beat Angela Merkel\u2019s party in a state election at the weekend</a>.</p> <p>The main concern across the Channel is over migration of large numbers of people from outside the EU, rather than freedom of movement of workers within the EU. But, as in the UK referendum, populist politicians may find it convenient to muddle the two issues. If so, mainstream politicians may respond by eventually agreeing to modify free movement.</p> <p>Listing these possibilities may seem like clutching at straws. Each scenario is a low-probability event. But they don\u2019t all have to occur for Britain to stay in the EU. If even one happens, that may be enough.</p> <p>What does have to happen is that a significant number of leave voters need to change their minds. That could in turn trigger one of the other possibilities \u2013 a U-turn by May, a change in the Labour party, or even the willingness of our European partners to offer Britain a concession to persuade us to stay.</p> <p>My own view is that the chance of staying in the EU is now no better than 25%. But no Brexit is a good Brexit except, just maybe, the pure fantasy one promised by the leave camp. Some things are worth fighting for even when the odds are long. This is one of them.</p>",

Meanwhile, Chinese media claimed that reports of poor treatment shown to Obama and his entourage on his arrival in China were sensationalized by the western press.

  "<p>As the presidential election enters the home stretch, Donald Trump\u2019s campaign is in a vulnerable position. In recent weeks, the Republican nominee has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/26/steve-bannon-florida-registered-vote-donald-trump\">changed key aides</a> yet again, flip-flopped on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/04/donald-tump-immigration-mixed-messages-republicans\">his signature issue of immigration</a> and stayed well behind Hillary Clinton in fundraising, organization and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/29/donald-trump-nascar-north-carolina-republicans\">polling</a>.</p> <p>Trump is by no means out of the race, but his path to victory relies as much on Clinton missteps as on his own successes. That means he now has a clear goal. He is not going to try to be a normal candidate. There will be no attempt to pivot to the center. There will not be a softer side. </p> <p>Trump will be the same fiery demagogue that tore up the Republican primary. The goal will not be to dam his torrent of political incorrectness. It will be to channel it, to produce maximum appeal to voters.</p> <p>The biggest change in the Trump campaign in recent weeks was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/19/paul-manafort-resigns-donald-trump-campaign\">the replacement</a> of top aide Paul Manafort with a two-headed team, pollster Kellyanne Conway as campaign manager and rightwing publisher Steve Bannon as campaign CEO. The two took over in mid-August, after a series of revelations about Manafort\u2019s ties to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/16/donald-trump-campaign-paul-manafort-ukraine-yanukovich\">allies of Russian president Vladimir Putin</a>. </p> <p>A veteran of Republican campaigns since 1976, Manafort was brought on to help guide the campaign through the arcane process of delegate selection for the Republican convention in Cleveland. He was then able to push out Corey Lewandowski, Trump\u2019s previous campaign manager, who was known for his brash, hard-charging style. </p> <p>Manafort is known for his charisma, but he was not able to bring it to bear on Trump. Before the billionaire clinched the nomination, Manafort <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/apr/21/trump-campaign-republican-establishment-election-strategy\">promised top Republicans</a> his candidate was putting on \u201can act\u201d for primary voters. Trump was reportedly furious, and therefore did his utmost to demonstrate that he was just being himself.</p> <p>Trump subsequently meandered from controversy to controversy, a situation not helped by the fact that unlike Lewandowski, Manafort did not travel with him. It is almost unheard for campaign managers to travel with their candidate, but no candidate in American history has been so impulsive as Trump. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/03/citizens-united-david-bossie-trump-campaign\">Trump's new hire David Bossie has decades-long history attacking Clintons</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The result?

As a result, the campaign\u2019s brains trust, which also includes Trump\u2019s son-in-law <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/05/jared-kushner-new-york-observer-jewish-antisemitism\">Jared Kushner</a>, has no experience working for a presidential candidate in a general election. It is however well-attuned to Trump\u2019s idiosyncratic ways.</p> <p>One of the biggest changes is that Trump now uses a teleprompter when speaking, even at his raucous campaign rallies. Although he has long disdained the device and boasted of his ability to improvise every night, thanks to the arrival of Conway he has finally been persuaded to stick to something resembling a script. </p> <p>No one, of course, should mistake Trump for an automaton. He uses his prepared remarks in the same way John Coltrane used the sheet music to My Favorite Things: as the basis for a series of wild riffs. But the presence of the teleprompter means that Trump at least gets back to the basic notes, rather than off on a politically costly solo.</p> <p>The most glaring sign Trump\u2019s new reliance on technology came at the end of August, at an Iowa fundraiser for Senator Joni Ernst that was held in a barn on the state fairgrounds, where livestock normally compete for blue ribbons. Politician after politician took the stage to cheers from crowd sitting on benches on the dirt floor, wolfing down barbecued pork sandwiches. As Trump\u2019s appearance drew near, technicians suddenly appeared and installed a teleprompter. At such an informal event, it was a jarring site.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d9ec5297b1d66276248bc101c1f8a915d5d659bb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d9ec5297b1d66276248bc101c1f8a915d5d659bb/0_319_5200_3119/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Donald Trump Attends Joni Ernst\u2019s Annual Roast And Ride In Des Moines\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Donald Trump speaks from a teleprompter at the 2nd annual Joni Ernst Roast and Ride in Des Moines last month.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stephen Maturen/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In terms of policy, the candidate has returned to the \u201clet Trump be Trump\u201d tactics that defined his campaign in the primary. This was most clear in his immigration speech in Phoenix on Wednesday, where Trump definitely took a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/01/donald-trump-vows-to-deport-millions-during-first-hour-in-office-in-hardline-speech\">hardline stance</a>, doubling down on the inflammatory rhetoric that drove his surge to the nomination. </p> <p>Proclaiming \u201cthere will be no amnesty\u201d, parading family members of Americans killed by illegal immigrants, he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/01/in-arizona-we-saw-the-real-donald-trump-the-one-we-already-knew\">framed the issue</a> not as \u201ca humanitarian crisis\u201d, as he said earlier that day in Mexico, or even an economic one. Instead, it was about public safety and the \u201cwellbeing of the American people\u201d.</p> <p>In the aftermath of a speech that showed little potential to improve poll numbers among Latino voters, a number of members of Trump\u2019s Hispanic advisory council resigned. A recent poll showed <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/nation/politics/trailguide/la-na-trailguide-updates-1472827916-htmlstory.html\">only 19% of Hispanics</a> supporting Trump. In 2004, George W Bush won 44%. In one recent poll, Trump\u2019s approval rating among African Americans was <a href=\"http://fusion.net/story/341993/trump-public-policy-polling-0-percent/\">zero</a>. To win, he will have to run the table with white voters.</p> <p>Trump does appeal to disconnected blue-collar white voters. While diverse states like Colorado and Virginia, swing states in past cycles, have moved off the map, Trump is showing staying power in places such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/28/donald-trump-iowa-republican-red-state\">Iowa</a> and Nevada, which have recently leaned Democratic. The problem is that those states have comparatively few votes in the electoral college.

Her loyal gatekeeper Huma Abedin will likely stand guard, returning to the plane after a period of absence that aides insist has nothing to do with the very public <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/29/anthony-weiner-sexting-twitter-scandal\">break-up of her marriage to former congressman Anthony Weiner</a>. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"02fe2f8a192552c1eab0129408a381a14a5f5d6c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/02fe2f8a192552c1eab0129408a381a14a5f5d6c/0_40_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Huma Abedin\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Huma Abedin waits while Hillary Clinton greets supporters in Scranton, Pennsylvania, last month.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark Makela/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Campaign manager Robby Mook and chairman John Podesta have their own challenge: working out where to direct the plane. Some campaign destinations are obvious, such as the swing states of Ohio, Florida, New Hampshire, Nevada, Iowa and North Carolina. Some in rust-belt states such as Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan are getting more attention this time thanks to Trump\u2019s appeal to the white working class. Colorado and Virginia look well out of his reach.</p> <p>The bigger question is whether to take the battle into enemy territory. Trump has proved so unpopular among some Republican voters, minorities and women, that deep red territory is perhaps in play. States such as Arizona, Utah and Georgia, which haven\u2019t voted Democrat in decades, could be vulnerable in the winner-take-all electoral college system \u2013 and Clinton has superior fundraising and a vastly more organised network of campaign offices.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/02/presidential-debate-moderators-martha-raddatz-anderson-cooper\">The Clinton-Trump presidential debates: who are the moderators?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Her campaign is at least testing the waters. On Friday, Clinton began airing <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2016/09/01/clinton-launching-tv-ads-in-arizona-a-state-that-has-been-reliably-republican/\">TV ads in Arizona</a>, where Mitt Romney beat Barack Obama by nearly 10 points. Clinton\u2019s husband is the only Democrat to have won the state in a presidential election since 1952. </p> <p>Her campaign is also spending money in Nebraska, one of two states that splits electoral college votes and therefore offers Clinton a chance to peel off electors from the relatively liberal city of Omaha. Even Utah, where Trump has riled conservative Mormons, has seen the Clinton campaign <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/onpolitics/2016/08/23/clinton-field-office-utah-sullivan/89200340/\">open a field office</a>. </p> <p>Whether these moves amount to a radical new strategy or clever feints to trick Trump is not clear. Some inside Clinton\u2019s Brooklyn headquarters are <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2016/08/clinton-trump-electoral-strategy-227561\">reportedly cheering</a> that moves into Republican heartlands appear to have Trump spending time and money in places he ought to take for granted \u2013 for instance, by staging a major immigration speech in Arizona. </p> <p>Yet the confidence could easily become complacency too. Clinton\u2019s healthy lead following the party\u2019s convention has eroded in recent weeks, slipping down to the low single digits in some key states. Not only are the <a href=\"http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/presidential-races/294037-national-poll-clinton-edges-trump-by-2-points\">headline polls</a> too close for comfort, but Americans still stubbornly dislike Clinton and Trump by enormous margins. A record number of Americans now say they dislike Clinton, according to a <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/page/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2016/08/31/National-Politics/Polling/release_441.xml\">Washington Post-ABC News poll</a> that showed 41% of Americans have a favorable impression of her, while 56% have an unfavorable one.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b2a5b2a2b7e42facc177e4254c15454870f9037b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b2a5b2a2b7e42facc177e4254c15454870f9037b/0_58_5178_3107/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Latino Clinton supporters\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Latino supporters of Hillary Clinton hold a sign saying \u2018I\u2019m with her\u2019 written in Spanish at a campaign rally in Miami in July.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Brooks Kraft/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Though she enjoys a powerful coalition of support in Washington, particularly from the Obama administration, political surrogates cannot necessarily translate her shower their popularity on friends.</p> <p>\u201cThis ain\u2019t over man.

Aides also complain that she does not get the recognition she deserves for developing many more new policy ideas than most candidates.</p> <p>\u201cPeople criticise me for having so many plans,\u201d Clinton told a lukewarm audience of military veterans in Cincinnati on Wednesday. \u201cPeople say, Oh there she goes with another plan about mental health, or whatever,\u201d she added. \u201cBut I have this old fashioned idea that if you are going to ask to be president if you have to have a plan.\u201d<br></p> <p>Yet the campaign is under no illusion about the nature of this year\u2019s fight. If hunkering down away from the press while outspending Trump \u2013 she has <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/09/hillary-clinton-has-a-lot-of-money/498467/\">raised more money</a> than <a href=\"http://data.worldbank.org/country/marshall-islands\">the GDP</a> of <a href=\"http://www.tradingeconomics.com/palau/gdp\">small Pacific nations</a> \u2013 is what it takes to beat him, then so be it.</p> <p>\u201cThis is not a normal election,\u201d Clinton said at the American Legion convention in Cincinnati. \u201cThis election shouldn\u2019t be about ideology, it\u2019s not just about differences over policy. It\u2019s about who has the experience and temperament to serve as president and commander and chief.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe stakes this fall are as high as any election in our lifetimes.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Key players</strong></h2> <p>Huma Abedin, Clinton\u2019s right-hand woman and gatekeeper. Robby Mook, the campaign manager in charge of her election machine. John Podesta, family friend, campaign chairman and former chief of staff to Bill Clinton. Jennifer Palmieri, former Obama communications director now fielding flak for Clinton. Neera Tanden, key figure in transition team preparing the clan for power.</p> <h2><strong>S</strong><strong>ignature policies</strong></h2> <p>The campaign slogan \u201cstronger together\u201d captures Clinton\u2019s broad belief in a more socially inclusive America, but the underlying policies range widely from a jobs program and infrastructure spending, to making college more affordable and tackling climate change. On trade and social security, she has moved to the left, rhetorically, at least.<br></p> <h2><strong>Strongest points</strong></h2> <p>Clinton\u2019s experience as secretary of state, senator and activist first lady make her one of the most qualified candidates to run for office. Supporters also point to her resilience in the face of setbacks, long track record of social activism and historic achievement as the first woman nominee of a major party.</p> <h2><strong>Weakest points</strong></h2> <p>The biggest handicap according to opinion polls is a perceived lack of trust among voters, something exacerbated by years of attacks on Clinton family \u201cscandals\u201d and an ongoing controversy over her private email server. Voters sometimes also talk about finding her inauthentic and lacking warmth. </p> <h2><strong>C</strong><strong>ore supporters</strong></h2> <p>African Americans, women, Latinos, college-educated men \u2013 in short, a vast swath of the increasingly diverse US electorate. Geographically, the strongest support for Democrats is heavily concentrated on the coasts however.</p>"

Obama described them as irresponsible and insisted the US would undergo a smooth transition of power in January.</p> \n<p>\u201cAnd so I\u2019d advise Mr Trump to stop whining and go, try to make his case to get votes. And if he got the most votes then it would be my expectation of Hillary Clinton to offer a gracious concession speech and pledge to work with him in order to make sure that the American people benefit from effective government.</p> \n<p>\u201cAnd it would be my job to welcome Mr Trump, regardless of what he\u2019s said about me or my differences with him on my opinions, and escort him over to the Capitol in which there would be a peaceful transfer of power. That\u2019s what Americans do. That\u2019s why America\u2019s already great.

Since the beginning of September, sterling has fallen a further 8 percent or so against the euro and the dollar. This will continue to push up inflation in the months ahead. A stronger oil price will add further to price rises for energy and transport. <br></p> <p>\u201cOver the course of next year, we should expect inflation to rise above the Bank of England\u2019s 2 percent target.

In Nevada, 46% of likely voters said they planned to back Clinton while 44% said they would support Trump. In North Carolina voters were split 48-47 in favor of Clinton, while in Ohio Clinton attracted only 44% of likely voters compared with Trump\u2019s 48%.</p> <p>The Clinton campaign seems to be well aware that they have work to do if they want to secure these three states, which together are <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.archives.gov/federal-register/electoral-college/allocation.html\">worth</a> 39 of the 270 electoral college votes needed to win the White House.

That said, he is tapping \u2013 uncomfortably \u2013 into something more than his supporters\u2019 most racist and violent urges: American democracy isn\u2019t working for most Americans, and Trump voters\u2019 threats are an ugly reminder that we need to fix it.</p> <p>Nearly 90% of Trump supporters agreed with a Rand Corporation <a href=\"http://www.rand.org/blog/2016/01/rand-kicks-off-2016-presidential-election-panel-survey.html\">survey</a> statement that \u201cpeople like me don\u2019t have any say about what the government does.\u201d The irony here is that Trump voters are historically some of the <em>most</em> enfranchised, with some of his strongest support coming from white protestant men. A study done during the primaries also found that Trump backers make an average of $72,000 per year, compared with a $61,000 average among likely Clinton voters. </p> <p>Most election rigging, of course, is done by Republicans through gerrymandering and restrictive voter ID laws, aimed at making it harder for poor people and people of color to get to the polls. On the whole, then, Trump voters are some of the least likely to find their ballots fall victim to foul play. Still, that doesn\u2019t mean the threat posed by his fear-mongering is any less real, or that his supporters aren\u2019t responding to legitimate flaws in American politics.</p> <p>Corporate citizens \u2013 as defined by Citizens United<em> \u2013 </em>now have an easier time getting a hold of their elected representative than just about any other American. In other words, money talks in Washington, and Super Pacs have spend just under <a href=\"https://www.opensecrets.org/outsidespending/summ.php?chrt=V&amp;type=S\">$795m </a>this election cycle.

And unlike in systems based on proportional representation, our winner-take-all electoral model creates some of the highest barriers to entry for political outsiders of any democracy on earth.</p> <p>Americans\u2019 distrust of politics is about more than just elections, though. Congressional approval ratings have declined steadily <a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/poll/190598/congress-approval-remains-low.aspx\">since 2009</a>, and now sit at just 20% \u2013 a high in the last few years. Unions \u2013 which used to cudgel Democrats into representing working people\u2019s interests \u2013 are at their weakest point in decades, and lack the sway they once held at the highest levels of government. </p> <p>Declines in organized labor have been paired with the disappearance of steady and well-paid work, either succumbed to automation or shipped overseas by free trade agreements. A jobless recovery from the financial crisis has left many adrift in the economy, while executives from the firms that drove it got golden parachutes courtesy of the Obama administration and the Federal Reserve.<br></p> <p>On the table now are to very different responses to these crises. Using an apocryphal quote from Frederich Engels, Rosa Luxemburg once <a href=\"https://www.marxists.org/archive/luxemburg/1915/junius/ch01.htm\">wrote</a>: \u201cBourgeois society stands at the crossroads, either transition to socialism or regression into barbarism.\u201d </p> <p>The path Trump has chosen is clear: scapegoating immigrants and people of color for white political and economic woes \u2013 a script that sounds eerily similar to both 1930s Germany and the far-right\u2019s European resurgence today. Another path, though \u2013 Bernie Sanders\u2019 Democratic Socialism \u2013 garnered 12 million votes in the primaries, and continues to find voice in the social movements that helped make his campaign possible. Railing against the 1% in Washington and on Wall Street, Sanders offered an egalitarian populism to those who felt left out of the political system, not a reactionary one.</p> <p>The fight over vote rigging in 2016 is a proxy war for a much deeper crisis of legitimacy in American democracy, pitting the country\u2019s political elite against just about everyone else who lives here. Our democracy is in sore need a revolution, one that \u2013 with any luck \u2013 will be a far cry from the violent and xenophobic coup Trump\u2019s supporters are promising to bring about. </p>",

The upshot, though, was simply to deter legitimate voters, many of whom left rather than endure what they saw as bullying and humiliation by confident white men in suits.</p> \n<p>When Democratic party poll watchers objected, a scuffle broke out. Eventually, Rehnquist and his colleagues were asked to leave, and the practice of challenging individual voters \u2013 a relic of the Jim Crow-era south \u2013 was soon outlawed in Arizona and many other states.</p> \n<p>With the Trump campaign now predicting the election will be rigged by Hillary Clinton, voting rights activists are once again alarmed by calls from the Republican\u2019s campaign for so-called \u201cvolunteer election observers\u201d.</p> \n<p>Many voting rights activists worry, however, that just calling for a volunteer army of observers may have a chilling effect on turnout, especially among minority voters. They worry, too, about the toxic political atmosphere that Trump\u2019s rhetoric is creating. </p> \n<p>\u201cThere is no place for harassment of voters in American democracy,\u201d a group of more than 60 activist groups spearheaded by the Lawyers\u2019 Committee for Civil Rights Under Law wrote in an <a href=\"http://www.866ourvote.org/pages/open-letter-to-political-parties-concerning-voter-intimidation\">open letter</a> to all the major political parties. \u201cUnsubstantiated predictions of voter fraud and rigged elections, coupled with the demagogic rhetoric of the last few months towards minority communities, constitute an unacceptable targeting of those members of our society most vulnerable to disenfranchisement.\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/apr/14/clinton-campaign-democratic-party-sue-arizona-voting-rights\">Clinton campaign and Democratic party sue Arizona over voting rights</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Even before Trump launched his presidential campaign, the Republican party had established a track record of controversial challenges to the legitimacy of certain Democratic voters. They have waged a decade-long campaign to introduce voter ID laws and other restrictions that have done little or nothing to prevent fraud . The Brennan Center for Justice has found that voter fraud is <a href=\"https://www.brennancenter.org/publication/truth-about-voter-fraud\">less likely than death by lightning strike</a> \u2013 between 2000 and 2014 it found <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2014/08/06/a-comprehensive-investigation-of-voter-impersonation-finds-31-credible-incidents-out-of-one-billion-ballots-cast/\">just 31 credible incidents</a> of voter impersonation across the entire US.</p> \n<p>Courts and activists have warned that the principal effect of these laws has been to suppress the voices of legitimate voters who lean Democratic.</p> \n<p>\u201cUnfortunately,\u201d said Kristen Clarke of the Lawyers\u2019 Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, \u201cthe problem with voting in the United States is not the voting process itself, but the efforts undertaken at the local and state level in recent years to make voting more difficult, most especially for African American and other minority voters.\u201d </p> \n<p>In contrast to Trump\u2019s call for monitors to challenge voters, lawyers and activists have set up elaborate election protection systems across the country so voters suffering harassment can call for help, and groups can dispatch lawyers to defuse problems. They are particularly concerned about Florida and Pennsylvania, where the laws are not as strict as elsewhere.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/oct/18/us-presidential-election-rigged-donald-trump-wisconsin-video\" data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/582gk\" data-show-ads=\"true\" data-video-id=\"2816579\" data-video-name=\"US presidential election is rigged, says Donald Trump \u2013 video\" data-video-provider=\"Reuters\"> \n <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-5805e0cfe4b005f21833a984\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> \n  <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/10/18/161018TrumpRiggedElectionUpdate_desk.mp4\">\n  <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/10/18/161018TrumpRiggedElectionUpdate.m3u8\">\n  <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/10/18/161018TrumpRiggedElectionUpdate_WebM.webm\"> \n </video> \n <figcaption>\n  <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/oct/18/us-presidential-election-rigged-donald-trump-wisconsin-video\">US presidential election is rigged, says Donald Trump</a>\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Trump\u2019s rhetoric \u2013 now including the threat that he may refuse to concede if the election goes against him \u2013 only compounds a political environment that has already been fraught with challenges following the supreme court\u2019s 2013 decision to overturn parts of the 1965 Voting Rights Act. The ruling not only limited the justice department\u2019s power to stop some voting laws that can have a discriminatory effect; the department is also unable, for the first time in more than 50 years, to send <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-voting-observers-exclusi-idUSKCN0ZX0QR\">election observers of its own</a> without a court order. </p> \n<p>Almost 800 federal election observers were deployed around the country in 2012. </p> \n<p>Challenging voters is itself not a new idea. The GOP tried to do it in Ohio in 2004 by sending postcards to Democratic voters at their last known address and then challenging the legitimacy of anyone whose postcard bounced back in the mail \u2013 a notorious practice dating back to the civil rights era known as vote caging. The courts stepped in to stop the maneuver in its tracks.</p> \n<p>Since then, a conservative poll-watching group called True the Vote has vowed to train 1 million activists to challenge and confront anyone they regard as suspect. The organization <a href=\"http://www.demos.org/publication/bullies-ballot-box-protecting-freedom-vote-against-wrongful-challenges-and-intimidation\">said in 2012</a> it wanted to make the experience of voting for those voters \u201clike driving and seeing the police following you\u201d.</p> \n<p>But Trump\u2019s predictions of a rigged election have put him out of step even with many of his <a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2016-election/rubio-toomey-dispute-trump-rigged-elections-claims-debates-n668006\">fellow Republicans</a>, including his own running mate, Indiana governor <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/2016/10/16/498152787/mike-pence-we-will-absolutely-accept-the-result-of-the-election\">Mike Pence</a>, who said on Sunday: \u201cWe will absolutely accept the results of the election.\u201d</p> \n<p>Even the former senator Kit Bond of Missouri, who was one of the first to advocate voter ID laws, and memorably claimed to have found a <a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2012/07/voter-suppression-kevin-drum\">springer spaniel</a> who voted Democratic, has said that Trump\u2019s evidence-free pre-emptive allegation of vote-rigging <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2016/10/republicans-rigged-election-claim-donald-trump-229630\">\u201cisn\u2019t going to cut it\u201d.</a> </p> \n<p>The split with the party may itself be an obstacle to Trump pursuing any kind of post-election challenge, because the top election officials in several swing states, including Florida, North Carolina, Wisconsin, Georgia and Arizona, are Republicans. If they raise no objection to certifying the results, it is unlikely Trump by himself can do anything to change their minds.</p>",

  "<p>Donald Trump has continued an unprecedented effort by a major presidential candidate to effectively declare the presidential election invalid before voters have even had their say.<br></p> <p>On Monday, just over three weeks before election day, the Republican nominee repeated his unsupported claim that voter fraud was rampant and specifically stated in a rally in Green Bay, Wisconsin that ballots cast by undocumented immigrants led to Barack Obama\u2019s victory in North Carolina in 2008. \u201cPeople who died 10 years ago are still voting,\u201d he claimed.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s Wisconsin appearance came after a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/16/donald-trump-rigged-election-poll-giuliani-gingrich-pence\">series of provocative tweets</a> culminating on Monday morning <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/787995025527410688\">when he wrote:</a> \u201cOf course there is large scale voter fraud happening on and before election day.

They are the ur-Americans. They are the ground zero of American life. And that\u2019s an attractive idea for them and for outside observers. On the other hand they would bridle at some of the ways that they were portrayed.\u201d<br></p> <p>When the acclaimed photographer Margaret Bourke-White <a href=\"https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/c3/cf/35/c3cf3554fa9d498dd8aacd024e3f9839.jpg\">took a series of photographs for Life magazine</a> that showed <a href=\"http://imgsrc.art.com/img/print/print/margaret-bourke-white-muncie-mayor-rollin-bunch-having-breakfast-with-his-wife-and-bulldog-in-his-dining-room_a-g-4920262-4990000.jpg?w=894&amp;h=671\">the deep economic inequalities </a>following the Depression, the town was in uproar. In 1982, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/membership/2016/oct/11/middletown-gary-younge-us-election-presidential-muncie-indiana#comment-85280992\">as one of our readers noted</a>, PBS released a six-part documentary on Muncie called Middletown. <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/36651048\">One episode, set in Southside High School</a>, which has since closed, depicted casual drug use, profanity and sexual banter while focusing considerable attention on an teenage interracial relationship. After tense discussions between local leaders, PBS and the film-makers, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1982/03/31/arts/final-pbs-middletown-segment-is-withdrawn.html\">the episode was withdrawn</a> and the series sponsor, Xerox, withdrew its sponsorship \u2013 but not its funding \u2013 from that particular program, which <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/06/movies/homevideo/seventeen-and-cooley-high-no-easy-as-but-powerful-lessons.html?_r=0\">has since been released on DVD</a>. One person involved in the talks at the time told the New York Times that the decision was made to protect the children. \u2018\u2019It\u2019s a very difficult issue of freedom of speech versus what these kids might have been doing to themselves. There\u2019s a possibility that they really could be destroying their lives in saying some of the things they said in the film. In a way, you have to protect them \u2013 they\u2019re minors, after all \u2013 from themselves.\u2019\u2019</p> <p>And like a fairground mirror, Middletown gave America an image of itself that was both familiar and woefully distorted \u2013 an image that the American commentariat preferred to reality. For when the Lynds selected a city they settled on three key characteristics: that it be between 25,000 and 50,000 people, that it was \u201cself-contained\u201d (not a \u201csatellite\u201d or suburb) and finally, that it should \u201chave a small Negro and foreign-born population\u201d. Muncie did not actually fit the bill for the final point. At 5% its black population was proportionally higher at the time than New York, Chicago and Detroit . It did have a small foreign-born population because the local business class imported workers from Tennessee and Kentucky. \u201cThere was a conscious attempt to keep foreign workers out,\u201d says Connolly. \u201cBecause they wanted people to go home during slack times and they were worried foreigners would bring in dangerous ideas.\u201d But once again, this made it atypical compared with other towns of its size.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/2016/01/now-and-then-embed/embed/embed.html?mobile_before=//media.guim.co.uk/52311fa9413df6d33f6530a355523586f57930cc/0_0_6533_4540/500.jpg&amp;desktop_before=//media.guim.co.uk/52311fa9413df6d33f6530a355523586f57930cc/0_0_6533_4540/1000.jpg&amp;label_before=Then&amp;mobile_after=//media.guim.co.uk/c6b30b1f2fda993a6526aa12ef16eb680a9afcab/0_0_6533_4540/500.jpg&amp;desktop_after=//media.guim.co.uk/c6b30b1f2fda993a6526aa12ef16eb680a9afcab/0_0_6533_4540/1000.jpg&amp;label_after=Now&amp;\" data-alt=\"Delaware Courthouse\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/2016/01/now-and-then-embed/embed/embed.html?mobile_before=//media.guim.co.uk/52311fa9413df6d33f6530a355523586f57930cc/0_0_6533_4540/500.jpg&desktop_before=//media.guim.co.uk/52311fa9413df6d33f6530a355523586f57930cc/0_0_6533_4540/1000.jpg&label_before=Then&mobile_after=//media.guim.co.uk/c6b30b1f2fda993a6526aa12ef16eb680a9afcab/0_0_6533_4540/500.jpg&desktop_after=//media.guim.co.uk/c6b30b1f2fda993a6526aa12ef16eb680a9afcab/0_0_6533_4540/1000.jpg&label_after=Now&\">Delaware Courthouse</a> <figcaption>Delaware Courthouse</figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Lynds did this consciously because they wanted to concentrate on class and therefore avoid dealing with \u201ctwo major variables\u201d and deal instead with a \u201chomogeonous, native-born population\u201d. \u201cThey understood that they were doing that and they justified it in a social-scientific sense,\u201d says Igo, an associate professor at Vanderbilt University. \u201cThey try to unmask this myth about class.

  "<p>No news, they say, is good news. Either that or it\u2019s the result of a government blackout. The draw for the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/africannationscup\">Africa Cup of Nations</a> will be held in Libreville, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/gabon\">Gabon</a>, on Wednesday but yet again the buildup to a tournament has been dominated by doubts over where it will be staged as the aftershocks of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/31/gabon-election-results-disputed-incumbent-ali-bongo-victor-jean-ping\">Gabonese presidential elections</a> continue to be reverberate.</p> <p>At the moment it seems the tournament will go ahead in Gabon, beginning on 14 January, but no one is confident. Even by the standards of the Cup of Nations, the 2017 edition has seemed ill-starred. In 2006, hosting rights were given to South Africa but because of the war in Libya, which was scheduled to host in 2013, the two nations swapped. As the conflict in Libya continued, it became apparent they would have to be replaced altogether as hosts, leading to another round of bidding in 2015 in which Gabon beat Algeria and Ghana; Nigeria, who had initially been named as a reserve host, declined to be considered.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/30/gabon-army-deployed-before-official-result-election\">Gabon army deployed before result of fraught election is announced</a> </p> </aside>  <p>After elections in August gave <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/31/gabon-election-results-disputed-incumbent-ali-bongo-victor-jean-ping\">the incumbent president, Ali Bongo, a narrow victory</a> over his veteran challenger Jean Ping, Gabon descended into violence. Initial results suggested he had won by only 5,594 votes but there were widespread allegations of corruption. Bongo has ruled Gabon since 2009 when he succeeded his father Omar, who had been the president since 1967.</p> <p>The parliament building and the national television station were attacked by Ping supporters and there were several days of clashes on the streets between the opposition and police. The government acknowledged three people were killed in the protests but the opposition has said the figure could be as high as 50. There were also several hundred arrests. Social media was suspended and a moratorium imposed on the issuing of visas to foreign journalists. The Confederation of African Football discussed the unrest and sounded out Morocco as a replacement host; it had been supposed to host the 2015 tournament before <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/feb/06/morocco-banned-and-fined-africa-cup-of-nations\">withdrawing at the last minute</a> because of fears over Ebola.</p> <p>The Gabonese supreme court<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/24/gabon-court-rules-president-ali-bongo-rightful-winner-of-september-election\"> investigated the election result</a> and concluded Bongo had won by 11,000 votes. Bongo has sworn in a new cabinet and, for now, everything appears relatively calm, although the state budget for 2017 has been cut by 5% because of the falling oil price. The possibility remains the tournament could be used as a platform for dissent by the opposition, particularly in Oyem and Port Gentil, host cities in areas that strongly backed Ping.</p> <p>The tournament looks fascinatingly open and, as has been the recent way of things, is missing a number of big names.

They lurk ominously in seeding pot three which also comprises Cameroon, Senegal and Morocco and, as such, looks rather more likely to produce a winner than pot two, where Tunisia, Mali, Burkina Faso and DR Congo have benefitted from decent runs at recent tournaments.</p> <p>Another side making a long-awaited comeback are Uganda who have qualified for the first time since being beaten in the final by Ghana in 1978. They are joined in Pot four by Togo, Zimbabwe and the debutants Guinea-Bissau, who finished top of a qualifying group comprising Congo, Zambia and Kenya with a goal difference of zero.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ng-interactive/2016/oct/14/desert-fire-the-world-cup-rebels-of-kurdistan-video\">Desert fire: the world cup rebels of Kurdistan \u2013 video</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Last time they (co-) hosted the tournament, in 2012, Gabon reached the quarter-final where they lost on penalties to Mali.

Two of the last three winners have not qualified. It feels as though any of about 10 sides could win in Gabon. Whether that is the result of a general lifting of standards, or whether the absence of a great team is evidence of a general lack of quality is open to debate but what is certain is how competitive and unpredictable the 2017 Cup of Nations will be.

And they know he\u2019s married.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cEvery assault should be taken care of in court of law,\u201d Trump said, but the accusations made in the media are \u201cdamaging and it\u2019s unfair.\u201d<br></p> <p>\u201cI believe my husband. This was all organized from the opposition,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThey don\u2019t have any facts and even the story that came out in People Magazine, the writer that she said that my husband took her to the room and start kissing her, she wrote in the same story about me that she saw me on Fifth Avenue and I said to her, Natasha, how come we don\u2019t see you anymore? I was never friend with her. I\u2019d never recognize her.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow we could believe her? That never happened.\u201d</p> <p>Despite the pressures of the campaign on her marriage, Trump said, she does not want people feeling bad for her.</p> <p>\u201cPeople think and talk about me like, \u2018oh Melania, oh poor Melania.\u2019 Don\u2019t feel sorry for me, don\u2019t feel sorry for me.

His non-answer provoked much ire, especially since many other athletes were quick to criticise Trump\u2019s remarks.</p> <p>Brady, who threw for 376 yards and three touchdowns in New England\u2019s 35-17 win over the Bengals on Sunday, told Boston sports radio WEEI that he ducked the question because didn\u2019t want to create extra headlines.</p> <p>He said: \u201cIt\u2019s just the way it is right now. Obviously there\u2019s a lot of headlines to make, and I\u2019ve tried not to make a lot of headlines. I\u2019ve been in an organization where we\u2019re taught to say very little, we have respect for our opponents and we don\u2019t do the trash-talking.</p> <p>\u201cThe thing I\u2019ve always thought is I don\u2019t want to be a distraction for the team. That\u2019s what my goal is. Not that there are things I\u2019ve said and done that haven\u2019t been, but you try not to be. It\u2019s just hard enough to win and prepare without the distractions so when you start having the distractions it\u2019s even harder to prepare.\u201d</p> <p>However, Brady\u2019s refusal to answer the question arguably created just as much of distraction for the Patriots, a point which was acknowledged by former New England receiver Troy Brown on Sunday.</p> <p>Brown said: \u201c[He should have said] just something, a quick answer on the question to get it out of the way, just answer the question to say, \u2018I don\u2019t condone it\u2019 and then walk off the stage. The optics of it weren\u2019t great. I understood what he was trying to do. But the next time he\u2019s asked that question, then give a quick answer and let it be. I\u2019m not responsible for what comes out of my friend\u2019s mouth. But I am responsible for correcting my friend.\u201d</p> <p>Today, Brady again said that he and Trump have been friends for 15 years, and that \u201cI\u2019ve always had a good time with him\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/17/tom-brady-donald-trump-press-conference-distraction\">Tom Brady says he ducked Trump questions to avoid team distractions</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58054a18e4b0cd26ff71e1d4\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-17T22:01:59.374Z\">11.01pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <h2>Juanita Broaddrick, on Donald Trump\u2019s accusers:</h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>If these accounts are true, yeah.

This is one of the big-breaking stories of our time, in my opinion - this shows corruption at the highest level, and we can\u2019t let it happen as American citizens.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo let\u2019s see how the press covers it,\u201d he continued. \u201cThe press likes not to cover it because the best thing that Hillary Clinton has going is the media. Without the media, she wouldn\u2019t even be in this race. This is collusion between the FBI, the Department of Justice and the State Department to make Hillary Clinton look like an innocent person when she\u2019s guilty of very high crimes.

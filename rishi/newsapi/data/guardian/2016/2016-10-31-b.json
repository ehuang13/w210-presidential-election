And recent events suggests he may have a fine grasp of the dark arts of political spin.</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/10/31/mark-carney-hasnt-just-played-a-political-game-hes-won-it-hands/\">The Telegraph\u2019s James Kirkup argues</a> that Carney has played a blinder this month, by using the attacks from Brexit supporters to spark a debate about his future.</p> <p>The key to the saga is Carney\u2019s declaration last week that his decision on whether to stay or go in 2018 was \u201centirely personal\u201d. That sent the hare running.... and it got a second burst of speed when various Carney \u2018friends\u2019 suggested he was leaning towards a return to Canada.</p> <p>Kirkup explains how Carney outfoxed his detractors within Theresa May\u2019s government: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Before the row over his ideological commitment to Brexit blew up, there was a perfectly respectable question to be asked about Mr Carney\u2019s future based on his competence as a central banker. Some of his policies, especially \u201cforward guidance\u201d about rates, have been less than impressive, leading to confusion instead of the clarity he promised.</p> <p>But the Carney-bashers have allowed that debate to shift from economics into politics, an arena where Mr Carney does rather well.

I\u2019m not aware of any of the factors that went into Director Comey\u2019s decision to send this letter to Congress on Friday.\u201d</p> <p>Asked if the incident could affect the election outcome, Earnest replied: \u201cWe certainly have already seen some of Secretary Clinton\u2019s harshest critics capitalise on this letter, distort its contents to provoke controversy.\u201d</p> <p>Comey\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/28/fbi-reopens-hillary-clinton-emails-investigation\">letter to Congress</a>, stating that the FBI is examining newly discovered information that might be pertinent to Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server as secretary of state, has placed a widely respected FBI director in extraordinary political jeopardy.</p> <p>Earnest dismissed any notion that Congress could be seen as an impartial oversight body. \u201cWe\u2019ve already seen just in the last 72 hours the kind of risk that\u2019s associated with communicating to them sensitive information,\u201d he said. </p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s one senior Republican official, who had previously endorsed the Republican nominee for president, who\u2019s let it slip that his party was considering impeaching President Clinton even before she\u2019s been elected, if she\u2019s elected.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/oct/31/donald-trump-anthony-weiner-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/5a59t\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2857941\"            data-video-name=\"Trump: who'd have thought we\u2019d be thanking Weiner? \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"AP\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-5816fbe7e4b01c528432e846\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/10/31/161031TrumpAttorneyGeneral2_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/10/31/161031TrumpAttorneyGeneral2_V4.webm\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/10/31/161031TrumpAttorneyGeneral2.m3u8\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/oct/31/donald-trump-anthony-weiner-video\">Trump: who\u2019d have thought we\u2019d be thanking Weiner?</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>\u201cThat I think is a pretty clear indication that Congress is not at all impartial and that\u2019s why many of these norms \u2026 that apply even when we\u2019re not talking about someone famous and even when we\u2019re not talking about an election a week and a half away, should apply. The president believes these norms are important and worth upholding.\u201d</p> <p>The press secretary was at pains to defend <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/30/james-comey-fbi-director-hillary-clinton-email\">Comey as an individual</a>, if not his actions in this case. \u201cThe president\u2019s assessment of his integrity and character has not changed,\u201d he said. \u201cFor example, the president doesn\u2019t believe that Director Comey is intentionally trying to influence the outcome of an election. The president doesn\u2019t believe that he\u2019s secretly strategising to benefit one candidate or one political party.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/31/huma-abedin-hillary-clinton-anthony-weiner-emails\">Huma Abedin: has Hillary Clinton's closest ally become her biggest liability?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cHe\u2019s in a tough spot and he\u2019s the one who will be in a position to defend his actions in the face of significant criticism from a variety of legal experts, including individuals who served in senior Department of Justice positions and administrations that were led by presidents in both parties. </p> <p>\u201cBut I\u2019m just not going to be in a position to frankly defend or criticise the decisions that he\u2019s made with regard to what to communicate in public.\u201d</p> <p>An emboldened Donald Trump has described the revelation as \u201cbigger than Watergate\u201d, but there is little initial evidence the news has upended the presidential race. A <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2016/10/clinton-emails-comey-poll-politico-morning-consult-230519\">Morning Consult/Politico poll</a> carried out after the announcement put Clinton three points ahead, while a CBS/YouGov survey of likely voters in 13 battleground states showed that only 1% of Clinton supporters were less likely to vote for her as a consequence.</p> <p>Trump claimed on Monday that the FBI had stumbled across a digital \u201cmother lode\u201d and predicted they would discover missing work-related emails that had been deleted from Clinton\u2019s computers.</p> <p>\u201c650,000 [emails]? \u2026 I think you are going to find the 33,000 that are missing,\u201d he told supporters in Michigan. \u201cI think we hit the mother lode, as they say in the mining industry.\u201d</p> <p>Trump urged Comey to resist political pressure. \u201cHe\u2019s gotta hang tough because a lot of people think he did the wrong thing, but he did the right thing,\u201d he told the Grand Rapids rally. \u201cI was not his fan but what he did he brought back his reputation.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt took guts for director Comey to do what he did,\u201d he added, to chants of \u201clock her up\u201d from the crowd.</p> <p>Trump has seized on signs of momentum to push into once-safe Democratic territory in the industrial mid-west. He was also due to speak in Warren in Michigan on Monday before appearing with running mate Mike Pence in Eau Claire, Wisconsin, on Tuesday.</p> <p>Until his polling gap began to narrow again last week, Trump had been forced back to a dwindling number of swing states, while Clinton eyed Republican territory in Utah, Arizona and Georgia. Renewed optimism among Republicans has created an unusually vast national battleground, particularly as Trump\u2019s economic populism scrambles traditional demographic dividing lines. </p> <p>Michigan and Wisconsin have both been hit hard by the loss of manufacturing jobs and were the scene of surprise defeats for Clinton in the Democratic primary, when large numbers of blue-collar workers favoured Bernie Sanders. Signs of Democratic nervousness in Wisconsin became apparent last week when the Clinton campaign suddenly announced an advertising blitz. Sanders has been dispatched to help campaign for Clinton in the state on Wednesday.</p> <p>The impact of early voting may also be forcing Trump to look further afield. States such as a North Carolina have seen heavy early turnout among Democrats and may be relatively immune from any late swing away from Clinton.</p> <p>If he cannot win North Carolina but picks up Florida and Ohio, Trump\u2019s best hope of pulling off a shock victory will rely on either rustbelt states like Michigan and Wisconsin or, in the north-east, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania and Maine.</p> <p>Clinton is redoubling her efforts. Two stops on Monday in Ohio were to be followed by three in Florida on Tuesday and another swing to North Carolina later in the week.</p> <p>\u201cMost people have decided quite a long time ago what they think about all this,\u201d she told a rally in Ohio on Monday. \u201cNow what people are focused upon is choosing the next president and commander-in-chief.\u201d<br></p> <p>There was less direct criticism of the FBI than over the weekend.</p> <p>\u201cI am sure a lot of you may be asking what this email business is about and why in the world the FBI would decide to jump into an election without any evidence and it\u2019s a good a question,\u201d she said, to boos from a young crowd at Kent State University. \u201cBy all mean they should look at [the emails] and I am sure they will reach the same conclusion as when they looked at my emails: there is no case.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/oct/28/hillary-clinton-new-fbi-investigation-emails-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/59nxm\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2851168\"            data-video-name=\"Hillary Clinton reacts to new FBI investigation into her emails \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-5814032ae4b0219a00d39cc9\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/10/29/161028clintonemails_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/10/29/161028clintonemails.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/10/29/161028clintonemails_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/oct/28/hillary-clinton-new-fbi-investigation-emails-video\">Hillary Clinton reacts to new FBI investigation into her emails</a>.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>The Office of Special Counsel (OSC) declined to confirm to the Guardian whether it is investigating Comey for violating the Hatch Act.

  "<p>Liberal democracy and free market capitalism are under threat unless governments do more to tackle inequality, the US Treasury secretary has warned on a visit to the UK.</p> <p>Jack Lew <a href=\"http://uk.reuters.com/article/us-usa-treasury-lew-idUKKBN12V14Z\">called for Britain and the EU to ensure their economies remain \u201chighly integrated\u201d when Britain leaves the bloc</a>. He linked the vote for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum\">Brexit</a> to a more general rise in anxiety among people over how economies have evolved and the \u201clopsided\u201d nature of gains.</p> <p>With just over a week to go to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-elections-2016\">US presidential election</a> and against <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/30/democratic-senators-fbi-director-comey-clinton-emails-letter\">the backdrop of a tight race</a> between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, Lew told an audience in Oxford that populism was on the rise in many countries, calling it \u201ca challenge in so many parts of the world right now\u201d.</p> <p>Lew told the Oxford Union debating society: \u201cClearly it was an issue during the vote here and the decision whether or not to remain part of the European Union. It\u2019s clearly a part of the elections taking place in the United States this year. And if you look around in Europe, it\u2019s part of elections in so many countries in Europe.\u201d</p> <p>He said people\u2019s worries about their economic situation and economic prospects stemmed from many sources, including technological changes and globalisation.</p> <p>\u201cIn the United States \u2013 and I would hazard to say that this is true here in the vote for Brexit \u2013 there is some anxiety that flows from the way that the modern economy has evolved that is looking for a solution,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t people feel good? They are looking at an economy that increasingly seems lopsided,\u201d he added, saying many workers who paid tax felt wronged by what they saw as a business tax system where \u201con the international side you see a whole lot of international firms organising themselves to avoid paying in some cases any taxes\u201d. </p> <p>The onus was on government to reform the tax system, to increase investment in people so that they have the right education and skills for the modern workplace and to spend on infrastructure, according to Lew, who has served as Treasury secretary under the US president, Barack Obama, since 2013 after a stint as White House chief of staff.</p> <p>Without such moves, he predicted drastic long-term consequences. \u201cWe run the real risk that middle class, working class people say, \u2018I see the economy is growing but I don\u2019t see how I am going to benefit from it.\u2019 The danger, if that is where things drift to, is not just a short-term political one, I actually think it\u2019s a fundamental threat to liberal democracy and to free-market capitalism.\u201d</p> <p>Without referring specifically to Trump and his proposal to build a wall between the US and Mexico, Lew also addressed rising concerns among voters over immigration.</p> <p>\u201cWe have a history [in the US] of \u2018everyone should have an opportunity\u2019, and you look at the way the modern economy has evolved and people are beginning to question that proposition. </p> <p>\u201cWhen people question that proposition they lash out and historically one of the places people lash out is against outsiders. And I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a surprise to see that when people are anxious they lash out on issues like immigration. But the answer is not to put up borders that are impermeable \u2026 but it\u2019s also not to ignore the anxieties,\u201d Lew told his audience in Oxford.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/27/theres-comfort-gdp-figures-early-days-philip-hammond\">There's comfort in the GDP figures \u2013 but it's strictly early days</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Touching on a debate at the heart of the UK\u2019s referendum battle, when pro-Brexit MP Michael Gove remarked <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jun/09/michael-gove-experts-academics-vote\">\u201cpeople in this country have had enough of experts\u201d</a>, Lew also raised concerns about widespread scepticism over fact-based analysis. </p> <p>\u201cI fear that there is a growing distrust of authorities in general \u2026 The alternative to relying on expert analysis is making decisions more emotionally and that worries me,\u201d he said.</p> <p>He also championed US efforts to strike free trade deals but said politicians had a responsibility to convey to people how those trade deals were improving economic growth and living standards. Barriers, on the other hand, hindered economic growth, he added, in another apparent dig at Trump\u2019s protectionist policies.</p> <p>Lew also congratulated himself and his administration for progress made on shoring up financial stability since the global crisis. </p> <p>He said conversations with big banks in the week after the Brexit vote showed him that moves to build up capital and readiness to deal with shocks was paying dividends. But he stressed that the fact the global economy had been able to withstand shocks like the referendum should not lead to complacency.</p> <p> \u201cWe should never take our eye off the ball in terms of asking what is the threat of the future \u2026 False complacency is a thing to worry about,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Earlier on Monday, Lew met bank bosses in London. Following the discussions, his spokeswoman relayed his pleas for an orderly Brexit process. \u201cThe secretary reiterated that a transparent, smooth and cooperative process that results in a highly integrated economic relationship is in the best interests of Europe, the United States, and the global economy,\u201d she said.</p>",

He told MPs:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Through many conversations I, and my colleagues had, here and in Japan, it became clear that four reassurances were important to securing the investment for Britain.</p> <p>Three were about the automotive sector generally and one was about Brexit.</p> <p>These were</p> <p>1 - That we would continue our successful and longstanding programme of support for the competitiveness of the automotive sector, including Nissan.</p> <p>This support is available to firms for skills and training of the local workforce, for research and development and innovation \u2013 in line with EU and UK government rules.</p> <p>Since 2010 the government has invested \u00a3400m into the UK automotive sector in this way and we will continue to invest hundreds of millions more over the coming years.</p> <p>All proposals of course \u2013 from any company \u2013 must be underpinned by strong business cases and tested against published eligibility criteria. All proposals are subject to rigorous external scrutiny by the Independent Industrial Development Advisory Board and are reported on to parliament.</p> <p>2 - We would continue our work with the automotive sector, including Nissan at Sunderland, to ensure that more of the supply chain can locate in the UK, and in close proximity to the major manufacturing sites. In a previous post I established the local growth deals and the city deals which working with Local Enterprise Partnerships, have provided a way in which local councils, businesses and the government can upgrade the sites, especially sites brought into use from dereliction, and to provide the infrastructure for small and medium-sized businesses that can supply these major companies.

Clark has not published the letter the government gave to Nissan that helped secure the investment, but he spoke about the assurances in some detail yesterday in an interview that shed considerable light on how the government will approach Brexit.</p> <p>Over the summer, and at the Conservative conference, Theresa May suggested that her Brexit priority would be getting control of immigration, even if that meant limiting access to the single market. Clark\u2019s comments yesterday suggested that in recent weeks there may have been something of a rethink, because<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/30/nissan-eu-tariff-free-brexit-sunderland\"> he implied Downing Street want a free trade relationship similar to the single market and customs union.</a></p> <p>Clark\u2019s interview has already prompted much analysis.

This is a very important consideration when looking at the necessity for an inquiry or independent review and the public interest to be derived from holding one.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>She says policing has changed \u201cfundamentally\u201d since 1994, and she implies this makes it very unlikely that the Orgreave events could happen again.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There have been very significant changes in the oversight of policing since 1984, at every level, including major reforms to criminal procedure, changes to public order policing and practice, stronger external scrutiny and greater local accountability.</p> <p>The operational delivery and practice of public order policing has moved on a great deal from the arrangements in 1984, and tactics have now been reviewed and altered several times both by the police and the courts.</p> <p>Protections which were singularly lacking at the time of Orgreave now exist with the introduction in the mid-80s of the Police &amp; Criminal Evidence Act which has vastly improved the way police investigations and powers operate.</p> <p>The creation of the Crown Prosecution Service in 1986, with the introduction of independent CPS prosecutors, fundamentally altered the prosecution of offences. It ended the existence of ad hoc prosecution arrangements across the country whereby a mixture of police prosecutors and private firms of solicitors - hired by the police and acting for and on the instruction of the police \u2013 conducted prosecutions.</p> <p>With regards to the external scrutiny of complaints against the police, this was strengthened by the creation, in 1985, of the Police Complaints Authority which was replaced in 2004 by the more effective Independent Police Complaints Commission and in turn will be replaced by the Office for Police Conduct in 2017. The exemplary standards of behaviour expected of everyone who works in policing were reinforced by the introduction of a statutory Code of Ethics, laid before this House in 2014.</p> <p>Lastly, the introduction of directly elected Police and Crime Commissioners in 2012 has given the public a voice in shaping their local policing priorities and improved the accountability of police leadership.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>She says she is not convinced that a proper investigation into Orgreave at the time would have prevented the Hillsborough tragedy.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The campaigners say that had the consequences of the events at Orgreave been addressed properly at the time, the tragic events at Hillsborough would never have happened five years later.

On a walk around Richmond town centre with the Lib Dem candidate, Sarah Olney<strong>,</strong> <strong> Nick Clegg</strong>, the latest big name brought in to boost the campaign, was keen to stress the temporary Ukip leader\u2019s support for Goldsmith to constituents who stopped to chat. He said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>For all those people who were originally attracted to Zac Goldsmith as a modern, idealist, attractive, faintly glamorous ... minor royal, for those people, if you look back to his demeanour (when he was first elected), I think many people will be gobsmacked that he\u2019s now Nigel Farage\u2019s favoured candidate.</p> </blockquote> <p>The Lib Dems projected an aura of confidence about their chances with Olney declaring her chances of winning at 10/10. She said it could not be a referendum on Heathrow as there was no candidate in favour of a third runway while Clegg said Goldsmith had been unable to stop the government taking the Heathrow decision when a Tory so would be even less influential as an independent. He recalled:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>All the hours and hours I spoke to David Cameron and George Osborne (about Heathrow)... Goldsmith\u2019s name never came up.

He was one of Nigel Farage\u2019s chief advisers in the run-up to the 2015 and was credited/blamed for encouraging Farage to adopt increasingly hard right positions, especially on immigration. When he announced his leadership bid he seemed an unlikely candidate, partly because of his age (30) but more because <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/ukip-leadership-frontrunner-raheem-kassam-nicola-sturgeon-twitter-apology_uk_5813943de4b0672ea688ddc0\">his Twitter feed is littered with offensive comments that make Donald Trump sound diplomatic, </a>but he campaigned energetically, and was good at generating publicity.

This was a very difficult decision, and I want to thank everyone who supported me in the process.</p> <p>It is a decision I have not taken lightly, but following meetings this weekend I realised the path to victory is too narrow. <strong>I would encourage my supporters to back Peter Whittle, who I think would make a fantastic leader of the party.</strong></p> <p>On their own, the following issues would not have caused me to take this decision, but taken together, the following reasons created an impossible route forward for me: </p> <p><strong>1. The top of the party is treating this like a coronation:</strong> I am not satisfied about the integrity of the process, and having put a number of complaints in to the party chairman, I was disappointed that incidents whereby Members of the European Parliament are using party databases to effectively campaign against me \u2013 ostensibly against the rules \u2013 were not challenged.</p> <p><strong>2. Disgraceful treatment by the media: </strong>I am tough and I can take it, but when<em>Times</em> journalists show up at my elderly parents\u2019 house at dusk, intimidating them, I draw the line. Billy Kenber at the <em>Times</em> has a lot to answer for and I will be pursuing a harassment complaint further.</p> <p><strong>3. Fundraising:</strong> While we raised enough for our deposit, and got over 200 assentors to my nomination, we could not raise enough for this to be more than a digital campaign run from SW1, and to not feature at events all around the country would have made me a hypocrite, given how much I criticise the establishment for ignoring the country.</p> <p>Over the next few weeks I will be providing a statement of accounts for all my donors, and in-keeping with my money pledge on my website, I will be giving them the choice as to what happens with the remainder of the money they donated. I will suggest we either: donate to the Royal British Legion or Help for Heroes, donate to the party, donate to Peter Whittle\u2019s campaign. Those who want refunds are welcome to contact me.</p> <p>I wish the UK Independence Party and whoever its new leader is all the best in ensuring Brexit happens, and in the upcoming electoral tests next year. I remain commited to the causes of the UK Independence Party, but sadly, at this campaign, it was a bridge too far for us.</p> <p>I will be continuing at my job as Editor in Chief of Breitbart London, returning to the United States this week to cover the last leg of the presidential elections.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-10-31T09:59:30.064Z\">at 9.59am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-58171022e4b0219a00d3a8b9\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-31T09:36:25.031Z\">9.36am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>NHS Providers,</strong> a group representing hospitals, has put out <a href=\"https://www.nhsproviders.org/news-blogs/news/time-has-come-for-a-new-financial-settlement-for-the-nhs-and-social-care\">a statement backing what the MPs from the health committee are saying. </a>This is from Chris Hopson, its chief executive.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We share the health committee\u2019s concerns that short term pressures, combined with cuts to public health, social care and capital funding, risk overwhelming the NHS\u2019 ability to provide the quality of care we all want when funding increases significantly tail off from 2017/18 onwards.

She told the programme.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Well, it\u2019s only technically correct if you\u2019re looking at spending on NHS England and you add an extra year to the spending review and you also take account of the switch from other budgets that we would normally think of as health spending. So, for example, you can only arrive at the \u00a310bn by shifting money from public health budgets and from health education and training, and also by changing the date at which you calculate real terms increases. So, yes, you can see how they have arrived at the figure. But the real figure we feel should be quoted at \u00a34.5bn which is considerably less ... That\u2019s over the period of the spending review and that\u2019s the period that we usually talk about increases in spending. We wouldn\u2019t normally, say for other government departments, just add an extra year.</p> </blockquote> <p>She also rejected the claim that Simon Stevens, NHS England\u2019s chief executive, has said that the government has given him what he wants. In fact, health spending is due to fall on a per head basis towards the end of this parliament, she said.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>[Stevens] was very clear when he came before our committee during our inquiry that if you look at the middle years, next year and the year after, we are going to be seeing a far more constrained situation, and certainly not what he asked for. So, certainly, for 2018-19 we will be seeing a per capita fall in funding for the NHS at a time when our demographics [are changing], the increase in older people, a 21% increase in the number of people over 65 in the last decade up to 2015.</p> </blockquote> <p>Here is a clip from Wollaston\u2019s interview.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/BBCr4today/status/792994381645148160\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">&#39;Government wrong on NHS spending&#39; - <a href=\"https://twitter.com/sarahwollaston\">@sarahwollaston</a> says actual figure \u00a34.5bn rather than \u00a310bn they have claimed <a href=\"https://t.co/BfALjw4bMg\">https://t.co/BfALjw4bMg</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/BVT6qNe3F2\">pic.twitter.com/BVT6qNe3F2</a></p>&mdash; BBC Radio 4 Today (@BBCr4today) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BBCr4today/status/792994381645148160\">October 31, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>I will report more on this if the story moves on.</p> <p>Otherwise, it\u2019s a patchy day.

  "<p>The most striking thing about the Washington Post/ABC <a href=\"http://www.langerresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/1184a92016ElectionTrackingNo9.pdf\">poll</a> released on Monday is not how close Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump are in popularity, it\u2019s how close they are in unpopularity. Such deep dislike could affect Americans\u2019 willingness to vote \u2013 and that\u2019s all the more problematic for Clinton\u2019s campaign given that the latest development in her <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/30/hillary-clinton-donald-trump-fbi-director-comey-emails\">email scandal</a> could dent her popularity yet further. </p> <p>Some <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/01/upshot/get-ready-for-another-swing-in-the-polls-but-not-necessarily-a-shift-in-the-race.html?rref=collection%2Fsectioncollection%2Fupshot&amp;action=click&amp;contentCollection=upshot&amp;region=rank&amp;module=package&amp;version=highlights&amp;contentPlacement=1&amp;pgtype=sectionfront&amp;_r=0\">analysts</a> claim that any such dip will be temporary, but with just eight days left until most of the US votes, a short-lived decline would need to be very short. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/18/us-election-polls-nevada-north-carolina-ohio-trump-clinton\">Clinton and Trump virtually tied in Nevada, North Carolina and Ohio polls</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Monday\u2019s poll showed that the Democratic candidate is seen unfavorably by 60% of likely voters while her Republican opponent is viewed unfavorably by 58%.

Neither finding ended their tenures. Castro remains in his post and Sebelius served for two more years before stepping down. </p> <p>The likely Hatch Act investigation adds to a swarm of headaches for Comey, who awoke on Monday to repudiation from former allies.</p> <p>Eric Holder, the former attorney general who worked beside Comey at the beginning of his time as FBI director, wrote a <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/eric-holder-james-comey-is-a-good-man-but-he-made-a-serious-mistake/2016/10/30/08e7208e-9f07-11e6-8832-23a007c77bb4_story.html?utm_term=.f6452161d55a\">public rebuke in the Washington Post</a>, warning that Comey had jeopardized \u201cpublic trust in both the Justice Department and the FBI\u201d. </p> <p>Holder criticized Comey for high-profile interventions in the election, first through his July press conference <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/05/fbi-no-charges-hillary-clinton-email-investigation\">recommending against indicting Clinton</a>, and now through casting \u201cpublic suspicion\u201d on her. </p> <p>\u201cIt is incumbent upon him \u2013 or the leadership of the department \u2013 to dispel the uncertainty he has created before Election Day,\u201d Holder wrote. </p> <p>Holder also joined nearly 100 former federal prosecutors in blasting Comey for inviting \u201cconsiderable, uninformed public speculation\u201d about the Clinton case before establishing, by the FBI director\u2019s admission, investigative relevance.

Over the weekend, justice department officials began leaking that the US attorney general, Loretta Lynch, had advised Comey against going public with the potential connection. </p> <p>The Clinton campaign and the Democratic establishment have unloaded on Comey, months after praising him for declining an indictment recommendation. Four powerful senators, all of whom are likely to become committee chairs should the Democrats win the chamber next week, have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/30/democratic-senators-fbi-director-comey-clinton-emails-letter\">demanded</a> a briefing from Comey on the Clinton saga by the end of Monday, though it is unclear if the director will provide one. The Senate\u2019s top Democrat, Harry Reid, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/30/hillary-clinton-donald-trump-fbi-director-comey-emails\">openly accused</a> Comey of breaking the law to help elect Donald Trump. </p> <p>The FBI learned of a potential connection to the Clinton server weeks ago, after opening an investigation into Weiner allegedly sending messages of a sexual nature <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/22/anthony-weiner-under-investigation-nypd\">to an underage girl</a>. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/30/hillary-clinton-lose-election-fbi-email-investigation\">Will Hillary Clinton lose the US election because of the FBI email investigation?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Comey\u2019s allies contend he is caught in an impossible position.

  "<p>Donald Trump\u2019s self-inflicted wounds and propensity for public meltdowns had pushed the public-opinion needle toward Hillary Clinton, according to recent polls. That <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/30/hillary-clinton-lose-election-fbi-email-investigation\">may have changed a little</a> in the aftermath of the FBI\u2019s renewing of its email probe last week. But even so, the fears of many voters that a Donald Trump presidency might become a reality have abated. </p> <p>Those fears are not unfounded. Trump\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/13/donald-trump-assault-allegations-women-jill-harth\">failings as a candidate and a person</a> are manifest, and he would be in a position to wreak considerable havoc if elected. That\u2019s especially true at the agency level, with the judiciary and in other arenas where the president can wield executive power. The wildcard aspect of his personality poses risks that can\u2019t be predicted, nor can anyone know the degree to which congress would be inclined to obstruct or approve his most damaging initiatives.</p> <p>What has been lost in the salacious and obsessive media coverage of the Republican nominee\u2019s outrageous behavior, bigoted remarks and appeal to the worst instincts of the electorate, however, is a critical examination of what a Clinton administration will mean for the nation. The FBI probe, information on tangled interests within the Clinton Foundation, evidence of influence peddling and Wikileaks revelations detailing manipulation of media and the democratic process, signal a plutocratic style of governance that is all too familiar and increasingly dominant at the federal level.</p> <p>The content of what has been revealed in these leaks, as well as her lengthy track record in government and policy statements as a candidate yield an inescapable conclusion: Hillary Clinton represents the entrenched interests of the status quo. Her election will expand the excesses of global interventionism and corporate welfare that have characterized US policies for several decades \u2013 at tremendous, almost incalculable cost both domestically and internationally.</p> <p>During the campaign, Clinton has engaged in the type of saber-rattling one expects of presidential candidates, especially Democrats who seek to counter the party\u2019s image as weak on defense. She has agitated against Russian President Putin on Ukraine and Syria, and reiterated her belief in \u201cthe responsibility to protect,\u201d the rationale used to selectively promote the elitist economic agenda that she has so faithfully pursued over the years \u2013 even as the exercise of that dubious mission has resulted in widespread devastation in the Middle East, South America and elsewhere. A muddled and hypocritical foreign policy has created bitter enemies across the globe and angered US allies, yet Clinton supports the rudderless and demonstrably ineffective efforts of President Obama without a hint of irony.</p> <p>The ill-advised and tragic wars in Iraq and Afghanistan continue to extract a heavy toll, and though opposition to those wars helped propel Barack Obama into office, the focus on ending them and preventing new ones has been blurred by the government\u2019s ongoing crusade, the so-called War on Terror. In reality little more than an extension of other armed conflicts the US has waged around the world, the deadly manifestations of the War on Terror have largely been met with silence or, depressingly, approval from much of what passes for the progressive movement. Sadly, Donald Trump\u2019s self destruction has provided a smoke screen for those on the left and the more moderate elements on the right who might ordinarily question Clinton\u2019s unabashed cheerleading for a continuation of these modified Cold-War strategies. </p> <p>Beyond the battlefield, Clinton\u2019s historical enthusiasm for \u201cfree\u201d but not fair trade \u2013 even while waffling on the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/20/trump-clinton-free-trade-policies-tpp\">TPP</a> \u2013 gives credence to the belief that she will sacrifice the welfare of workers here and abroad for the unfettered profits of the business elites whom she has always served. In the face of documented inhumane labor practices and other related human rights abuses around the world, the Obama administration and those preceding it have steadfastly refused to demand changes as conditions of honoring trade agreements. As Secretary of State, Clinton had an opportunity to honor and promote the rights of working people around the world but failed to do so. Why would anyone expect her to change now? </p> <p>The inflammatory rhetoric and actions of both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump stand in sharp contrast to the platform and orientation of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/05/green-party-convention-jill-stein-bernie-or-bust-clinton\">Green party</a>, which offers the only alternative in this election that will move decisively to draw down US military interventions abroad and reduce the military budget to a sane level while redirecting increasingly scarce resources to rebuild the frayed social safety net and help those most in need here at home. </p> <p>This election is about far more than our collective distaste for a hyper-inflated ego, and trading the noxious buffoonery and personal insults of Trump for the clear and present danger of Clinton\u2019s corporatist logic is no trade-off at all. <br><br></p>",

During that time, 176 of the hospitalized children died.</p> <p>The study found that over 15 years, as the popularity and prescribing of opioids increased, the number of children who were accidentally poisoned or adolescents who attempted to kill themselves also increased.</p> <p>The most dramatic rise in poisonings was among the youngest children. Toddlers between one and four years old had more than twice the rate of poisonings from painkillers in 2012 as they did in 1997. On a population level, researchers estimated that meant 2.6 of every 100,000 toddlers would be poisoned by opioids, from less than one in 1997.</p> <p>Most poisonings were accidental \u2013 probably from toddlers believing the pills were candy.</p> <p>Among teens, the rise was also dramatic but was more likely to indicate attempts at intentional self-harm. Overdoses among adolescents from 15 to 19 years old rose by an estimated 176%, the population of teens hospitalized from opioid poisoning rising from 3.6 per 100,000 in 1997 to 10.1. </p> <p>In the same age group, heroin overdoses increased by 161%. Poisoning from opioid abuse treatment soared \u2013 methadone overdoses increased by 950%. </p> <p>In that time, the profile of children hospitalized for opioids also changed, growing significantly whiter and more male. </p> <p>In 1997, researchers found that 34.7% of hospitalizations were of boys. That grew to 47.4%. The children were predominantly white, 73.5%, and the proportion who were on Medicaid or government health insurance for low-income families increased from 24.1% to 44% in 2012.</p> <p>The new work, published in the <a href=\"http://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics\">Journal of the American Medical Association Pediatrics</a>, adds to research that showed increases in overdose among children.

Nasrallah has backed Aoun for more than two years , meeting regularly to discuss developments in Lebanon and Syria, where Hezbollah is heavily engaged in a battle to support the Syrian leader.</p> <p>Aoun\u2019s run towards Monday\u2019s parliamentary vote began on 6 February 2006, when he and Nasrallah signed a pact based on him eventually becoming president. Aoun\u2019s political bloc, which accounts for roughly half of Lebanon\u2019s Christian population, aligned its strategic interests with Hezbollah, and united against the political weight of Hariri\u2019s Sunni-dominated Future bloc.</p> <p>Saudi Arabia, meanwhile, has been in steady retreat from Lebanon. It withdrew its ambassador in September and cancelled funding for the Lebanese military. Before Monday\u2019s vote, Riyadh sent a senior envoy to consult Lebanese officials in what was seen as a tacit approval of the pivot to Aoun, as well as an increasing disengagement from Lebanese affairs.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Though largely ceremonial in Lebanon, the president appoints the cabinet and influences foreign policy. The Lebanese constitution stipulates that the president must be a Maronite, the prime minister a Sunni Muslim and the speaker of the parliament a Shia Muslim.<br></p> <p>Aoun has remained a contentious figure in Lebanon since the civil war, when he served as military commander and stood against the Syrian occupation. </p> <p>He served briefly as prime minister of one of the two rival governments established near the war\u2019s end.

However, his position shifted after he returned to Lebanon, where he became a powerful political presence. He soon won the patronage of Iran, setting his sights on the country\u2019s highest office and tailoring his message to suit Tehran.</p>",
  "<h2>FBI obtains warrant to search Clinton aide\u2019s laptop</h2> <p>The FBI has obtained a warrant to investigate emails found on a laptop used by Clinton aide Huma Abedin, as part of its investigation into the Democratic presidential candidate\u2019s use of a private email server while serving as secretary of state. The move came as the Senate minority leader, Harry Reid, said the FBI director, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/30/james-comey-fbi-director-hillary-clinton-email\">James Comey</a>, may have broken the Hatch Act, which bars federal officials from using their official authority to influence an election, by his decision to send a letter to Republican congressional committee chairs on Friday announcing the new development. That showed \u201cclear intent to aid one political party over another\u201d, Reid said, adding a claim that Comey was not releasing information linking the Trump campaign to Russia. Reports said FBI investigators had known for weeks they might find pertinent emails on Abedin\u2019s device, which was shared with her estranged husband Anthony Weiner, who is under investigation over alleged illicit texts to a minor. Clinton called on Comey to \u201cput it all out on the table\u201d; Donald Trump said the email scandal was \u201cworse than Watergate\u201d. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/30/hillary-clinton-donald-trump-fbi-director-comey-emails\">Clinton emails inquiry: FBI gets warrant as Comey told he may have broken law</a></p> <h2>Will Hillary Clinton lose?<br></h2> <p>The Democrat is losing support just as the Republican is experiencing a resurgence. While Clinton still stands to win, a shift in sentiment appears to have begun with the WikiLeaks release of emails that showed how much even Clinton aides worried about blurred boundaries between business, charitable and political interests. In an election that many describe as an unpopularity contest, it may not take much more to swing the mood of independents.

In Russia, warm words about Putin from Trump and a slightly more positive tone of television coverage relating to the real estate tycoon have both left their mark. A Russian poll found that 22% of Russians had a positive opinion of Trump, compared with just 8% for Clinton. In Mexico, Trump\u2019s rise has stirred unease and indignation. Iranians have been amused by the bitter rivalry been Clinton and Trump.

  "<p>Obviously it\u2019s not a competition, but cities are winning. Every year, more people move to cities and they generate more of the world\u2019s prosperity. And as a result, they\u2019ve become wildly unpopular in some quarters.</p> <p>Conservative politicians in the US jeer at \u201cNew York values\u201d, while the \u201cmetropolitan elite\u201d are now held responsible for all of Britain\u2019s failings. A bogus moral superiority, fixation with cultural authenticity and a stifling national identity have become the abiding principles for all those who look on at the world\u2019s economic and creative powerhouses with resentment and baffled fury.</p> <p>But this is nonsense. New York values, just like those of other world cities, are the values of optimism, diversity and tenacity we should all aspire to, and cities at their best are an expression of humans at their best. Here are just 10 of the many reasons why \u2026</p> <p><strong>1 For their tolerance.</strong> A source of enduring comfort about humans is that the more often different peoples and cultures bump up against one another, the more they end up liking one another. In the year of Brexit and Trump, we should remind ourselves that the racism and bigotry that infects so much of national politics largely melts away at the city level. Cities have prospered because in them people get on together and overcome their hang-ups about ethnicity, faith, gender and sexuality. Of course, cities have social problems, income inequality and cultural fault lines, but whatever the outcome of the presidential election, America\u2019s metropolitan areas will firmly reject Trump, just as the UK\u2019s large cities rejected Brexit.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4364392ac1916bb02ef7fb538504c278b0174a66\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4364392ac1916bb02ef7fb538504c278b0174a66/0_0_2992_1972/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Participants staged a die-in outside Trump Tower in memory of all the lives taken by homophobia.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"659\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Participants staged a die-in outside Trump Tower in memory of all the lives taken by homophobia.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: SIPA/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>2 Because they are well regulated \u2026</strong> Cities pioneered planning and the social and economic rules of conduct that make civilisation possible. Ever since the first great cities of antiquity, urban administrators have had to devise policies for them to function, and these have expanded as cities have grown in size and complexity. As a consequence, cities today are managed through a web of regulations, restrictions, prohibitions and directives. Largely impenetrable and often infuriating, it is these rules that allow millions of us to live together in such harmony.<br></p> <p><strong>3 \u2026 although also a little bit lawless.</strong> The Dark Web might now be a thing, but city centres are still the place to go for recreational drugs, sexual misadventures, open-all-hours drinking dens, street food which doesn\u2019t conform to health standards, and nightclubs which breach acceptable noise guidelines.<br></p> <p><strong>4 Because you get to interact with nature.</strong> Barely anyone who lives in the countryside ever actually experiences the countryside. Industrial agriculture means that fields are now fenced off, drenched in pesticide and viewed as a blur from the motorway. In cities, however, people flock to public parks and nature reserves, visit botanical gardens, swim in ponds and take riverside walks, or simply buy fresh produce from farmers\u2019 markets. Not many cities can match Vienna, which has a whopping <a href=\"http://citiscope.org/story/2016/vienna-ranks-high-almost-every-urban-quality-life-list-heres-why\">120 square metres of green space per resident</a>, but even in New York there are <a href=\"http://www.milliontreesnyc.org/html/about/urban_forest_facts.shtml\">5 million trees</a>. <br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"60756b8de2650eaedcb454527da077e005138619\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/60756b8de2650eaedcb454527da077e005138619/0_478_7360_4415/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Vienna, 120 metres of green space per capita.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Vienna has 120 square metres of green space per capita.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>5 Because immigrants live in them.</strong> Cities have always attracted the planet\u2019s brightest and best, in other words: immigrants. Despite the endless studies showing this; despite all of <a href=\"http://nfap.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Immigrants-and-Nobel-Prizes.NFAP-Policy-Brief.October-2016.pdf\">America\u2019s 2016 Nobel Prize winners</a> (with the honourable exception of Bob Dylan) being immigrants, national politicians have become increasingly hysterical on the issue. But the world\u2019s leading cities are going the other way. The British government wishes to audit foreign workers, but London is openly welcoming them; Donald Trump wants to build a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/aug/31/trump-mexico-border-wall-video\">wall across the Mexican border</a>, but just two hours away in Los Angeles, <a href=\"http://time.com/3678320/antonio-villaraigosa-senate/\">Antonio Villaraigosa</a>, the son of a Mexican immigrant, recently completed two terms as its mayor.</p> <p><strong>6 Because all the artists live there.</strong> In Plato\u2019s ideal city, there would be <a href=\"http://www.iep.utm.edu/republic/\">no artists or poets</a>. Happily, every single city since then, with the possible exception of John Calvin\u2019s Geneva, has ignored this advice. From the impressionists in 1870s Paris to the abstract expressionists of 1950s New York and <a href=\"http://www.tate.org.uk/learn/online-resources/glossary/y/young-british-artists\">Young British Artists</a> of 1990s London, it is cities where all the great art scenes have flourished. And where there are art scenes, there is also innovation, new ideas, a successful night time economy and a glimpse of the future. To live in a city of artists is to live in the world\u2019s cockpit.<br></p> <p><strong>7 Because cities make you healthier.</strong> No one should ignore issues of air quality and inequality, but the fact remains that people in cities live healthier lives.

But it is cities that actually make the institutions that form the bedrock of our heritage, culture and public life. The world\u2019s great museums, universities, galleries and libraries are not just found in cities \u2013 they were founded by them. Through citizens subscriptions, local philanthropy and municipal foresight, the treasures of the world are collected, studied, conserved and made available for everyone to enjoy.<br></p> <p><strong>9 Because of their strong communities.</strong> Cities are often associated with anonymity but they are better characterised by their strong sense of community. It is in cities \u2013 particularly European ones with narrow roads, public spaces, local schools and high-density housing \u2013 that people come together. By contrast, the modern countryside can be deeply isolating; a place where people drive their children to school, shop in retail parks and spend their evenings watching satellite television. If the world really is undergoing an epidemic of loneliness, then the cure will be found in cities.<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/oct/31/why-i-hate-living-in-cities-dirty-dull-no-free-toilets\">Dirty, dull \u2013 and hardly any free toilets.

In the UK, London makes up 14% of the national population and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/jul/07/london-top-taxpaying-city-uk-report\">almost 30% of its tax base</a>, with Londoners thought to be making a net contribution to the Treasury of approximately \u00a32,000 a year. What\u2019s amazing about this is that the response of rural populations is to heap scorn on metropolitan liberals, inflict reactionary governments on them, and vote to destroy their economic wellbeing. And yet, cities still continue to subsidise farms, finance national infrastructure and pay for public services. If cities are judged not just for what they do for their citizens but what they do for everybody, then surely it is all of us who should love them.<br></p> <p><em>Tom Campbell is the author of <a href=\"http://www.bloomsbury.com/uk/the-planner-9781408818268/\">The Planner</a>, published by Bloomsbury Circus. </em><em>To order this novel for \u00a310.39 (RRP \u00a312.99) go to <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/planner.html\">bookshop.theguardian.com</a></em></p> <p><em>Follow Guardian Cities on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/guardiancities\">Twitter</a> and <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/guardiancities\">Facebook</a> and join the discussion</em></p>",
  "<p>A week ago, the US election looked to be over. Hillary Clinton was riding so high in the polls after a disastrous series of gaffes by Donald Trump that few could conceive of a Republican path to victory on 8 November. Friday\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/30/hillary-clinton-donald-trump-fbi-director-comey-emails\">shock intervention by the FBI</a> may not be enough to change that outcome on its own, but it has certainly set political imaginations running wild.<br></p> <p>The worry for Democrats is that fresh inquiries regarding Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server while secretary of state come at a difficult time. Not only is it hard to prove a negative and re-establish her innocence with barely a week to go until the election, but the letter to congressional officials from director James Comey capped a tricky run of news that was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/28/hillary-clinton-lead-donald-trump-polls\">already making a sizable dent in her polling lead</a>.</p> <p>Momentum for Trump began to recover first thanks to another set of emails, the contents of which perhaps explain why the Clintons risked so much to try to retain control of her electronic communications in the first place. Released by WikiLeaks, a factor that US intelligence agencies have blamed on Russian hackers, these emails to and from campaign chairman John Podesta have been trickling out for weeks, with mostly embarrassing rather than damaging content.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/31/hillary-clinton-latest-emails-explained\">Hillary Clinton's email controversy explained: what we know so far</a> </p> </aside>  <p>That changed on Wednesday with the release of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/27/wikileaks-bill-clinton-foundation-emails\">report</a> that appeared to confirm just how much the Clinton family has blurred the boundaries between its business, charitable and political interests. Though almost all of the new information related to Bill rather than Hillary, it gave Trump supporters fresh ammunition at a moment when they were desperate to shift attention from their candidate\u2019s own scandals over <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/02/donald-trump-income-tax-returns-published\">taxes</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/28/temple-taggart-donald-trump-gloria-allred-lawsuit\">alleged inappropriate behaviour towards women</a>.</p> <p>In an election that many pollsters describe as an unpopularity contest, it does not take much to swing the mood of independent voters.

  "<h2>\u2018We must remember the richness immigrants have brought\u2019<br></h2> <ul> <li>Monica, 51, Vermont, voting for <strong>Hillary Clinton</strong></li> </ul> <p>I live in a tiny rural town in Vermont. The daughter of Peruvian immigrants who overstayed visas back when it took just a few months to get a green card; I\u2019ve worked hard to feel like I belong anywhere. I found my way to Vermont as a young adult and no other place feels like home. I am voting for Hilary Clinton, although my preference would have been Bernie Sanders. Hillary\u2019s approach seems to be informed by her years of experience and that\u2019s what I want in a president \u2013 someone who is intelligent and informed about both policy and process. A Trump presidency would be a \u201cdisaster\u201d as he\u2019s so fond of saying. I get no sense that he has any knowledge of, or worse, the desire to learn about, the issues at all. That\u2019s truly frightening. Trump would further divide our nation \u2013 his rhetoric alone has deepened existing divides. We must remember the richness immigrants have brought to our country. The first priority of the next president must be to unify us, as nothing can be accomplished in the current atmosphere. This has been the ugliest campaign I have witnessed in my 51 years. Trump\u2019s campaign has been embarrassing and dangerous and it will take a while for the nation to recover. One good thing that has come of this cycle is that it has woken people up from apathy and encouraged them to make their voices heard at the ballot box \u2013 for better or worse.</p> <h2>\u2018We have become a politically correct society to our detriment\u2019<br tabindex=\"-1\"></h2> <ul> <li>Anne-Marie, 69, New Jersey, voting for <strong>Donald Trump</strong></li> </ul> <p>Born in 1946, the first year of the \u201cbaby boom\u201d, I am a second-generation American. I earned my BA, MEd and MA in, respectively, history, teaching and journalism. Most of my working life was in publishing. I have been alone since my divorce some 40 years ago. My views do not fit any one party, and my voting history is mixed. I have voted for Democrats and Republicans, and I threw away a vote on Ralph Nader in 2000 because I could not vote for either of the main candidates. I will vote for Donald Trump. He might not change this country \u2013 Congress can obstruct a president, as it has been doing since 2008 \u2013 but if he could, it would be in directions I support: defeating Isis, strict(er) immigration, encouraging businesses to stay or return here, a much better relationship with Russia, and the disestablishment of the politically correct society we have, to our detriment, become. A president\u2019s priorities should be protecting the American land and people, and promoting the general welfare \u2013 here, stateside. I have found the campaign absolutely horrid. The only good thing about election day is that it ends the campaign. </p> <h2>\u2018Trump\u2019s misogyny, racism and general ignorance astound me\u2019<br tabindex=\"-1\"></h2> <ul> <li>Wendy, 63, California, voting for <strong>Hillary Clinton</strong><br></li> </ul> <p>I\u2019m 63 years old, a Democrat, and a retired registered nurse. My husband of 36 years is a retired teacher. We live in Panorama City, a working-class suburb in the San Fernando Valley. This election is the worst I\u2019ve ever seen, and I lived through Watergate and the Vietnam war. Donald Trump\u2019s misogyny, racism and general ignorance astound me. I\u2019m worried that Russia\u2019s attempt to influence the outcome of this election in Trump\u2019s favor might yet succeed. I don\u2019t know who I\u2019m angrier at \u2013 Donald Trump for being a compulsive liar \u2013 or the press for letting him get away with it. Trump\u2019s supporters chanting \u201cLock her up\u201d are the worst. Hillary Clinton is not a criminal! We face serious problems with no easy solutions. Over 20% of our children live in poverty. Climate change is real. We have too many guns and not enough good jobs. Our son is unemployed \u2013 I don\u2019t want Obamacare repealed \u2013 I want it fixed. Hillary has a plan for that. Hillary cares about people, about children and families. She\u2019s a feminist who will appoint supreme court justices who will stand up for women\u2019s rights. Especially if the Democrats take back the Senate, she can get things done. Even Trump conceded that she\u2019s a fighter. This is a historic election and, yeah, I\u2019m excited about it. I didn\u2019t think a woman president would happen in my lifetime. On November 8th, I hope we will elect Hillary Clinton as the first woman president of the United States.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d88c255f6b9784ac704bd2d08318a47aa0ec741a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d88c255f6b9784ac704bd2d08318a47aa0ec741a/0_0_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pumpkin portraits of Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump by Disney artist Joseph Yakovetic, on Hollywood Blvd, 27 October 2016.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pumpkin portraits of Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump by Disney artist Joseph Yakovetic, on Hollywood Blvd, 27 October 2016.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Livingston/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>\u2018I will remain apprehensive until she is president-elect\u2019</h2> <ul> <li>Sarah, 28, Florida, voting for <strong>Hillary Clinton</strong><br></li> </ul> <p>I\u2019m a third-year medical student living in Brooklyn, NY, voting by mail as a Florida resident. My vote this year is unequivocally going to Hillary Clinton. There is a vocal proportion of Clinton voters who make no secret of their reluctant support, whether grudging Bernie Sanders advocates, or voters of any persuasion who oppose Donald Trump only marginally more than they do Clinton. Despite having backed Sanders myself, I take a less noncommittal position: Clinton, far from being the \u201clesser of two evils\u201d, is a remarkably qualified, intelligent candidate whose views largely mirror my own, a stark contrast to the unsympathetic view of her character that is frustratingly widespread. Her proposed policies demonstrate forward thinking that would enable the United States to stand upright as a respected model among nations. I anticipate with hope the improvement of the Affordable Care Act to make healthcare universally affordable, the push to end gun violence, the increase in police accountability, the reform of our prison system, and a social promotion that advances race relations, LGBT rights and gender equity. None of these changes can be expected under the influence of Donald Trump, who sees the truth as tractable, promotes his sexism and narcissism as assets, and in the end, is excessively volatile and unprincipled. It\u2019s embarrassing that Clinton, whose political competence is nigh unparalleled, holds only an uncertain majority over his farcical campaign. While the current poll aggregates are tentatively reassuring, I will remain apprehensive until she is confirmed as president-elect after election day.</p> <h2>\u2018Washington is offering no choice besides disaster\u2019<br></h2> <ul> <li>Geno, 37, Pennsylvania, voting for <strong>Jill Stein</strong></li> </ul> <p>I\u2019m in that middle class suffering from decades of neoliberalism \u2013 involuntarily in debt, in a dead-end job because of health coverage and few options. My household can eat and pay bills most of the time, so we\u2019re luckier than some, but doing much more is a rare treat. The nation needs living wages, progressive taxation, universal healthcare, renewable energy, an end to US aggression, and investment in our future instead of the already-rich. Society should support people over profit. The most wretched excuse for a campaign in our lifetimes has only promised the opposite. The major parties offer a deranged rightwing sociopath provoking global war or a reality-TV buffoon with no actual policy, both of them hopelessly corrupt and staggeringly incompetent. Reinforcing Bush-Obama corporatism isn\u2019t an option. Libertarianism is suicidally shortsighted. We need a progressive administration that\u2019ll keep the grassroots engaged in fighting for constructive, sustainable goals. That\u2019s why I\u2019m voting Jill Stein. It\u2019s already too late to prevent a president Clinton; that\u2019s what the establishment wants and that\u2019s what it\u2019ll get. Of course Trump never had a chance \u2013 he\u2019s only there to scare us towards Hillary. No thanks. I won\u2019t throw my vote away on a felon and war criminal. I\u2019d rather affirm policies I actually support. The alternative is staying home, but I\u2019d rather send a message rejecting business as usual (hopefully amplified a little in a swing state). Washington is offering no choice besides disaster. Our first duty is to refuse to be complicit or legitimize it.</p> <h2>\u2018I\u2019m not so much with her as I am against the fascist Donald Trump\u2019<br tabindex=\"-1\"></h2> <ul> <li>Chris, 50, New York, voting for <strong>Hillary Clinton</strong><br></li> </ul> <p>My name is Christopher; I am a gay African American illustrator and comic book artist living in New York City with my husband who is an Episcopal seminarian. As a Bernie Sanders supporter, allow me to make my position crystal clear: I\u2019m not so much with her as I am against the fascist, racist and misogynist Donald Trump. I would love to have another choice, but unfortunately, with Jill Stein polling even worse than Gary Johnson I\u2019m forced to be pragmatic and vote for Hillary Clinton. Liberal supreme court nominations; banking, healthcare, student loan and immigration reform; increasing living wages, honest discussions of the true effects of mechanization of labor, infrastructure revitalization, climate change, federal enforcement of police reform \u2026 these should be presidential priorities. Will they be under a centrist Clinton administration? Doubtful. Still, it is my sincere hope that the more progressive side of the Democratic party will apply the appropriate pressure. This entire presidential campaign has been a demoralizing debacle, and I for one can\u2019t wait until election day. I\u2019m just going to need a shower or two to scrub off the stink after leaving the voting booth.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e80b8e18f28860102232c90c229eda747b769af7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e80b8e18f28860102232c90c229eda747b769af7/0_0_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bernie Sanders answers a question about college affordability during a Clinton campaign event in Durham, New Hampshire, 28 September 2016.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bernie Sanders answers a question about college affordability during a Clinton campaign event in Durham, New Hampshire, on 28 September 2016.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Brian Snyder/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>\u2018Had Sanders won the primaries, I wouldn\u2019t be writing this\u2019</h2> <ul> <li>Dan, 59, California, voting for <strong>Donald Trump</strong></li> </ul> <p>My name is Dan and I\u2019m an older, white, middle-class male who intends to vote for Donald Trump. But I didn\u2019t start out that way. Although I\u2019ve been a Republican since registering to vote at age 18 I switched to the Democratic party this year in order to vote for Bernie Sanders in the California primary election. Had Sanders won the Democratic primary I wouldn\u2019t be writing this little essay and I would most definitely <em>not</em> be voting for Donald Trump. Let me be clear \u2013 I\u2019m not voting for Trump because I like him. I\u2019m voting for Trump \u2019cause I like Hillary Clinton even less. I don\u2019t think policy positions matter much in a presidential election. Presidents don\u2019t actually get to direct much policy. What matters most to me is leadership. The ability to lead a large organization and inspire those being led. In this respect both candidates have serious liabilities. But Hillary\u2019s appear to be the far more serious breaches of integrity. From her early days on the Nixon impeachment issue to her operation of the state department she has left behind a taint of corruption at the highest levels of government. We are already hearing of the rumblings of disorganization and discontent in both the state and justice department as a result of her corrupting influence. The priority of a president should be to manage the immense federal bureaucracy and inspire citizens. Hillary has proven herself to be singularly inadequate to the task.</p> <h2>\u2018I\u2019m a Mormon Republican voting for Clinton\u2019</h2> <ul> <li>David, 43, Colorado, voting for <strong>Hillary Clinton</strong><br></li> </ul> <p>I\u2019m a westerner, having lived and voted in Utah, Nevada and Colorado. I\u2019m educated, with two postgraduate degrees. I\u2019m also religious, having been Mormon all my life. I\u2019ve been a registered Republican since my first voting experience in 1996. I\u2019m voting for Hillary Clinton. Or, to put it more precisely, I\u2019m voting against Donald Trump. The most important factor for me in voting for any public office is character, and I think it is obvious that Trump has the worst character of any candidate I\u2019ve ever seen. There are many very reasonable objections to Clinton, and I\u2019m really not a big fan of hers, but I don\u2019t think they come anywhere close to the magnitude of Trump\u2019s deep moral flaws. I think Clinton is a very capable politician, and I like her experience in public service. I also think she\u2019s quite moderate, which is what I consider myself to be. Presidents are important, but they can\u2019t do all the things for which people often hold them responsible. I think she\u2019ll do well at foreign relations. I think she\u2019ll choose capable but moderate supreme court justices, and I hope that Congress will approve them. This has been a miserable campaign, not just because of the poor field of candidates and the disgusting rhetoric, but also because it has divided the citizenry in very ugly ways. I am voting early, by mail, and I look forward to having the whole thing finished.</p> <h2><br></h2>",
  "<p>The emails currently <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/30/democratic-senators-fbi-director-comey-clinton-emails-letter\">roiling the US presidential campaign</a> are part of some unknown digital collection amassed by the troublesome Anthony Weiner, but if your purpose is to understand the clique of people who dominate Washington today, the emails that really matter are the ones being <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/07/wikileaks-hillary-clinton-paid-wall-street-speeches\">slowly released by WikiLeaks</a> from the hacked account of Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign chair John Podesta. They are last week\u2019s scandal in a year running over with scandals, but in truth their significance goes far beyond mere scandal: they are a window into the soul of the Democratic party and into the dreams and thoughts of the class to whom the party answers.</p> <p>The class to which I refer is not rising in angry protest; they are by and large pretty satisfied, pretty contented. Nobody takes road trips to exotic West Virginia to see what the members of this class looks like or how they live; on the contrary, they are the ones for whom such stories are written. This bunch doesn\u2019t have to make do with a comb-over TV mountebank for a leader; for this class, the choices are always pretty good, and this year they happen to be excellent.</p> <p>They are the comfortable and well-educated mainstay of our modern Democratic party. They are also the grandees of our national media; the architects of our software; the designers of our streets; the high officials of our banking system; the authors of just about every plan to fix social security or fine-tune the Middle East with precision droning. They are, they think, not a class at all but rather the enlightened ones, the people who must be answered to but who need never explain themselves.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video element--supporting\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/oct/31/donald-trump-us-immigration-daca-arizona-obama-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/59n4x\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2851228\"            data-video-name=\"'We learned to fight back': Dreamers campaign against Donald Trump \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-58140c67e4b08d944ba4bd15\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/10/29/161028Daca_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/10/29/161028Daca_V3.webm\"/><source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=12004004&amp;format=video/m3u8\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/oct/31/donald-trump-us-immigration-daca-arizona-obama-video\">\u2018We learned to fight back\u2019: Dreamers campaign against Donald Trump</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Let us turn the magnifying glass on them for a change, by sorting through the hacked personal emails of John Podesta, who has been a Washington power broker for decades. I admit that I feel uncomfortable digging through this hoard; stealing someone\u2019s email is a crime, after all, and it is outrageous that people\u2019s personal information has been exposed, since WikiLeaks doesn\u2019t seem to have redacted the emails in any way. There is also the issue of authenticity to contend with: we don\u2019t know absolutely and for sure that these emails were not tampered with by whoever stole them from John Podesta. The supposed authors of the messages are refusing to confirm or deny their authenticity, and though they seem to be real, there is a small possibility they aren\u2019t.</p> <p>With all that taken into consideration, I think the WikiLeaks releases furnish us with an opportunity to observe the upper reaches of the American status hierarchy in all its righteousness and majesty.</p> <p>The dramatis personae of the liberal class are all present in this amazing body of work: financial innovators. High-achieving colleagues attempting to get jobs for their high-achieving children. Foundation executives doing fine and noble things. Prizes, of course, and high academic achievement.</p> <p>Certain industries loom large and virtuous here. Hillary\u2019s ingratiating speeches to Wall Street are well known of course, but what is remarkable is that, in the party of Jackson and Bryan and Roosevelt, smiling financiers now seem to stand on every corner, constantly proffering advice about this and that. In one now-famous email chain, for example, the reader can watch current US trade representative Michael Froman, writing from a Citibank email address in 2008, <a href=\"https://newrepublic.com/article/137798/important-wikileaks-revelation-isnt-hillary-clinton\">appear to name</a> President Obama\u2019s cabinet even before the great hope-and-change election was decided (incidentally, an important clue to understanding why that greatest of zombie banks was never put out of its misery).</p> <p>The far-sighted innovators of Silicon Valley are also here in force, interacting all the time with the leaders of the party of the people. We watch as Podesta appears to <a href=\"https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/15865\">email</a> Sheryl Sandberg. He makes plans to <a href=\"https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/29255\">visit</a> Mark Zuckerberg (who, according to one missive, wants to \u201clearn more about next steps for his philanthropy and social action\u201d). Podesta exchanges emails with an entrepreneur about an ugly race now unfolding for Silicon Valley\u2019s seat in Congress; this man, in turn, appears to forward to Podesta the remarks of yet another Silicon Valley grandee, who <a href=\"https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/19482\">complains</a> that one of the Democratic combatants in that fight was criticizing billionaires who give to Democrats. Specifically, the miscreant Dem in question was said to be:</p> <p>\u201c\u2026 spinning (and attacking) donors who have supported Democrats. John Arnold and Marc Leder have both given to Cory Booker, Joe Kennedy, and others. He is also attacking every billionaire that donates to [Congressional candidate] Ro [Khanna], many whom support other Democrats as well.\u201d</p> <p>Attacking billionaires! In the year 2015! It was, one of the correspondents appears to write, \u201cmadness and political malpractice of the party to allow this to continue\u201d.</p> <p>There are wonderful things to be found in this treasure trove when you search the gilded words \u201cDavos\u201d or \u201cTahoe\u201d. But it is when you search \u201cVineyard\u201d on the WikiLeaks dump that you realize these people truly inhabit a different world from the rest of us. By \u201cvineyard\u201d, of course, they mean Martha\u2019s Vineyard, the ritzy vacation resort island off the coast of Massachusetts where presidents Clinton and Obama spent most of their summer vacations. The Vineyard is a place for the very, very rich to unwind, yes, but as we learn from these emails, it is also a place of high idealism; a land of enlightened liberal commitment far beyond anything ordinary citizens can ever achieve.</p> <p>Consider, for example, the 2015 <a href=\"https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/30396\">email</a> from a foundation executive to a retired mortgage banker (who then seems to have forwarded the note on to Podesta, and thus into history) expressing concern that \u201cHillary\u2019s image is being torn apart in the media and there\u2019s not enough effective push back\u201d. The public eavesdrops as yet another financier <a href=\"https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/24270\">invites</a> Podesta to a dinner featuring \u201cfood produced exclusively by the island\u2019s farmers and fishermen which will be matched with specially selected wines\u201d. We learn how a Hillary campaign aide <a href=\"https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/19449\">recommended</a> that a policy statement appear on a certain day so that \u201cIt wont get in the way of any other news we are trying to make \u2013 but far enough ahead of Hamptons and Vineyard money events\u201d. We even read the <a href=\"https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/32784\">pleadings</a> of a man who wants to be invited to a state dinner at the White House and who offers, as one of several exhibits in his favor, the fact that he \u201cjoined the DSCC Majority Trust in Martha\u2019s Vineyard (contributing over $32,400 to Democratic senators) in July 2014\u201d.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/oct/31/how-does-electoral-college-work-us-election-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/59yvc\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2849673\"            data-video-name=\"How does the US electoral college work? \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"Guardian/Getty Images\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-58136bc4e4b08d944ba4ba7a\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/10/28/161028elect1_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/10/28/161028elect1.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/10/28/161028elect1_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/oct/31/how-does-electoral-college-work-us-election-video\">How does the US electoral college work?</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>(Hilariously, in another <a href=\"https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/8640\">email chain</a>, the Clinton team appears to scheme to \u201chit\u201d Bernie Sanders for attending \u201cDSCC retreats on Martha\u2019s Vineyard with lobbyists\u201d.)</p> <p>Then there is the apparent nepotism, the dozens if not hundreds of mundane emails in which petitioners for this or that plum Washington job or high-profile academic appointment politely appeal to Podesta \u2013 the ward-heeler of the meritocratic elite \u2013 for a solicitous word whispered in the ear of a powerful crony.</p> <p>This genre of Podesta email, in which people try to arrange jobs for themselves or their kids, points us toward the most fundamental thing we know about the people at the top of this class: their loyalty to one another and the way it overrides everything else. Of course Hillary Clinton staffed her state department with investment bankers and then did speaking engagements for investment banks as soon as she was done at the state department. Of course she <a href=\"https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/927\">appears to think</a> that any kind of bank reform should \u201ccome from the industry itself\u201d. And of course no elite bankers were ever prosecuted by the Obama administration. Read these emails and you understand, with a start, that the people at the top tier of American life all know each other. They are all engaged in promoting one another\u2019s careers, constantly.</p> <p>Everything blurs into everything else in this world. The state department, the banks, Silicon Valley, the nonprofits, the \u201c<a href=\"http://www.teneoholdings.com/\">Global CEO Advisory Firm</a>\u201d that <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/clinton-foundations-fundraisers-pressed-donors-to-steer-business-to-former-president-1477527597\">appears</a> to have solicited donations for the Clinton Foundation.

The biggest gains in this month\u2019s elections were made by the rightwing Brazilian Social Democratic party (PSDB), which won S\u00e3o Paulo.

Vladimir Putin has a personal dislike of Hillary Clinton going back to her time as secretary of state, while Trump fits perfectly into the mould of \u201cchaos candidates\u201d that Russia has supported in other western countries.</p> <p>It would take a conspiracy theorist to believe Trump is actually a Kremlin stooge rather than simply a \u201cuseful idiot\u201d, and some in Russia believed a Trump presidency could actually have more potential for conflict than a Clinton one.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/oct/14/hillary-clinton-email-hack-russia-cybersecurity\">Entire US political system \u2018under attack\u2019 by Russian hacking, experts warn</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Under Clinton, relations would be unlikely to be rosy but would probably stay within a long-established paradigm of mutual distrust and limited cooperation on certain issues.<br></p> <p>US politics tends to be portrayed as driven by geopolitical interests rather than personalities, and so most ordinary Russians assume that little will change, whoever wins. Still, the warm words about Putin from Trump, and the slightly more positive tone of television coverage relating to the real estate tycoon, have both left their mark.

If we get attacked, Japan doesn\u2019t have to help us,\u201d he said. \u201cSomehow, that doesn\u2019t sound so fair.\u201d</p> <p>Trump\u2019s frequent claim that Japan is taking advantage of US largesse is inaccurate. Tokyo contributes \u00a5192bn ($1.84bn) a year towards maintaining the US military presence. US bases in Japan cost about $5.5bn a year, according to the Pentagon, about half of which goes on salaries and other personnel costs.</p> <p>South Korea, meanwhile, contributes $850m a year \u2013 about half the cost of maintaining 28,500 troops on the southern side of the heavily fortified border that divides the Korean peninsula.</p> <p>Yet Trump has returned to the theme throughout the campaign: \u201cAs far as Japan and other countries, we are being ripped off by everybody in the world,\u201d he said at an event in Las Vegas. \u201cWe\u2019re defending other countries, we\u2019re spending a fortune doing it.

The perpetrator, Omar Mateen, was of Afghan origin, and Trump\u2019s explicit linking of Afghans to terrorism earned him widespread contempt.<br></p> <p>Afghans in general seem unsure of what either candidate has in store for their country, apart from two indications from the Trump campaign: his proposed ban on Muslims from entering America; and his calls to pull American troops home, or at least limit their role in Afghanistan, which would likely have a destabilising effect on the country. Neither is popular with Afghans.<br></p> <p>Recently, though, Afghans have mostly treated the US elections with a certain sarcastic distance. After the third presidential debate, Trump\u2019s refusal to accept the election results if he did not win led to a wave of snarky commentary on social media.

Trump\u2019s fitness for office, his persistent appeals to the worst fears and least attractive elements of American public opinion, his unwillingness to accept the results of the election. And Clinton has been plagued by decades-long enmity towards her among large segments of the electorate and persistent questions about her honesty.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/feb/07/is-the-us-australia-anchor-of-peace-immune-from-rust\">Is the US-Australia 'anchor of peace' immune from rust? | Carl Ungerer</a> </p> </aside>  <p>For the first time since 1980, unease about America\u2019s standing in the world \u2013 and how it should respond to numerous foreign policy challenges \u2013 has taken outsized prominence in a US presidential election. For Australia, vastly different implications for foreign and defence policy, as well as trade and investment, would flow from the election of Clinton or Trump.</p> <p>On the question of a Clinton or Trump presidency, Australian public opinion is utterly unambiguous. Earlier this year, before Trump\u2019s most shameful moments, the United States Studies Centre fielded questions about the US-Australia relationship to the more than 100,000 Australians who took the ABC\u2019s Vote Compass survey: 70% said Australia should distance itself from the United States if Trump is elected (just 24% said Australia\u2019s relationship with the United States should remain unchanged). </p> <p>Under a Clinton presidency, 87% of Australians would leave the US relationship unchanged, or seek to strengthen it. </p> <p>Australia\u2019s comfort with Clinton is understandable: she has visited here twice as first lady and secretary of state (including the 2012 launch of our sister centre in Perth). Much has been made of Clinton\u2019s hawkishness relative to President Obama\u2019s, her greater instinct to deploy military force and to take an active stance in global affairs. It seems likely that Clinton\u2019s foreign policy will be broadly consistent with Obama\u2019s, but with renewed vigour, less pensive deliberation, and a determination to stand up to global bullies. </p> <p>Three of the foreign policy challenges Clinton (or Trump) face are already apparent.</p> <p>Clinton will need to address ongoing Russian attempts to confront the United States and its interests at the same time as she manages US allies in Europe. Clinton seems determined to take a more active role in stabilising the Middle East, limiting if not eliminating the threat posed by Isis and other extremist groups, and instituting a no fly zone over Syria. Clinton will also need to police the Iran nuclear deal and limit the wider prospects of a Sunni-Shia conflagration stemming from Saudi-Iranian rivalry.</p> <p>In Asia, Clinton must balance the long term trend of increasing cooperation and dialogue between China and the United States alongside China\u2019s increasing assertiveness and militarisation in places like the South China Sea. </p> <p>For months Clinton\u2019s Asia team have been working on plans to further operationalise America\u2019s stabilising alliances and partnerships across the Indo-Pacific. North Korea will command immediate attention. Speaking last week, the US Director of National Intelligence James Clapper grimly assessed that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/26/paranoid-north-korea-wont-stop-building-nuclear-weapons-us-spy-chief\">denuclearising the North Korean regime</a> may already be a lost cause, suggesting that the US and its Asian allies may soon face the prospect of North Korean nuclear tipped missiles pointed their way. </p> <p>If the United States is to act to avert this, the next administration will have to make some extremely tough decisions very early in its term. Australia is already committed to play a part in North Korean contingencies by virtue of our role in the UN Command charged with supervising the uneasy armistice on the Korean peninsula. </p> <p>The pressing question for Australia is how a President Clinton might apportion diplomatic and military effort between the Middle East, Russia, and Asia \u2013 and how Australia would seek to shape its contribution.</p> <p>Conventional wisdom is that a President Trump would lead an isolationist America. This is an incorrect simplification. Trump is a nationalist, not an isolationist. Trump has signalled he would increase the United States Navy by 30% and the US Marine Corps by more than 50%. He has pledged to renegotiate the Iran deal and up the fight against Isis, including through the commitment of US (and presumably allied) ground forces in Iraq and Syria. A Trump foreign policy could be very active indeed.</p> <p>Trump has declared he will sharply escalate trade tariffs with China and designate that country a currency manipulator. He has simultaneously promised to increase the presence of the US military in Asia (including in hotspots like the South China Sea) and withdraw forces contributing to the defence of South Korea and Japan. All of these moves are destabilising in a rapidly evolving Asian strategic situation.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/26/unlike-julia-gillard-hillary-clinton-will-inherit-an-electorate-incredibly-alive-to-sexism\">Unlike Julia Gillard, Hillary Clinton will inherit an electorate incredibly alive to sexism | Kristina Keneally</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Most immediately, a President Trump would force Australia to a decision on Japan. Trump\u2019s dislike of Japan is visceral and long held, stemming back to 1987 when he bought full page ads in the New York Times claiming that Japan was taking advantage of the US. Would Australia, hedging against less predictable US engagement in Asia, continue its decade long trend towards a closer security relationship with Japan? Or to assure Trump, would Australia seek to distance itself from Japan, distinguishing Australia\u2019s alliance from one the new President sees as unfair and unrewarding?</p> <p>Though Clinton is the status quo candidate for Australians, her presidency may not be \u2013 she will face pressure to demonstrate that US allies are contributing to US interests. </p> <p>A Trump presidency however would put the US-Australia relationship under much greater stress. It would be unpalatable to a majority of Australians, and concerning to those with responsibilities for Australia\u2019s foreign and defence policy. </p> <p>These concerns would be compounded by uncertainty as to which of Trump\u2019s many (and often contradictory) campaign pronouncements would actually be implemented \u2013 and by whom. All of this would put immense pressure on the bipartisan consensus that has guided Australia\u2019s relationship with America.</p> <p><em>James Brown is director of research and Simon Jackman is professor of political science and chief executive officer, both of the United States Studies Centre at the University of Sydney. </em></p>"

  "<p>Malcolm Turnbull is marking his first year as prime minister. We take a look back at the major moments of the past 12 months.</p> <h2><strong>Advocacy: not slogans. Catharsis of the leadership change</strong></h2> <p>On September 14 2015, Malcolm Turnbull strode into a parliamentary courtyard and declared he was moving against Tony Abbott. The Coalition had been behind Labor in 30 consecutive Newspolls, a fact Turnbull noted in his rationale for the leadership change.</p> <p>His pitch was simple. Abbott had proved himself incapable of providing economic leadership. \u201cIt is clear enough that the government is not successful in providing the economic leadership that we need. It is not the fault of individual ministers. Ultimately, the prime minister has not been capable of providing the economic leadership our nation needs.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7e89b5bc89d8238082ec315765d775db71606975\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7e89b5bc89d8238082ec315765d775db71606975/0_0_4900_3305/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The morning newspapers in Sydney on 15 September 2015, the day after he ousted Tony Abbott in a snap party vote\" width=\"1000\" height=\"674\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The morning newspapers in Sydney on 15 September 2015, the day after he ousted Tony Abbott in a snap party vote.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: William West/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And there was a promise of grown-up government. \u201cWe need a different style of leadership. We need a style of leadership that explains those challenges and opportunities, explains the challenges and how to seize the opportunities. A style of leadership that respects the people\u2019s intelligence, that explains these complex issues and then sets out the course of action we believe we should take and makes a case for it. We need advocacy, not slogans. We need to respect the intelligence of the Australian people.\u201d</p> <p>The effect was immediate. Turnbull\u2019s oft-repeated optimistic declaration that there had never been a more exciting time saw the Coalition recover in the polls. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/nov/19/globetrotting-turnbull-stretches-his-wings-but-will-the-diehards-clip-them\">Turnbull changed the national tone instantly on issues like national security</a>, moved quickly to produce a science and innovation package as well as reopening a tax reform debate that had stalled under Abbott and Joe Hockey.<br></p> <h2><strong>\u2018If something isn\u2019t working as well as you want, chuck it out\u2019</strong></h2> <p>One month after taking the leadership, Turnbull did his first round of sit-down media interviews. He was keen to project a sense of pragmatism and compromise, to draw a contrast with the unrelenting conflict atmosphere promulgated by his predecessor. \u201cIf something isn\u2019t working as well as you want, chuck it out,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/oct/23/the-malcolm-turnbull-interview-if-something-isnt-working-chuck-it-out\">Turnbull said during a conversation with Guardian Australia</a> on 23 October. \u201cI\u2019m not afraid of people saying, it\u2019s a backdown, or a backflip. An agile government is prepared to abandon policies that don\u2019t work.\u201d<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2230278f7538802b4bab5093abf2321faabccc39\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2230278f7538802b4bab5093abf2321faabccc39/362_810_4410_2646/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Turnbull in his Parliament House office on 23 October 2015, during an interview with Guardian Australia\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Turnbull in his Parliament House office on 23 October 2015, during an interview with Guardian Australia.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mike Bowers/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Turnbull was flagging that he would have a high tolerance for floating and then killing various reform proposals \u2013 a tendency which was, in some respects, a welcome change from the highly controlled, scripted modus operandi of most prime ministers \u2013 but a tendency that would get him into political trouble as the tax reform debate began to gather pace early in 2016.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We should never cease trying to make changes in the social welfare area fairer. Fairer is what is it all about</p> <footer> <cite>Malcolm Turnbull in October 2015</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Turnbull during his opening gambit also acknowledged that the political conversation around budget repair needed to address equity \u2013 again an explicit point of contrast with the 2014 budget, which was a political disaster for Abbott. \u201cWe should never cease trying to make changes in the social welfare area fairer,\u201d Turnbull said. \u201cFairer is what is it all about. Fairness has got to be the key priority.\u201d He gave his first signal about where the government would ultimately land with the controversial superannuation reforms it would unveil in the May 2016 budget. He suggested tax concessions for the wealthy had to be pared back as well as government spending programs primarily benefiting the lower paid.</p> <h2><strong>The first summit season</strong></h2> <p>Two months after the leadership change, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/nov/20/presidents-planes-and-paris-inside-the-whirlwind-of-malcolm-turnbulls-first-world-tour\">Malcolm embarked on his first summit season</a>. His first stop was Jakarta \u2013 an investment in improving the bilateral relationship with president Joko Widodo. The relationship with Jakarta had been battered and bruised over asylum boat turnbacks and also the revelation that Australia\u2019s spy agencies <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/18/australia-tried-to-monitor-indonesian-presidents-phone\">had attempted to listen-in on the calls</a> of the previous Indonesian president, Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, and his inner circle. Much was made of the attempted rapprochement and rebalancing in the relationship early in the new Turnbull term.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6a3de32d86021dab7efa9e2ab8cb564917123826\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6a3de32d86021dab7efa9e2ab8cb564917123826/0_93_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Turnbull and the US president, Barack Obama, after their bilateral meeting alongside the Apec summit in Manila, Philippines, in November 2015\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Turnbull and the US president, Barack Obama, after their bilateral meeting alongside the Apec summit in Manila, Philippines, in November 2015.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jonathan Ernst/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Turnbull went on to Berlin and was in the German capital when the Paris terror attacks unfolded on November 14. He flew on to Turkey for the G20 gathering, which was dominated by the worsening security situation in Syria. Turnbull met the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, at the Antalya gathering \u2013 the first substantial contact between Canberra and Moscow since Tony Abbott had famously threatened to \u201cshirtfront\u201d the Russian president. Turnbull <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/18/apec-summit-malcolm-turnbull-says-syria-solution-hinges-on-power-sharing\">noted a political solution in Syria would require the inclusion of Sunni groups</a> that had felt disenfranchised by the Assad regime and had consequently been left vulnerable to overtures from Islamic State. In Turkey he met the leaders of Japan, Singapore, the EU, India and China.</p> <p>Turnbull then winged his way to Manila and the Apec summit, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/nov/17/malcolm-turnbull-and-barack-obama-hold-first-meeting-and-promise-to-ramp-up-fight-against-isis\">where he had his first substantial bilateral with the US president, Barack Obama</a>. Obama invited Turnbull to visit Washington and courted Australia\u2019s support in the hotly disputed region of the South China Sea, where Australia had resolved to walk a middle course diplomatically, carefully balancing the relationship between most important strategic ally and largest trading partner.</p> <h2><strong>Early concessions to conservative enemies</strong></h2> <p> Turnbull lost the leadership of the Liberal party in 2009 for two reasons \u2013 he was seen by colleagues as dragging the Coalition in too progressive a direction and his leadership style was regarded as high-handed.</p> <p>Turnbull entered the leadership in 2015 determined to be more consultative and he vowed to restore good cabinet processes, which was partly an explicit apologia about his own mistakes in the past and a more contemporary acknowledgement that one of the things that had undone Abbott as prime minister was a \u201ccommand and control\u201d leadership style out of the prime minister\u2019s office.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1ec2d0491efd887f50ba2c653c297e9e017a36f7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1ec2d0491efd887f50ba2c653c297e9e017a36f7/0_108_5154_3092/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Turnbull with the education minister, Simon Birmingham.

They offered a number of concessions after a brief backbench storm over the Safe Schools anti-bullying program.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dean Lewins/AAP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Early in the piece Turnbull made it clear he would keep the plebiscite as a means of resolving whether to legalise same-sex marriage, even though he was a supporter of a parliamentary vote. He also made it clear that there would be no change to the Coalition\u2019s climate change policy before a planned review in 2017, despite broad criticism about the effectiveness of the Direct Action scheme.</p> <p>After a brief backbench storm over the Safe Schools anti-bullying program in March, Turnbull and fellow moderate, the education minister Simon Birmingham, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/mar/18/turnbull-government-unveils-dramatic-changes-to-safe-schools-program\">offered up a number of concessions</a>, such as requiring parental consent for student participation and requiring the agreement of parental bodies to decide whether, and how, a school will participate in the program.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The concessions to the conservative right set a definitive trend for Turnbull and they corroded his personal standing</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>One of the chief critics of the program, the LNP backbencher George Christensen, later declared victory. \u201cIt\u2019s all going,\u201d Christensen said. \u201cBoys in girls\u2019 school uniforms, girls and boys using the same toilets, classroom role plays where kids imagine they have no genitalia or they\u2019re gay ... I doubt the Safe Schools Coalition \u2013 who came up with with the weird and wonderful elements of this, attempting to instil queer theory, sexual liberation and Marxism into classrooms \u2013 will accept this. And if they don\u2019t, the funding will be cut.\u201d</p> <p>The concessions to the conservative right set a definitive trend for Turnbull and, progressively, they corroded his personal standing with voters. Voters had welcomed the leadership change, believing that Turnbull would be less ideological than his predecessor, would move the Coalition back to the political centre and was a politician prepared to sacrifice ambition for principle.</p> <h2><strong>Tax reform debate: the brief life of a GST hike, and competitive federalism</strong></h2> <p>Reopening the government\u2019s stalled tax reform debate was an early marker that the prime minister intended to prosecute a broad-ranging economic policy discussion. A possible rise in the GST had been, as Turnbull liked to say, \u201ckicked off into the long grass\u201d under Abbott. The new prime minister elected to put the GST back on the political agenda.</p> <p>The treasurer, Scott Morrison, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/jan/24/gst-debate-scott-morrison-backs-need-for-option-to-raise-tax-as-part-of-reforms\">opened the political new year in 2016 by softening Australians up for an increase in the GST,</a> arguing that reform needed to be on the table if voters want personal income tax relief and a cut to corporate tax to boost economic growth. Two state premiers, Mike Baird in New South Wales, and Jay Weatherill, the Labor man in South Australia, were resolved to give Turnbull political cover.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"31d431cb281fb7ed1c3d0b69db237798625d2414\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/31d431cb281fb7ed1c3d0b69db237798625d2414/0_87_2758_1655/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Turnbull and the treasurer, Scott Morrison, during question time at Parliament House in Canberra early in 2016\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Turnbull and the treasurer, Scott Morrison, during question time at Parliament House in Canberra early in 2016.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mick Tsikas/AAP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But Labor had spent the summer working up a marginal seats campaign for the election year predicated around opposing the GST and that rattled the government backbench. While Morrison continued to roll forward, Turnbull began to roll back. It was the first sign that the relationship between prime minister and treasurer wasn\u2019t entirely harmonious.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-02-16/turnbull-rules-out-gst-change-election-policy/7172294\">A GST increase was dumped formally in February.</a> \u201cAfter you take into account all of the compensation that you would need to ensure the change was equitable, it simply is not justified in economic terms,\u201d the prime minister told reporters.</p> <p>A second phase of tax reform played out somewhat chaotically in the lead-up to a Council of Australian Governments meeting in late March 2016. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/mar/29/states-offered-5bn-hospitals-funding-income-tax-raising-powers\">Turnbull floated the idea that state governments would be able to levy a portion of income tax</a> and service delivery would be devolved back to the states. The premiers shot the concept down in flames. Turnbull put the defeat more delicately. \u201cThere was not a consensus among the states and territories to support further consideration of the proposal that would enable states to levy income tax on their own behalf,\u201d he said.</p> <h2><strong>A budget, Senate reform and a sprint to a double dissolution</strong></h2> <p>Having turned into an election year, and with political momentum clearly on the wane, Turnbull set about putting together <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/feb/19/senate-voting-reform-stirs-up-hornets-nest-between-likely-winners-and-losers\">reforms to the Senate voting system</a> that were designed to reduce the chances of micro-party candidates being elected on small percentages of the vote. This change reflected the government\u2019s frustration with a Senate crossbench that had worked to thwart many of the government\u2019s proposals for cutting expenditure since 2013.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2dcbf87a1a0e66140ea8dd52412db92755cf8482\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2dcbf87a1a0e66140ea8dd52412db92755cf8482/0_0_3052_2069/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Turnbull outside Parliament House in Canberra the day after Morrison delivered the federal budget\" width=\"1000\" height=\"678\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Turnbull outside Parliament House in Canberra the day after Morrison delivered the federal budget.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sam Mooy/AAP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The reform was widely seen as a springboard to a double-dissolution election that the government would call as a consequence of being unable to pass two pieces of industrial relations legislation: restoring the Australian Building and Construction Commission and the registered organisations bill.</p> <p>But the other springboard for the election was to be <a href=\"http://www.budget.gov.au/\">the budget of 2016</a>, which was handed down in the week Turnbull called the eight-week winter election. The budget was styled not merely as a budget but pitched rather more grandly as an \u201ceconomic plan\u201d for the nation, where cuts to business taxes would generate more economic growth and jobs (although the fine print on the tax cut made it clear the growth dividend was small and would take many years to arrive). Somewhat bravely for an election budget, there were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/may/03/budget-2016-jobs-and-growth-pitch-costs-wealthy-retirees-smokers-and-multinationals\">no goodies for people on average incomes</a> between $37,000 and $80,000.</p> <h2><strong>The winter of Malcolm\u2019s discontent</strong></h2> <p>By the conclusion of budget week, Malcolm Turnbull resolved Australians would go to the polls for a double-dissolution election on 2 July. Looking over the heads of colleagues to the voters, Turnbull told people watching on Mother\u2019s Day he was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/may/17/election-2016-malcolm-turnbull-liberal-party-coalition-profile\">seeking a personal mandate</a>. He was \u201cseeking the mandate of the Australian people to continue and complete [the government\u2019s] national economic plan, because that is the key to us achieving and realising the great opportunities of these exciting times\u201d. The pitch went to the crux of what Turnbull required to steady his political fortunes \u2013 an affirmation from the voters that they wanted him to be prime minister.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/video/2016/jul/02/malcolm-turnbull-im-confident-that-we-can-form-a-majority-government-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/4nhqz\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2591592\"            data-video-name=\"Malcolm Turnbull: \u2018I\u2019m confident that we can form a majority government\u2019 \u2013\u00a0video\"            data-video-provider=\"ABC News 24\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-5777e1b9e4b0c5b1280f315f\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/07/02/160702TurnbullSpeech_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2016/07/02/160702TurnbullSpeech_large.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2016/07/02/160702TurnbullSpeech_small.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/07/02/160702TurnbullSpeech_synd_768k_vp8.webm\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/07/02/160702TurnbullSpeech.m3u8\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/video/2016/jul/02/malcolm-turnbull-im-confident-that-we-can-form-a-majority-government-video\">Malcolm Turnbull speaks on the night of the federal election, saying he is \u2018confident that we can form a majority government\u2019 \u2013 video</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>It was an unusual election campaign at a number of levels. Despite the polls all suggesting the outcome was on a knife-edge, there were no substantial new policies unveiled over the eight weeks, just an extended policy conversation about the \u201cplan\u201d (which was more a proposal, contingent on future Senate support), versus the Labor alternative.</p> <p>Coalition MPs contesting marginal seats fretted about the presidential nature of the campaign, the lack of content to connect with ordinary voters and problems with the campaign headquarters. A bubble of discontent about one of the budget proposals, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/jun/02/institute-of-public-affairs-likens-coalition-to-bernie-sanders-over-superannuation\">a move to wind back tax concessions for high-income earners</a>, surfaced but didn\u2019t catch fire.

The major parties both saw a substantial swing in their internal tracking poll in the middle of the final week of the campaign to Labor, which carried through to election night. Labor would not pick up enough seats to govern in majority but, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/jul/10/australian-election-turnbull-wins-but-elation-marginal\">for a time, it wasn\u2019t clear that the Coalition would be able to command a majority</a> in its own right.</p> <p>The Senate had not been cleared out, many crossbenchers were set to continue their careers and two new protectionist blocs had emerged in the upper house \u2013 the Nick Xenophon Team with three senators and Pauline Hanson with four.

The paid leave, which would provide these mothers unemployment insurance for six weeks as opposed to paying them their salaries, would be funded by reducing fraud in the current unemployment insurance program, the campaign said.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/13/trump-international-hotel-washington-opening-protests\">Trump not 'welcome here': opening of DC hotel met with protests</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Trump already has promised a significant tax cut as well as major increases in defense and infrastructure spending on the campaign trail without cutting spending on entitlements such as social security, Medicare and Medicaid.</p> <p>In a rally in Iowa on Tuesday afternoon, Trump previewed his childcare plan, while also touching on familiar themes. The Republican nominee once again insisted that Clinton\u2019s email scandal was \u201cworse than Watergate\u201d while talking ominously about bad trade deals influenced by \u201cspecial interests\u201d. </p> <p>Trump told the crowd: \u201cIt\u2019s almost like, I was thinking about it in the last couple of weeks in particular, they want these other countries to do so well ... because nobody can make deals that badly.\u201d <br></p> <p>Clinton unveiled a plan for universal preschool with increased federal funding in June 2015. </p> <p>In a statement, the Clinton campaign cast scorn upon Trump\u2019s proposal. Maya Harris, a senior policy advisor to the Democratic nominee, said: \u201cThe lack of seriousness of this proposal is no surprise given his history of disrespecting women in the workplace and the fact there\u2019s no evidence he ever provided paid family leave or childcare to his own employees.\u201d </p> <p>The campaign went on to deride the proposed tax deductions as disproportionately favoring rich Americans as well as the inequity that Trump would only provide parental leave to mothers and not to fathers. Harris described it as \u201ca regressive and insufficient \u2018maternity leave\u2019 policy that is out-of-touch, half-baked and ignores the way Americans live and work today\u201d.</p> <p>Hours before Trump was to make his pitch on childcare with daughter Ivanka in suburban Philadelphia, a former stronghold for moderate Republicans that has trended Democratic in recent years, Obama hit the trail for Clinton for the first time solo, downtown in the same city.

As well as the appearance in Charlotte, the president has also headlined a series of fundraisers to help raise money for Democrats.</p> <p>Obama can also prove influential in rallying core Democratic constituencies behind Clinton.

  "<p>The Census Bureau released its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/13/household-income-increase-poverty-us-census-report\">annual look at US household incomes</a> on Tuesday, the most detailed report on the financial health of the nation in the run-up to the 2016 election. The economy is once again the central background of the 2016 campaign. </p> <p>The data confirmed what the Obama administration has been trying to convince American voters of for more than a year: the US economic recovery is here. But it also highlighted how much work remains to be done.</p> <p>Here are the six charts that could decide who takes the White House come November.</p> <h2>Median household income</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8c3d8daa9215c622f1c9089137ec5dd9ec8ff4e9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8c3d8daa9215c622f1c9089137ec5dd9ec8ff4e9/0_0_3000_2250/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Median US household income\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Median US household income.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: US Census Bureau</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Yes, the median household income saw its first significant increase since 2007 last year, rising by 5.2%. It\u2019s the first rise since the recession and since Obama was elected, and it\u2019s clearly a significant moment. But, for perspective, that increase brings the median household income up to $56,516 a year, which is about where it was back in 1999. Adjusted for inflation, Americans today are bringing home 2.4% less than they were at the turn of the millennium. It\u2019s no wonder that so many feel as though they haven\u2019t had a significant raise in years \u2013 because they haven\u2019t. </p> <h2>Job creation </h2>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/04/jobs-report-added/\" data-alt=\"US jobs growth\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/04/jobs-report-added/\">US jobs growth</a> </figure>  <p>An additional 1.4 million people found full-time work in 2015, according to the Census Bureau. Job creation has been one of the highlights of Obama\u2019s presidency. His administration often likes to point out that his presidency saw the longest streak of job creation on record. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/02/us-jobs-report-august-economy\">August was the 71st</a> consecutive month of overall job creation and the 77th consecutive month of private-sector job growth.</p> <p>Donald Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, has described the jobs added as \u201cbad jobs\u201d and promised that if elected he would be \u201cthe greatest jobs-producing president that God ever created\u201d.</p> <h2>Racial divide</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"47f168bef223e33fb2b32722d55e5ce3a34abb81\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/47f168bef223e33fb2b32722d55e5ce3a34abb81/0_0_3000_2250/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Median household income by race\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Median household income by race.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: US Census Bureau</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>While everyone\u2019s income went up in 2015, a large racial divide remains. The median household income for white Americans in 2015 was $63,000. That\u2019s 70% more than the median household income of black Americans, which was $36,898. </p> <p>Hispanic households saw the greatest jump in median income. Their income went up by 6.1%, reaching $45,148. Trump, who lags Clinton by a wide margin with minority voters, has argued the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/17/donald-trump-appeals-to-black-voters-in-attempt-to-offset-dismal-polling\">Democrats have failed African Americans and Latinos</a> economically. <a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2016-election/trump-s-attempts-woo-black-voters-having-opposite-effect-n642331\">Polls suggest</a> that his message is not yet hurting Clinton.</p> <h2>Income inequality</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"13b8d7e80c206833e94dcf5907890ee7be6e35c5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/13b8d7e80c206833e94dcf5907890ee7be6e35c5/0_0_3000_2250/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Household income by percentile\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>The census does not have to single out the top 1% of Americans in order to make a point about income inequality in the US. According to its data, the top 5% of Americans had a median household income of $214,500, while the bottom 50% had a median income of $56,500. And the bottom 10%? Their median household income was $13,300. Bernie Sanders railed against income inequality, and in the primaries at least, so did Clinton and Trump. The two one-percenters have been major beneficiaries of the widening income gap.</p> <h2>Gender wage gap</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2bc979d7e2489e8586a4604b90f288c319866d22\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2bc979d7e2489e8586a4604b90f288c319866d22/0_0_3000_2250/1000.jpg\" alt=\"earnings by gender\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>In 2015, the gender wage gap shrank by a penny. This means that women earned 80 cents for every dollar earned by men that year, up from 79 cents the year before. Clinton has long called for equal pay. While serving in the US Senate, she co-sponsored the Paycheck Fairness Act, which despite being introduced in every Congress since 1997 has yet to pass. </p> <p>Speaking at the Republican national convention, Ivanka Trump promised that her father too would fight for equal pay for women. \u201cHe will fight for equal pay for equal work, and I will fight for this too, right alongside of him,\u201d she said. </p> <h2>Millions still in poverty</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0c576b6624099cc40e74de7168ee7df256be4b97\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0c576b6624099cc40e74de7168ee7df256be4b97/0_0_3000_2250/1000.jpg\" alt=\"poverty rate\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>In 2015, the US poverty rate dropped by 1.2%.

This is mainly attention-seeking Wildean posturing, a staging of ennui for dramatic effect, but with a grain of truth.

He has also come out in support of raising the US federal minimum wage to $10 an hour and claimed the Democrats have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/20/what-do-you-have-to-lose-donald-trump-appeals-for-black-vote\">failed black voters.</a><br></p> <p>His rival, Hillary Clinton, has spoken about the need to build an economy for everyone. </p> <p>Activists are hoping the candidates will also address the needs of the still huge number of Americans living in poverty. On Wednesday, the Vote to End Hunger coalition plan to deliver a petition to Lester Holt, NBC newscaster and host of the first presidential debate, urging him to push the presidential candidates to address what they will do to alleviate poverty and end hunger in the US and worldwide. Holt will be moderating the first presidential debate at Hofstra University on 26 September.</p> <p>More than 42 million Americans, including 13.1 million children, struggled with hunger in 2015, the coalition said.<strong> </strong></p> <p>The drop in poverty and increase in household income was due to the strengthening labor market and growth in wages, according to Sheldon Danziger, president of Russell Sage Foundation.</p> <p>\u201cPoverty declined so much because employment increased steadily in 2015, with the annual unemployment rate at 5.3% compared to 6.2% in 2014. In addition, 21 states and the District of Columbia increased their minimum wage rates in 2015,\u201d he said. </p> <p>In both 2014 and 2015, the number of full time workers went up \u2013 with an additional 1.2 million men and 1.6 million women finding full time work in 2014 and another 1.4 million men and one million women finding full time work in 2015. This past month, the US economy added 151,000 jobs. August was the 71st consecutive month of overall job creation \u2013 the longest streak on record. The US Federal Reserve has previously said that the labor market is nearing full employment.</p> <p>The data released on Tuesday also showed that gender wage gap still persists \u2013 with women earning about 80 cents for every dollar earned by men in 2015. The gender wage gap has only decreased by one cent since 2014. While this is the smallest pay gap on record, it is no reason for celebration. </p> <p>\u201cWomen of America, if you are looking for a raise, don\u2019t get your hopes up: the wage gap closed by only a penny last year,\u201d said Emily Martin, vice-president for workplace justice at the National Women\u2019s Law Center. \u201cWhile a small step forward is better than standing still, over a 40-year career women still stand to lose hundreds of thousands of dollars to the wage gap. And for many women of color, the cost of the lifetime wage gap will still exceed a million dollars. We can\u2019t afford to close this gap one penny at a time.\u201d </p> <p>Black women working full time earned 63 cents for every dollar earned by white men. Hispanic women earned only 54 cents for every dollar earned by white men.</p>",
  "<p>With about two months remaining until the US Presidential Elections, and much at stake for Americans and the rest of the world, the time has come to examine how the election of each candidate might affect science and scientific research. </p> <p>Although relatively little has been said directly about science and science policy, both Democratic candidate <a href=\"https://www.hillaryclinton.com/issues/\">Hillary Clinton</a> and Republican nominee <a href=\"https://www.donaldjtrump.com/POSITIONS\">Donald Trump</a> have official websites with a list of their key policy issues, and how they will be addressed.</p> <p>Hillary Clinton, who has made a number of statements broadly supportive of science and scientific research, has at least seven distinct issues on her website that directly relate to science and research. Clinton cites the prevention and treatment of Alzheimer\u2019s and related diseases, and the allocation of 2 billion dollars annually towards research in the field. </p> <p>She has a similar plan for the study of autism and HIV/Aids, with a commitment to eradicating Aids in the US and abroad. She specifically calls for an investment in brain behavioural research as part of broad-based support for research on brain development and human behaviour. She also supports research on addiction and substance abuse, as part of an overall plan to address these problems in American society. </p> <p>In addition, there is an overall goal of enhancing technology and innovation, which goes hand-in-hand with science. Clinton has also outlined a plan to protect animals and wildlife, and ensure that national parks and protected wildlife areas are not privatised. Finally, she has cobbled together a substantial plan to deal with the threat of climate change and global warming. Her website also lists a variety of substantial issues tangential to science policy concerns, including healthcare, Medicare, paid family and medical leave, and so on.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/occams-corner/2016/apr/06/eu-brexit-scientific-impact-complicated\">The scientific impact of Brexit: it's complicated</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Donald Trump, on the other hand, has a very sparse and rather amateurishly composed list of policies on his website.

Is our country still spending money on the GLOBAL WARMING HOAX?\u201d <br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/427226424987385856\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">NBC News just called it the great freeze - coldest weather in years.

His comments about spreading out vaccine doses come from the annals of superstition, rather than informed views. There is no scientific evidence in support of the notion that vaccine doses, or the times between vaccines, affect autism; indeed, years of trials, data, research, experience and statistics have brought us to the current <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/parents/\">Centers for Disease Control (CDC)</a> and <a href=\"https://www.aap.org/en-us/advocacy-and-policy/aap-health-initiatives/immunization/Pages/Immunization-Schedule.aspx?nfstatus=401&amp;nftoken=00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000&amp;nfstatusdescription=ERROR:+No+local+token\">American Association of Pediatrics</a> recommendations for vaccines. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/occams-corner/2016/feb/22/making-the-meningitis-b-vaccine-available-for-all-children-makes-sense\">Making the meningitis B vaccine available for all children makes sense | Jenny Rohn</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Trump\u2019s approach is not science, it is bunk.<br></p> <p>A lot has also been said about the health of each of the two candidates, with Clinton and Trump at 68 and 70 years of age, respectively. Indeed, Hillary Clinton\u2019s recent pneumonia diagnosis and cancellation of her schedule for the next few days highlights the mortality of aging presidential candidates. So it would be worthy to look at statements made by the vice presidential candidates. </p> <p>While Democrat Tim Kaine is largely in line with Clinton, Republican Mike Pence has made statements that may even outdo those of Trump. \u201c<a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/2016/07/15/mike-pence-donald-trumps-vp-pick-smoking-doesnt-kill.html\">Time for a quick reality check</a>,\u201d wrote Pence. \u201cDespite the hysteria from the political class and the media, smoking doesn\u2019t kill. Two out of every three smokers doesn\u2019t die from a smoking-related disease.\u201d </p> <p>So according to Pence, smoking doesn\u2019t kill, but a third of the smoking population DOES die from smoking. Am I missing something? It sounds like it\u2019s definitely time for Mr Pence to do a reality check.</p> <p>This upcoming election is like no other election in US history. Far more important than mere policy is the foundation on which science is based: truth. Science is, for the most part, objective, built on facts and the most likely explanation that those facts can provide at any given time. As more facts arise, models can be modified or expanded. Or revised altogether. But any model/theory/hypothesis must always fit the facts. And while all politicians tend to embellish and bend facts to some degree, more than any candidate ever in US history, Trump has been ignoring facts and promoting falsehoods. </p> <p>Paul Krugman of the New York Times wrote a recent opinion piece called <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/09/opinion/donald-trumps-big-liar-technique.html\">Donald Trump\u2019s \u2018Big Liar\u2019 Technique</a>. In this article, Krugman outlines how Trump repeatedly lies about points that are demonstrably false, and when challenged, merely repeats them. As one of many examples, he notes how Trump insists that he was against the war in Iraq \u2013 and yet, the only on-record statement he made prior to the invasion was that he was for it. Or <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/11/22/donald-trumps-outrageous-claim-that-thousands-of-new-jersey-muslims-celebrated-the-911-attacks/\">Trump\u2019s assertion that he saw thousands of cheering Muslims in Jersey City after 9-11</a>. It is Krugman\u2019s hypothesis that the sheer volume of lies has saturated and overwhelmed the American public and journalists. It is almost to the point where journalists no longer challenge yesterday\u2019s lies because they are so busy dealing with today\u2019s new round of lies.</p> <p>Trump, however, is not only adept about lying; he is a master of innuendo-based conspiracy theories. He will frequently use openings such as \u201cPeople tell me that \u2026\u201d to spread false rumours and lies. He will talk about President Obama\u2019s reaction to the murderous attack at the Orlando night-club and use phrases such as \u201cThere\u2019s something going on,\u201d as if suggesting that the president was part of a conspiracy involved in the mass shooting. And then drift away and watch his surrogates promote the conspiracy.</p> <p>A candidate who has such a loose and irreverent relationship with the truth will not be good for science, whether or not he has a solid policy to support science \u2013 and Trump does not. But science serves as a microcosm for everything else. </p> <p>If a candidate refuses to accept the advice of the vast majority of the most knowledgeable experts in a scientific field, such as those who have debunked any relationship between autism and vaccines, then why would this candidate pay any heed to foreign policy experts with regard to international affairs? Or experienced generals with regard to military issues? Indeed, Trump has already stated, \u201c<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/29/us/politics/donald-trump-hillary-clinton-intelligence-briefings.html?_r=0\">I know more than the generals about ISIS</a>.\u201d</p> <p>Perhaps the most serious concern about the Trump candidacy is that it heralds a new era that some are calling \u201c<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-truth_politics\">post-truth politics</a>\u201d. Once the truth has become irrelevant to the American electorate, scientists may as well pack up their microscopes and test tubes and look for other careers. However, with two months until the election, there is still time to campaign for facts, truth \u2013 and yes, science.</p>",

But the gaudy flamboyance of Las Vegas or Palm Beach has been dialled down to cream and grey walls \u2013 as befits understated Washington.</p> <p>The hotel opened its doors at 2pm on Monday after a two-year, $200m renovation. There was little fanfare: Trump and his family will attend a predictably grand opening ceremony next month. While the tycoon himself stayed away, there was a typical menu of divisiveness and surrealism.</p> <p>By 4.30pm, some 38 protesters had lined up outside the hotel to form a human wall in response to Trump\u2019s promise to build a wall on the Mexican border. They made speeches through a megaphone, chanted \u201cNo Trump, no KKK, no racist USA!\u201d and hoisted placards and banners that said, \u201cWe\u2019ll build a wall against racism &amp; bigotry\u201d and \u201cImmigrants &amp; Muslims are welcome here \u2013 Trump Hotel is NOT!\u201d</p> <p>In a district where Trump was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/mar/13/marco-rubio-trounces-donald-trump-in-washington-dc-presidential-primary\">badly beaten by Marco Rubio</a> and John Kasich in the Republican primary, some passing motorists tooted their horns in support of the protesters.

Liveried staff, racially diverse, glided under industrial steel girders and the dramatically high glass roof with canap\u00e9s and sparkling Trump wine. Of the hotel management, an affable Frenchman and urbane Irishman chatted to journalists. A steady trickle of guests arrived at check-in with luggage but were less willing to be interviewed about their first impressions.</p> <p>The hotel is nine stories tall and has 263 rooms, including 35 suites. Rooms start at an average of $895 a night. For the presidential inauguration in January of either Trump or Hillary Clinton, the biggest suite will cost $12,000 per night and must be booked for a minimum of five nights.

Beginning in 1995, Trump hired Pun-Yin and her father to assess the energy of his Int\u2019l Hotel &amp; Tower development project and make the necessary changes to its design, in a calculated move to tap into the burgeoning market of international investors in US real estate from China and Hong Kong. For such respected clients, a building lacking in feng shui could be a dealbreaker.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6fbe1b6b791cd5eeed51fdc746072211f31c745d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6fbe1b6b791cd5eeed51fdc746072211f31c745d/0_0_1950_1463/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pun Yin and Donald Trump in 1995.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pun-Yin and Donald Trump in 1995.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sasha von Oldershausen</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And it seems the famously bullheaded real estate developer met his match in Pun-Yin. An apprentice to her father for 15 years, Pun-Yin made a name for herself when she took on the project, for which Trump invested $230m in revamping the building. </p> <p>\u201cUntil I did this project and took off, it was not a female industry at all,\u201d Pun-Yin said, referring to the cult of mostly male feng shui masters. \u201cAs a woman, you have to be 50 to 60 years old. So I broke rank not only as a female but also as a young female.\u201d</p> <p>When Pun-Yin saw the Trump Int\u2019l Hotel &amp; Tower, the energy was so bad, she insisted that it had to be her way or the highway. She said, \u201cBy the time we went there and saw it, we said, \u2018We\u2019re not going to do this project with you unless you follow us completely.\u2019\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media-network/media-network-blog/2014/may/27/digital-feng-shui\">Feng shui comes back into fashion to declutter the digital world</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Not one to miss out on a potential financial opportunity, Trump complied. \u201cIt\u2019s just another element in which you can have the advantage over your competitors,\u201d Trump told the New York Times for an article about feng shui in 1994. \u201cAsians are becoming a big part of our market and this is something we can\u2019t ignore.\u201d </p> <p>Keep in mind this is the same man who recently blamed China for \u201cthe greatest theft in the history of the world\u201d, and who perpetually accuses the country of manipulating its currency. Yet few have capitalized on the potential investment opportunity that China represents more than Trump. </p> <p>Today, some of the Trump International Hotel and Tower\u2019s most iconic features are the result of the counsel Pun-Yin provided at the time. The metal globe that stands before the building was intended to deflect the negative energy produced by the oncoming traffic in Columbus Circle. And the tower\u2019s tea-colored glassy exterior, which reflects the surrounding sky, was said to absorb the negative energy caused by the wind\u2019s sway upon the building.</p> <p>Pun-Yin also insisted that the entrance of the building face Central Park, which she refers to as the \u201cgreen dragon of New York City\u201d, instead of its original orientation, which faced Columbus Circle.<br></p> <p>\u201cThe instability of energy caused by traffic coming at the building \u2013 it\u2019s almost like bullets flying at you all the time.

There were 10 years of international media coming to me and talking about his project.\u201d</p> <p>She added, \u201cThat\u2019s why he became the most profitable real estate developer.\u201d</p> <p>To be clear, Trump is neither the most profitable real estate developer, nor is he the largest. But the flurry of media attention from Trump\u2019s tower not only made a name for Pun-Yin, it also introduced the concept of feng shui into the mainstream. </p> <p>Soon after the project broke ground, the discipline \u2013 previously a foreign concept in the west \u2013 became a household name. A New Yorker <a href=\"http://www.condenaststore.com/-sp/A-million-two-does-seem-a-bit-heavy-for-a-one-bedroom-at-first-but-this-New-Yorker-Cartoon-Prints_i8542186_.htm\">cartoon</a> from 1995 depicts a broker, who stands on the balcony of an apartment building with two prospective buyers and says, \u201cA million two does seem a bit heavy for a one-bedroom at first, but this unit has the best feng shui in the building.\u201d</p> <p>In the late 1990s, interior designers began appropriating elements of the philosophy for a western audience, while publishers put out accessible feng shui books with titles like \u201cDorm Room Feng Shui\u201d to provide college students with \u201cquick and inexpensive feng shui fixes\u201d like putting a pink seashell in the corner of the room to attract true love. But, Pun-Yin insists, much of the true meaning of feng shui has been lost on commercialized gimmicks. </p> <p>Nowadays, Bill Seto, a veteran New York broker who specializes in the Asian-majority market in Flushing, Queens, said that while it was once regarded as an obscure philosophy, feng shui is now a tool of the trade. \u201cIt\u2019s heavily practiced in Manhattan. Brokers are starting to take courses in feng shui because it helps them market their property better,\u201d he said.</p> <p>As for Pun-Yin, she has established a robust business for herself with a wide array of clients and projects, ranging from the CEO of fashion label Theory, Andrew Rosen, to projects commissioned by the local government.</p> <p>When I contacted her again \u2013 my first interview with her was two years ago \u2013 to divine her thoughts on the impending presidential election, I caught her between feng shui consultations. </p> <p>\u201cI\u2019d have to consult with my lawyers to comment on my client,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd my plate is too full to take this on.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Only 14% of American Catholics have a favorable view of Muslims and Catholic media outlets tend to have a bias against Muslims, a <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://bridge.georgetown.edu/danger-dialogue-american-catholic-public-opinion-and-portrayals-of-islam/\">study</a> has found.</p> <p>The findings, carried out by the Bridge initiative, a multi-year research project that focuses on Islamophobia at Georgetown University, conducted research on how mainstream and Catholic media consumption correlates to respondents\u2019 perceptions of Islam. </p> <p>Of the 1,027 self-identified Catholics polled, only 14% said they had favorable views of Islam and one in three said they had either very or somewhat unfavorable views. However, those who know Muslims personally \u2013 only three out of 10 respondents, which is less than the national average \u2013 had far more positive views of Muslims. Those who did not know a Muslim were twice as likely to have very unfavorable views.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/01/pope-francis-says-it-not-right-to-identify-islam-with-violence\">Pope Francis says it is 'not right' to identify Islam with violence</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Father Patrick Ryan of the Society of Jesus, McGinley professor of religion at Fordham University, said Catholic people\u2019s view on Islam was unfortunately similar to the mainstream Christian American view. They tend to be, \u201crather hostile to Muslims with perceptions colored by things like 9/11 and the persecution of Christians in places like Syria\u201d.</p> <p>Inherent biases were also found among certain Catholic media outlets. Half of the time the word Islamic was mentioned between October 2014 and September 2015 in prominent Catholic media outlets, it was in relation to the Islamic State. More than 60% of readers of outlets like the Catholic World Report and Patheos Catholic Blogs said they had unfavorable views of Muslims. However, the authors note only a fraction of respondents consume Catholic media regularly. </p> <p>The report also examined the news consumption of mainstream cable news networks. It found respondents who watched Fox News have a less favorable view of Muslims than those who prefer CNN and MSNBC. About a quarter of CNN and MSNBC watchers said they have unfavorable views of Islam, compared with 39% of Fox. More than half of the people who preferred Fox News said that Islam encourages violence more than other religions. </p> <p>The outlets with the most negative sentiment in their headlines were also the outlets that mentioned Pope Francis the least. The pope has prioritized building Muslim-Catholic relations since he came to the Vatican last year, making several overtures to Muslims and Arab Christians. He has explicitly said Islam should not be associated with violent extremism, nations should embrace Syrian refugees, and he has prayed at the separation barrier at the West Bank.</p> <p>He has also called out Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump for his controversial characterizations of Islam. </p> <p>However, the pope\u2019s leadership on the issue has not completely resonated with American Catholics. Nearly half of Catholics believe Islam encourages violence more than other religions around the world, the report said. </p> <p>\u201cNot every American Catholic bishop is backing him,\u201d said Ryan, on the disconnect between American Catholics and the pope. The pope\u2019s view on Islam is informed by his relations with Muslims and Jews in Argentina, Ryan added, which most American Catholics are not engaged in. </p> <p>Muslims in the United States have become increasingly persecuted in the years since the 9/11 attacks. The rise to prominence of the Islamic State has also caused backlash for American and European Muslims. The Bridge Initiative released a study that found American Muslims were subjected to more hate crimes in 2015 than any other year since 9/11. </p> <p>Catholics were long subjected to persecution themselves in the United States. Dr Pamela Cooper-White explained that Jewish and Catholic immigrants to America in the 19th century, following mostly Protestant settlers, were viewed as exotic. </p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s always been a kind of Protestant hegemony over religion and politics,\u201d Cooper-White said. </p> <p>There was inherent distrust of Catholics and they were heavily persecuted for decades, and targeted by groups like the Klu Klux Klan. Catholic presidential candidate John F Kennedy had to give a speech to Baptist ministers to assure them that he would not take orders from the pope. Before Kennedy, Governor Al Smith of New York lost the 1928 presidential election as several churches opposed his nomination because he was Catholic. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Mainstream society has since welcomed Catholics \u2013 vice-presidential nominee Tim Kaine\u2019s Catholic roots are not a flashpoint in this election. \u201cIt\u2019s forgotten how much that was the exception for the first half of the 20th century,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cCatholics have forgotten that.\u201d</p>",

But she also acknowledged that she had her flaws and that her government had been hurt by economic crises and political instability worsened by her opponents.<br></p> <p>Later, for perhaps the first time in this process, Rousseff appeared to choke up as she recounted Workers\u2019 party achievements \u2013 the expansion of welfare payments, increased access to higher education, a rise in the minimum wage, development of offshore oilfields and the hosting of the World Cup and the Olympics. It was unclear whether this pause was from emotion or fatigue, but supporters cheered their encouragement as she paused to sip water. </p> <p>\u201cNo demonstrations please,\u201d came a reprimand from the public address system, in a tone more respectful than earlier episodes in the impeachment process.<br></p> <p>The anti-Rousseff camp in the senate was keen to avoid the boisterously triumphant scenes witnessed when the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/18/dilma-rousseff-congress-impeach-brazilian-president\">lower house voted for impeachment in April</a>, and to minimise the impression that the country\u2019s first female president is a victim.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"7914d7df8396ffc886aa510a3d4352763a702c74\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7914d7df8396ffc886aa510a3d4352763a702c74/0_63_5568_3341/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Former president Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva watches President Dilma Rousseff\u2019s appearance at her impeachment trial intently.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Former president Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva watches President Dilma Rousseff\u2019s appearance at her impeachment trial intently.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Evaristo Sa/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But that will be hard to do, as Rousseff has lived in the shadow of an impeachment threat for more than a year.<br></p> <p></p> <p>Monday\u2019s debate also set the stage for the next presidential election in 2018.

Similar fiscal irregularities went unpunished in previous national and regional administrations, but these were being used as a pretext to remove a leader who had struggled to assert her authority. Prominent senators \u2013 close to Temer \u2013 have also been secretly recorded plotting to remove Rousseff in the hope that it will kill off a wide-ranging corruption investigation \u2013 known as Lava Jato (Car Wash) \u2013 that has implicated many of them in a kickback scheme involving the state-run oil company Petrobras.<br></p> <p>Allies said there was little chance the president would survive the final impeachment vote. </p> <p>At the start of the senate process in May, opponents had already <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/12/dilma-rousseff-brazil-president-impeached-senate-vote\">secured more than the two-thirds of the 81 votes</a> they will need to remove the president from office. There has been no evident progress in changing minds since then. </p> <p>Senator Otto Alencar, of the Social Democratic party (PSD) from the north-eastern state of Bahia, revealed he would vote against the president\u2019s impeachment but said few would be swayed by Rousseff\u2019s speech.<br></p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s no crime of responsibility.

The realclearpolitics.com average of polls, however, <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/us/general_election_trump_vs_clinton-5491.html\">had him down by six</a>.</p> <p>Answering the question of just how bad things could get for Republicans, in Senate and House races as well as the general election, requires state-by-state analysis, an assessment of congressional contests and, perhaps, a little unscientific sampling of the mood.<br></p> <p>Among demographic stereotypes who ought to remain loyal to Trump, few stand out quite like the \u201cNascar dads\u201d. In 2004, these supposedly white, male and mostly southern fans of the <a href=\"http://www.dailykos.com/story/2016/3/4/1495637/-NASCAR-has-a-political-problem-and-they-just-made-it-substantially-worse\">National Association for Stock Car Auto Racing</a> were targeted by Democrats in their battle with George W Bush. In 2016, after eight years of Barack Obama, they should be a bastion of enthusiasm for Trump.</p> <p>While other former swing demographics, such as \u201csoccer moms\u201d in the suburbs, look lost to Clinton for good, white men in America\u2019s red states are at the heart of Trump\u2019s support. Early on, the campaign heralded an <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/704626119836901376?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">endorsement by Nascar boss Brian France</a> and several drivers.</p> <p>Yet recently, outside the <a href=\"http://www.nascarhall.com/\">Nascar Hall of Fame</a> in Charlotte, the mood among visiting families who spoke to the Guardian before a recent Trump rally in the city seemed at best to have stalled.</p> <p>At first, Keith, a former military man from nearby Fayetteville, home to Fort Bragg, the world\u2019s largest military base, was supportive.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m definitely against Hillary and I voted for [Trump] for the primary,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s no filter. He\u2019s gonna tell you the truth.\u201d</p> <p>North Carolina is perhaps the most important of the traditional battleground states this year. In 2012, it was the only swing state that Obama lost to Mitt Romney. Since then it has swung further to the right, replacing one of its senators with a Republican in 2014 and sitting at the centre of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/26/north-carolina-judge-transgender-bathrooms-identity-choice\">a conservative backlash</a> against transgender rights.</p> <p>Nonetheless, <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/nc/north_carolina_trump_vs_clinton-5538.html\">five of the last presidential opinion polls here have show Clinton ahead</a>. If Trump cannot win North Carolina, something is going badly wrong.</p> <p>Keith, who like many Trump voters was reluctant to give his surname, echoed the very issue that the campaign is most worried could alienate voters in increasingly diverse states like this come November.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Saying \u2018I am the only one who can fix everything you need\u2019 sounds a lot like a dictator in Latin America or North Korea</p> <footer> <cite>Mark, 35, from Connecticut</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cThe way he deals with certain things worries me,\u201d he said. \u201cImmigration is a big thing. You can\u2019t just ban a certain race from coming into the country. It doesn\u2019t work that way, especially as it\u2019s the land of the free.\u201d</p> <p>For core supporters, Trump\u2019s intolerant views and loud mouth matter less. For example, Keith\u2019s friend Kaycee, an accountant from Great Falls, Montana, was less worried: \u201cI would vote for Trump even though his social game isn\u2019t so hot. He is an incredible businessman and I really think that\u2019s what America needs right now. Sometimes he has no filter, but sometimes that\u2019s not a bad quality.\u201d</p> <p>But among floating voters, particularly in states without a tradition of voting Republican but where <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/01/trump-clinton-kaine-rust-belt-pennsylvania-ohio\">Trump\u2019s economic message is resonating</a>, people are easily turned off by the billionaire\u2019s brash style.</p> <p>\u201cFrom where I come from, they call him a bullshit artist,\u201d said Neil, a 63-year-old self-employed heating and air-conditioning contractor from Providence, Rhode Island, who was also visiting the Nascar Hall of Fame on the day Trump landed in town.</p> <p>\u201cI am not a big fan. I just don\u2019t trust what he says. He\u2019s got that very pushy attitude. From a political standpoint, I don\u2019t think he is doing that well. He just squirts off what\u2019s off the top of his head. I don\u2019t think he spends a lot time thinking about what he\u2019s saying.\u201d</p> <p>The younger voters get, the bluer the state they come from, the more Trump\u2019s style is a turn-off. Even, it turns out, for white dads at the Nascar shrine.</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s thin on policy, big on broad-based authoritarian statements,\u201d said Mark, a 35-year-old engineer from Connecticut. \u201cSaying \u2018I am the only one who can fix everything you need\u2019 sounds a lot like a dictator in Latin America or North Korea or something.</p> <p>\u201cI think he is very popular in a very narrow strip of America. That works well in a Republican primary, but not in a general election.\u201d</p> <p>A failure to capture states like North Carolina would kill Trump\u2019s hopes of winning the White House. Worse, for Republicans, the mood among potential voters here speaks to the party\u2019s concern about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/27/republican-donors-trump-congress-local-races-sheldon-adelson\">losing the control of the Senate</a> that was gained two years ago with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jun/18/north-carolina-midterm-elections-thom-tillis-obamacare\">victories like that of Thom Tillis</a>.</p> <p>Senate seats last for six years, so Tillis is safe for now, but his North Carolina colleague Richard Burr is up for re-election. He is only two points ahead of his Democratic challenger, Deborah Ross.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3615c6e777f85cd1e4553e9ad493d78de74329a5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3615c6e777f85cd1e4553e9ad493d78de74329a5/102_0_4564_2738/1000.jpg\" alt=\"American, Confederate and NRA flags fly on top of motor homes at the Daytona International Speedway in July 2015.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">American, Confederate and NRA flags fly on top of motor homes at the Daytona International Speedway, in Florida, in July 2015.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Phelan M Ebenhack/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/28/donald-trump-iowa-republican-red-state\">Welcome to Iowa, where Trump's purple patch could turn a blue state red</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Across states such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/25/senate-women-democrats-majority-power\">Pennsylvania, Michigan, Illinois, New Hampshire, Arizona, Wisconsin and Iowa</a>, there is a real fear that Trump\u2019s unpopularity could cause loyal Republicans to stay home and steer enough independents into handing control of the Senate back to Democrats.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/upshot/senate-election-forecast.html\">New York Times Upshot model</a> gives Democrats a 57% chance of winning the Senate, and may even seriously erode the Republican party\u2019s tighter grip on the House of Representatives.<br></p> <p>Such is the worry that more than 70 Republicans recently sent an <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2016/08/republicans-urge-rnc-cut-funds-trump-226918\">open letter</a> to the party\u2019s national chairman, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/28/reince-priebus-donald-trump-new-hires\">Reince Priebus</a>, urging him to divert resources away from the race for the White House and towards protecting the lead in Congress.</p> <p>\u201cIf it\u2019s truly a [Clinton] landslide, even the House may be at risk as well,\u201d former Bob Dole spokesman Andrew Weinstein, a vocal anti-Trump Republican who helped organise the petition, told MSNBC last week.</p> <p>\u201cThis guy is the Titanic.

  "<p>A law banning the full-body burkini swimsuit in France would stoke tensions between communities and would be both unconstitutional and ineffective, interior minister Bernard Cazeneuve has said.</p> <p> France\u2019s highest administrative court, the Council of State, ruled on Friday against a decision by the mayor of the resort town of Villeneuve-Loubet to ban the burkini .</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/aug/27/burkini-ban-riyadh-riviera-women-fight\">In Riyadh and the Riviera, women have to fight for the right to be themselves</a> </p> </aside>  <p> The ruling may set a precedent for the dozens of French towns that have also ordered burkini bans. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/28/french-mayors-burkini-ban-court-ruling\">After the ruling some mayors said they would refuse to lift the bans.</a></p> <p> The issue has become politically charged at the start of party primaries ahead of next year\u2019s presidential election in France, with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/26/frances-highest-court-suspends-burkini-ban-in-test-case\">several leaders on the right and far-right calling for a law prohibiting the full-body swimming costume</a> worn by some Muslim women.</p> <p> Former president Nicolas Sarkozy who is staging a political comeback and is seeking the ticket of the conservative Les Republicains in primaries set for November, has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/26/burkini-row-nicolas-sarkozy-calls-for-nationwide-ban\">called for a law allowing mayors to ban the burkini</a>.</p> <p> But Cazeneuve said in an interview with La Croix newspaper on Sunday that such a law was unlikely under the current socialist government.</p> <p> \u201cThe government ... refuses to legislate on this because a law would be unconstitutional, ineffective and likely to create antagonism and irreparable tensions,\u201d he said.</p> <p> \u201cWe do not need a new law.

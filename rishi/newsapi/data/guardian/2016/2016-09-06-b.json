  "<p>Hillary Clinton has said her husband, former president Bill Clinton, should not have to resign his role as head of their family\u2019s charitable foundation until the presidential election is decided in November. </p> <p>The Democratic nominee said she did not see any ethical problems with her husband\u2019s continued involvement with the Clinton Foundation, which raises money from wealthy donors around the world while she runs for president despite mounting criticism. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/22/bill-clinton-hillary-president-clinton-foundation-future-trump\">Clinton Foundation: Bill to quit board if Hillary becomes president</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think there are conflicts of interest,\u201d Clinton <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/exclusive-hillary-clinton-husband-bill-resign-foundation-post/story?id=41878492\">told ABC\u2019s David Muir</a> in a joint interview today with her running mate, Senator Tim Kaine, that aired in full on Tuesday. </p> <p>Bill Clinton told supporters in August that he would <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/22/bill-clinton-hillary-president-clinton-foundation-future-trump\">resign from the foundation\u2019s board</a> and stop raising money if his wife were elected. The foundation last month <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/chelsea-clinton-to-stay-on-clinton-foundation-board-if-hillary-becomes-president-1472058025\">confirmed</a> that Clinton\u2019s daughter, Chelsea Clinton, would remain on the board even if her mother won in November. </p> <p>On Tuesday, Clinton signaled that this could change. Asked whether she thought her daughter\u2019s ongoing role with the foundation would present a conflict of interest if she were elected, Clinton said she did not. </p> <p>\u201cAs I\u2019ve said over and over again ... these issues will be decided after the election and we will decide the appropriate way forward,\u201d Clinton told reporters during a press conference aboard her plane. </p> <p>In the ABC interview, Clinton also dismissed accusations that allies and donors of the Clinton Foundation received special treatment while she served as secretary of state.</p> <p>\u201cI know that that\u2019s what has been alleged and never proven. But nevertheless, I take it seriously,\u201d Clinton said in the interview, which was taped on Monday between Labor Day campaign stops. </p> <p>When Kaine was asked how he would convince voters who still find Clinton untrustworthy, he made it personal. </p> <p>\u201cI have a son in the military who is deployed overseas right now,\u201d Kaine said. \u201cI care very, very deeply about who the next commander-in-chief is. I completely count and trust Hillary Clinton to be a great commander in chief and to make the right decisions for the country. The prospect of Donald Trump making those decisions about the life of my kid and millions of service members scares me to death.\u201d</p> <p>Clinton and her campaign pointed to a more recent<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2016/09/01/trump-pays-irs-a-penalty-for-his-foundation-violating-rules-with-gift-to-florida-attorney-general/\"> Washington Post report</a> that revealed the Republican presidential nominee paid a $2,500 penalty to the Internal Revenue Service for a 2013 donation from his charitable organization to an organization associated with the Florida attorney general, Pam Bondi. At the time, Bondi was debating whether to investigate the now defunct Trump University. She decided against it. </p> <p>\u201cThe fact that a Hillary Clinton presidency would be compromised by tens of millions of dollars in foreign donations to the Clinton Foundation is no laughing matter either \u2013 it is downright terrifying,\u201d said Jason Miller, a spokesman for the Trump campaign. \u201cWhen that 3am phone call comes, we can\u2019t have an ethically challenged president on the line who took truckloads of cash from other countries.\u201d </p> <p>Earlier on Tuesday, Clinton questioned her opponent\u2019s readiness to be the commander-in-chief and his grasp of foreign policy during a campaign event in Tampa, Florida, while her running mate delivered a speech on national security in North Carolina.<br></p> <p>\u201cHis whole campaign has been one long insult to all those who have worn the uniform,\u201d Clinton told a crowd, adding that a \u201cman who is so wrong about our veterans isn\u2019t right to serve as commander-in-chief\u201d.</p> <p>Clinton also attacked Trump over his inconsistencies on how to defeat Islamic State, quipping: \u201cHe says he has a secret plan to defeat Isis. But the secret is he has no plan.\u201d</p> <p>She continued: \u201cWhen it comes to fighting Isis, he has been all over the map. You would have to literally map it out. He has talked about letting Syria become a free zone for Isis. Look at the map, Donald. He has talked about sending in American ground troops. Not on my watch.\u201d </p>",

  "<p>Donald Trump\u2019s claims that if he loses in November it will be due to a \u201crigged\u201d election have sparked strong bipartisan criticism from election lawyers, donors and a former member of Congress who warn that the Republican candidate\u2019s words are dangerous, fueling doubts about the election\u2019s legitimacy and potentially leading to voter intimidation.</p> <p>As his poll numbers have weakened and his high-decibel spats with critics escalated, Trump has raised the specter of rigged elections and suggested that if he loses it might well be because of voter fraud. </p> <p>\u201cThe only way we can lose, in my opinion, I really mean this, Pennsylvania, is if cheating goes on,\u201d Trump told a largely white rally last month in Altoona, Pennsylvania. \u201cGo down to certain areas and watch and study [to] make sure other people don\u2019t come in and vote five times.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to have unbelievable turnout, but we don\u2019t want to see people voting five times,\u201d Trump added, saying that he had \u201cheard some stories about certain parts of the state and we have to be very careful\u201d.</p> <p>Several election lawyers and analysts are disturbed by Trump\u2019s combustible use of language.</p> <p>\u201cTrump\u2019s rhetoric is troubling and casts a shadow over the legitimacy of the elections,\u201d said Ken Gross, a well-known election lawyer in Washington who represents both Republican and Democratic clients. \u201cTrump\u2019s words may motivate people to go to polling places and potentially intimidate people not to vote.\u201d </p> <p>The idea that \u201celections are rigged and there\u2019s widespread fraud is not backed up by facts\u201d, he said.</p> <p>Others echo these concerns. \u201cTo argue that the process is rigged and prepare people for a supposedly illegitimate outcome is a very dangerous thing,\u201d former Reublican representative Vin Weber told the Guardian. \u201cWhat you want is to have a civil peaceful election [and] you don\u2019t want to disrupt that.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/sep/06/donald-trump-tax-returns-hillary-clinton-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/52vdg\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2696938\"            data-video-name=\"Hillary Clinton: 'Trump clearly has something to hide' in tax returns \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"AP\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57cf3270e4b0bc856be626ee\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/09/06/160906Clinton_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/09/06/160906Clinton.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/09/06/160906Clinton_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/sep/06/donald-trump-tax-returns-hillary-clinton-video\">Hillary Clinton: \u2018Trump clearly has something to hide\u2019 in tax returns</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>One prominent GOP election lawyer says that Trump\u2019s fears are overblown, stressing that the \u201cfar right has been worked up about voter fraud for the last five to 10 years, but there\u2019s little evidence that this type of activity is material. I don\u2019t like it when people talk about issues that haven\u2019t happened yet, or are phantom issues\u201d.</p> <p>Recent studies indicate that voter fraud is not widespread. Only 31 cases of possible in-person voter fraud were found from 2000 to 2014, during which period over 1bn votes were cast in general and primary elections, according to a study by Justin Levitt, a professor at Loyola Law School.</p> <p>Nonetheless, Trump\u2019s ominous warnings seem part of a new campaign mantra. The candidate voiced similar views this summer in an <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/for-trump-a-new-rigged-system-the-election-itself/2016/08/02/d9fb33b0-58c4-11e6-9aee-8075993d73a2_story.html\">interview with The Washington Post</a> and on Fox News with Sean Hannity. </p> <p>Trump complained to the Post that recent court decisions nixing restrictive voter ID laws could well lead to voter fraud, calling this a \u201cvery unfair development. We may have people vote 10 times\u201d. Likewise on Hannity, Trump urged supporters to begin \u201cwatching closely\u201d lest the election be \u201ctaken away from us\u201d.</p> <p>On the campaign trail in Ohio Trump declared: \u201cI\u2019m afraid the election is going to be rigged. I have to be honest.\u201d</p> <p>Moreover, the candidate\u2019s website boasts a section that not only informs supporters how they can be a \u201cvolunteer Trump election observer\u201d, but also echoes Trump\u2019s heated rhetoric about election rigging. Those who sign up to be volunteers receive emails explaining that the campaign intends to do \u201ceverything that we are legally allowed to do to stop crooked Hillary from rigging the election\u201d. The website notes that volunteers would be useful in Ohio and Pennsylvania.</p> <p>There is nothing wrong with Trump talking about training poll watchers as campaigns have long done, stresses Larry Noble, a former general counsel at the Federal Election Commission who now holds the same title at the nonpartisan Campaign Legal Center. \u201cBut if he\u2019s suggesting, as it appears he is, that his supporters should take any actions that would result in intimidation of voters, that\u2019s illegal.\u201d</p> <p>Adds Charlie Black, a veteran GOP operative: \u201cIf it was my campaign, I\u2019d let the lawyers handle any potential voter fraud.\u201d </p> <p>Some conservative groups have echoed Trump\u2019s fears about rigged elections.</p> <p>Right-leaning groups \u2013 including Judicial Watch and True the Vote \u2013 are calling for extra vigilance, and raising money off the issue. Judicial Watch has rolled out an \u201cElection Integrity Project\u201d which warns voters that \u201cthe integrity of our elections is under systematic assault by leftists and politicians whose objective is clearly to manipulate the elections for their own gains\u201d. The project charges that certain states are refusing to clean their voter rolls of the deceased and people who have moved and has filed suits in some states to force them to do so.</p> <p>Outside experts disagree with the premise that there\u2019s a link between voter rolls and voter fraud. \u201cIn-person voter fraud is virtually nonexistent and is a myth that has been used to to justify voter restrictions like photo IDs,\u201d said Gerry Hebert, the executive director of the Campaign Legal Center. </p> <p>And Hebert adds that filing a lawsuit to clean up voter rolls \u201cis not proof of voter fraud\u201d.</p> <p>But Trump allies have continued to stoke fears of fraud. Longtime Trump confidante Roger Stone, who has offered periodic advice during the campaign and publicly raised the specter of a rigged election, told Breitbart News that the government \u201cwill be shut down if they attempt to steal this election and swear Hillary in\u201d.</p> <p>Some GOP operatives poke fun at Trump\u2019s fears of a \u201crigged\u201d election \u2013 especially in Pennsylvania.</p> <p>\u201cTrump\u2019s comments make perfect sense coming from a paranoid narcissist,\u201d quipped Rick Tyler, a former spokesman for Senator Ted Cruz, noting that the GOP \u201chasn\u2019t won Pennsylvania in a presidential election since 1988\u201d.</p> <p>But other critics see graver threats in Trump\u2019s words.</p> <p> \u201cIf people start to believe that elections aren\u2019t legitimate then it could encourage anarchy and despotism,\u201d said Michael Epstein, a GOP donor and fundraiser who initially backed Governor Scott Walker in the primaries. \u201cIf you lose respect for government, anything is possible.\u201d</p>"

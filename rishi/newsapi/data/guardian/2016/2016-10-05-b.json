  "<p>If you decided to skip the vice-presidential debate on Tuesday evening and just tune into to the late night talk shows to get all of your information (and, these days, the gap between comedy and news is forever narrowing), then you probably came away thinking only one thing: the debate for the second most powerful job in the free world was dreadfully boring. (Jimmy Kimmel had to recuse himself from comment since he is actually <a href=\"http://jk4vp.com/\">running for vice-president</a>.)</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/05/tim-kaine-vp-debate-mike-pence-what-we-learned\">Tim Kaine shouldn't try standup \u2013 and other things we learned at the VP debate</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Stephen Colbert said the moderator at the contest between Donald Trump\u2019s running mate Mike Pence and Hillary Clinton\u2019s would-be second-in-command, Tim Kaine, told the audience to \u201cmuffle your yawns, silence your blinks, and apply the Breathe Right strip before you fall asleep in your seats\u201d.</p> <p>The Daily Show spent most of its live broadcast after the debate talking about how lackluster the whole thing was. Trevor Noah flat-out said: \u201cThe debate was boring. It was boring as hell.\u201d He joked that it was so boring that the ratings showed that \u201c80 million people had <em tabindex=\"-1\">not</em> watched the debate\u201d, adding that it was the first time a broadcast had negative ratings. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPtcDrbUa1A\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/HPtcDrbUa1A?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>\u201cIt was the biggest white guy argument in history,\u201d Noah said. He saw little differentiation between the two candidates and said that if they were both bags you were picking up at the airport you would definitely get them mixed up. </p> <p>However, he saw that each candidate had a distinctive job to do. Tim Kaine had to seem affable and lifelike to counteract Clinton, \u201cwho died six weeks ago\u201d, and Mike Pence had to make some of Donald Trump\u2019s crazier statements seem palatable. He said Pence\u2019s performance was sponsored by Febreze and that he was basically spraying the air freshener and saying, \u201cNothing smells here. Nothing smells here.\u201d </p> <p>Ultimately, Noah was swayed by Pence\u2019s defenses of Trump, saying that they were so believable it almost made him want to vote for Pence. However, he made a very apt analogy for his reverence. \u201c[Pence] is the guy who\u2019s not good at convincing his friend not to drive drunk but is very good at convincing the cop that his friend isn\u2019t drunk,\u201d he said. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyjAw7-eKIs\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/MyjAw7-eKIs?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Stephen Colbert, who was also performing live after the debate, came down for Pence, though it wasn\u2019t with much distinction. \u201cIt was like watching a loaf of white bread get pistol-whipped by a jar of mayonnaise,\u201d he said. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t much flavor, but there was a clear winner.\u201d </p> <p>Colbert then spent the majority of his monologue poking at Pence, particularly because he signed a \u201creligious freedom\u201d bill into law in Indiana that allows businesses to refuse services to gay customers. He said that Pence saying that he \u201cspends a bit of time on his knees every day\u201d was evidence that he is \u201cvery close with Vladimir Putin\u201d. Then he chided Pence for when he accused Kaine of \u201c<a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/05/that-mexican-thing-mike-pence-vice-presidential-debate\">whipping out that Mexican thing again</a>\u201d. Sure does sound kinky. </p> <p>He concluded that he was \u201cfuzzing\u201d happy that the debate was over but ultimately concluded that it would really have no bearing on the election. \u201cThe team with the best vice-quarterback always wins the Super Bowl,\u201d he said sarcastically. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6D1U6MGODEY\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/6D1U6MGODEY?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Unlike his performance after the presidential debates, Seth Meyers\u2019 show was not live and didn\u2019t spend much time talking about the debate, especially since there was much more important international news to talk about: Kim Kardashian\u2019s robbery. Still, he echoed the general sense that the face-off was a little bland. \u201cIt was pretty much the same debate I had with my wife about what color to paint the foyer,\u201d he said. \u201cDo we want eggshell or ivory?\u201d </p>",
  "<p>In the final stretch of a presidential campaign that has seen little sustained debate over reproductive rights, Tuesday night\u2019s vice-presidential debate brought the issue of abortion firmly into focus. </p> <p>It started with Republican Mike Pence on the attack, accusing Tim Kaine and Hillary Clinton \u2013 <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/feb/10/marco-rubio/marco-rubio-says-hillary-clinton-supports-abortion/\">falsely</a> \u2013 of actively supporting an outlawed form of abortion late into pregnancy. Kaine shot back with a litany of attacks on Donald Trump and his running mate\u2019s harsh promises to outlaw abortion, including Trump\u2019s promise to nominate supreme court justices who will overturn any right to the procedure.</p> <p>\u201cGovernor Pence wants to repeal Roe v Wade. He said he wants to put it on the ash heap of history,\u201d the Democrat said. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you trust women? Why doesn\u2019t Donald Trump trust women to make this choice for themselves?\u201d</p> <p>It was the rare moment in the general election campaign when abortion issues have taken a front seat. That is despite Trump\u2019s selection of Pence as his running mate fueled expectations that the culture wars would loom large. Pence, who first made his name as one of the most anti-abortion members of Congress, rose to national prominence as the Indiana governor who signed a highly contentious and economically damaging set of restrictions on LGBT rights. </p> <p>Instead, divisive issues such as abortion and the rights of LGBT people have gotten little more than a perfunctory nod from the Republican standard bearer. Clinton speaks regularly on the stump about her support for LGBT and abortion rights. But the issue has seldom been the subject of her fiery clashes with Trump.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/05/vice-presidential-debate-pence-kaine-trump-clinton\">Trump on trial: Kaine calls on Pence to defend running mate in debate</a> </p> </aside>  <p>On Tuesday night, their running mates more than made up for that. </p> <p>Pence began the exchange by falsely accusing his opponent and Clinton of supporting the practice of \u201cpartial-birth abortion\u201d. Congress already has imposed a national ban on \u201cpartial-birth abortion\u201d, which is a political moniker, not a medical one. In 2007, the supreme court upheld the ban. And neither Clinton nor Pence has ever advocated for reviving the procedure.</p> <p>Pence also touted his state\u2019s efforts to expand anti-abortion counseling for pregnant women. But the source of the funding has been controversial: In one case, Indiana\u2019s health department <a href=\"http://www.indystar.com/story/news/2015/10/13/state-awards-35-million-contract-anti-abortion-organization-pregnancy-services/73819882/\">furnished $3.5m</a> to a Pennsylvania-based anti-abortion counseling group from the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program. TANF funds are traditionally earmarked to provide food and shelter for pregnant women or families with young children.</p> <p>Setting off a heated exchange, Kaine responded by highlighting Trump\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/mar/30/donald-trump-women-abortions-punishment\">remarks</a>, in late March, that women ought to face \u201csome form of punishment\u201d for having illegal abortions.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/04/mike-pence-led-anti-lgbt-backlash-trump\">Before he was Trump's running mate, Mike Pence led the anti-LGBT backlash</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Trump\u2019s threat is a salient one in Pence\u2019s Indiana. In 2015, Indiana became the first state where a woman, Purvi Patel, was sentenced to serious prison time for attempting her own abortion. Pence did not sign the law under which Patel was convicted, but neither has he used his power to change it. In fact, pro-abortion rights activists have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/22/purvi-patel-abortion-sentence-reduced\">pleaded with Pence</a> to clarify the law so it can\u2019t be used in the future to punish other women. So far, Pence has refused.</p> <p>On Tuesday, Pence denied that Trump\u2019s words were sincere, saying, \u201cDonald Trump and I would never support legislation that punished women.\u201d</p> <p>Trump\u2019s position on abortion has constantly shifted.<br></p> <p>Of particular concern to some evangelicals, Trump\u2019s position on abortion has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/16/donald-trump-abortion-coalition-public-funding-planned-parenthood\">shifted over the years</a>. He declared himself to be \u201cvery pro-choice\u201d in 1999 and didn\u2019t publicly change his stance until 2011, when he first toyed with the idea of running for president as a Republican. </p> <p>This election cycle, Trump has antagonized anti-abortion groups by referring to reproductive health organization Planned Parenthood as helping millions of women and saying decisions such as Roe v Wade \u2013 the supreme court ruling that established a woman\u2019s right to an abortion \u2013 are set in stone. The Susan B Anthony List, the country\u2019s foremost anti-abortion political action committee, kicked off the Republican primaries by <a href=\"https://www.sba-list.org/home/pro-life-women-sound-the-alarmdonald-trump-is-unacceptable\">urging voters</a> to \u201csupport anyone but Donald Trump,\u201d saying he \u201ccannot be trusted\u201d to oppose abortion. Trump eventually made peace with anti-abortion groups by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/16/donald-trump-abortion-coalition-public-funding-planned-parenthood\">adopting</a> the standard Republican platform on abortion wholesale. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/04/vp-nominees-tim-kaine-mike-pence-catholic\">Kaine and Pence: two Catholic-inspired visions with little else in common</a> </p> </aside>  <p>On the Democratic side, there is more talk of reproductive rights. Clinton has staked out new territory with vocal support for the use of public funds to pay for abortion. Her platform calls for repealing the Hyde amendment, a budget rider which has prevented women from using Medicaid to cover abortion services for more then 40 years. </p> <p>But her choice of Kaine as a running mate caused skepticism among progressive circles over the Virginia senator\u2019s personal support for the Hyde amendment. \u201cI have been for the Hyde amendment and I haven\u2019t changed my position on that,\u201d Kaine told CNN shortly after joining Clinton\u2019s ticket. An aide later clarified that Kaine, despite his personal opinions, \u201cwill stand with Secretary Clinton to defend a woman\u2019s right to choose, to repeal the Hyde amendment. Voters can be 100% confident that Tim Kaine is going to fight to protect a woman\u2019s right to choose.\u201d </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/04/vp-nominees-tim-kaine-mike-pence-catholic\">Both Kaine and Pence are Catholics</a> who have said their faith informs their governing on issues ranging from the death penalty to needle exchanges. Abortion came up after the moderator, CBS anchor Elaine Quijano, asked the two men about the role their faith has played in their political decision-making. </p> <p>Quijano posed the question as a catch-all query on \u201csocial issues\u201d. The result was that the debate never touched on the biggest issue looming over either candidate \u2013 the anti-LGBT \u201creligious liberty\u201d bill that Pence signed amid national condemnation in 2015.</p> <p>The law green-lighted several forms of discrimination against gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender individuals under the guise of religious beliefs. Facing pressure from dozens of major corporations, which threatened to pull their business from Indiana, Pence eventually softened the bill\u2019s restrictions.</p>",
  "<p>Television spinoffs are all the rage at the moment. The Netflix show Luke Cage came from Jessica Jones. Punisher is being spawned from Daredevil. Better Call Saul was sired by Breaking Bad.</p> <p>So it makes sense that the 2016 presidential election would get in on the act, commissioning the one-off vice-presidential debate after the success of its parent series, The Presidential Debates.</p> <p>Here are the takeaways.</p> <h2><strong>We got closer to learning which vice-presidential candidate is which</strong></h2> <p>Before Tuesday\u2019s night\u2019s debate 40% of Americans <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/40-percent-americans-vp-candidates/story?id=42497013\">could not name either vice-presidential candidate</a>, let alone tell them apart.</p> <p>Thanks to the hour-and-a-half slog, we now have at least some sense of which one is Virginia senator Tim Kaine and which one is Indiana governor Mike Pence.</p> <p>Tim Kaine is the yappy little puppy. He interrupted too much and was a little bit too keen. Pence is the overly relaxed one who had his face permanently set to condescension.</p> <p>If you only saw photos from the debate: Kaine looks like a friar who has drunk too much mead. Pence <a href=\"http://media.salon.com/2015/03/mike_pence3.jpg\">looks like</a> he has been embalmed.</p> <h2><strong>Sometimes commercial breaks are a good thing</strong></h2> <p>Did anyone really want to watch two men in their late 50s argue for 90 minutes straight? </p> <p>This was one of the rare occasions where television viewing would have been improved by the show being broken up. It certainly would have been more humane.</p> <p>Three commercial breaks during Tuesday\u2019s debate would have been perfect. One to use the bathroom, one to fetch refreshments, and an extra one in case of emergencies.</p> <h2><strong>Pre-cooked lines are terrible</strong></h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoPu1UIBkBc\">Ronald Reagan had a good one once</a>, but he was actually an actor. Tim Kaine is not an actor, and it showed in his delivery on Tuesday night.

But the problem is we have tasted Trump now. It tastes awful, obviously, but it has rendered everything else bland by comparison.</p> <p>Kaine and Pence did not call each other names. They did not insult whole groups of people. Neither man referred to his phallus.</p> <p>Consequently, neither came across as unequivocally odious. </p> <p>We\u2019re used to turning on a debate and sitting back while Trump shoots himself in the foot, as Kaine might say. Kaine and Pence didn\u2019t so much as stub their toe.</p> <p>Pence defended Trump and Trump\u2019s views, but he did it pleasantly, like a smiling sales assistant telling you he won\u2019t honour your return even though you have a receipt. Trump is the mechanic who chases you out of his garage with a wrench after destroying your car.</p> <p>Trump returns on Sunday for the penultimate presidential debate. Enjoy it while it lasts.</p>",

Helena Smith reports: </p> <blockquote> <p>Anger over the incendiary issue of home repossessions intensified as clashes broke out while a court in the northern metropolis convened over the issue. Judges were forced to adjourn the hearing as protestors, who have formed a citizens group called Collectives Against Auctions, rioted with police reinforcements sent to guard the building. Last week, the same group managed to stop a similar hearing over the foreclosure of a home belonging to a man who had defaulted on a \u20ac300,000 bank loan after storming the court room. The man, a father- of-six, who also owed \u20ac80,000 to the social security fund, claimed he had been unable to meet loan repayments after his business went bust and he had suffered a heart attack that had left him almost wholly incapacitated.</p> <p>Home repossessions are widely seen as a tipping point for Greeks at the sharp end of the biting austerity that has been the price of the debt-stricken country\u2019s rescue from insolvency. </p> <p>But within the 19-member eurozone Greece is also the champion in non-performing loans with the International Monetary Fund estimating that of the \u20ac900bn worth of bad loans in the area around \u20ac100bn belong to the portfolios of Greek banks. By contrast the Greek economy accounts for a mere 1.5 per cent of the eurozone. The IMF and the EU, which have poured over \u20ac300bn in bailout funds into the country since mid 2010, are now pressuring the government to relax protection laws against home foreclosures. In the months ahead the wave of repossessions is expected to grow amid escalating concerns that the issue is assuming explosive proportions. Indicatively Michalis Sallas, the long-serving chairman of Piraeus Bank until resigning in July, recently warned: \u201cCitizens cannot live with the fear of expulsion and repossession. It is to nobody\u2019s benefit, not even the banks. Who will insure [properties], who will look after them, who will pay property tax?\u201d </p> <p>The Greek real estate market \u2013 with the exception of that on popular Greek islands \u2013 is among the worst performing worldwide, with properties in Athens having lost up to 70 percent of their value since the crisis began. </p> </blockquote> <p><em>On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the evening.

Actors stand in sober formation to address the audience. Descriptive sentences are parceled out to actors and dialogue takes the backseat to pontificating and political speechifying. Characters aren\u2019t much more than mouthpieces.</p> <p>The mouthpiece with the best words is Doremus Jessup, played by Tom Nelis. A social-democratic newspaper editor (from Vermont of all places), Jessup is the wry voice of reason. He knows those who express certainty that there\u2019s no way Americans will elect Buzz Windrip are \u201coverestimating the country\u201d. Played bigly by David Kelly, Senator Berzelius \u201cBuzz\u201d Windrip is a charismatic charlatan who spins stagecraft and peddles fears.</p> <p>Taccone and Cohen sprinkle Trumpiness throughout their adaptation. Resemblances to today\u2019s headlines are like a theatrical round of Where\u2019s Waldo. Windrip, we hear, \u201cpretended he was his own publicity man\u201d, telling reporters that he \u201cwas the smartest man on Earth\u201d. At a rally, Windrip kicks out a commie, yelling, \u201cGet him out \u2026 Get him out of here! \u2026 In the good old days we would\u2019ve known what to do with this boy.\u201d</p> <p>These nimble additions put a fresh orange coat on the 1934 narrative but Sinclair Lewis\u2019s original book was eerily on the nose. Lewis describes Windrip as \u201cvulgar, almost illiterate, a public liar easily detected, and in his \u201cideas\u201d almost idiotic\u201d. He is backed by \u201cThe League of Forgotten Men\u201d \u2013 men who would fit well into a basket of deplorables one imagines. To add to the festive election spirit, the theater audience is instructed to cheer and boo on command. Placards are thrust into our hands. Flags are waved.</p> <p>But after Windrip is elected, the play loses some of its cleverness. The genre shifts to wartime noir as paramilitary thugs squash dissent, martial law is imposed, jails spill over into concentration camps and a resistance movement forms. But for all the high stakes suspense and totalitarian brutality, the stage action fizzles. It\u2019s hard to care about resistance fighters who spout undiluted ideology. </p> <p>To the extent that there are parallels to contemporary politics in the play\u2019s second half, it\u2019s the Bush administration that one sees reflected \u2013 scoundrels exploiting patriotism and snatching liberties in the name of freedom. Lewis even anticipated <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/nov/06/sorryforthefreedomfries\">freedom fries</a>; Jessup recalls the war hysteria that had them calling sauerkraut liberty cabbage.</p> <p>From our vantage point, this as an eerily prescient foreshadowing of current affairs. But like some other politically knowing dystopian narratives, (Orwell\u2019s 1984<em> </em>for one) Lewis was writing about the state of his own contemporary society. His objective was to take down presidential hopeful Huey Long \u2013 who was actually assassinated before the election. In Sinclair Lewis\u2019s call to arms, the fearless journalist and his printing press is the final image that inspires hope for political change. Eighty-one years later, Americans might be forgiven for believing that that won\u2019t happen here.</p>",
  "<h2>Kaine attacks; Pence rolls with the punches</h2> <p>Donald Trump was put on trial in his absence during the vice-presidential debate as his running mate, Mike Pence, was accused of trying to defend the indefensible. \u201cThings don\u2019t always come out exactly the way he means,\u201d Pence said of Trump in a polished performance that may have given some hope to Republicans.

  "<p>Trump isn\u2019t <em>fit</em> to serve as president of the United States. Clinton isn\u2019t relating <em>emotionally</em> to the electorate. These points of contention seem to be at the heart of debates around this year\u2019s presidential election. Gone is the traditional division between left and right, or liberalism and conservatism. What we are seeing instead, is a competition between technocracy and populism.</p> <p>It is little surprise that this election has been described as a choice between the \u201clesser of two evils\u201d. We have a reliable, if uncharismatic, policy wonk on one hand; and an entertaining, if unpredictable, maverick on the other. And it is this opposition \u2013 competence v charisma \u2013 rather than substantive policy disagreements, that is framing the election.</p> <p>Consider that, when it comes to policy positions, these two candidates are among the most <em>different</em> in recent memory. Yet such differences don\u2019t really seem to be at the center of attention, either for the candidates themselves, or the public at large.</p> <p>In their recent debate, Clinton said explicitly that she intends to \u201cincrease taxes\u201d for the rich and address the \u201csystemic racism\u201d of the country\u2019s criminal justice system: positions that not even Obama had dared to take so plainly four or eight years ago. Trump instead declared he intends to lower taxes for the top income brackets and dismissed the problem of racism as a question of \u201claw and order\u201d. Similarly, on international trade, they took almost diametrically opposed stances: Clinton sees it as a factor of growth and stability, whereas Trump says trade is \u201ckilling our country\u201d.</p> <p>Yet all this somehow remains in the background. The real core of what Clinton was attempting to communicate is that she is more competent than her rival, because she has greater policy expertise. This explains her reliance on the opinion of \u201cindependent experts\u201d to make the case for her economic plan, as well as the insistence on \u201cfact-checking\u201d Trump\u2019s assertions.</p> <p>Conversely, most of Trump\u2019s efforts went into depicting Clinton as a political insider, who is responsible for the \u201cmess\u201d the country is supposedly in at the moment, while presenting himself as a \u201cstrong leader\u201d who can solve the country\u2019s problems precisely by virtue of his decisive and unconventional approach.</p> <p>The roots of this populist drift in the Republican party go back several decades. Although the party\u2019s current establishment professes to be outraged by at least some of Trump\u2019s excesses, there is a direct line of continuity running from the late 1990s\u2019 bid to impeach Bill Clinton over the Lewinsky affair, to George W Bush\u2019s self-presentation as the candidate one would \u201cmost like to have beer with\u201d, the choice of Sarah Palin as John McCain\u2019s running mate in 2012 and many features of Trump\u2019s current campaign.</p> <p>The Democrats\u2019 response has been to move progressively towards the center, assuming the mantle of \u201creason\u201d and \u201crespectability\u201d, while presenting their rivals as irresponsible mavericks. No wonder the substantive policy differences between them have fallen into the background: when politics is structured around the opposition between competent technocrats on one hand and anti-establishment populists on the other, there is little room left for substantive policy disagreement in the middle.</p> <p>Nor is America alone in this shift. The debate over Brexit in the UK was fought along the same axis of opposition. The core of the Remain campaign\u2019s argument rested on the opinion of \u201cexperts\u201d, according to which leaving the European Union would have had objectively catastrophic consequences for the country. In contrast, the Leave campaign appealed to many of the same sentiments that underscore Trump\u2019s appeal: widespread anti-establishment feeling, guttural nationalism and concerns about immigration and international trade.</p> <p>The paradox is that all this is depoliticizing public debate, precisely as campaigns become more bitter and conflictual. Democratic politics depends on the confrontation between rival political agendas and ideological visions. But in the struggle between technocrats and populists all we are left with is the choice between preserving the system as it is or burning it all to the ground. For those who want meaningful political alternatives, this doesn\u2019t bode well. <br></p>",

It\u2019s a nice touch, much like the permanently pained look on his face. </p> <p>But at Tuesday\u2019s vice-presidential debate, it wasn\u2019t entirely clear why Pence was so unhappy. Was he opposed to every word coming out of Tim Kaine\u2019s mouth? Or was he just dismayed at his own situation?</p> <p>It\u2019s not easy campaigning as Donald Trump\u2019s running mate. You can\u2019t admit the obvious: that your presidential candidate is hiding his tax returns, stoking racism and spooking allies around the world. </p> <p>So you have to deny Trump\u2019s quotes, or accuse your opponent of hurling insults. But most of all, you have to look affable while your running mate looked irascible.</p> <p>In that sense, Pence succeeded in beating his boss. The problem is: so did Kaine. </p> <p>If Kaine had one job, it was to repeat as loudly and frequently as possible all the dumb and offensive words that have tumbled out of Trump\u2019s curled lips.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/04/vice-president-debate-fact-check-mike-pence-tim-kaine\">VP debate fact-check: Mike Pence and Tim Kaine's claims reviewed</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It wasn\u2019t a pretty night for the Democratic veep pick.

While Pence kept his cool, Kaine tried to imitate Joe Biden\u2019s interruption-heavy performance against Paul Ryan in 2012 \u2013 without half his charisma. Kaine\u2019s biggest downfall, though, may not have been about tone. </p> <p>Compared to Kaine, Pence told a compelling \u2013 if terrifyingly cynical and blatantly false \u2013 story of a country that has lost its way, and how he and Trump intend to restore it. \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d might be one of the best political slogans of the past decade. But Trump owes its creation to people such as Margaret Thatcher and Reagan, who worked to spread the neoliberal gospel that\u2019s now seeped into both parties. That evangelizing project has been incredibly successful, with each candidate airing concerns about government spending, personal responsibility and the limits of American coffers.</p> <p>There were glaring omissions tonight, too. Despite a series of increasingly brutal projections about the likelihood of catastrophic global warming, talk of climate change was limited to a few coded words at the debate\u2019s start, like the mythical \u201cwar on coal\u201d and \u201cclean energy jobs of tomorrow.\u201d A cringe-worthy conversation about criminal justice reform somehow managed not to breach mass incarceration. And a brief discussion of reproductive rights \u2013 one that should have been up top given Pence\u2019s deplorable record on the issue \u2013 got shunted to the very end.</p> <p>The Democratic party has spent the past several decades pivoting around terms of debate set by the right. Kaine\u2019s loss in tonight\u2019s debate showed just how much work the Democrats \u2013 and the social movements pushing them \u2013 need to do to recenter the conversation. </p> <p>More than the \u201cintelligence surge\u201d Kaine and Clinton keep pushing, the Democratic party needs a surge in imagination, to do more than play defense against attacks from across the aisle and propose transformative solutions, in line with the pain many Americans today are facing.

Two experienced politicians dispatched to further the rhetoric of their campaigns and defend the candidates at the top of the ticket. Neither disappointed. </p> <p>At the start, when asked what made him a good candidate for the vice-presidency, Kaine faltered. Looking down, he rushed a heavily scripted first answer, told through the filter of Clinton\u2019s point of view, that took too long and strained to connect back to the question. Kaine directed his entire answer off camera, which greatly reduced his engagement with the television audience. </p> <p>Pence restated Trump\u2019s conservative positions, doubling down on wealth and whiteness for the win. Pence tried to spin away from Kaine\u2019s points on policy, using plain speak \u2013 the common language of the Trump campaign. When Kaine pushed Pence on social security, all that Pence could offer was: \u201cThere they go again.

Kaine spoke of \u201ccommunity policing\u201d and \u201cbuilding bonds of understanding\u201d while Pence seemed annoyed with the topic and impatiently attempted to dress down his opponent by saying \u201c\u2026 enough of seeking every opportunity to demean law enforcement broadly by making the accusation of implicit bias every time tragedy occurs\u201d. A frightening reality check for minorities. </p> <p>On immigration, Pence offered more thinly veiled hate with \u201ctoo often with criminal aliens in the country, it\u2019s bringing heartbreak\u201d. If only Kaine had challenged him right then and there. As the debate went on, Kaine grew stronger, relying less on prepared statements and messages, and listening and responding in real time. <br></p> <p>In the words of Kaine: \u201cFrom the fullness of the heart, the mouth speaks ...

Whatever the accuracy of Kaine\u2019s attacks on Trump \u2013 and make no mistake, they were often accurate \u2013 Kaine\u2019s style was excessive.

Performance matters. </p> <p>Pence won the debate by a landslide, and it\u2019s hard to imagine there will be many in the media who will even attempt to claim otherwise. The only question is how his running mate\u2019s fragile ego will react when all those who panned his debate skills praise Pence\u2019s. <br></p>",
  "<p>Charles Harder is in a combative mood.

But while the suit elicited <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3769798/Melania-Trump-retraction.html\">a rare retraction and apology</a> from the paper, Harder has not been swayed and will be pursuing litigation.<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/01/melania-trump-daily-mail-lawsuit\">Melania Trump sues the Daily Mail for $150m over 'lies' about her past</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201c[The Mail\u2019s apology] came several weeks after they had published their original article, knowing that it was going to be republished by lots of different publications, and it was republished,\u201d he says. \u201cThen we had to do what we could do to get retractions across the board, but still, there were hundreds and hundreds of publications that ended up reporting about this horrible lie that the Daily Mail had perpetuated. The damage had been done.\u201d</p> <p>The only reason the Mail published a retraction, Harder maintains, was to try to minimise damages that it could be held responsible for, \u201cbut I think the end result will be they will be held accountable for all of the damages that they caused\u201d. There is little chance of any developments in the Trump case before the presidential election, but a court in Maryland, where the lawsuit was filed, has scheduled a status conference in December. </p> <p>Harder, 46, grew up in Encino, Los Angeles, where his father was a financial consultant and his mother a homemaker. He attended the University of California, Santa Cruz, where he became involved in student politics, and later enrolled in law school at Loyola. \u201cI grew out of politics and when I was in law school, I needed a job after I finished to pay off all my student loans, which were massive,\u201d he says.</p> <p>He went on to work for a series of firms <a href=\"http://hmafirm.com/attorney/charles-j-harder/\">before starting his own</a>, and made a name for himself representing high-profile clients such as Sandra Bullock, Bradley Cooper, George Clooney, and Clint Eastwood, mainly in disputes involving advertising. In essence, Harder kept the stars\u2019 names off products they had not officially endorsed, such as jewellery, movie projectors and even ottomans.</p> <p>His battle with what he terms the \u201cirresponsible\u201d press dates back to 1999, but it was in 2012 when his name began circulating in popular news stories. In that year, Harder was hired by writer and actor Lena Dunham, at the height of her success with the HBO series Girls, to demand that Gawker take down a $3.7m book proposal which the website had acquired and published without her permission \u2013 Gawker eventually obliged.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"72dd3608db07722944908f30d23181a29d4b4887\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/72dd3608db07722944908f30d23181a29d4b4887/0_109_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Charles Harder with Hulk Hogan during the case against Gawker.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Charles Harder with Hulk Hogan during the case against Gawker.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gerardo Mora/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Around the same time, Gawker posted a clip from the former professional wrestler Hulk Hogan\u2019s sex tape. Hogan, whose real name is Terry Bollea, hired personal lawyer David Houston to ask Gawker to remove the video, and when the publisher refused, citing first amendment rights, Houston asked Harder to file a lawsuit against Gawker and its founder, Nick Denton, for invasion of privacy. In March, a Florida jury made shockwaves by awarding Bollea $140m \u2013 $40m more than Harder had originally requested \u2013 and soon thereafter, Gawker, once a leader in digital media, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/jun/10/gawker-media-bankruptcy-auction-hulk-hogan-lawsuit\">filed for bankruptcy</a>. Gawker.com was soon <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/aug/18/gawker-to-close-univision-sale\">shut down by its new owner, Univision</a>.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>The case wasn\u2019t entirely black and white, and controversy abounded when <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/may/26/paypal-co-founder-peter-thiel-admits-bankrolling-hulk-hogan-gawker-lawsuit\">it emerged that Bollea\u2019s lawsuit was actually funded by Peter Thiel</a>, a Silicon Valley billionaire and co-founder of PayPal, who had had his own issues with Gawker in the past after the site published an article about his sexuality. Press freedom advocates feared that the verdict would pave the way for other rich and powerful people to pursue personal vendettas by giving financial backing to chosen litigants in order to take down those who had wronged them. It is not a fear Harder shares.</p> <p>\u201cIt was a meritorious case,\u201d he says. \u201cIf my firm had taken on the case on a contingency fee basis, if a public interest organisation had taken on the case, if the client had paid for the case himself, or if he had gotten funding from an outside litigation funding company, he would still have gotten the verdict that he got. Mr Thiel just happened to pay Hulk Hogan\u2019s costs, but that doesn\u2019t take away from the merits of the case. Gawker had violated his privacy, violated the law, and a jury ruled in his favour. That\u2019s why the case ended up the way that it did.\u201d</p> <p>Since the Hogan verdict, Harder\u2019s list of influential clients has been growing. <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jun/03/amber-heard-johnny-depp-divorce-blackmail-suit-doug-stanhope\">He was hired by Amber Heard to sue the comedian Doug Stanhope</a> after he wrote online that the actress was blackmailing her estranged husband Johnny Depp, whom she had accused of spousal abuse. <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/61d2be5c-7382-11e6-bf48-b372cdb1043a\">He was hired by the former Fox News CEO Roger Ailes to challenge negative media coverage in New York magazine</a> over sexual harassment allegations against him by his former colleagues, a partnership that led to one Forbes writer dubbing Harder <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://twitter.com/katiasav/status/773220883133497348\">\u201cthe rich man\u2019s favourite tool for assaulting journalism\u201d</a>.</p> <p>But perhaps his most intriguing relationship is the one he has with the Trumps.<br></p> <p>It is somewhat unusual for a major party\u2019s presidential nominee or their spouse to mount legal action against a publication so close to an election, but Trump has a reputation for threatening and pursuing legal action. The GOP candidate, who has banned publications such as the Washington Post, Politico <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/25/donald-trump-media-ban-guardian-denied-entry-campaign-event\">and a Guardian reporter and photographer from covering some of his events</a>, recently tweeted that <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/18/donald-trump-threatens-to-sue-new-york-times-over-irresponsible-intent\">his lawyers wanted him to sue the New York Times</a> for \u201cirresponsible intent\u201d in reports. While Trump never specifically mentioned Harder, some have speculated as to whether the lawyer will be acting as his right-hand man.</p> <p>When I put this to Harder, he laughs and firmly states: \u201cNo, I\u2019m not one of Trump\u2019s lawyers, period. I don\u2019t represent Donald Trump, I represent his wife; it\u2019s different.\u201d</p> <p>Nonetheless, does he agree with Trump that the hurdle established in the landmark supreme court decision in New York Times v Sullivan (1964), which requires public figures who bring defamation lawsuits against the media to establish \u201cactual malice\u201d, should be challenged?</p> <p>\u201cSeparate and apart from anything that Donald Trump has ever said, I\u2019ve always felt that the \u2018actual malice\u2019 standard is unreasonable,\u201d Harder says. \u201cJustice Byron White, who voted in favour of the standard in the New York Times v Sullivan case, 20 years later wrote a dissent in the Dun &amp; Bradstreet case, saying we all got it wrong, that the standard is far too high and it\u2019s very difficult for people who are public figures to prevail when they are actually defamed. I agree with him.\u201d</p> <p>As far as public figures go, does Harder think there is a difference between suits that come from celebrities and those that come from politicians, due to varying levels of public interest, and if so, should the term \u201cpublic figures\u201d be split into two?</p> <p>\u201cI do think that in the context of a political campaign, if a reporter is writing about issues that are relevant to the political campaign, there is some leeway there and there should be some leeway there,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you\u2019re electing a Congress member, a senator, a governor, a president, or any other person to elective office, that is different from just the public\u2019s curiosity about somebody\u2019s sex life, somebody who is not seeking public office, who just happens to be an actor or a recording artist. I do think that those two have a different public importance.</p> <p>\u201cBut my view is this: if it\u2019s defamation, it\u2019s problematic, inherently. The actual malice standard basically says, \u2018OK, you do have defamation but there\u2019s an additional standard that needs to be overcome if you\u2019re a public figure.\u2019\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c6a9b428da1655204ccad2f302e1ffbb6160d5a1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c6a9b428da1655204ccad2f302e1ffbb6160d5a1/234_137_2582_1549/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nick Denton, founder of Gawker, clashed with Terry Bollea, AKA Hulk Hogan, before the site declared bankruptcy.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nick Denton, founder of Gawker, clashed with Terry Bollea, AKA Hulk Hogan, before the site declared bankruptcy.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pool/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Though he views libel laws as outdated, Harder has never seen himself as an adversary of the free press and disagrees with depictions of him as such. </p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not true,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m an advocate of responsible free press, but when people choose to tell lies about others, they\u2019re exposing themselves. Sometimes when people lie and lie, they become emboldened that they can get away with anything, and then they tell bigger and bigger lies against various people, some of whom can afford to bring an action. The takeaway is that news organisations need to be responsible, just like lawyers, doctors, and teachers.\u201d</p> <p>A spokesman for the Daily Mail said the newspaper had \u201coffered Mr Harder the opportunity to agree wording for the retraction days \u2013 not several weeks \u2013 after publication\u201d and that \u201cinstead of taking that opportunity, he rushed to file a lawsuit later the same day\u201d.</p> <p>He added: \u201cMr Harder\u2019s many public statements about the lawsuit have attracted vast amounts of media coverage, far more than the original article, which provoked very little response. The Daily Mail disagrees with Mr Harder\u2019s interpretation of the article as the retraction makes clear ... we note that, six weeks later, proceedings have still not been served by him in the US.\u201d</p> <p>Harder, meanwhile, says the recent increase in his profile hasn\u2019t changed his life much. \u201cI\u2019ve always been busy, I\u2019ve always been hardworking, and that remains. I\u2019ve got the same family, same house, same car, same routine.\u201d He spends his spare time with his wife and children, mostly going to places around LA and doing things together. \u201cIt\u2019s a pretty boring life,\u201d he says, \u201cbut I enjoy it.\u201d</p>",

They are headed for a one-year master\u2019s programme at Tsinghua University in Beijing, and the plan is that 200 students will go annually in future. <br></p> <p>Schwarzman claims the scholarship looks for students who are \u201clikely to be global leaders, in politics, business or science\u201d, and who are potentially in a position to influence their country\u2019s relations with China, with the ultimate hope of ensuring peace with the world\u2019s emerging superpower.</p> <p>This suggests its motivation is to address the so-called \u201c<a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2015/09/united-states-china-war-thucydides-trap/406756/\">Thucydides\u2019 trap</a>\u201d, the theory that suggests rising powers tend to fight with ruling powers.

But a number of questions remain about the overarching idea that such a scheme can mould more peaceful international relations. </p> <p>Is a one-year programme actually enough to have a real impact? And how will foreign scholars react to Chinese censorship and political repression? Could exposure to China\u2019s economic success \u2013 seen against a backdrop of slow growth in Europe, gridlock in the US congress, and the flowering of extremist movements around the world \u2013 tempt some students to consider the merits of Beijing\u2019s authoritarian political system?</p> <p> With nationalism on the rise and China re-ordering the league table of global power, any effort to diffuse tension should be welcomed.

  "<p>On 23 February, Donald Trump stood before a rally of cheering supporters to celebrate a thumping victory in the Nevada Republican caucus \u2013 his third consecutive win, in defiance of the naysayers who had predicted that his bubble was about to burst. \u201cIf you listen to the pundits, we weren\u2019t expected to win too much \u2013 and now we\u2019re winning, winning, winning the country,\u201d he bragged. \u201cWe won with young. We won with old. We won with highly educated. We won with poorly educated. I love the poorly educated.\u201d</p> <p>That last line provoked immediate waves of mockery. It sounded at the time like another one of Trump\u2019s many gaffes \u2013 he loves that people do not get a decent education? Yet behind the mockery was a real sense of disquiet, which has not gone away: Trump loves the less educated because they appear to love him back. As the Atlantic reported in March: \u201cThe best single predictor of Trump support in the Republican primary is the absence of a college degree.\u201d Education \u2013 or the lack of it \u2013 seemed to be propelling the Trump bandwagon.</p> <p>The possibility that education has become a fundamental divide in democracy \u2013 with the educated on one side and the less educated on another \u2013 is an alarming prospect. It points to a deep alienation that cuts both ways. The less educated fear they are being governed by intellectual snobs who know nothing of their lives and experiences. The educated fear their fate may be decided by know-nothings who are ignorant of how the world really works. Bringing the two sides together is going to be very hard. The current election season appears to be doing the opposite.</p> <p>Trump continues to poll far ahead of Clinton among voters who did not go to college, while Clinton still leads by a considerable margin among college graduates. This is a significant change from 2012, when the picture was far more mixed. Four years ago, the college-educated vote was almost evenly split, with graduates favouring Obama over Romney by a narrow margin, 50 to 48. Recent polling puts Trump\u2019s lead over Clinton among <a href=\"http://www.breitbart.com/2016-presidential-race/2016/09/26/poll-trump-leads-clinton-76-percent-to-17-percent-among-white-men-without-college-degrees/\">white men without a college degree</a> at a sobering 76 to 19.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2016/nov/29/how-the-education-gap-is-tearing-politics-apart-podcast\">How the education gap is tearing politics apart \u2013 podcast</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Of course, there are other factors at play here. Race is one; gender is the other. The overwhelming majority of Trump\u2019s supporters are white, regardless of their education levels. However, white men with a college degree split much more evenly between the candidates, whereas white women without a college degree still strongly favour Trump. Less educated voters who support Trump are not necessarily poor: many earn more than $50,000 (\u00a339,000) a year. Trump scores particularly well among small business owners who did not go to college. These polling numbers \u2013 which are only indicative, since no one has actually voted yet \u2013 can be unpicked a hundred different ways. But it is hard to avoid the conclusion that how people vote is increasingly being shaped by how long they spent at school.</p> <p>What is happening in the United States has also been happening in the UK. The Brexit campaign had its own Trumpian moment, courtesy of Michael Gove, who told Faisal Islam in an interview on Sky News on 3 June that \u201cthe British people have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jun/09/michael-gove-experts-academics-vote\">had enough of experts</a>\u201d. Gove was also widely mocked \u2013 if not experts, who was he proposing to get to repair his car, fix his teeth, teach his kids?</p> <aside class=\"element element-membership element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Membership Event: </span><a href=\"https://membership.theguardian.com/event/the-long-read-live-at-the-hospital-club-27192843527\">The Long Read live at the Hospital Club</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But what he said struck a deep chord, because it contained a large element of truth. The experts Gove was deriding had been telling the British public that the risks of Brexit far outweighed any potential benefits. Gove insisted that the voters should decide this for themselves, on the basis of their own experiences, rather than listening to elite voices that had a vested interest in the outcome. Those voices came trailing educational qualifications, which had put them in their positions of authority \u2013 at the IMF, the Bank of England, the Treasury. Gove was asking voters lacking anything like the same educational qualifications to feel empowered to reject what they were being told. And in the referendum on 23 June, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/24/britain-votes-for-brexit-eu-referendum-david-cameron\">that is what they did</a>.</p> <p>Voters with postgraduate qualifications split 75 to 25 in favour of remain. Meanwhile, among those who left school without any qualifications, the vote was almost exactly reversed: 73 to 27 for leave. A <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/31/people-who-felt-marginalised-drove-brexit-vote-study-finds\">report from the Joseph Rowntree Foundation</a> last month confirmed that \u201ceducational opportunity was the strongest driver\u201d of the Brexit vote. Again, there were plenty of other factors at work \u2013 including a significant generational divide. Older voters were far more likely to vote leave, which partly helps to explain the education gap, since the rapid expansion of higher education in recent decades means older voters are also much less likely to have attended university. But the Rowntree report concludes that educational experience was the biggest single determinant of how people voted. Class still matters. Age still matters. But education appears to matter more.</p> <p>A post-Brexit electoral map of Britain starkly illustrates this new divide. Scotland voted remain for its own particular reasons. But in England and Wales, many university towns emerged from the referendum as isolated outposts of pro-EU sentiment in a sea of Brexit. Newcastle, York, Nottingham, Norwich, Cambridge, Brighton, Warwick, Exeter, Bristol, Reading, Oxford and Cardiff all voted remain. I live in Cambridge, which voted remain by a margin of 74 to 26. There was consternation here following the result. It was accompanied by a barely suppressed feeling that ignorance had won the day. I lost count of the number of times I was told that one of the top trending searches on Google in the immediate aftermath of the vote was: \u201cWhat is the EU?\u201d The implication was that we had been taken out of Europe by people who did not even know what it was they were being asked to decide about.</p> <p>Few felt comfortable, at least in public, following this thought through to its logical conclusion. Yet it was hard to escape the sense that a long buried suspicion of democracy was fighting its way back to the surface. If politics has turned into a contest between ignorance and knowledge, then places like Cambridge may be starting to feel dismayed by the realisation they are now on the losing side. But that would be to fall into an old trap.</p> <h2>* * * </h2> <p>Elite anxiety about the consequences of political ignorance is nothing new. In the long history of intellectuals worrying about democracy and its failings, two basic fears keep nagging away. The first is that democracy will mean rule by the poor, who will use their power to steal from the rich. The second is that democracy will mean rule by the ignorant, who will use their power to do the dumbest things. Both these worries go back at least as far as Plato. The ancient Greeks understood full well that democracy meant letting the have-nots get their claws into the haves. For Aristotle, that\u2019s what the word meant: it was rule by the poor (the <em>demos</em>) over the wealthy. But if class conflict came with the territory, the deeper fear was what the masses might do out of sheer foolishness.</p> <p>For Plato, democracy suffered from the basic defect of putting decision-making in the hands of people who were not competent to decide. Politics was a skill \u2013 and most people were simply clueless. Worse, that made them prey for hucksters and demagogues who would promise the earth and get away with it. Democracy was fertile ground for fantasists with a taste for power. If you tell the people that up is down, and the people believe you, then who is going to let them know that they are wrong?</p> <p>These fears have never really gone away, and they reassert themselves at times of political crisis. In the 1920s, the American political commentator Walter Lippmann updated Plato for the 20th century by arguing that modern citizens simply lacked the mental capacity to process the information needed for intelligent decision-making. Lippmann had worked in American propaganda during the first world war and had seen at first hand just how easy it was to manipulate public opinion.</p> <p>\u201cIt is no longer possible,\u201d he wrote, \u201cto believe in the original dogma of democracy: that the knowledge needed for the management of human affairs comes up spontaneously from the human heart.\u201d People will vote on the basis of anything that grabs their attention in a passing moment, filtered by whatever deep prejudices they harbour beneath the surface. Evidence means little to the average voter; reasoned argument means even less. Lippmann concluded that democracy could only be rescued by establishing a cadre of specially trained experts, whose job was to steer politicians away from the dubious instincts of the people and back towards what the evidence required. Otherwise, the manipulation of public opinion would become the be all and end all of democracy, which is all the encouragement demagogues ever need.</p> <p>Lippmann\u2019s fears chimed with the growing worry of some prominent mid-20th century economists that too much democratic decision-making would lead to financial ruin. A series of future Nobel prize winners, from Friedrich Hayek to Milton Friedman, channelled the ancient critics of democracy by arguing that putting the voters in charge meant short-term impulses would prevail over long-term prudence. Ultimately, they thought, democracy produced inflation, which was just another way of the poor getting their own back on the rich. Hayek and Friedman both put their ultimate faith in the power of markets. But first, they felt experts had to be empowered to rein in the self-destructive impulses of the voters. Hayek at one point advocated restricting the franchise to those aged 45, in order to cut out the young, who don\u2019t know what\u2019s good for them, and the old, who have a vested interest in the past. Hayek did not believe that anyone, however expert, could know the future. But he wanted to put self-knowledge back at the heart of democracy: the worldly wisdom of understanding what is possible, and what is just wishful thinking.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It is tempting to think that democracy is reverting to type and that ignorance is being set against knowledge</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Lippmann, Hayek and Friedman insisted they were trying to save democracy, not destroy it. But what they thought democracy needed saving from was itself. The voters had to be rescued from their preference for fairytales and the people peddling them. In the late 20th century, partly under the influence of such thinkers, democratic politics did carve out spaces where experts could be better insulated from the impulsive decision-making of the masses, as independent central banks and other unelected bodies were entrusted with more and more decision-making capacity, away from the glare of public opinion. Now, in the 21st century, these are the experts who find that the voters no longer want to heed their advice.</p> <p>In the year of Trump and Brexit, it is tempting to think that democracy is reverting to type and that popular ignorance is once again being set against expert knowledge. Trump is what you get when demagoguery is allowed to run unchecked, egged on by a craven media that simply enjoys the show. Brexit is what you get if you ask people a question that they lack the basic information to answer. This is the view that has been doing the rounds in the circles in which the highly educated move. But to think this is a big mistake.<strong> </strong>The educational divide that is opening up in our politics is not really between knowledge and ignorance. It is a clash between one worldview and another.</p> <h2>* * * </h2> <p>What is the EU?<strong> </strong>Hearing educated remainers mock those who asked that question the day after the vote was an uncomfortable experience \u2013 and not just because the story about Google searches was largely apocryphal. After all, the question is not as straightforward as it seems: it is simple enough to say what the letters refer to, but far more difficult to know what they really mean for our politics and our future. Education is not the same as knowledge. Nor is knowledge the same as knowing which way to vote. The split between the university towns and other parts of the country did not arise because one set of people understood what was truly at stake and the others were just taking a wild guess. Both sides were guessing.</p> <p>Even now, no one truly knows what is going to happen. The better-educated cleaved to one set of predictions because these chimed with what they already believed in. Polling carried out before the referendum, which asked people what they thought was likely to happen in the aftermath of a Brexit vote, found that university graduates thought that it would produce an immediate financial crash, whereas those with fewer qualifications thought it much more likely that things would carry on as before. Prior political preferences shape what we think the evidence shows, not the other way round.</p> <p>None of this would have surprised Lippmann. When he argued that ordinary voters were incapable of judging complex policy questions on their merits, he did not exclude the educated from that judgment. He meant everybody. As he wrote: \u201cI have not happened to meet anybody, from a president of the United States to a professor of political science, who came anywhere near to embodying the ideal of the sovereign and omnicompetent citizen.\u201d He thought that we needed experts who were trained in eliminating their own biases \u2013 and whatever a regular university education does, it does not do that.</p> <p>\u201cThe historical record leaves little doubt that the educated, including the highly educated, have gone astray in their moral and political thinking as often as anyone else,\u201d write the political scientists Christopher Achen and Larry Bartels in their new book <a href=\"http://press.princeton.edu/titles/10671.html\">Democracy for Realists</a>, echoing Lippmann. What the educated are better at is sounding like they know what they are talking about, because they have been trained in how to make an argument. \u201cWell-informed people are likely to have more elaborate and internally consistent worldviews than inattentive people, but that just reflects the fact that their rationalisations are better rehearsed.\u201d Education gives you the ability to tailor your arguments to suit your personal preferences, which is why it is a big asset on the job market. But it does little to help tailor your personal preferences to suit the best arguments.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"84ce22140f4c0663b48956256603613171397104\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/84ce22140f4c0663b48956256603613171397104/0_0_5000_3000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Guardian Design\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Guardian Design</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Composite: Guardian Design</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the current political climate, a lack of education is sometimes blamed for the spread of conspiracy theories, which run like wildfire through many populist movements. Trump\u2019s campaign, with its nods and winks to \u201cwhat\u2019s really going on\u201d, and its pre-emptive warnings about the vote being stolen, has been feeding and feeding off the appetite for conspiratorial thinking. Yet to blame this on the absence of education is just another version of the old fear of the credulity of the untutored masses: they will believe anything.</p> <p>The real story is more complicated. Polling conducted earlier this year by a research project in Cambridge shows that education does sometimes make a difference when it comes to conspiracy theories: the likelihood of someone thinking the moon landing was a hoax, or that the government is hiding the existence of aliens, does decline as you go higher up the education ladder. But when the theories concern politically divisive issues, then education has far less effect.</p> <p>Possessing a university degree does not alter the probability of someone believing that global warming is a hoax \u2013 that tracks prior political commitments, not superior knowledge. Nor are conspiracy theories confined to the right. Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s support among Labour party members contains a high proportion of university graduates. Yet in a YouGov poll, 55% of Corbyn supporters agreed with the statement that intelligence services such as MI5 have been working to undermine Corbyn since he became leader. That figure compares with only 19% of the wider public who give credence to the same claim. People will believe what their political loyalties incline them to believe, regardless of how much education they have received.</p> <p>This doesn\u2019t mean that our political beliefs are simply a reflection of our narrow self-interest. It is true that we all have a tendency to favour the worldview that enhances our future prospects. The preference of university graduates for remaining in the EU echoes the benefits that EU membership gives them: the free movement of labour and easy access to European networks is better for those with the qualifications to take advantage of a knowledge economy. But it is not the case that the education divide is just another version of the class divide, with the winners from globalisation lined up against the losers.</p> <p>As with Trump supporters in the US, Brexit was not simply the cause of the disadvantaged and left behind. Many Brexiteers come from the affluent middle classes, particularly in the south of England, outside of the university towns. Meanwhile, universities are producing their fair share of losers these days, as students leave burdened with debt and confronted by a bleak job market. Yet these students \u2013 rich or poor, in work or out, elite or not \u2013 overwhelmingly favoured EU membership. Education does not simply divide us on the grounds of what is in our interests. It sorts us according to where we feel we belong.</p> <h2>* * * </h2> <p>Why does education do this?<strong> </strong>Political scientists have been aware of the growing education divide for decades. A report on the 1983 general election \u2013 whose authors included a young John Curtice, the current eminence grise of the UK polling business \u2013 noted that education levels were emerging as a significant indicator of voting patterns. The report put this down to the distinctive social attitudes that were picked up at university. \u201cEducational experience,\u201d it noted, \u201cis an important source of values distinct from class experience.\u201d These values often related to issues that were not straightforwardly economic.</p> <p>Graduates, even in the 1980s, tended to be much more concerned about the environment than other sectors of the population. They were also strikingly more internationalist in outlook. In 1983, 58% of graduates expressed a positive attitude to what was then known as the European Economic Community, whereas only 35% of those who left school at 16 felt the same. Not much has changed since. But at that time, the Labour party was still overtly hostile to the European project, and withdrawal from the EEC was part of its famously radical 1983 election manifesto. Many graduates reported having leftish attitudes on a whole host of other questions \u2013 from defence spending to women\u2019s rights. But on this issue their cosmopolitanism took precedence over their party loyalties. The result was that in the 1983 election more than twice as many university graduates voted for the centrist pro-European SDP-Liberal Alliance as voted for Labour.</p> <p>One reason this was not a bigger issue back then \u2013 and the Alliance did not manage to supplant Labour as the main party of opposition \u2013 was that there were not that many university graduates. Although participation had been steadily rising, in the mid-1980s fewer than one in five people had benefited from higher education. That was enough to make a difference, but not enough to tip the balance. By <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2013/apr/24/students-higher-education-almost-50-per-cent\">2012, university participation among 18-30 year olds was close to 50%</a>, and it has only dipped recently because of rising tuition fees. That is enough to start splitting the population into two camps.</p> <p>But it is not simply a question of demographics. The gap has been amplified by certain forms of social mobility, which have reinforced the education divide by enabling the better-educated to start congregating together: socially, geographically, romantically. In a previous generation, graduates often married non-graduates, because their choices tended to be driven by where they happened to live or work. As the clich\u00e9 has it: bosses used to marry their secretaries. Not any more, and not just because there are fewer secretaries. If you went to university, ask yourself: how many of your friends didn\u2019t go to university? And among your friends, how many of those who did are married to people who didn\u2019t? Greater freedom of movement produces greater freedom of choice. But that does not produce more social diversity, it produces more social stratification.</p> <p>Social media now enhances these patterns. Friendship groups of like-minded individuals reinforce each other\u2019s worldviews. Facebook\u2019s news feed is designed to deliver information that users are more inclined to \u201clike\u201d. Much of the shock that followed the Brexit result in educated circles came from the fact that few people had been exposed to arguments that did not match their preferences. Education does not provide any protection against these social media effects. It reinforces them.</p> <p>The growing political divide between the educated and the less educated can be seen across Europe. It is most pronounced in Scandinavian countries, where university attendance is high and levels of education are an increasing driver of voting habits. It is less visible in southern and eastern Europe \u2013 in places such as Portugal and Poland \u2013 where participation in higher education is lower, and other social factors, including family and religion, still exert a strong grip.</p> <p>But Britain and the US are different again, because of their political systems. In European countries with proportional representation, smaller parties can offer a home to particular segments of the population, including those at both ends of the education scale. The support for many European parties of the populist right is heavily drawn from less educated voters. Meanwhile, green and liberal parties, especially those that favour immigration, rely strongly on university graduates for their support. That group includes the Liberal Democrats, which is still the UK-based party that attracts the highest proportion of graduates among its voters. But as the Lib Dems have discovered to their cost, with first-past-the-post that is not enough. Under a PR system, targeting the graduate vote can generate significant representation in parliament. Here, it can get you wiped out \u2013 especially if you make a promise to students not to raise their tuition fees and then fail to keep it.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The education divide derives from values often characterised as the opposition between libertarians and authoritarians</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The education divide is never going to supplant traditional left-right politics. There is not going to be a \u201cGraduate party\u201d taking on a party of \u201cSchool Leavers\u201d. Instead the divide cuts across left and right, which is why it is proving so disruptive to our politics right now. Big-tent political parties are struggling to hold their fractured coalitions of voters together. Polling still reveals some shared attitudes between university graduates and those without educational qualifications on economic issues, such as support for trade unions and mistrust of the free market. But the education divide derives from an alternative set of values, which is often characterised as the opposition between libertarians and authoritarians.</p> <p>Authoritarians are looking for order and control, libertarians want greater freedom and tolerance. Along with education levels, the strongest indicator of likely support for Brexit was shown by attitudes to capital punishment: the more you were in favour, the more you wanted to leave the EU. These attitudes tend to track educational experience. Labour\u2019s support is now split between left-leaning libertarians (broadly pro-union and anti-banks, but also pro-immigration, and often highly educated) and left-leaning authoritarians (also pro-union and anti-banks, but far tougher on immigration and very concerned about crime and community). Each grouping might gather upwards of 20% of the electorate under its wing. Together that would be enough for a parliamentary majority. But they do not fit together any more, and increasingly they neither like nor trust each other.</p> <p>The same forces are threatening to play havoc with electoral politics in the US. Trump\u2019s army of the less educated is on the march inside the Republican party, but that leaves plenty of traditional Republicans \u2013 including many college-educated ones \u2013 wondering where to go. Some Republicans will be voting for Clinton. Some traditional Democrats<strong> </strong>will be sorely tempted by Trump\u2019s deeply authoritarian message. It is true that American democracy has proved highly resilient in the past and the party system has adapted to many demographic and cultural shifts. However, it is also possible that the gap between the educated and the less educated is going to become more entrenched over time, because it is not just a question of economic interests. It represents a gulf in mutual understanding.</p> <h2>* * * </h2> <p>The conflict between rich and poor<strong> </strong>still matters a great deal in our politics. But the age-old fear that democracy would end up letting the poor steal from the rich has always looked overblown. Constitutions \u2013 including the one carefully crafted by the American founders to guard against just that outcome \u2013 have done their bit to safeguard the interests of the propertied classes. So, too, have the increasingly complex institutional arrangements that give power to experts in areas \u2013 defence, finance, environment, health \u2013 where technical knowledge is assumed to be required. Representative democracy has proved effective at staving off class war. It has done it by finding electoral outlets for popular dissatisfaction \u2013 as with the election of Franklin D Roosevelt in 1932, of Attlee in 1945, or of Obama in 2008 \u2013 that never quite let the people take charge. When inequality gets out of hand, the system does what it can to correct for it. But it is designed to avoid extreme solutions driven by popular anger. That still holds. The haves do not look in danger of being expropriated by the have-nots any time soon.</p> <p>The contest between the educated and the less educated is different. Many of the safeguards that have been put in place to bypass popular politics \u2013 above all, the authority that now resides in central banks \u2013 have had the effect of empowering a new class of experts, for whom education is a prerequisite of entry into the elite. These are not just the bankers, but the lawyers, the doctors, the civil servants, the technicians, the pundits, the academics. Not all of the educated are winners in this world, but almost all of the winners are educated. It gives the impression that knowledge has become a proxy for influence.</p> <p>When Gove suggested that the experts should not be trusted because they have a vested interest in what they are saying, that was his point: once knowledge becomes a prerequisite of power, then it no longer speaks for itself. It appears to speak for the worldview of the people who possess it. At that point it ceases to be knowledge and simply becomes another mark of privilege.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Educated v less educated may be even more toxic than rich v poor, because it comes laden with assumptions of superiority</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The education divide has the potential to break apart the careful ties that hold representative democracy together. Regardless of our different interests, we elect representatives to take decisions on our behalf on the understanding that we share certain basic values, including a respect for knowledge, wherever it comes from. Once knowledge is assumed to be just another one of the perks of power, then the basis to trust others to take decisions for us becomes eroded. Asserting the facts and asserting your privilege grow increasingly difficult to distinguish.</p> <p>Educated v less educated may be even more toxic than rich v poor, because it comes laden with assumptions of moral superiority. These days the rich find it quite hard to get away with the presumption that their wealth is proof of their virtue. When they seek protection from the system, it is pretty clear what they are up to: they are looking after their interests. But when the educated look out for themselves they can dress it up as something ostensibly better than that: expertise.</p> <p>To those on the receiving end, that stinks. It stinks of hypocrisy, and it also stinks of self-interest. The fact that the educated are not always the beneficiaries of the social attitudes that they hold \u2013 Corbyn\u2019s supporters, like Bernie Sanders\u2019s, would rightly insist that many of the positions they adopt are designed for the benefit the socially excluded \u2013 does not help. It just makes them sound even more self-righteous.</p> <p>In the run-up to the EU referendum Jeremy Cliffe of the Economist \u2013 the house journal of the educated expert \u2013 suggested that although Brexit might win this time, it was possible the UK would vote to rejoin the EU in a second referendum 20 years from now, by which point current levels of university education would have spread to later age groups. Twenty years is a very long time in politics. Before then, the gap between the educated and the less educated has the potential to widen, as each side digs in. The viciousness of public debate, as bad as it is now, could still get worse. Because two-party politics does not map on to this division, mainstream politicians will have to find creative ways to try to harness it. These carry the risks of making it worse.</p> <p>The EU referendum was seen by educated optimists \u2013 including some of the people around David Cameron \u2013 as just another way for democracy to let off steam: a means of giving vent to anger without letting it run out of control. That is what the optimists have been saying about Trump too. But the steam is still rising.</p> <p>\u2022 Follow the Long Read on Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/@gdnlongread\">@gdnlongread</a>, or sign up to the long read weekly email <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2015/jul/20/sign-up-to-the-long-read-email\">here</a>.</p>",

Still Pence talking here. \u201cI like to spend a little bit of time on my knees every day.\u201d</p> <p>Kaine: \u201cThis is a fundamental question... we really feel that it is not the role of the public servant to mandate that for everybody else... we support Roe v Wade... the constitutional right of American woman to... make their own decision about pregnancy. We trust American women to do that. And we don\u2019t think that women as Donald Trump said should be punished.. \u201c Pence wants to overturn Roe.. \u201cThe very last thing that government should do is to make laws that would punish women.\u201d And that \u201cis the </p> <p>Pence: \u201cDonald Trump and I\u201d don\u2019t favor punishing women for abortion.</p> <p>Kaine: Trump said he did.</p> <p>Pence: \u201cHe\u2019s not a polished politician.\u201d</p> <p>Kaine: The gospel of Matthew says, \u201cFrom the fullness of the heart the mouth speaks.\u201d So Trump meant it.

He was pressed on this support in an interview with O\u2019Reilly, who himself called the operation \u201c<a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2015/11/donald-trump-immigration-deportation-215783\">really brutal</a>\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWell, well, I\u2019ve heard it both ways. I\u2019ve heard good reports, I\u2019ve heard bad reports,\u201d Trump told the Fox News host. \u201cWe would do it in a very humane way.\u201d</p> <p>But Trump has given mixed messages since his<a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/donald-trump-60-minutes-scott-pelley/\"> early calls</a> for mass deportation, and he has used the phrase <a href=\"http://www.msnbc.com/hardball/watch/trump-vows-to-deport-11-million-people-564859459935\">\u201cdeportation force\u201d</a>. In August of this year, he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/27/donald-trump-immigration-policy-deportation\">appeared to have doubts, </a>until finally promising<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/01/donald-trump-vows-to-deport-millions-during-first-hour-in-office-in-hardline-speech\"> \u201cno amnesty\u201d and a \u201chumane\u201d removal </a>of migrants.</p> <p><strong>Kaine: the nuclear deal with Iran has prevented Tehran from developing weapons</strong></p> <p>The nuclear deal with Iran was finalized in July 2015, three years after the end of Clinton\u2019s term as secretary of state, and it does not completely remove Iran\u2019s nuclear program. It removes a reserve of medium-enriched uranium, cuts into its low-enriched uranium, and allows access to international inspectors.</p> <p>Kaine also appears to exaggerate how quickly Iran could have developed a bomb. During negotiations, intelligence officials and analysts said they believed Iran was <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/14/world/middleeast/iran-nuclear-deal.html\">two to three months</a> <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/15/world/middleeast/iran-nuclear-deal-is-reached-after-long-negotiations.html\">away from bomb capabilities</a>. The terms of the deal extend that \u201cbreakout\u201d ability to a year, and have restrictions extending over 10, 15 and 25 years.</p> <p><strong>Pence: the US doesn\u2019t know who Syrian refugees are and should block them</strong></p> <p>The government has a fairly clear idea about how many people are in the US without legal authorization. Using data from the Census, Department of Homeland Security, Office of Refugee Resettlement and surveys and analysis from Mexico and Latin American countries, <a href=\"https://www.dhs.gov/immigration-statistics-publications\">the DHS</a> and nonpartisan <a href=\"http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/11/19/5-facts-about-illegal-immigration-in-the-u-s/\">Pew Research</a> have each been able to estimate the number, and arrived at similar figures in recent years: around 11.3 to 11.5 million people. The margin of error for these figures is generally around a million people at most \u2013 not 20 million as Trump says.</p> <p>Pew and the DHS both try to account for deaths, under-counted groups, arrivals and departures, and have adjusted their calculations based on decades\u2019 worth of research. Both have found that net migration has stabilized in recent years, and that <a href=\"http://www.pewhispanic.org/2015/11/19/more-mexicans-leaving-than-coming-to-the-u-s/\">more undocumented Mexicans are leaving</a> the US than entering it. In other words, recent net migration into the US has hovered near its lowest levels of the last 20 years.</p> <p><strong>Kaine: blocking Syrian refugees is unconstitutional</strong></p> <p>On Monday, the seventh circuit court of appeals accused Pence of baseless \u201cnightmare speculation\u201d and compared the governor\u2019s attempt to block refugees to an attempt to exclude black people from his state, Indiana. Pence tried to deny 174 refugees resettlement aid, and the case was taken to court.</p> <p>\u201cThe governor of Indiana believes, though without evidence, that some of these persons were sent to Syria by ISIS to engage in terrorism and now wish to infiltrate the United States in order to commit terrorist acts here.

While I would hope all of our children would aspire to be president, neither Donald Trump nor Hillary Clinton have set a good example and I wouldn\u2019t hold up either of them as role models for my kids,\u201d she said.<br><br>At the weekend Ayotte had struck a more moderate tone, giving away free condoms on the campaign trail to push her plan on birth control. The poster at the event claimed to \u201cUse Condom Sense!\u201d </p> <p>Ayotte is in a close race with Democratic governor Maggie Hassan, who was endorsed by Planned Parenthood, Emily\u2019s List and NARAL.

  "<h2><strong>Mike Pence: \u2018Norwood University\u2019</strong></h2> <p>In his opening statement, Pence misstated the name of the university hosting the debate. It is Longwood University, not Norwood.</p> <h2><strong>He also said that Barack Obama has raised more taxes to extraordinary levels</strong></h2> <p>This isn\u2019t quite right. There were two major changes to the tax code in Obama\u2019s two terms: the 2012 expiration of tax cuts created by George W Bush (with extensions for people making less than $400,000 a year), and levies to fund the Affordable Care Act (including a penalty for not having health insurance, a 10% tax on tanning services and a 3.8% tax on investment income for top earners).</p> <p>Obama also enacted temporary cuts meant to spur investment and help Americans in the depths of the financial crisis, but all in all tax rates for most Americans have not changed much since Bush\u2019s presidency, according to a <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.cbo.gov/publication/51361\">report</a> by the nonpartisan congressional budget office. Under Bush, the top tax rate was 35%; under Obama, the wealthiest Americans pay 39.5%.</p> <h2><strong>Pence: the Obama administration has \u2018stifled the economy\u2019</strong></h2> <p>Obama took office in the depths of the 2008 financial crisis, and the economy has crawled back into recovery over his two terms, with employment nearly down to pre-crisis levels. It\u2019s arguable that his policies have restricted some growth, but the economy has held to a steadily upward track.</p> <p>This summer the OECD gave its <a href=\"https://www.oecd.org/eco/surveys/United-States-2016-overview.pdf\">stamp</a> of approval to the US economy, saying in a report: \u201cthe US economy has rebounded: output has surpassed its pre-crisis peak by 10%, robust private-sector employment gains have sharply reduced unemployment, fiscal sustainability has been largely restored and corporate profits are high.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2016/oct/04/tim-kaine-mike-pence-vice-presidential-debate-elections-live\">Vice-presidential debate live: Mike Pence and Tim Kaine face off</a> </p> </aside>  <h2><strong>Pence: \u2018The Clinton Foundation accepted foreign donations while she was secretary of state \u2026 She kept that pay-to-play process in\u2019</strong></h2> <p>Pence is correct that the foundation took donations from foreign governments, and that the charity did not disclose every contribution \u2013 in violation of an agreement to identify donors that it made with the Obama administration. But no one has yet produced evidence of a quid pro quo exchange between the Clinton Foundation and its donors.</p> <h2><strong>Pence: \u2018It was a failure of the secretary of state\u2019 to acquire a status of forces agreement with Iraq</strong></h2> <p>The argument that Hillary Clinton\u2019s failure to secure an agreement with Baghdad over keeping American troops in Iraq ignores several key facts, including that the Bush administration similarly failed. It also ignores that Isis\u2019s first <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/19/world/middleeast/in-rise-of-isis-no-single-missed-key-but-many-strands-of-blame.html\">segments</a> <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/11/world/middleeast/us-actions-in-iraq-fueled-rise-of-a-rebel.html\">formed</a> out of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/dec/11/-sp-isis-the-inside-story\">post-invasion civil war</a> in Iraq, while Bush was president; that the group took root in Syria\u2019s civil war, where the US did not intervene until 2014; that Obama withdrew American forces in 2011 under the <a href=\"http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2008/12/20081214-2.html\">timeline</a> agreed on by Bush and <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/22/world/middleeast/united-states-and-iraq-had-not-expected-troops-would-have-to-leave.html\">Baghdad</a>.

Since Obama took office in January 2009 the US has created <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://data.bls.gov/timeseries/CES0000000001\">10.8m private-sector jobs</a>, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Kaine is counting back from the depths of the economic recession, in early 2010, which would erase a full year off of Obama\u2019s presidency.</p> <h2><strong>Kaine: \u2018The debt explosion on the Trump side is much much bigger than anything on the Clinton side\u2019</strong></h2> <p>Kaine is correct, according to conservative and nonpartisan thinktanks alike. Clinton\u2019s proposed tax plan would add $191bn to the debt over the long term, <a href=\"http://taxfoundation.org/sites/default/files/docs/TaxFoundation-FF496.pdf\">according to the </a><a href=\"http://crfb.org/papers/promises-and-price-tags-preliminary-update\">Committee for a Responsible Budget</a>, a conservative thinktank. The Tax Policy Center, however, estimates that she would <a href=\"http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/publications/analysis-hillary-clintons-tax-proposals\">add $1.1tn in revenue</a> in a decade, though much of that would be offset by increased spending. The Tax Foundation estimated that Trump\u2019s plan would add <a href=\"http://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2016/09/26/donald-trump-would-boost-debt-more-than-hillary-clinton-report-says/\">$5.3tn to the debt</a>.</p> <h2><strong>Kaine: even Richard Nixon released his taxes</strong></h2> <p>Richard Nixon did not release his tax returns while running for president in 1960 or in 1968 \u2013 he released them in 1973, after his second term began. In 1968 Nixon only gave a limited glimpse of his to a magazine writer and only released the returns under pressure from the Watergate inquiry. He released the returns despite an audit by the IRS, which Trump has repeatedly claimed is his reason for not releasing returns.</p> <p>You can look at Nixon\u2019s returns at the <a href=\"http://www.taxhistory.org/www/website.nsf/web/presidentialtaxreturns\">Presidential Tax History Project</a>.

Pence, on the other hand, <a href=\"http://thehill.com/capital-living/meet-the-lawmaker/20999-house-conservatives-oppose-add-ons\">supported</a> a <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://money.cnn.com/2016/07/15/news/economy/trump-pence-social-security/\">2005 plan</a> that would have modified the program into a private system.</p> <h2><strong>Pence: \u2018He\u2019s created a business that\u2019s worth billions of dollars\u2019</strong></h2> <p>There is no direct evidence that Trump\u2019s business is worth billions of dollars \u2013 the only tax return publicly available, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/02/us/politics/donald-trump-taxes.html\">published by the New York Times</a> last weekend, shows that he reported a $916m loss in 1995. Trump could prove the worth of his business by publishing his returns. Forbes <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/04/donald-trump-net-worth-forbes-400\">estimates Trump is worth $3.7bn</a>, far lower than his claimed $10bn.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2bf7b56f52cd95fbe3764bedcbb05801dcc9f7c0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2bf7b56f52cd95fbe3764bedcbb05801dcc9f7c0/0_95_4722_2833/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mike Pence responds to Tim Kaine.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mike Pence responds to Tim Kaine.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pool/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Kaine: Trump would let states decide whether to be rid of the minimum wage</strong></h2> <p>Kaine is correct insofar as Trump has a position on minimum wages, if he\u2019s talking about the federal minimum wage, specifically.</p> <p>Trump has changed his position on the minimum wage at least three times, including within the span of a single interview. On 26 July, when Fox News host Bill O\u2019Reilly <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMK8Iv7tiE\">asked him</a> where he would set a federal minimum wage, he repeated <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/08/federal-minimum-wage-trump\">a stance from May</a> that the US does not need one: \u201cThere doesn\u2019t have to be.\u201d</p> <p>He then immediately changed his position: \u201cWell, I would leave it, and raise it somewhat.\u201d A day later in Florida he said he wanted a $10 an hour minimum wage, up from the current level of $7.25, and confirmed to a reporter: \u201cfederal\u201d. He has most consistently said that states should decide a minimum wage.</p> <h2><strong>Kaine notes, correctly, that black people are more likely than white people to be arrested and given long sentences.</strong> </h2> <p>They are also <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/dec/31/the-counted-police-killings-2015-young-black-men\">more likely to be shot by police</a>.</p> <h2><strong>Pence: Clinton and Kaine support \u2018open borders\u2019</strong></h2> <p>Neither ticket supports \u201copen borders\u201d, which the US does not have. Pence appears to be using the word to denigrate Barack Obama\u2019s support for immigration reform and protection for some undocumented people from deportation. But Obama has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/21/latino-immigrants-us-war-on-terror-study\">deported a record more than 2.5 million people since he took office</a>, including <a href=\"http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/10/02/u-s-deportations-of-immigrants-reach-record-high-in-2013/\">a record 438,421 people in 2013</a>, and increased border patrol staff to <a href=\"https://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/publications/performance-accountability-financial\">a record 21,444 agents in 2011</a>; his policy could not reasonably be described as \u201camnesty\u201d or \u201copen borders\u201d.</p> <p>Clinton supports reform to let people pass background checks and pay backtaxes in order to stay in the US, and she supports Obama\u2019s executive actions to shield some migrants, such as people who were brought to the US as children. Like Obama, she supports the deportation for people with criminal records.</p> <h2><strong>Kaine: Trump has \u2018called Mexicans rapists and criminals \u2026 He attacked an Indiana-born federal judge and said he was unqualified \u2026 He said African Americans are living in hell\u2019</strong></h2> <p>Kaine is right that Trump has broadly characterized immigrants in derogatory terms, but Trump also almost always gives himself a way out. On 16 June 2015, when he announced his candidacy, Trump said: \u201cThey\u2019re sending people that have lots of problems, and they\u2019re bringing those problems with us. They\u2019re bringing drugs. They\u2019re bringing crime. They\u2019re rapists. And some, I assume, are good people.\u201d</p> <p>Trump\u2019s claim is patently false, as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/26/donald-trump-fact-check-immigration-inner-cities\">we</a> and <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/2016/08/31/492096565/fact-check-donald-trumps-speech-on-immigration\">fellow</a> <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2016/09/01/fact-checking-donald-trumps-immigration-speech/\">fact-checkers</a> have <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/jul/09/donald-trump/donald-trump-says-mexican-government-forces-many-b/\">repeatedly</a> shown, since most migrants leave their homes for work or family and the Mexican government has nothing to do with their emigration. Statistics on crime by non-citizens mostly suggest that Mexican migrants \u2013 more of whom are leaving the US than entering \u2013 don\u2019t affect overall crime rates.</p> <p>Trump has i<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/05/donald-trump-muslim-judges-face-the-nation\">ndeed called judge Gonzalo Curiel unqualified</a> because the American judge is \u201cMexican\u201d, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/28/living-in-hell-milwaukee-segregation-donald-trump\">said that African Americans are \u201cliving in hell\u201d.</a></p> <h2><strong>Pence: Clinton called half of our supporters \u2018deplorable\u2019</strong></h2> <p>At <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/10/hillary-clinton-trump-supporters--bigoted-deplorables\">a fundraiser</a> Clinton said: \u201cTo just be grossly generalistic, you could put half of Trump\u2019s supporters into what I call the basket of deplorables\u201d. This group, she said, included \u201cracist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, Islamophobic\u201d people.

Polls also show lower but significant such sentiment among supporters of Clinton. Her generalization pointed to real racial animus, ignored it among her own supporters and showed how difficult it is to attach a number to racism, even while <a href=\"http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/07/18/sharp-differences-over-who-is-hurt-helped-by-their-race/\">separate polling</a> shows <a href=\"http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2016/06/27/on-views-of-race-and-inequality-blacks-and-whites-are-worlds-apart/\">racism</a> is <a href=\"http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/07/27/blacks-with-college-experience-more-likely-to-say-they-faced-discrimination/\">affecting millions</a> in <a href=\"http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/06/29/roughly-half-of-hispanics-have-experienced-discrimination/\">widespread</a> and <a href=\"http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/07/01/racial-gender-wage-gaps-persist-in-u-s-despite-some-progress/\">systemic ways</a>.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s complaint contradicts his own past remarks. In 2012, after Mitt Romney was lambasted <a href=\"http://takingnote.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/09/18/the-47-percent/\">for dismissing 47% of Americans</a>, Trump agreed, telling <a href=\"http://news.yahoo.com/video/trump-romney-dont-apologize-47-025517267.html\">Fox News</a>: \u201cYou do have a large percentage of people that feel they\u2019re entitled.\u201d Last year he similarly dismissed half of all Americans, <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2015/06/18/donald_trump_eventually_50_of_americans_are_not_going_to_be_able_to_carry_the_other_50.html\">telling Fox</a>: \u201cWe have a society that sits back and says, \u2018We don\u2019t have to do anything.\u2019 Eventually the 50% cannot carry, and it\u2019s unfair to them, but cannot carry the other 50%.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Kaine: Trump hasn\u2019t apologized to anyone</strong></h2> <p>Trump has expressed regret for having said \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/19/donald-trump-tries-out-a-new-campaign-tactic-saying-sorry\">the wrong thing</a>\u201d but not said what that thing was or whom he had caused \u201cpersonal pain\u201d.</p> <h2><strong>Kaine: Trump supports the mass deportation of 11 million people</strong></h2> <p>During <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDUADNTpAh0\">a 10 November debate</a> Trump expressed support for Dwight Eisenhower\u2019s Operation Wetback, the forcible deportation of <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/08/06/annotated-transcript-the-aug-6-gop-debate/\">hundreds of thousands of migrants</a>, sometimes under inhumane circumstances. He was pressed on this support in an interview with O\u2019Reilly, who himself called the operation \u201c<a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2015/11/donald-trump-immigration-deportation-215783\">really brutal</a>\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWell, well, I\u2019ve heard it both ways. I\u2019ve heard good reports, I\u2019ve heard bad reports,\u201d Trump told the Fox News host. \u201cWe would do it in a very humane way.\u201d</p> <p>But Trump has given mixed messages since his <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/donald-trump-60-minutes-scott-pelley/\">early calls</a> for mass deportation, and he has used the phrase <a href=\"http://www.msnbc.com/hardball/watch/trump-vows-to-deport-11-million-people-564859459935\">\u201cdeportation force\u201d</a>. In August of this year, he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/27/donald-trump-immigration-policy-deportation\">appeared to have doubts,</a> until finally promising <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/01/donald-trump-vows-to-deport-millions-during-first-hour-in-office-in-hardline-speech\">\u201cno amnesty\u201d and a \u201chumane\u201d removal </a>of migrants.</p> <h2><strong>Kaine: the nuclear deal with Iran has prevented Tehran from developing weapons</strong></h2> <p>The nuclear deal with Iran was finalized in July 2015, three years after the end of Clinton\u2019s term as secretary of state, and it does not completely remove Iran\u2019s nuclear program. It removes a reserve of medium-enriched uranium, cuts into its low-enriched uranium, and allows access to international inspectors.</p> <p>Kaine also appears to exaggerate how quickly Iran could have developed a bomb. During negotiations, intelligence officials and analysts said they believed Iran was <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/14/world/middleeast/iran-nuclear-deal.html\">two to three months</a> <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/15/world/middleeast/iran-nuclear-deal-is-reached-after-long-negotiations.html\">away from bomb capabilities</a>.

Using data from the census, Department of Homeland Security, Office of Refugee Resettlement and surveys and analysis from Mexico and Latin American countries, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.dhs.gov/immigration-statistics-publications\">the DHS</a> and nonpartisan <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/11/19/5-facts-about-illegal-immigration-in-the-u-s/\">Pew Research</a> have each been able to estimate the number and arrived at similar figures in recent years: around 11.3 million to 11.5 million people. The margin of error for these figures is generally around a million people at most, not 20 million people as Trump says.</p> <p>Pew and the DHS both try to account for deaths, under-counted groups, arrivals and departures, and have adjusted their calculations based on decades\u2019 worth of research. Both have found that net migration has stabilized in recent years, and that <a href=\"http://www.pewhispanic.org/2015/11/19/more-mexicans-leaving-than-coming-to-the-u-s/\">more undocumented Mexicans are leaving</a> the US than entering it. In other words, recent net migration into the US has hovered near its lowest levels of the past 20 years.</p> <h2><strong>Kaine: blocking Syrian refugees is unconstitutional</strong></h2> <p>On Monday, the seventh circuit court of appeals accused Pence of baseless \u201cnightmare speculation\u201d and compared the governor\u2019s attempt to block refugees to an attempt to exclude black people from his state, Indiana. Pence tried to deny 174 refugees resettlement aid, and the case was taken to court.</p> <p>\u201cThe governor of Indiana believes, though without evidence, that some of these persons were sent to Syria by Isis to engage in terrorism and now wish to infiltrate the United States in order to commit terrorist acts here. No evidence of this belief has been presented, however; it is nightmare speculation,\u201d Judge Richard Posner wrote in the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://media.ca7.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/rssExec.pl?Submit=Display&amp;Path=Y2016/D10-03/C:16-1509:J:Posner:aut:T:fnOp:N:1838881:S:0\">opinion</a>.

Comey did say that \u201cno reasonable prosecutor would bring such a case\u201d against Clinton over her use of a private email server while secretary of state. But Comey also <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/05/fbi-no-charges-hillary-clinton-email-investigation\">excoriated Clinton for \u201cextremely careless\u201d practices</a> and found that she had spoken falsely repeatedly about the system.</p> <h2><strong>Kaine: Trump has praised Vladimir Putin and \u2018it\u2019s clear that he has business dealings with Russian oligarchs who are dealing with Putin\u2019</strong></h2> <p>Trump has repeatedly called Russia\u2019s president a \u201cstrong leader\u201d and spoken approvingly of this strength and Putin\u2019s polling numbers. For instance, on 18 December 2015 he <a href=\"http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2015/12/18/donald-trump-praises-putin-as-strong-leader/\">told MSNBC</a>: \u201cI\u2019ve always felt fine about Putin. I think that he\u2019s a strong leader.\u201d</p> <p>He added: \u201cHe\u2019s running his country and at least he\u2019s a leader, unlike what we have in this country.\u201d</p> <p>Last September, he <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/donald-trump-gives-russias-putin-an-a-in-leadership/\">told Fox News</a>: \u201cIn terms of leadership [Putin\u2019s] getting an A.\u201d In <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YaA2rmuJu9c\">a 10 March debate</a>, Trump tried to hedge on semantics. \u201cStrong doesn\u2019t mean good,\u201d he said. \u201cPutin is a strong leader, absolutely. He is a strong leader. Now I don\u2019t say that in a good way or a bad way. I say it as a fact.\u201d</p> <p>Pence also said, as Kaine points out, that <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2016/09/08/mike-pence-says-its-inarguable-that-putin-is-a-stronger-leader-than-obama/\">it\u2019s \u201cinarguable\u201d that Putin is a stronger leader than Obama</a>.</p> <p>Kaine also said that Putin \u201chas run his economy into the ground, he persecutes LGBT folks and journalists\u201d.</p> <p>The caliber of Putin\u2019s leadership is debatable in and of itself. Russia\u2019s economy under Putin\u2019s 16 years of leadership has become over reliant on oil and hamstrung by economic sanctions, themselves prompted by Putin\u2019s aggressive military action in Ukraine.

But I\u2019m not there. You have Obama there. And frankly, that whole part of the world is a mess under Obama with all the strength that you\u2019re talking about and all of the power of Nato and all of this.

Ukraine is not a member of Nato, the history of Crimea and Russia goes back centuries, and the continued war in eastern Ukraine is being fueled by both the Kremlin and local forces.</p> <h2><strong>Pence: the Associated Press found that more than half of Clinton\u2019s meetings as secretary of state were with donors to the Clinton Foundation</strong></h2> <p>The AP story on Clinton\u2019s meetings <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/blogs/on-media/2016/09/ap-deletes-clinton-foundation-tweet-227917\">did not include her meetings with people in the US government and from foreign governments</a> \u2013 who were by a huge margin the people she met with while serving as the top diplomat of the United States.</p> <p>The news agency deleted a tweet about the story \u2013 virtually verbatim to what Pence said \u2013 for lack of context, and the Associated Press\u2019s vice-president for standards John Daniszewski wrote <a href=\"https://blog.ap.org/announcements/statement-on-why-ap-deletes-clinton-tweet?utm_campaign=SocialFlow&amp;utm_source=Twitter&amp;utm_medium=AP\">a blog post about the decision</a>.</p> <h2><strong>Pence: \u2018Trump and I would just never support legislation that would punish a woman for making the heartbreaking decision to terminate a pregnancy\u2019</strong></h2> <p>Kaine is correct that Trump suggested <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/mar/30/donald-trump-women-abortions-punishment\">women should be punished for having abortions</a> \u2013 he then <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/mar/30/donald-trump-women-abortions-punishment\">recanted the idea</a> at the end of a day of flip-flopping positions.

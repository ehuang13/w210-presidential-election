  "<p>As the first woman to clinch a major party nomination, Hillary Clinton\u2019s candidacy is already historic \u2013 and increasingly it looks like Donald Trump\u2019s is too. But not in a flattering way.</p> <p>If last week came the point at which he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/05/donald-trump-week-campaign-turning-point-2016-election\">self-immolated the campaign</a> and beloved Trump brand, this week may be remembered as the time he finally drove his party\u2019s national security leadership to support the Democratic candidate for president en masse, either by voting for her expressly or by abstaining.</p> <p>National security is an issue that Republican presidential candidates have historically been able to dominate, but Trump may be the first guy in recent history to blow that for the party. Even more remarkable is that top neoconservatives in the party are all taking the Democrat\u2019s side: Clinton has said Trump \u201cshouldn\u2019t have his finger on the button\u201d of our nuclear arsenal. It looks like even Republican top brass agrees.</p> <p>On Thursday <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/08/republicans-donald-trump-warning-letter-bush-reagan\">a long list of GOP national security hands wrote a letter</a> saying Trump would be \u201cthe most reckless president in American history\u201d and that electing him in November would put the nation\u2019s security at risk. Some of the 50 signatories said they\u2019d vote for Clinton while others deemed it better to abstain from voting entirely. But all were in fundamental agreement on one main point: \u201cTrump is not qualified and would be dangerous.\u201d</p> <p>This comes after Evan McMullin, a former CIA official who recently worked for the House Republican conference, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/08/republican-evan-mcmullin-presidential-run-trump\">filed papers to run for president</a> as an independent candidate. He doesn\u2019t support Clinton, and having missed the ballot-access deadlines in most states, the move is expected to have little effect on the race other than to help the former secretary of state by cutting into Trump\u2019s margins. But that\u2019s just fine with McMullin, who says: \u201cIt\u2019s never too late to do the right thing.\u201d</p> <p>In fact if there\u2019s a common theme to this most recent wave of GOP dissenters, it\u2019s just how eerily close they sound to Hillary Clinton\u2019s talking points.</p> <p>\u201cHe is unable or unwilling to separate truth from falsehood,\u201d<a href=\"http://warontherocks.com/2016/03/open-letter-on-donald-trump-from-gop-national-security-leaders/\"> the GOP national security leaders said in the letter</a>. \u201cHe does not encourage conflicting views. He lacks self-control and acts impetuously. He cannot tolerate personal criticism. He has alarmed our closest allies with his erratic behavior. All of these are dangerous qualities in an individual who aspires to be president and commander in chief, with command of the US nuclear arsenal.\u201d</p> <p>Some <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/09/us/politics/national-security-gop-donald-trump.html?smid=tw-nytpolitics&amp;smtyp=cur&amp;_r=1\">in recent interviews</a> have specifically cited Trump\u2019s recent comment inviting Russia to hack into Clinton\u2019s email servers, a remark Trump has since claimed he was making in jest, as the moment that changed their mind about him. They also touched on his embrace of Putin specifically, calling his admiration for him and other foreign dictators \u201cunacceptable\u201d.</p> <p>That sounds a whole lot like what Clinton\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/05/19/politics/hillary-clinton-on-egyptair-shines-a-very-bright-light-on-threat-of-terror/\">been saying all along</a>, if not what Barack Obama said at the Democratic convention last month when he called Trump\u2019s rival the most qualified presidential candidate in history.</p> <p>In our era of political polarization and congressional stagnation, it\u2019s been ages since top Republicans and Democrats in Washington could agree on anything more definitively than the need to keep Trump out of the White House. And without getting ahead of ourselves too much (for Trump\u2019s done nothing this election so well as outperform low expectations), let\u2019s hope the unlikely unity extends beyond the neocons and with any luck, lasts longer than the election. </p>",
  "<p>Many longtime Republican foreign policy and <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/05/hillary-clinton-military-endorsements-trump\">national security</a> officials have issued their most vociferous repudiation of Donald Trump to date, saying the GOP presidential nominee, if elected, \u201cwould be the most reckless president in American history\u201d.</p> <p>An open letter released on Monday and signed by 50 fixtures from decades of Republican Pentagons, state departments, White Houses and treasuries rejected Trump\u2019s \u201calarming ignorance\u201d of basic international affairs, his competence at understanding US national interests and his temperament.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/08/republican-evan-mcmullin-presidential-run-trump\">Republican Evan McMullin to launch presidential run against Trump</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cFrom a foreign policy perspective, Donald Trump is not qualified to be president and commander-in-chief,\u201d states the letter, which was first reported by the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/09/us/politics/national-security-gop-donald-trump.html\">New York Times</a> and includes several top aides from the George W Bush administration. </p> <p>\u201cIndeed, we are convinced that he would be a dangerous president and would put at risk our country\u2019s national security and well-being.\u201d</p> <p>The former officials, many of whom are likely candidates to staff any Republican president\u2019s administration, added that Trump \u201clacks the character, values, and experience\u201d to hold the highest office in the land. It was the latest sign of traditional Republicans, usually a fractious group, striking at Trump while the nominee reels under signs of cratering poll numbers and self-inflicted political wounds.</p> <p>Many of the signatories have made their doubts known before. A March letter published at the online national security salon <a href=\"http://warontherocks.com/2016/03/open-letter-on-donald-trump-from-gop-national-security-leaders/\">War on The Rocks</a> sounded warnings on Trump\u2019s character, policies and fitness for office. It included many who also signed the current letter, including George W Bush\u2019s homeland security secretary Michael Chertoff; ex-Pentagon under secretary for policy and ambassador to Turkey Eric Edelman; Condoleezza Rice aide Philip Zelikow; John McCain advisers Richard Fontaine and Kori Schake; and former US ambassador to Iraq Robert Blackwill.</p> <p>But the previous letter was penned in the midst of the Republican primary, when several other candidates remained competitive in the race. For dozens of high-profile intelligence officials to rebuke their own party\u2019s nominee with the general election officially underway is yet another indication of the unprecedented nature of Trump\u2019s candidacy.</p> <p>The new letter also arrives amid heightened concerns over <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/27/donald-trump-russia-hacking-dangerous\">Trump\u2019s posture toward Russia</a> \u2013 the former reality TV star has lavished unusual praise on the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, while his campaign manager, Paul Manafort, has been scrutinized for holding ties to Russian politicians. Former CIA acting director Michael Morrell, who endorsed Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton this weekend, has insinuated that Putin is manipulating an unwitting Trump. </p> <p>Signing the new letter are former CIA and NSA director Michael Hayden, whose antipathy to Trump has become highly public in recent months, and John Negroponte, a senior official in the Reagan, George HW Bush and Bill Clinton administrations and George W Bush\u2019s first director of national intelligence. So has George W Bush\u2019s White House Iraq and Afghanistan adviser, Meghan O\u2019Sullivan, who is held in high esteem amongst congressional Republican internationalists.</p> <p>The new letter also contains harsher language than the old. While the March letter compared Trump to a \u201cracketeer\u201d, the new one flatly says Trump \u201clacks the temperament to be president\u201d. It also calls into question his fitness to wield \u201ccommand of the US nuclear arsenal\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cUnlike previous presidents who had limited experience in foreign affairs, Mr Trump has shown no interest in educating himself,\u201d the letter states. \u201cHe continues to display an alarming ignorance of basic facts of contemporary international politics.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/05/hillary-clinton-military-endorsements-trump\">Clinton set to seize national security issue from GOP as endorsements roll in</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Clinton campaign has also sought to cast a spotlight on Trump\u2019s competence to be commander-in-chief as voters grow increasingly alarmed over national security. The Democratic national convention featured a cadre of generals, admirals and former officials from Republican administrations making the case against Trump in primetime, homing in on his erratic behavior and wayward statements on US foreign policy.</p> <p>The Clinton campaign also <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qznPnKG9zko\">released a video</a> stringing together clips of both national security officials and former Republican presidential candidates, from Mitt Romney to Marco Rubio, stating that Trump was fundamentally unqualified to be president and should not have access to the nuclear codes.</p> <p>Trump called the letter \u201cpolitically motivated\u201d in a statement, saying its signatories were members of a \u201cfailed Washington elite\u201d struggling to hold on to its influence.</p> <p>\u201cThe names on this letter are the ones the American people should look to for answers on why the world is a mess, and we thank them for coming forward so everyone in the country knows who deserves the blame for making the world such a dangerous place,\u201d Trump said.</p> <p>\u201cThese insiders \u2013 along with Hillary Clinton \u2013 are the owners of the disastrous decisions to invade Iraq, allow Americans to die in Benghazi, and they are the ones who allowed the rise of Isis.\u201d</p> <p>Trump further committed to a foreign policy that would stand up to dictators, rebuild the military and pursue peace over war.</p> <p>\u201cTogether, we will break up the rigged system in Washington, make America safe again, and we will make America great again,\u201d he said.</p>",

In 1996, his then editor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/women-in-leadership/2016/apr/07/tina-brown-our-speakers-have-taken-on-bigger-misogynists-than-trump\">Tina Brown</a> commissioned him to write a profile of Trump with the words \u201cHe\u2019s totally full of shit, you\u2019ll love him!\u201d After months getting a full immersion into Trump\u2019s world, one highlight being a ludicrous meeting between Trump and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2002/apr/29/guardianobituaries.russia\">Aleksandr Lebed</a>, in which Trump proudly showed the Russian general and Kremlin fixer a shoe he\u2019d been given by Shaquille O\u2019Neal \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/video-mark-singer-on-the-perils-of-profiling-donald-trump\">Singer wrote a 10,000-word profile</a> that nailed the narcissism, superficiality and cynicism with which the world is now so alarmingly familiar. It concluded that Trump had \u201caspired to and achieved the ultimate luxury, an existence unmolested by the rumbling of a soul\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jul/21/trump-and-me-mark-singer-donald-review-hari-kunzru\">Trump and Me by Mark Singer review \u2013 a lot of laughs but then horror</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Naturally, Trump didn\u2019t appreciate Singer\u2019s efforts, attacking him in his book Trump: the Art of the Comeback, in a letter to the New York Times (\u201che was not born with great writing ability\u201d), and finally in an irate missive that read: \u201cMark, you are a total loser! And your book (and writings) sucks!\u201d </p> <p>These last two sentences are proudly printed on the back of Singer\u2019s new book <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jul/21/trump-and-me-mark-singer-donald-review-hari-kunzru\">Trump and Me</a>, which revisits his profile in the light of Trump\u2019s presidential campaign. Given Singer\u2019s probing wit and Trump\u2019s essential ridiculousness, it is very funny, though the implications of a Trump presidency seem increasingly less amusing in the light of the hatred he has unleashed. \u201cI am afraid. Everybody I know is afraid,\u201d Singer says. \u201cIf Hillary Clinton wins, listening to the sigh of relief just on this island, we might have a carbon dioxide overload crisis. You\u2019ll see these trees shooting up.\u201d </p> <p>Singer says that Trump is \u201cthe most unapologetic \u2026 there has to be a word stronger than hypocrite, there really does.\u201d He is despairing that some voters \u2013 stoked by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/05/hillary-clinton-emails-fbi-investigation-next-steps\">email scandal</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/24/clinton-campaign-blames-russia-wikileaks-sanders-dnc-emails\">the WikiLeaks revelations about her attempts to undermine Bernie Sanders</a> \u2013 think Hillary Clinton is more dishonest than Trump. This, he says, \u201cis what really makes you want to blow your brains out. It makes you want to go back and find patient zero and think, when was the moment where we stopped being willing to fund public education in this country, that it became so egregious that we no longer could have people who understood the constitution, the checks and balances? Trump says: \u2018I love the ill-educated.\u2019 You bet he does.\u201d </p> <p>Singer blames Fox News and the web for what seems to be a growing disregard for the truth, but also acknowledges that widening inequality, leaving a large swathe of Americans essentially abandoned by the two main parties, has helped account for Trump\u2019s rise \u2013 along with \u201cthe haters\u201d, racists and xenophobes excited by this promises to keep Mexicans and Muslims out of America. </p> <p>Nevertheless, he can\u2019t bring himself to picture Trump actually being elected. \u201cImagine November 9, 2016. You wake up and there it is in the newspaper, Donald Trump has been elected president. He\u2019s not going to institute martial law yet, he\u2019s not going to abridge the first amendment just yet, he\u2019s not going to seal the borders \u2013 he can\u2019t do anything until January 20. This will be the beginning of a series of <em>anni horobili</em> that we\u2019ve never seen.\u201d </p> <p>Singer cites a recent obituary of a friend\u2019s aunt, which concluded: \u201cDied of complications of congestive heart failure and the 2016 presidential election.\u201d Like her, he says, \u201cI think that you\u2019re going to see a lot of people who\u2019ve been hanging on, letting go. I believe that. And a lot of them are going to be envied.\u201d</p> <h2>\u2018Trump in his quintessence\u2019</h2> <p>Just a week later, however, things look very different. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/05/donald-trump-campaign-terrible-week-paul-ryan-khan\">Trump is plunging in the polls</a>, largely thanks to his typically impetuous and politically suicidal decision to attack Khizr and Ghazala Khan, the parents of US army captain Humayun Khan, who was killed in the Iraq war. \u201cYou have sacrificed nothing,\u201d Khan said of Trump in his speech at the DNC, a line devastating because it is so self-evidently true, and one to which Trump was stupid enough to respond, telling ABC: \u201cI think I\u2019ve made a lot of sacrifices.\u201d </p> <p>\u201cThat almost made me embarrassed for humanity,\u201d says Singer when I call him a few days after Trump\u2019s car-crash performance. \u201cI don\u2019t really lump myself in the same humanity that possibly he belongs to.\u201d</p> <p>Singer says the Khan episode \u201cshowed Donald Trump in his quintessence\u201d. Even the rightwing political commentator <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jul/27/bill-oreilly-slaves-eat-well\">Bill O\u2019Reilly</a>, he says, \u201cwho\u2019s a bomb thrower\u201d, told Trump on his Fox show that you don\u2019t attack a gold-star mother. \u201cTrump is saying: \u2018Well yeah, but\u2019 \u2013 and then he says, as plain as day, \u2018I didn\u2019t attack her.\u2019 And right after he says that he says: \u2018I was viciously attacked.\u2019 This demonstrates as plainly as anything that he\u2019s a person who lies reflexively.\u201d</p> <p>Now Trump seems to be flailing. \u201cHe\u2019s shocked,\u201d Singer says. \u201cHe\u2019s in a tailspin because his ego is constructed in a way that does not brook any kind of disagreement. He has his own party telling him, \u2018Dude, shut the fuck up. Do not go there.\u2019 These are people like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/rudygiuliani\">Rudy Guiliani </a>and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/newt-gingrich\">Newt Gingrich</a>, this is not <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/nancy-pelosi\">Nancy Pelosi</a>, OK? He hears them, he goes out and the next day does it again.\u201d</p> <p>This reckless behaviour has had many commentators wondering whether Trump is suffering from a mental illness. Last week, Singer participated in <a href=\"http://www.msnbc.com/the-last-word/watch/trump-the-candidate-unfit-to-serve-737086019759\">an extraordinary discussion on MSNBC\u2019s The Last Word With Lawrence O\u2019Donnell</a> with Dr George Simon, a psychologist <a href=\"http://www.manipulative-people.com/\">described on his website</a> as \u201cthe leading expert on manipulators and other disturbed characters\u201d. To be diagnosed with a narcissistic personality disorder, you need to exhibit five of around <a href=\"http://psychcentral.com/disorders/narcissistic-personality-disorder-symptoms/\">a dozen symptoms on a checklist</a>, such as \u201cHas a grandiose sense of self-importance\u201d and \u201clacks empathy\u201d. However, the entire list seemed to apply to Trump. </p> <p>\u201cHis mental illness is now the conversation,\u201d Singer says. There are tricky ethical issues around such a long-distance diagnosis \u2013 not least, he says, the fact that comparing them to Trump may further stigmatize sufferers. \u201cIt\u2019s extremely unfair to people who have various mental illnesses.\u201d </p> <p>Singer says that even mental illness can\u2019t entirely account for Trump\u2019s behaviour. \u201cYou can\u2019t believe that this is somebody capable of this degree of obtuseness, obliviousness, total absence of self-awareness and cruelty. This combination. Since you and I spoke the other day, that has blown open and he\u2019s really done. So now the headlines are, what\u2019s the party going to do? They\u2019ve got to do something. They\u2019re almost conceding the election now, two weeks after their convention!\u201d Singer even made a bet last Monday with <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/contributors/jane-mayer\">Jane Mayer</a>, a New Yorker colleague, that Trump would be gone in two weeks. \u201cThe wheels are starting to come off so dramatically and you can feel it.\u201d </p> <p>Given his plunging popularity, Singer says it\u2019s no surprise that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/02/donald-trump-calls-hillary-clinton-the-devil-and-suggests-election-will-be-rigged\">Trump is now claiming that the election will be rigged</a>. \u201cIt\u2019s in the book,\u201d<strong> </strong>he points out. \u201cThe thing that he\u2019s dreaded most in his life is being labeled a loser. So he has to have an explanation for that.\u201d </p> <p>In the shorter term, Singer says, Trump\u2019s next big challenge will be the debates \u2013 or more specially, how he can avoid them. As Trump has demonstrated many times, for instance <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/05/donald-trump-fact-check-nfl-debates-iran-hillary-clinton\">recently claiming that Russia would not invade Ukraine</a>, when Russian soldiers occupied Crimea over two years ago, when it comes to events beyond America\u2019s borders he is profoundly ignorant. \u201cExactly right,\u201d Singer says. \u201cBy choice and temperament both. And this is a person who brags: \u2018I know more about Isis than the generals.\u2019 This party has this quote on record when they nominated him. Guess who I don\u2019t have a whole lot of sympathy for? It\u2019s game over.\u201d Given the warp speed at which the news has moved this year however, Singer rows back: \u201cThat is the kind of stuff that is so dangerous to say I should bite my tongue.\u201d</p> <p>Trump, says Singer, is the most transparent politician there has ever been: \u201cHe\u2019s only out for himself, in every way, in every gesture.\u201d One of the reasons for publishing his book, he says, was in disgust at the way journalists indulged Trump\u2019s race for the presidency because it was good for ratings and traffic. \u201c<a href=\"https://www.thenation.com/article/how-false-equivalence-is-distorting-the-2016-election-coverage/\">This notion of false equivalency</a> is not something that journalists have figured out, but it wasn\u2019t even that with Trump, it was just the celebrity and [him] using up all the oxygen. But I knew that Trump had no intention of winning, it was obvious \u2013 and here we are.\u201d</p> <p>As for many Americans, the Trump candidacy has been a draining experience for Singer. No one can turn away, Singer least of all. \u201cI just sat here and I was watching MSNBC last night until 11 o\u2019clock and I realized, I am now an addict. I\u2019m totally a junkie and I really need to have an intervention of my own, I\u2019m afraid.\u201d</p> <p>That sets him off on another Trumpian train of thought \u2013 those in the Republican party who think they can perform some kind of intervention. \u201cThis idea of doing an intervention with Trump is hilarious to me. These might be the last optimists in America.\u201d You can\u2019t treat people like Trump, he says. \u201cThey\u2019re incurable.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Donald Trump\u2019s election as US president could affect the strength of the Anzus treaty and Australia\u2019s relationships in the Asia-Pacific region, former federal foreign minister and NSW premier Bob Carr has warned.</p> <p>ABC\u2019s Q&amp;A program on Monday night was entirely dedicated to US politics, and parallels were also drawn between the US and Australia, with rising public dissatisfaction having led to the emergence of more fringe candidates.</p> <p>Besides Carr, the panel included US anti-poverty campaigner Linda Tirado, US author and satirist PJ O\u2019Rourke, international security analyst Lydia Khalil, and US defence and politics analyst Crispin Rovere. </p> <p>Guests initially discussed the prospect of Trump having access to nuclear weapons. O\u2019Rourke described him as a \u201ctoddler\u201d but Rovere, who is writing a book on Trump, said his approach to nuclear weapons was \u201centirely mainstream and entirely consistent\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/31/pj-orourke-says-blame-the-elites-for-trump-and-brexit-and-vote-for-clinton\">PJ O'Rourke says blame the elites for Trump and Brexit \u2013 and vote for Clinton</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cHe says he hates nuclear weapons. He never wants to be in a position where they might have to be used but so long as they exist he will not rule it out entirely. That\u2019s exactly the same as Barack Obama. That\u2019s exactly the same as most presidents.\u201d</p> <p>Carr said Trump\u2019s suggestion that <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2016/04/06/should-more-countries-have-nuclear-weapons-donald-trump-thinks-so/\">it would not be a bad thing if Japan, South Korea and Saudi Arabia had nuclear weapons</a> was \u201cvery worrying\u201d.</p> <p>This was \u201cunravelling\u201d the security arrangements in the Asia Pacific which Australia was part of through the Australia, New Zealand, and US (Anzus) treaty, a collective security agreement in place since 1951.</p> <p>\u201cWe would be in the peculiar position of watching a President Trump unravel arrangements that have been considered vital to avoiding nuclear exchanges in the region in which we live and \u2026 it would really challenge us,\u201d said Carr.</p> <p>Carr noted the potential fallout should the US go through with ideas raised by Trump, suggesting it would threaten the strength of the treaty, but did not say Australia should walk back from it if Trump wins.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m suggesting first of all, the alliance works both ways, it is a running argument,\u201d said Carr.</p> <p>\u201cAnd we would be obliged to seek every opportunity to tell the Americans that inaugurating a trade war with China by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/apr/17/china-finance-minister-trump-trade-proposal-irrational\">putting a 45% tax on American imports</a> from China would be disastrous, and telling them, as I believe, as a respected ally of the United States, that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/apr/02/donald-trump-north-korea-war-nuclear-weapons\">withdrawing nuclear protection from Japan and South Korea</a> would compel those countries to acquire their own nuclear weapons. Australia has something to say, and we can say it,\u201d he said, adding that he would be uncomfortable with Australian warships alongside a Trump-led US fleet in Japanese waters.</p> <p>He said the treaty was more important than any single presidency.</p> <p>Khalil, who is also a Lowy Institute fellow, said she believed the treaty was strong, but she was not \u201cblase\u201d about it.</p> <p>\u201cI spent a lot of time in my career in the Middle East and for the first time in my life I have seen those authoritarian tendencies come through Trump,\u201d she said. </p> <p>\u201cThis idea that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/22/donald-trump-republican-convention-speech-law-order\">\u2018I alone can fix it\u2019, that line he said during his convention</a> \u2013 that\u2019s very worrying to me. Maybe because I spent so much of my time looking at other regions of the world where this is very easy to open up, and democracy is a fragile thing, open society is a fragile thing \u2026 no international security person in the United States has come out in favour of him. They\u2019re saying he is a threat.\u201d</p> <p>It followed her earlier comments that Trump lacked an articulated position on anything, which she said made him a dangerous presidential candidate.</p> <p>\u201cWin or lose he\u2019s already set us back on the international and security front,\u201d said Khalil.</p> <p>O\u2019Rourke warned that perhaps Trump was not the real threat, but that his candidacy seemed to spark \u201can impulse to like a demagogue.\u201d</p> <p>Carr agreed Trump could be \u201cthe harbinger of something to come. It may not be this Trump, but it could be the Trump in four years time, as America becomes a society shaped by global forces that Washington can\u2019t control.\u201d</p> <p>Responding to a question about rising popular discontent with the Australian, US and UK establishments and support for Brexit, Trump, and newly reelected senator Pauline Hanson, Carr said there was a \u201cself-correcting process\u201d and Trump as president would result in \u201can enormous rethinking\u201d. </p> <p>\u201cThe sense of betrayal will be very rapid. How does somebody implement the promises that he has made? I think we\u2019ve seen a self-correcting process in the rise of the Green party in Australia. Its support hasn\u2019t continued to rise,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cAnd look at Clive Palmer, who was seen as a bit of a demagogue, I guess. The public looked at him, the public was entertained for a period and then the public dropped him. There is no alternative here but to trust in the good sense of the voters.\u201d</p> <p>Tirado said Australians were looking at their version of the rise of the Tea party, and it would be problematic when Turnbull has to negotiate with the One Nation senators over important issues like the economy and royal commissions.</p> <p>\u201cWhen we don\u2019t have the choices of pushing it one way or the other, that leads to a lot more people feeling disenfranchised\u201d.</p> <p>Khalil said the political elite had \u201cignored the losers of globalisation\u201d. </p> <p>\u201cWe see it here in Australia with Pauline Hanson. But you have a prime minister here who talks about innovation and how wonderful it is to be an Australian. But for many Australians, innovation is scary and no one is addressing these concerns of voters. There is a crisis with the middle class in the States \u2013 there\u2019s opiate addictions, high mortality rates and no-one outside of it are addressing those concerns. They have a voice in Trump \u2013 a narcissistic, crazy one, but they have a voice in Trump.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Evan McMullin, a little-known former CIA operative, is launching a third-party bid for president as a conservative alternative to Donald Trump.<br></p> <p>The independent run, first reported by <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/mckaycoppins/anti-trump-republican-launching-independent-presidential-bid?utm_term=.ptQANWqd5#.jgbkXQ4e1\">BuzzFeed</a> and <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://twitter.com/JoeNBC/status/762624156211023872?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Etweet\">MSNBC\u2019s Morning Joe</a>, comes as a faction of Republicans remain reticent to embrace Trump as the party\u2019s presidential nominee.</p> <p>McMullin, who until recently was employed as the chief policy director of the House Republican Conference, told ABC News there was still time to mount a campaign that could prove to be a spoiler in certain GOP-leaning states where <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/07/donald-trump-committed-fans-poll-drop-us-election\">Trump has lost ground in recent polls</a>.</p> <p>\u201cIn a year where Americans have lost faith in the candidates of both major parties, it\u2019s time for a generation of new leadership to step up,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cIt\u2019s never too late to do the right thing, and America deserves much better than either Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton can offer us.</p> <p>\u201cI humbly offer myself as a leader who can give millions of disaffected Americans a conservative choice for president.\u201d</p> <p>A \u201cMcMullin for President\u201d campaign fundraising website has been set up at <a href=\"http://www.evanmcmullin.com/\">EvanMcMullin.com</a>, which features a picture of McMullin with the text: \u201cStanding up to run for president because it\u2019s never too late to do the right thing.\u201d </p> <p>McMullin\u2019s candidacy is being pushed by backers of the \u201cNever Trump\u201d movement, which formed before the former reality TV star wrapped up the Republican nomination but has struggled until now to field an alternative candidate. </p> <p>Better for America, a group formed by Never Trump proponents, indicated that some influential Republicans would come out in support of McMullin following his announcement. He is expected to file paperwork on Monday afternoon, but would nonetheless face hurdles getting on the ballot in states where the deadline has already passed.</p> <p>Rory Cooper, a Republican strategist who counts himself among the Never Trump ranks, said it was important to have a candidate \u201cdraw a distinction between Trump and conservatism\u201d regardless of the odds. </p> <p>\u201cThere are clear and obvious hurdles to an independent run at this point, especially not being a household name, but I assume they are well aware of them and I\u2019ll withhold judgment and keep an open mind,\u201d said Cooper, who served as an aide to former House majority leader Eric Cantor. </p> <p>\u201cThe next generation of leaders need to step up and start making a difference or conservatism will be electorally challenged for years to come.\u201d</p> <p>But as Cooper indicates, McMullin holds little name recognition even among Republicans in Washington.

The monarch, emperor of Japan since 1989, said he wanted an orderly imperial family succession, stopping short of saying he intended to abdicate. Akihito has had heart surgery and treatment for prostate cancer. \u201cI am concerned it may become difficult for me to carry out my duties as the symbol of the state with my whole body and soul as I have done so far,\u201d he said.

  "<p>Donald Trump\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/31/donald-trump-mexico-president-nieto\">shock trip to Mexico</a> has the potential to shake up the US presidential election as the Republican candidate continues in an attempt to \u201csoften\u201d what has been one of his most hardline and controversial policy areas \u2013 immigration.</p> <p>Scheduled to take place just hours before Trump will finally spell out a definitive immigration policy after 14 months on the campaign trail, it will mark the first time that Trump has met with a head of state since becoming the Republican nominee and only his second foreign trip as a candidate. The first was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/23/donald-trump-faces-wall-of-opposition-as-he-returns-to-scotland\">his trip to Scotland</a> in the aftermath of the Brexit referendum.<br></p> <p>The visit was announced in characteristic fashion by Trump, on Twitter. Just minutes before the Republican candidate was due to take the stage at a campaign rally in the safe Democratic state of Washington on Tuesday night, he tweeted: \u201cI have accepted the invitation of President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto, of Mexico, and look very much forward to meeting him tomorrow.\u201d</p> <p>The meeting marks a shift in tone for Pe\u00f1a Nieto, who compared Trump to Mussolini and Hitler <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/mexican-president-pena-nieto-compares-donald-trump-to-hitler-and-mussolini/\">in a March interview</a> with a Mexican newspaper. \u201cI believe in dialogue to promote the interests of Mexico in the world and to protect Mexicans wherever they are,\u201d he tweeted early on Wednesday morning.</p> <p>It comes as the Mexican president is facing <a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/why-mexican-president-enrique-pe-nieto-so-unpopular-n640611\">historically low approval ratings</a> amid <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/22/mexico-president-enrique-pena-nieto-plagiarized-thesis-law-degree\">a plagiarism controversy</a> and an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/18/mexico-president-apologizes-luxury-home-contractor\">ongoing corruption scandal</a> over a house purchased by his wife from a government contractor. </p> <p>Trump touched down in Mexico City shortly after 1pm local time and is scheduled to meet with Pena Nieto for roughly 90 minutes at Los Pinos, the presidential residence. Afterwards both the Mexican president and the Republican nominee are expected to give statements to the press. It is unclear if either will take questions although Kellyanne Conway, Trump\u2019s campaign manager, insisted Wednesday that \u201cthere\u2019s going to be a press availability\u201d in an interview with Fox News.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s visit <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/31/donald-trump-mexico-visit-greeted-with-hostility-online\">has not been well received south of the border</a>. \u201c@realDonaldTrump you are not welcome in Mexico,\u201d tweeted <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MBarbosaMX/status/770822727510822912\">Miguel Barbosa</a>, of the opposition Party of the Democratic Revolution. \u201cGet out!

The pledge is a staple of his campaign rallies, at which he frequently asks the crowd: \u201cWho is going to pay for the wall?\u201d The response is loudly shouted: \u201cMexico.\u201d<br></p> <p>Within minutes of announcing his presidential campaign in June 2015, Trump claimed that the Mexican government was deliberately sending criminals and rapists across the border to the United States. The Republican nominee has <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/487316463204986880\">tweeted</a> that Mexico is an \u201cenemy\u201d of the United States and that the country is <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/570384640281870337?lang=en\">\u201ccorrupt.\u201d</a> Despite all this, he has long maintained: \u201cI love the Mexican people.\u201d</p> <p>The trip is only Trump\u2019s second visit abroad as a candidate. Although presidential candidates often travel overseas to boost their foreign policy credentials, Trump has kept almost entirely to the United States. The only exception was his June trip to Scotland for the opening of his golf course there. Then, Trump held <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/24/donald-trump-hails-eu-referendum-result-as-he-arrives-in-uk\">a self-congratulatory press conference</a> only hours after the UK had voted to leave the EU, at which the Republican nominee praised himself for correctly predicting the result. </p> <p>Unlike his trip to Scotland, Trump\u2019s visit to Mexico is intended to promote his campaign, not his personal business interests. It underscores the messaging in Trump\u2019s immigration speech scheduled for Wednesday night in Phoenix, Arizona. There, the Republican nominee is expected to try to strike a balance between the hardline rhetoric he used throughout the Republican primary and the need to deflect charges of racism in order to win a general election in November. </p> <p>The Republican nominee has struggled in the past two weeks to clarify his position on immigration, specifically whether he is undergoing \u201ca softening\u201d on his past call for the deportation of all 11 million illegal immigrants in the United States. Trump, who previously backed \u201ca deportation force,\u201d seemingly endorsed a path to legal status for undocumented immigrations and then reversed himself in the past week. The resulting lack of clarity forced prominent rightwing talkshow host Rush Limbaugh <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2016/aug/30/donald-trump-hillary-clinton-hacking-threat-election-live?page=with:block-57c5aa4be4b0df5f040dbd69#block-57c5aa4be4b0df5f040dbd69\">to admit to</a> his audience on Monday: \u201cI never took him seriously\u201d on immigration.</p> <p>In a statement, Tana Goertz, a former contestant on Trump\u2019s television show The Apprentice and senior advisor to his campaign, insisted that Trump would stay tough on immigration in his speech on Wednesday. </p> <p>\u201cThroughout his presidential campaign, Donald J Trump has been consistent in his calls to end illegal immigration by building a wall on our southern border. He is the only candidate in this race who will stop illegal immigration, secure our border, end sanctuary cities, enforce our existing laws and stop American employers from hiring illegal workers,\u201d she said. \u201cThese reforms will not only put an end to our illegal immigration epidemic \u2014 they will promote safe communities and good-paying jobs that will make America great again.\u201d</p> <p>The move on immigration follows rhetorical attempts to reach out to African American voters following a shakeup of his campaign team and the hiring of pollster Kellyanne Conway as his campaign manager and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/17/donald-trump-stephen-bannon-breitbart-news-kellyanne-conway\">Steve Bannon, former executive chairman of rightwing website Breitbart</a>, as his campaign CEO. </p> <p>Trump is not the only presidential candidate who has received an invitation from Pe\u00f1a Nieto. In a statement from senior campaign official, the Clinton campaign told the Guardian: \u201cWe have received a letter from President Pe\u00f1a Nieto requesting an opportunity to meet. Secretary Clinton last met with President Pe\u00f1a Nieto in Mexico in 2014 and our campaign is in a regular dialogue with the Mexican government officials. She looks forward to talking with President Pe\u00f1a Nieto again at the appropriate time.\u201d</p> <p>Trump reportedly went to Mexico accompanied by two close advisers, former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani and Senator Jeff Sessions from Alabama. However, the Republican nominee was not accompanied by his traveling press corps, who have been stranded in the United States in an unprecedented step. The Trump campaign has been historically combative towards the press and refused to credential a number of outlets for his events, including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/25/donald-trump-media-ban-guardian-denied-entry-campaign-event\">the Guardian in one instance</a>, on his trip to Scotland. </p> <p><em>Additional reporting by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/samjones\">Sam Jones</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/david-agren\">David Agren</a> in Villahermosa, Mexico</em></p>",
  "<p>The Southern Poverty Law Center\u2019s designation of the White Lives Matter organization <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/31/us/white-lives-matter-has-been-declared-a-hate-group.html?smprod=nytcore-ipad&amp;smid=nytcore-ipad-share\">as a hate group</a> this week confirms what we already knew: that a group of white racists have organized what might be called a backlash to the Black Lives Matter surge. </p> <p>It is more accurate, though, to view it as a continuation of a long and dreadful history of white supremacy in America. This country\u2019s practice of anti-black racism coupled with official denial of institutional racism and collective amnesia regarding the horrors and crimes inflicted on black people <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/15/black-american-culture-movement-identity-racism-political-art\">nurtures white resentment against black advancement</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/25/trump-trying-to-woo-black-voters-not-buying-it\">Trump is trying to woo black voters. We're not buying it | Barrett Holmes Pitner</a> </p> </aside>  <p>White supremacist groups rose in the civil war\u2019s aftermath, organized by southern white people determined to use violence to deny Reconstruction-era promotion of black citizenship. The Ku Klux Klan is the most famous of these groups, whose numbers steadily increased at the end of the 19th century. By the early 20th century the Klan\u2019s worldview helped shape the racial nativism \u2013 marked by anti-immigrant fervor, antisemitism and anti-Catholicism \u2013 that gripped the nation.</p> <p>The Klan practically joined the American mainstream during the 1920s, proudly marching by the tens of thousands in the nation\u2019s capital, their very presence giving weight to the pseudo-science of eugenics being popularized at the time.</p> <p>Fewer white hate groups dotted America\u2019s political landscape after the second world war, the result of both the success of racial segregation and the pushback from anti-racist groups during WWII\u2019s freedom surge. The 1954 Brown v Board of Ed supreme court desegregation decision resurrected these groups with a vengeance, one of the most notable being the White Citizens Councils opposing public school integration that gained traction throughout the south.</p> <p>By the late 1960s, the political energies of hate groups reached their apex in the candidacy of former Alabama governor George Wallace, who received nearly 10m popular votes as a segregationist candidate for president in 1968. And the Republican party\u2019s now infamous \u201csouthern strategy\u201d further cultivated disgruntled white voters, sometimes called \u201cDixiecrats\u201d, with naked appeals to racism.</p> <p>Donald Trump, the inheritor of this complex history, is playing a most dangerous game. His calls to \u201cmake America great again\u201d \u2013 which many view as thinly veiled code for white nationalism \u2013 has inspired millions of disgruntled and economically insecure white people, unleashing barely controlled furies that have roiled and embarrassed the nation. <br></p> <p>White Lives Matter proponents gained national attention when they <a href=\"http://www.chron.com/houston/article/White-Lives-Matter-group-protests-outside-NAACP-9176142.php\">staged a protest</a> outside of NAACP offices in Houston that prominently featured the Confederate flag. An outgrowth of a social media meme that spread among white people in the aftermath of Black Lives Matter protests, the group traffics in the fiction that white Americans are under assault from an onslaught of illegal immigration, reverse racism and political correctness. </p> <p>With ties to the white nationalist Aryan Front Coalition and a self-described mission to preserve the white race, White Lives Matter joins the Southern Poverty law Center\u2019s list of 892 active hate groups in the US. America\u2019s racial Pandora\u2019s box, once thought to have been closed by Obama\u2019s watershed presidential election, has been reopened with a vengeance.</p> <p>As our third consecutive summer of racial discontent comes to an end, white and black Americans remain <a href=\"http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/06/27/key-takeaways-race-and-inequality/\">split</a> over what might be called our collective racial reality. Blacks are more likely than whites to perceive racial discrimination, advocate for substantive policy changes, document unfair treatment by the criminal justice system and other institutions and to support Black Lives Matter.</p> <p>Yet these differences merely scratch the surface of the pernicious effect of groups such as White Lives Matter. Buoyed by Trump\u2019s campaign and the capitulation of mainstream Republicans, groups like White Lives Matter have helped anti-black racism to once again be normalized. And its activists form the latest beachhead in the racial archipelago that contours a nation that twice voted overwhelmingly to elect a black president.</p> <p>The devastating takeaway from allegations of reverse racism, the promotion of the Confederate flag and the demonization of Black Lives Matter is the surreal picture by many aggrieved whites that they are the most discriminated-against group in America. </p> <p>Even as social economic indicators reveal the exact opposite, the racial grievances and resentment emanating from such hate groups have successfully captured the imagination of a sizeable portion of the American electorate. White Lives Matter\u2019s designation as a hate group confirms what we already knew about not just one organization, but the iconic demagogue who has breathed life into racial furies that we recently thought were facing extinction. </p>",
  "<p>It was the early hours of the morning, and protesters who had gathered to support their deposed president were resting in the streets of the Honduran capital when the security forces attacked.</p> <p>Three months after he was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/jun/28/honduras-coup-president-zelaya\">snatched by troops and unceremoniously expelled from the country</a>, Manuel Zelaya had returned to Tegucigalpa and taken refuge in the Brazilian embassy.

He introduced a minimum wage, gave away energy-saving lightbulbs, and pledged to finally resolve longstanding land conflicts between peasant farmers and agribusinesses. </p> <p>In June 2009, Zelaya called a referendum to decide whether an extra vote should take place in November \u2013 alongside the general election \u2013 to reform the constitution. If approved, the reform would have allowed presidents to stand again for re-election.<br></p> <p>Two days before the vote, the army refused to deliver the ballot boxes.

In <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2010/11/28/world/20101128-cables-viewer.html?hp#report/cables-09TEGUCIGALPA645\">a diplomatic cable</a> later released by WikiLeaks, he wrote that while it was possible that Zelaya may have \u201ccommitted illegalities\u201d there was \u201cno doubt that the military, supreme court and National Congress conspired on June 28 in what constituted an illegal and unconstitutional coup against the executive branch\u201d. </p> <p>In the hardback edition of her autobiography Hard Choices, Clinton wrote that the head of the Honduran congress, Roberto Micheletti, and the country\u2019s supreme court \u201cclaimed to be protecting Honduran democracy against Zelaya\u2019s unlawful power grab and warned that he wanted to become another Chavez or Castro. </p> <p>\u201cCertainly the region did not need another dictator, and many knew Zelaya well enough to believe the charges against him.\u201d </p> <p>But Zelaya would not have benefited from the proposed referendum, said Christine Wade, associate professor of political science and international studies at Washington College.</p> <p>Wade, who described Zelaya as \u201can opportunist and pragmatist, [but] definitely not a leftist\u201d, said: \u201cThe referendum would have had zero impact on the November elections. Zelaya could not have extended his power.\u201d </p> <p>Wade argues that Zelaya\u2019s real crime was to incur the anger of powerful Hondurans by pushing for settlements in the country\u2019s many land disputes. </p> <p>Clinton has claimed that calling the military coup a military coup would have <a href=\"http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/gonzalez-clinton-policy-latin-american-crime-story-article-1.2598456\">increased the suffering of ordinary Hondurans</a> as it would have triggered the suspension of US aid.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0d13981bd83fc0c64a9ebb4b9a5c9eff7f571ede\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0d13981bd83fc0c64a9ebb4b9a5c9eff7f571ede/0_96_5232_3140/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Supporters of ousted Honduras president Manuel Zelaya clash with soldiers near the presidential residency in Tegucigalpa on 29 June 2009.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Supporters of ousted Honduras president Manuel Zelaya clash with soldiers near the presidential residency in Tegucigalpa on 29 June 2009.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Esteban Felix/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the weeks following the coup, Zelaya made three attempts to re-enter the country, which <a href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2009/07/24/clinton-calls-zelaya-reckless-trying-return-honduras.html\">Clinton described as reckless</a>. She has said that her focus at the time was on electing a new leader in order to ensure an orderly transition.</p> <p>In her memoir, she wrote: \u201cIn the subsequent days I spoke with my counterparts around the hemisphere \u2026 We strategized on a plan to restore order in Honduras and ensure that free and fair elections could be held quickly and legitimately, which would render the question of Zelaya moot.\u201d<br></p> <p>Leaked emails from Clinton\u2019s private server which were published by WikiLeaks show that during this period, the US <a href=\"http://www.telesurtv.net/english/news/Clinton-Emails-US-Warned-OAS-Head-on-Support-for-Honduran-Prez-20160728-0020.html\">pushed the OAS to support new elections and sideline Zelaya</a>. </p> <p>But the ousted leader still had real support at home: tens of thousands of people took to the streets in daily demonstrations demanding his return and the cancellation of the November elections which Clinton advocated. </p> <p>Meanwhile, the crackdown was brutal, said Karen Spring of the Honduras Solidarity Network. \u201cPeople were beaten, tortured, disappeared, jailed illegally. There were no conditions for free and fair elections; there was no peaceful transition.\u201d</p> <p>New elections that November went ahead without any international observers \u2013 apart from a delegation from the US Republican party \u2013 and were boycotted by large sections of society. The independent candidates, and some from Zelaya\u2019s Liberal party, pulled out. </p> <p>Mass protests continued until the rightwing National party\u2019s Pepe Lobo Sosa, was sworn in as president in January 2010. </p> <p>The new government swiftly unveiled a collection of pro-business policies and aggressively pursued a sell-off of natural resources.</p> <p>As community leaders like C\u00e1ceres fought back against mining, logging and agri-business projects, Honduras became the most dangerous country for environmental activists, with at least 118 killed since 2010, according to the latest data from Global Witness.</p> <p>The deaths came amid a general deterioration in human rights. Between 2009 and 2015, the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR) issued 41 protective measures covering hundreds of union workers, lawyers and LGBT, environmental and indigenous activists who were facing imminent risks. Only Colombia and Mexico \u2013 both of which have much larger populations \u2013 received more during the same period.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2014/jan/07/honduras-dirty-war-clean-energy-palm-oil-biofuels\">Honduras and the dirty war fuelled by the west's drive for clean energy</a> </p> </aside>  <p>One of Zelaya\u2019s most controversial policies had been to order an investigation into the entrenched land conflicts in the Bajo Agu\u00e1n region where campesinos were pitted against palm oil conglomerates.

This week, people are asking. </p> <p>The Maine Council of Churches, which represents Catholic and mainline Protestant denominations, denounced the governor\u2019s \u201cvitriolic personal attack and disrespect\u201d in a statement. \u201cThe words he chose to use in the message and interview were unspeakable \u2013 and yet, he spoke them, disgracing the office of governor and dishonoring our state in the eyes of the nation.\u201d</p> <p>Fellow Republican Amy Volk, a state senator, expressed \u201cdeep concern\u201d about his behavior, \u201cwhether it is due to substance abuse, mental illness, or just ignorance\u201d.</p> <p> LePage\u2019s political career may run aground, but he has been navigating uncharted waters for six years in this rural New England state of 1.3 million, previously known for its civil political discourse and the election of moderates such as US senators Olympia Snowe, Susan Collins and Bill Cohen (Republicans), George Mitchell and Ed Muskie (Democrats), and Angus King (independent).</p> <p> Within days of taking office in 2011, LePage was generating news headlines for telling the NAACP, on television on the eve of the annual Martin Luther King Jr holiday, to \u201ckiss my butt\u201d.</p> <p>He\u2019s since told the public that a Democratic senator liked to \u201cgive it to the people without Vaseline\u201d, that the Internal Revenue Service is akin to the Gestapo, that the state government he oversees is corrupt, and that he\u2019d like to bomb the state\u2019s largest newspaper, the Portland Press Herald. </p> <p> He\u2019s tangled with legislators of both parties, refusing for months to allow his commissioners to testify before legislative committees and, last year, suddenly issuing hundreds of vetoes of bills to retaliate against them for declining to take up his initiative to eliminate the state income tax. (Lawmakers of both parties overturned most of the vetoes.) </p> <p>There were calls for his impeachment last year over an incident in which LePage threatened to cut off state funding to an educational not-for-profit group unless its board reconsidered a decision to hire the outgoing Democratic house speaker, Mark Eves, to lead the organization. Ultimately, legislators took no action and Eves had to find work elsewhere.</p> <p>In a racially charged preamble to the current controversy, LePage told a crowd in January that \u201cguys with the name D-Money, Smoothie, Shifty \u2013 these types of guys\u201d come to Maine \u201cfrom Connecticut and New York\u201d to try to sell heroin and \u201cimpregnate a young white girl before they leave\u201d.

Snowe was orphaned at a young age. LePage, the eldest of 18 children, ran away from home at 11 after his father broke his jaw in one of his frequent child-beating sessions. </p> <p>Raised through the kindness of several area businesspeople, LePage got into college and had his first year\u2019s tuition paid for by lawmaker and businessman Peter Snowe, who would later marry Olympia and who died in a 1973 car accident.</p> <p>LePage thrived in college and went on to a career in business management, eventually specializing in winding down bankrupt companies. He was mayor of Waterville, a town of 16,000, and was elected governor in a tight three-way race in 2010, promising to crack down on welfare cheats, reduce taxes and regulations, and thereby revive the state\u2019s moribund economy. He has said that welfare dependency undermined some of his younger siblings.</p> <p>In the current presidential election cycle, LePage was one of the first sitting governors to endorse Chris Christie for the Republican nomination, then followed Christie in switching his allegiance to Trump. Trump\u2019s campaign recently hired LePage\u2019s daughter as its coalitions director for the state.</p> <p>In the latest controversy, the governor revealed he collects press clippings of drug dealer arrests and keeps them in a three-ring binder. Over 90% of those pictured, he has claimed, are black and Hispanic. FBI data shows black people account for 14.1% of drug arrests in Maine.</p> <p>On Monday, LePage was sticking to his assertions. At a meeting of New England governors in Boston, he said of heroin dealers arrested in Maine: \u201cThey\u2019re Hispanic and they\u2019re black and they\u2019re from Lowell and Lawrence, Massachusetts; Waterbury, Connecticut; and the Bronx and Brooklyn.\u201d It was not clear why the race of the drug dealers was important.</p> <p>On Wednesday, LePage said Wednesday he would not resign.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not an alcoholic, and I\u2019m not a drug addict, and I don\u2019t have mental issues,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat I have is a backbone.\u201d</p> <p>He said instead he would seek \u201cspiritual guidance\u201d. He also <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2016/08/paul-lepage-vows-never-speak-media-227589\">vowed</a> never to speak to the press again, according to Politico. </p> <p>But legislative Republicans might have an incentive to impeach him before the November election, which would make the current president of the state senate, Michael Thibodeau, governor. If Democrats were to recapture control of the state senate, a future impeachment effort could give them the governor\u2019s mansion as well.</p> <ul> <li>This article was amended on 12 September 2016 to clarify that Peter Snowe was a lawmaker and businessman, not an attorney.</li> </ul>",

Now, from his fiery <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/video/national/watch-rudy-giulianis-full-speech-at-the-rnc/2016/07/18/d11411b8-4d57-11e6-bf27-405106836f96_video.html?tid=a_inl\">convention speech</a> to his specious claim that there were <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/aug/16/rudy-giuliani/aside-from-911-rudy-giuliani-wrong-about-no-terr/\">no terrorist attacks</a> in the eight years before Barack Obama\u2019s election, the former New York City mayor often seems to make pronouncements that are divorced from reality.</p> <p>But that\u2019s not new. That\u2019s Rudy Giuliani. As New Yorkers learned early on during his administration as mayor in 1990s, Giuliani has always had a penchant for bluster, for taking credit from his subordinates, and for an authoritarian single-mindedness. No wonder he\u2019s stumping for Donald Trump.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/30/rudy-giuliani-beyonce-black-lives-vmas\">Rudy Giuliani: I've 'saved more black lives' than Beyonc\u00e9</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I can\u2019t say I envy him as he tries to secure his legacy. Being America\u2019s Mayor is an impossible act to follow, and leading New York City has long been considered the \u201c<a href=\"http://www.barrypopik.com/index.php/new_york_city/entry/second_toughest_job_in_america_nyc_mayor\">second toughest job in America</a>\u201d. By implication, there\u2019s only one step up \u2013 the White House \u2013 and in 2007, Giuliani threw his hat into the presidential ring. Riding on his post-9/11 fame, Giuliani was an early favorite, but after dismal results in the early primaries, he withdrew in January 2008.</p> <p>Was his failure merely due to the fact that <a href=\"http://blogs.abcnews.com/politicalradar/2008/01/koch-on-giulian.html\">no New York City mayor</a> has ever bridged the gap from city hall to the Oval Office? Or was there something more in Giuliani\u2019s brash personality and his law-and-order mentality that couldn\u2019t make the transition to a national audience?</p> <p>Giuliani rose to national prominence when America was reeling from the 9/11 attacks. And as lawyer Ron Kuby points out in the documentary <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Giuliani-Time-Kevin-Keating/dp/B002UXFANC\">Giuliani Time</a>, in a crisis people are looking for a powerful authority figure. But what about the other eight years of his mayoralty? Most people realize that what works in a crisis isn\u2019t necessarily appropriate at other times \u2013 but that never stopped Giuliani. To him, New York had always been under attack.</p> <p>At the beginning of his first term, Giuliani gave a <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1994/03/20/nyregion/freedom-is-about-authority-excerpts-from-giuliani-speech-on-crime.html\">chilling speech</a> in which he said: \u201cFreedom is not a concept in which people can do anything they want, be anything they can be. Freedom is about authority. Freedom is about the willingness of every single human being to cede to lawful authority a great deal of discretion about what you do.\u201d</p> <p>He proceeded to put his words into action. First, he made good on a campaign promise to clean up squeegee men \u2013 launching the so-called \u201c<a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/criticism-for-giulianis-broken-windows-theory-2014-12\">broken windows\u201d era</a> that would end up disproportionately jailing black people and other minorities. He then embraced the <a href=\"http://nymag.com/nymetro/news/anniversary/35th/n_8551/\">ideas of transit cop Jack Maple</a> and helped launch CompStat, the city\u2019s data-driven crime-fighting system. It can\u2019t be denied that crime fell \u2013 and that\u2019s how Giuliani is today able to claim he saved \u201cmore black lives\u201d than Beyonc\u00e9. <br></p> <p>But despite CompStat\u2019s real successes, it also can\u2019t be denied that crime was already falling when he took office \u2013 and it was happening nationwide. Later, when New York police commissioner William Bratton landed on the cover of Time magazine as New York\u2019s top crime fighter, <a href=\"http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/hamill-bratton-sounds-de-blasio-policing-policies-article-1.1489351\">Giuliani pushed him out</a> for taking too much credit. </p> <p>There were other clear signs of paranoia during the Giuliani years. Long before the World Trade Center attacks, the front steps of city hall \u2013 a place for public gatherings and protest \u2013 were <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2000/04/21/nyregion/giuliani-defends-decision-over-access-to-city-hall.html\">sealed off by police barricades</a> that remain in place today. The administration claimed it was a security measure; the mayor\u2019s detractors felt certain it was done to limit access and stifle free speech. <br></p> <p>Giuliani\u2019s city hall was also the subject of constant lawsuits. Some were filed by <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1998/12/22/nyregion/court-tells-giuliani-to-release-budget-data.html\">other city agencies</a> to which he wouldn\u2019t release necessary data; others were brought by individuals whose whose constitutional rights were being violated by the city. Many of those lawsuits <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2004/12/24/nyregion/a-legacy-of-giuliani-years-damage-suits-against-city.html\">were still being settled</a> \u2013 for millions of dollars \u2013 years into the administration of Mike Bloomberg, Giuliani\u2019s successor.</p> <p>In short, Rudy Giuliani wasn\u2019t a great mayor, or even a good one. But on one terrible day, he was a strong, decisive one. He could have faded quietly into history, remembered as the man who kept the city together in its hour of need. Instead, by becoming Donald Trump\u2019s attack dog, the former mayor has instead ensured that his larger-than-life ego and his combative abrasiveness \u2013 the qualities New Yorkers remember all too well, and which kept him from the presidency \u2013 will ultimately define his legacy.</p>",

  "<p>Immigration has been one of Donald Trump\u2019s signature issues since he announced his presidential campaign in June 2015. From the moment he got off the escalator at Trump Tower in New York and spoke about Mexico deliberately sending criminals and \u201crapists\u201d to the United States and the need to build a wall on the southern border, Trump hasn\u2019t stopped talking about immigration. </p> <p>But in his Wednesday speech on the topic in Phoenix \u2013 which will follow <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/31/donald-trump-mexico-president-nieto\">his surprise visit to Mexico</a> \u2013 Trump will need to balance the hardline rhetoric he used throughout the Republican primary with the need to win a general election in November.<br></p> <p>Trump rode his hardline stance to victory in the primary. While his rivals refused to categorically rule out a path to legal status for any of the 11 million undocumented immigrants currently living in the United States, Trump talked about <a href=\"http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/trump-vows-humane-deportation-force\">\u201ca deportation force\u201d</a> to remove all of them <a href=\"http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2015/09/11/donald-trump-says-immigrant-deportations-done-in-two-years/\">within 18 to 24 months.</a> </p> <p>However, the Republican nominee <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/aug/27/donald-trump-deport-11-million-migrants-is-that-even-possible\">never worked out his plan in detail</a>. The Trump campaign has divulged little on its actual policy, save <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/aug/18/donald-trump-immigration-mexico-economy\">a set of proposals</a> dating back to August 2015. At almost every rally, Trump pledges that he will \u201cbuild a wall and make Mexico pay for it\u201d, but he has rarely gone into more detail. </p> <p>But, facing a general election where he has major deficits in the polls and is reviled by Latino voters, the Republican nominee has begun what he called a rhetorical \u201csoftening\u201d in recent weeks, raising questions about whether he was ever sincere in his hardline stance. </p> <p>In the past week and a half, Trump <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/24/donald-trump-immigration-reform-sean-hannity-fox-news\">seemingly endorsed a path to legal status for</a> undocumented immigrants in an interview with Fox News\u2019s Sean Hannity, only to <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/08/25/politics/trump-no-legal-status-for-undocumented-immigrants/\">reverse himself</a> in an interview with CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper.

In <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/27/donald-trump-immigration-policy-deportation\">a speech in Iowa</a> on Saturday, Trump spoke about details from his August 2015 plan that had gone almost unmentioned since, including the implementation of E-Verify (an online system that allows businesses to screen employees\u2019 work eligibility) nationwide as well as an exit-entry tracking system to prevent visa overstays. However, Trump dismissed the question of what to do with the 11 million illegal immigrants in the country, instead blaming the media: \u201cIn recent days, the media \u2013 as it usually does \u2013 has missed the whole point on immigration,\u201d he said. \u201cAll the media wants to talk about is the 11 million or more people here illegally.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/28/donald-trump-immigration-plan-deportation-mike-pence\">Trump surrogates: Republican's position on immigration has not changed</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Mark Krikorian, a leading immigration hawk and head of the Center for Immigration Studies, bemoaned the fact that Trump has spent a \u201cweek and a half meandering\u201d on immigration.

He\u2019s running as \u2018Mr Immigration Control\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>Krikorian told the Guardian he thought that Trump can only end up in the place where he actually started, \u201cfocusing on enforcement tools like E-Verify and tracking for visa holders\u201d.</p> <p>The vocal immigration hawk thought \u201cthe question of what happens to illegal immigrants is secondary; [the] primary question is how we stop another 12 million people from coming here.\u201d He noted that Trump was on record saying that some form of \u201camnesty\u201d would always happen but that \u201ca politician has no business talking like that and that\u2019s the one most important thing that I am looking to not see, is some kind of guarantee or commitment of amnesty.\u201d But he said that he was far less concerned about the wall, which \u201cas a policy matter is not that important\u201d.</p> <p>In the meantime, those on the right worried about a rhetorical softening did find some comfort from an interview that Trump\u2019s son, Donald Jr, gave to CNN on Tuesday, in which he said that his father\u2019s stance on undocumented immigrants was still the same and that all 11 million had to leave the country. But as longtime Trump adviser Roger Stone once said: \u201cNo one speaks for Donald Trump but Donald Trump.\u201d</p> <p>The Republican nominee is scheduled to give his immigration speech at 6pm local time at the Phoenix Convention Center on Wednesday. </p>",

Starting in 2008 but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/17/brazil-petrobras-scandal-oil-general-election\">ramping up in 2014</a>, federal police, prosecutors and judges have uncovered a multibillion-dollar kickback and bribery scandal at the state-run oil firm Petrobras, the biggest company in Latin America until the scandal hit.</p> <p>Essentially, contracts were inflated so up to 3% of funds could be channelled to the three parties that previously formed a ruling coalition: the Workers party, the Democratic Movement party of Brazil (PMDB) and the Progressive party. The probe, however, has widened to include other parties and other projects, including the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/08/brazil-rousseff-corruption-belo-monte-dam\">Belo Monte hydroelectric dam</a>. Some predict it will lead to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/15/brazil-impeachment-economy-crisis-corruption\">greatest jailing of lawmakers</a> in world history.</p> <h2>What has been the impact on the country?</h2> <p>The scandal has paralysed the government because bribes were essential for building coalitions. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/16/rio-olympics-crisis-brazil-zika-athletes-woes-uplift\">It has also choked business</a> because prosecutors ordered the suspension of contracts between Petrobras and its major suppliers, which included almost all of the country\u2019s biggest construction and shipping firms.

But that future is a long way off, if it comes at all.</p> <h2>Why do Brazilian parties need slush funds?</h2> <p>Politicians all over the world need campaign finance, but it is particularly important in Brazil due to the country\u2019s vast size, plethora of parties, three levels of government (with regular elections for municipal, state and national leaders and legislators) and an open-list election system for lawmakers. No single party has ever come close to a commanding majority in Congress, so support is bought with cabinet posts and/or cash.</p> <h2>Who is making the accusations?</h2> <p>The investigation is nationwide, but the charge is being led by judicial figures in the southern city of Curitiba. Most influential among them is Judge Sergio Moro, who has become something of a cult figure for his willingness to take on the country\u2019s most powerful politicians and business people.

Prosecutors have found no evidence that she was involved and even her enemies acknowledge that she is one of the few politicians in Brazil not to accept bribes.</p> <p>However, it is widely assumed that Rousseff must have known what was going on because she was a former energy minister and chief of staff at the height of the wrongdoing. Many of her confidants have been arrested or are on trial. Whether she was aware of what was going on or not, she benefited from the campaign funds and failed to halt the corruption. Prosecutors allege she also <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/17/brazil-judge-lula-da-silva-appointment-cabinet-wiretap-scandal-rousseff\">tried to obstruct their investigation</a> and protect her ally Lula by appointing him to the cabinet. </p> <h2>Is that why Rousseff was being impeached?</h2> <p>Only partly, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/12/the-guardian-view-on-dilma-rousseffs-impeachment-the-political-system-should-be-on-trial-not-one-woman\">for all the wrong reasons</a>. Rousseff has ostensibly been thrown out of office because she window-dressed government accounts ahead of the last presidential election. The charge is that her government filled holes in its accounts by taking loans from state banks without congressional approval.</p> <p>Opponents say this creative accounting \u2013 accounting sleights of hand known as \u201cpedaladas\u201d (pedalling) \u2013 allowed the administration to fund a program for family farmers using money that was not reimbursed until several months later, bypassing Congress, creating a misleading impression of state finances and adding to economic instability.</p> <p>In her defence, Rousseff said the money was not a loan because it was simply being transferred through the state banks from public coffers. Similar practices had also been used by previous administrations, though not at the same scale.</p> <p>But this is a pretext. The real reasons for impeachment are political. Rousseff is enormously unpopular because she is blamed for the multiple crises facing the country and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/09/dilma-rousseff-brazil-impeachment-fight-congress-vote\">has proved an inept leader</a>. But Brazil\u2019s constitution does not allow a no-confidence vote to eject her from office so her enemies are using impeachment to do the job.</p> <p>Some are clearly motivated by a desire to kill the Lava Jato investigation, which Rousseff refused to do. The impeachment process was initiated by Cunha after the Workers party refused to protect him from an ethics committee investigation. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/23/brazil-dilma-rousseff-plot-secret-phone-transcript-impeachment\">Secretly recorded conversations</a> have also revealed that the PMDB leader in the Senate, Romero Juc\u00e1, wanted to remove the president so the Lava Jato investigation could be choked by her successor.</p> <h2>Where does that leave interim president Michel Temer?</h2> <p>Rousseff\u2019s centre-right successor is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/03/brazil-michel-temer-dilma-rousseff-impeachment\">almost as despised</a> as his predecessor after helping lead the campaign to bring down his running mate, then <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/13/brazil-dilma-rousseff-impeachment-michel-temer-cabinet\">naming an all-male, all-white cabinet</a> and losing three ministers to the Lava Jato scandal in his first month in office.

But none of the alternatives are popular. Temer\u2019s administration has ratings in the low teens. Lula\u2019s popularity is higher, but he is also hated by more people. The biggest beneficiary might eventually be former environment minister Marina Silva, a losing candidate in the last two presidential campaigns.</p> <h2>Where does Brazil go from here?</h2> <p>In a best-case scenario, the economy will pick up next year and Lava Jato will purge the nation\u2019s political canker, allowing Latin America\u2019s biggest nation to concentrate more effectively on social equality, sustainable development and regional integration.</p> <p>Alternatively, the old hierarchy will quietly shelve Lava Jato once Lula and Rousseff are out of the way and restore the conservative policies of the past; or even open the way \u2013 as in Italy after the <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-01-30/from-clean-hands-to-carwash-brazil-probe-follows-italian-model\">Clean Hands investigation</a> \u2013 for a Silvio Berlusconi-like right-wing populist.</p>",

And earlier this month, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/17/donald-trump-stephen-bannon-breitbart-news-kellyanne-conway\">Trump appointed Steve Bannon</a>, Goldman Sachs banker turned film-maker and former chairman of the self-identified \u201calt-right\u201d Breitbart News website, as his campaign CEO alongside veteran pollster Kellyanne Conway as his campaign manager.</p> <p>The media certainly thinks it\u2019s spotted the upcoming twist. \u201cWhat if Trump and Breitbart could team up, raise some money from outside investors, and bring aboard some of the television executives who built Fox News?\u201d <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/what-are-donald-trump-roger-ailes-and-steve-bannon-really-up-to\">asked the New Yorker</a> last week. Vanity Fair <a href=\"http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2016/06/donald-trump-tv-network\">recently</a> reported Trump is looking to \u201cmonetize\u201d his \u201caudience\u201d through a possible \u201cmini-media\u201d conglomerate. The New York Times <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/18/us/politics/donald-trump-stephen-bannon-paul-manafort.html?_r=1\">reported</a> this month that Trump and his son-in-law, New York Observer publisher Jared Kushner, have been mulling over a media holding. CNN\u2019s chief media watcher Brian Stelter recently reported: \u201cWhat he might wanna do is launch a new television channel, or launch a new giant website, a new subscription service, he might be thinking about a media enterprise.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI think he\u2019s definitely working to cement his brand with an audience,\u201d said NPR media reporter David Folkenflik. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/aug/21/roger-ailes-gabriel-sherman-fox-news-book-rightwing-media\">Roger Ailes biographer: 'The impact could be greater than phone hacking'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There\u2019s certainly room out there for a Trump media brand. As Fox News expert and New York magazine writer Gabriel Sherman <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/aug/21/roger-ailes-gabriel-sherman-fox-news-book-rightwing-media\">told the Guardian</a> recently, the landscape is shifting in rightwing media thanks to Ailes\u2019s fall and Trump\u2019s rise. \u201cFox was this amazing unifier of all the strands of conservatism together \u2026 [Now] it\u2019s kind of a Lord of the Flies situation where everyone\u2019s trying to kill each other.\u201d<br></p> <p>As Trump\u2019s dysfunctional, bare-bones campaign continues to come up short in the polls, a media plan B makes sense. His alt-right base is too small to win an election, but big enough to make him some money afterward.  </p> <p>But this is a plan that has been tried before, and with less than impressive results. </p> <p>The most obvious forerunner was Sarah Palin, seen by many as Trump 1.0. Here was another rightwing \u201coutsider\u201d who, after the 2012 election, attempted to cash in on her stardom with the Sarah Palin Channel, a digital network run with the web-based TV company TAPP.<br></p> <p>Palin charged $10 per month to ride the straight-talk express, with sub-channels <a href=\"http://www.mediaite.com/online/sarah-palin-abandons-subscription-based-online-video-channel/\">including</a> New Life TV \u2013 \u201crecharge your relationships and grow closer to God\u201d \u2013 Live with Joan Lunden \u2013 \u201ca vibrant community for women\u2019s wellness and breast cancer patients and survivors\u201d \u2013 and K-Love TV \u2013 \u201cChristian Rock, Inspiration, and Family Values\u201d.</p> <p>The lineup failed to find an audience and by 2014 the Sarah Palin Channel was <a href=\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/11/07/stuck-in-the-lamestream-sarah-palin-tv-has-two-twitter-followers.html\">racking up</a> a mere 36,000 views a month, considerably less than many gardening blogs. The URL now leads to \u201c<a href=\"https://www.sarahpac.com/#modal\">SarahPAC.com</a>,\u201d the home of her political action committee that raises money for conservative candidates.</p> <p>Not far behind Palin\u2019s debacle, and also produced by TAPP, was The Herman Cain Channel \u2013 launched by another Republican presidential wannabe who briefly rose to national prominence. \u201cCainTV\u201d <a href=\"http://www.theblaze.com/blog/2013/08/20/cain-tv-is-no-more/\">died</a> in 2013 but then came back as a low-grade news blog framed by ads plugging Cain\u2019s books and radio shows. \u201cCainTV delivers it all in an Informed, Inspirational, and INtertaining way,\u201d goes its slogan. It too has failed to evolve into the conglomerate the former pizza magnate had likely envisioned. </p> <p>Finally, and perhaps most ominously for Trump, there\u2019s the demise of conservative radio and TV star Glenn Beck\u2019s post-Fox News venture, The Blaze. If anyone was likely to pull off a digital media empire targeting the audience of (relatively) young, pissed-off, conspiratorial conservatives, it should have been Beck.</p> <p>The former Fox host wanted to engineer a fresh news channel from digital beginnings, a scrappy upstart with enough populist appeal to challenge the mighty Fox brand with none of the legacy costs of mainstream media. What he produced was significantly less than that, and it\u2019s been bleeding money and staff for years. The Blaze <a href=\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/04/28/40-layoffs-as-glenn-beck-s-blaze-empire-continues-its-decline-and-fall.html\">laid off</a> 40 employees in April, as traffic and advertising revenue continued to wither away.</p> <p>The legacy of new media ventures further to the left is equally awful: onetime Democratic presidential candidate and vice-president Al Gore\u2019s CurrentTV failed spectacularly, burning money to attract an audience it could neither find nor hold. It was taken over and rebranded by the deep pocketed Al Jazeera network in 2013, but after three very expensive years Al Jazeera America closed in April.</p> <p>Trump would certainly argue he could do better. But building a media empire isn\u2019t as easy as burning down a political campaign. It requires serious money and a long-term strategy. These are not major turn-ons for the man who <a href=\"http://gawker.com/a-complete-list-of-donald-trump-s-business-disasters-1764151188\">brought</a> you 12-months of Trump Steaks and less than a year of Trump-brand water.</p> <p>\u201cYou gotta remember that Trump doesn\u2019t want to spend a lot of money on this,\u201d said Folkenflik. \u201cIt costs a ton of money. Murdoch had to pay cable providers to put Fox on.\u201d</p> <p>Even if Trump does commit to a more upscale venture, who would have the vision to run it? Ailes seems like an obvious choice until one considers that he\u2019s a 76-year-old in legal trouble and visibly poor health; and he wouldn\u2019t be able to start until his noncompete agreement with Fox News expires at the end of 2018. Still, even pushing 80, it\u2019s hard to imagine him mellowing with age. He has scores to settle with James and Lachlan Murdoch, sons of his former mentor and partner Rupert, who were always looking to <a href=\"https://www.google.com/?ion=1&amp;espv=2#q=lachlan%20murdoch%20ailes\">knock</a> him off his throne.</p> <p>\u201cI think Ailes would love a chance to once more stick it in the eye of the establishment and the Murdoch sons,\u201d Folkenflik said. \u201cBut also, it\u2019s not just that he\u2019s not a young man anymore, it\u2019s that he\u2019s not in good shape. He\u2019s not gonna be the guy in charge.\u201d</p> <p>Meanwhile Bannon, like so many other Trump campaign officials, is in the midst of public and embarrassing scandals, dealing with allegations <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/26/steve-bannon-florida-registered-vote-donald-trump\">that he violated Florida\u2019s voting laws</a> and reports of domestic abuse.</p> <p>Still, those charges may not matter to Trump, who is already happily defending and working with Ailes despite his issues. And they certainly don\u2019t matter to Trump\u2019s base, who tend to dismiss charges against Trump and his campaign as \u201cPC\u201d thuggery and liberal media bias.</p> <p>The final decision lies with Trump; he may jump at the chance to make a TV channel in his image, or he may just license his brand and let someone like Bannon or an Ailes-led brains trust take the reins. Trump loyalists like Fox News star Sean Hannity \u2013 who makes enough money from his radio career to leave his perch at Fox News \u2013 could possibly sign up to join a new splinter cell. Or maybe Trump will simply complete the marriage between his campaign and Breitbart News and put some money into an alt-right shop that\u2019s already <a href=\"http://www.ibtimes.com/trump-loving-breitbart-news-having-great-election-year-despite-massive-meltdown-2345760\">doing well</a>.</p> <p>If the Trumps don\u2019t make it to the White House, the family patriarch may indeed start a new \u201cmedia conglomerate\u201d. But business history, not least Trump\u2019s own business history, suggests a low-risk, low-grade propaganda house rather than a sprawling new cable empire. As his buddy Ailes has no doubt warned him, talk is cheap \u2013 but news is expensive. </p>",
  "<p>John Howard has pointed to the lessons of Donald Trump\u2019s rise in the US to argue that buttressing the middle class is fundamental to enduring success in politics and preserving the stability and harmony of societies.<br></p> <p>In an interview before of the broadcast of a new series he has produced with the ABC about Robert Menzies, Howard told Guardian Australia it was during the Menzies period that the \u201cgreat Australian middle class\u201d emerged, and preserving a robust middle class was the \u201ccement\u201d holding societies together.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s the greatest strength that Australia has \u2013 we have more, proportionately, in the middle,\u201d Howard said on Wednesday. \u201cThis is one of America\u2019s problems and one of the explanations of the Trump phenomenon.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/feb/28/john-howard-says-he-trembles-at-thought-of-donald-trump-becoming-us-president\">John Howard says he 'trembles' at thought of Donald Trump becoming US president</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cI think there is truth in the argument that [Trump] is appealing to people who have suffered,\u201d he said. \u201cTheir incomes have fallen, many of them have lost their jobs, the statistics tell a vivid story \u2013 people are just worse off now, in the middle.\u201d</p> <p>The former prime minister declined to be drawn on contemporary politics, replying \u201cnext question\u201d when asked what Malcolm Turnbull could learn from the person who founded the modern Liberal party.</p> <p>But he made general observations when asked about the lessons contemporary politics could draw from the Menzies prime ministership.</p> <p>Howard noted the bedrock of Menzies\u2019 success, and his own, was an ongoing dialogue with the middle class. \u201cVery much so. It, more than anything else, holds the country together,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cIt reinforces the notion of fairness and egalitarianism. It stands to reason that if you have a large middle class then the nation is more cohesive and people aren\u2019t conscious of gaps.</p> <p>\u201cWe still have people who need to be looked after, we have people who are poor and people who are in need of government assistance and we have some people who are very well off.</p> <p>\u201cMy philosophy is I don\u2019t mind people having a lot of money provided they get it honestly and they pay their tax. I have absolutely no objection. I believe in capitalism.</p> <p>\u201cBut the issue is the great bulk of the people in the middle. The stronger and larger the middle class is, the more stable the country is. History is on the side of that argument. You only have to examine the history of Europe in Australia to understand that.</p> <p>\u201c[Buttressing the middle class] has been very much part of the national cement and it\u2019s very important to keep it. You keep it through a range of policy approaches on a whole raft of policy issues, and obviously fundamental is a stable economy.</p> <p>\u201cA stable economy is produced by a range of policies according to the circumstances of the day, but I don\u2019t want to get into that. It\u2019s not the purpose of the interview.\u201d</p> <p>Howard also nominated consistency and strong cabinet processes as lessons that could be drawn in the modern political era from the success of Menzies, who was prime minister for more than 18 years. He said successful prime ministers understood Australian politics was \u201ca combination of the desirable and the achievable. You are successful if you can achieve the optimum blend of those two things.\u201d</p> <p>Howard said leaders needed ideology and pragmatism. \u201cYou need both. You\u2019ve got to believe in things, and one of his great strengths was he did believe in things and people were in no doubt as to where he stood or where he would jump on issues, but he was also a pragmatist with great political skills.\u201d</p> <p>He noted that Menzies had not been a presidential figure but an \u201corthodox cabinet prime minister\u201d who was very attentive to the views of his backbench. He also understood the \u201ccardinal importance\u201d of a united Coalition.</p> <p>\u201cThat is something that has always been a key element of our success. He understood it, Fraser understood it, I understood it and of course Abbott and Turnbull have practised that as well.\u201d</p> <p>In the series that airs on the ABC on 18 and 25 September, Howard interviews the former Labor prime minister Bob Hawke about the Menzies period. \u201cThe Labor left critique of Menzies is they were wasted years.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/30/america-problems-obama-fault-george-w-bush-election-2016\">America's problems aren't Obama's fault. They're George W Bush's | Richard Wolffe</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Howard said both his book on Menzies, and the television series, were an effort to refute that suggestion. He addresses the major events of the Menzies period and backs the decision to commit Australia to the Vietnam war.</p> <p>Halting the advance of communism through east Asia was an aspiration he would have \u201cprobably\u201d subscribed to in the 1960s, he said. He reasoned you can only ever answer whether a decision was right or wrong by \u201cputting yourself in the shoes of the decision maker at the time\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cObviously decisions are taken and then subsequent events might cast a different light on the decision,\u201d Howard said on Wednesday.</p> <p>\u201cWhat I say in the program is if I had been in Menzies\u2019 shoes in the 1960s I would have taken the same decision as he did. And why? He quite rightly judged that involvement in Vietnam was important in relation to the alliance with the US and the maintenance of American interest in our part of the world then.</p> <p>\u201cIn the 1960s that was seen as an even higher priority than it is now. I regarded the context of that decision \u2013 and context is everything \u2013 as justifying the decision he took.\u201d</p>",

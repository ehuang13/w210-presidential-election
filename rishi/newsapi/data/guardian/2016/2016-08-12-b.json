  "<p>Hillary Clinton added yet another first to her r\u00e9sum\u00e9 on Friday, becoming the first presidential candidate to have a campaign <a href=\"https://www.hillaryclinton.com/page/podcast/\">podcast</a>.</p> <p>The first episode of the free audio broadcast, titled With Her, is a conversation between Clinton and <a href=\"https://longform.org/about\">Longform cofounder</a> Max Linsky, though it won\u2019t always feature the candidate herself. Future episodes will include interviews with other higher-ups in the campaign and, the podcasters hope, some staffers and even volunteers out in the states. The next episode, with a \u201cvery important\u201d campaign staffer, is tentatively scheduled to tape next week.</p> <p>Don\u2019t look for that next episode next Friday, though. \u201cWe\u2019re sort of bucking one of the traditional rules of podcasting, which is that you come out at the same time every week,\u201d said Linsky. \u201cBut with a presidential campaign, that\u2019s not always possible.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/12/hillary-clinton-tim-kaine-tax-returns\">Hillary Clinton releases 2015 tax return and Tim Kaine unveils 10 years' worth</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Clinton\u2019s is the first podcast launched by startup Pineapple Street Media, a collaboration between Linsky and longtime public radio producer and recent BuzzFeed podcaster Jenna Weiss-Berman that only opened in May 2016. </p> <p>Linsky and Weiss-Berman are both supporters of Clinton \u2013 Linsky told the Guardian she was \u201ca big fan\u201d and Weiss-Berman said: \u201cI really like Hillary Clinton and want her to win\u201d \u2013 but the podcast isn\u2019t a labor of love. It\u2019s produced for and with the campaign, which had been considering doing a podcast for nearly a year before Weiss-Berman approached them.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not journalism, but that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not true,\u201d said Linsky \u2013 possibly in response to <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/08/hillary_clinton_s_podcast_with_her_is_charming_gutless_propaganda.html\">criticisms</a> that the podcast was more like an advertisement for Clinton\u2019s candidacy than a more critical exploration of it. \u201cWe\u2019re just trying to get a sense of what it really feels like to run for president, in every sense.\u201d</p> <p>Laura Olin, who consults with the Clinton digital team and was the social media director for Barack Obama\u2019s 2012 campaign, says that using social media is an important way for candidates not just to connect with potential voters but to activate supporters to donate money \u2013 especially in small dollar donations \u2013 and eventually make phone calls and knock on doors.</p> <p>\u201cThe way to get people engaged and interested and then take small actions on behalf of the campaign is to build relationships with people,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd you have to go to where they are, and connect with them on that level.\u201d</p> <p>For the 2012 campaign, which pioneered the use of Tumblr, Instagram, Pinterest and even Spotify to connect directly with voters, Olin said organizers had to be very strategic in which social media they chose to use, because there were only 14 staffers involved in the effort. \u201cIt was looking at the demographics of each platform, and how it would reach the target audiences for the campaign.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPodcasts have huge young audiences, and it\u2019s pretty important to the campaign, I think, for young people to hear from her as much as possible, so we\u2019re psyched that we can help with that,\u201d Weiss-Berman said.</p> <p>Still, only 21% of Americans 12 and over have listened to a podcast in the last year, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.journalism.org/2016/06/15/podcasting-fact-sheet/\">according</a> to Edison Research, and only about half of Americans of those ages have even heard of podcasting. Weiss-Berman is right about her audience, though: 35% of Americans aged 18-34 are podcast consumers, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.edisonresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/The-Podcast-Consumer-2015-Final.pdf\">according to 2015 Edison data</a>. And, like likely <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.people-press.org/2016/07/07/2-voter-general-election-preferences/\">Clinton</a> <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2016-08-12/education-level-sharply-divides-clinton-trump-race\">voters</a>, podcast consumers tend to be wealthy compared to the population at large and are more likely to have college or graduate degrees.</p> <p>Clinton is frequently criticized for failing to connect emotionally with large audiences \u2013 despite the fact that friends and staffers <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.vox.com/a/hillary-clinton-interview/the-gap-listener-leadership-quality\">describe her</a> as warm and a great listener. Supporters hope the podcast can help bridge the gap between the woman that people find so personable one-on-one and the politician who manages to rub a lot of people the wrong way onstage.</p> <p>\u201cWhat I was so excited about with this show, I feel like podcasts are such an intimate medium,\u201d said Weiss-Berman. \u201cIt was a great way to let people in on this intimate conversation [between Clinton and Linsky].\u201d<br></p> <p>Olin said: \u201cPart of the digital team\u2019s job is to show that [personal] side of her ... It\u2019s a bit of a longitudinal look at what it really takes to run for the most difficult job in the world.\u201d</p>",

Tragically, in 2016 he sounds increasingly anachronistic and at odds with many in his own party, including the prime minister herself.

The problem is being stirred up by those who can be described as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/nov/19/philip-daviestory-mp-politically-correct-males-pander-to-militant-feminists\">militant feminists and the politically correct males who pander to this nonsense</a>.</p> <p>\u201cIt seems to me that this has led to an \u2018equality but only when it suits\u2019 agenda that applies to women.

There was a modest upward revision (2 tenths of a percentage point) to June\u2019s figure, but it is still a miss. Car sales were actually the strong point of the report, rising 1.1%. There had certainly been some good volume numbers, but with GM having offered deep discounts we thought that the value of auto sales may not be quite so good.</p> <p>In terms of other categories, there was a 2.7% drop in gasoline station sales, due to price falls, but there was also weakness in sporting goods (-2.2%), building materials (-0.5%) and food/beverages (-0.6%). Looking at the \u201ccontrol group\u201d which excludes volatile items and has a better relationship with overall consumer spending growth, it was also flat on the month. This suggests that after a pretty disappointing second quarter GDP, the economy isn\u2019t exactly roaring ahead at the start of the third quarter.</p> <p>We have also had some softer than expected producer price inflation numbers, with the headline annual rate dropping into negative territory at -0.2% year on year, while the core (ex food and energy inflation rate slowed markedly to 0.7% year on year from 1.3%.</p> <p>So with activity being softer than hoped and pipeline inflation pressures looking benign it doesn\u2019t offer much support to the view the Fed will be hiking rates imminently.

Brexit may not have put developers off building yet but this slow down needs to be reversed if enough new homes are to be built over the next few years. Work has dropped quarter-on-quarter and so too has the number of new homes approved in the capital \u2013 with a 22% drop in Q2 2016 from the previous year.</p> <p>But, as ever with construction and house building, it\u2019s all about the pipeline. Next year will see huge construction projects like HS2 and Crossrail take centre stage \u2013 having a huge knock on benefit for housing and infrastructure opportunities. This will open up new areas of London and once the bricks start being laid momentum will keep growing. London desperately needs more homes to be built. Planning inefficiency is one of the main delays leading many developers to re-think projects. One of the new government\u2019s top priorities should be a new willingness to challenge the rigid planning system and bring new homes to London.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57ad96bee4b0f231200da2b8\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-12T09:29:35.340Z\">10.29am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Employers obviously want free movement to continue, according to the NIESR study.

The forthcoming figures are for June, early estimates of which were published by the ONS at the time of last week\u2019s GDP data. These suggested that the sector shrank by 1.0% over the month following a (revised) decline of 1.5% in May. </p> <p>Of course the main interest will be in the economic data for all sectors for July onwards, following the result of the referendum. In this respect anecdotal indicators are not encouraging with, for example, the construction PMI edging down to a new seven year low of 45.9 in July. This would tend to suggest that output in the sector declined at a faster pace than before the referendum, with a possibility that the economy as a whole has begun to contract as well. </p> </blockquote> <p>In China, industrial production rose by 6% in July, down from 6.2% growth in June, but markets seem less concerned about the slowdown in China than they were at the beginning of the year.

  "<p>Barbra Streisand stands as the only star to land No 1 albums in every one of the last six decades \u2013 a fact she made sure to point out near the start of her latest tour, which came to her home borough of Brooklyn on Thursday. <br></p> <p>Even so, she added, many people still can\u2019t accurately pronounce her name. \u201cIt\u2019s Strei-<em>sand -</em> soft like sand,\u201d the star schooled us from stage of the Barclays Center. \u201cYou\u2019d think after 50 years, people would pronounce it correctly.\u201d</p> <p>It was a deeply Strei-<em>sand</em>-ian moment, a sly rebuke that underscored the singer\u2019s enduring view of herself as a misunderstood outsider, despite more than half a century of acclaim. While that attitude could seem off-putting, it has bonded Streisand to her fans with uncommon depth. She\u2019s their ideal underdog, someone to herald specifically for having beaten the system with an uncompromising style and an unconventional character. The importance of Streisand as a symbol of staying power, tenacity and rebellion makes crucial the structure of her latest show. Like its recent predecessors, this two-act, 120-minute event involves nearly as much kibitzing, pontificating and icon-buffing as actual singing. As always, Streisand\u2019s persona shares the stage with her art, with each positioned to burnish the other.</p> <p>It\u2019s been four years since the star last launched a tour, a rhythm maybe-not-so-coincidentally timed with the presidential election cycle. The result gave her a nice excuse to offer a fish-in-a-barrel shot at guess which candidate. After noting, during an intro to People, that the genetic makeup of everyone on the planet is 99% identical, she added \u201cthe other 1% is Donald Trump.\u201d </p> <p>Streisand also had a lot to say about climate change, war, Hillary Clinton (whom she adores) and feminism. That last bit offered more chances for the star to highlight her underdog status. More crucially, these segments provided resting time for her voice, whose condition must be measured, and amended, with each tour. (Her latest tour represents Streisand\u2019s fifth since she returned to the stage in 1994 after a three-decade hiatus). Now 74, the singer can\u2019t be fairly compared with her herculean, younger self, or even to the surprisingly undiminished one from a decade ago. Yet, in some measure she has to be. On Streisand\u2019s previous tour, in 2012, a new huskiness crept into her voice, dimming some of the glisten in her tone, while shedding gradations of her once unending wind power. In addition, more of the old high notes had to be rerouted. </p> <p>Even with those qualifications, Streisand remains a rich and powerful singer. Song after song in Brooklyn showed her vibrato to be as resonant as ever, her phrasing as smart, and her essential timbre as deep in character. Her limits, such as they are, have redoubled her focus as an actress, allowing her to inhabit the characters in some songs more fully than ever. Chunks of the set emphasized that. Key segments came from her latest album, <a href=\"http://encore.barbrastreisand.com/\">Encore</a>, which features songs from Broadway, sung in duets with movie stars. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"08ab6469ed1022b7f2c0a47eef264a8c24fb5e1c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/08ab6469ed1022b7f2c0a47eef264a8c24fb5e1c/0_0_3000_1997/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jamie Foxx performed The Sound of Music\u2019s Climb Ev\u2019ry Mountain with Streisand.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jamie Foxx performed The Sound of Music\u2019s Climb Ev\u2019ry Mountain with Streisand.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kevin Mazur/WireImage for BSB</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Two guests from the album showed up. Patrick Wilson abetted her ably in Loving You, a song plucked from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/jul/10/stephen-sondheim-james-lapine-interview-writing-musicals-into-the-woods\">Stephen Sondheim\u2019s Passion</a>. Later, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/jamie-foxx\">Jamie Foxx</a> joined her for Climb Ev\u2019ry Mountain, adding a soulful twist to the classic melody while still matching the star at the song\u2019s bravura peaks. For a modern turn, she performed one duet with the departed. Streisand traded verses with the late <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2008/nov/16/musicals-anthony-newley\">Anthony Newley</a>, via a video of his original take on Who Can I Turn To. His florid vibrato made a fine mate for Streisand\u2019s most fluttering tones. </p> <p>The star offered a clutch of other Sondheim songs, including Children Will Listen (from Into the Woods) and Being Alive (from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2011/dec/06/company-review\">Company</a>). But a stronger motif had to do with the decade that dominated the song selection. Six of the first eight songs came from the 70s, many of which she has never performed before this tour. Dedicated fans had to be thrilled by the inclusion of <a href=\"http://www.allmusic.com/album/a-star-is-born-mw0000196532\">Carole King\u2019s Being at War With Each Other</a> and Everything (from the <a href=\"http://www.allmusic.com/album/a-star-is-born-mw0000196532\">A Star is Born soundtrack</a>). Later, Streisand offered two pieces from her 1975 film <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0073026/\">Funny Lady</a>, including Isn\u2019t This Better, about a love of resignation, and How Lucky Can You Get? Since Streisand didn\u2019t tour between the 60s and 1994, the current show might be seen as the 70s performance she never gave. Mirroring that decade\u2019s emphasis on pop over standards, the show featured a smaller backup band than usual \u2013 just 11 musicians rather than her more common orchestral support. </p> <p>The night also featured a psychic who, for 10 unfathomable minutes, read the minds of a crowd that clearly were clearly thinking one thing \u2013 love for their hero. Streisand herself wasn\u2019t always so dewy-eyed. She aired out several old battles with her record company. They tried to nix her cover idea for the People album, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51fvN%2BA1ZtL.jpg\">where she famously turned her back to the camera</a>. The cover went on to win a Grammy. The company also airbrushed out the bump, and tightened the width, of her nose on the cover of The Way We Were, which irked her. \u201cMe and that bump have been through a lot together,\u201d she said. </p> <p>Despite the speeches and schtick, Streisand seemed to sing more often than usual. Along the way, she proved she can still belt when she needs to. But her greatest moment came during a quieter section, when she brought her full acting skills to bear. Her take on Sondheim\u2019s Losing My Mind could double as a master class in character singing. Streisand moved through the song slowly, ruminating on the longing in the lyrics with notes that captured exasperation, pity, obsession and, probably, more understanding of a ruined love than any singer who has ever sung that song before.</p>",
  "<h2><strong>Richard Ford</strong></h2> <p>My old mentor and friend Shelby Foote used to say that a person couldn\u2019t understand the United States without understanding the American civil war. As a Mississippi kid who was glad the south had lost the war (100 years before!) and who felt that slavery was a blight on American history we would do well to try to \u201clive beyond\u201d, I thought Shelby\u2019s insistence was a lot of hooey intended to prove the south\u2019s undeserved centrality to all things American. In my naive view, the south and \u201csouthern values\u201d were a garish anomaly, not typical of what America stood for \u2013 those values expressed in the Declaration of Independence.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"c58493e2e2db24ed96426a43c2c16b876234514d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c58493e2e2db24ed96426a43c2c16b876234514d/0_946_3378_4219/801.jpg\" alt=\"Richard Ford.\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Richard Ford.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Karen Robinson/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I maintained this view until I unexpectedly experienced the American right wing\u2019s irrationally hostile opposition to the Obama presidency. From questioning \u2013 completely without justification \u2013 Obama\u2019s birth and religion, to opposing virtually all Obama\u2019s policy initiatives, to slandering the president personally, to denying his actual right to hold office, the right wing formally and informally waged a campaign not only to discredit our legally elected head of state but, in essence, to erase him.</p> <p>Okay, I said I was naive; but this shocked me. And it puzzled me. What was it about Barack Obama that incensed the right to such bizarre extremes? Here is a superbly intelligent man, dignified and persuasively presidential, a good communicator, an exemplary \u201cfamily man\u201d, remarkably scandal free; he knows the US constitution, he was and is strongly supported by the other party. He in every demonstrable way has had the country\u2019s best interests clearly in his sight. One could disagree with him policy to policy. But the right\u2019s reaction was outsized and\u2026 well\u2026 mindless. And all these views \u2013 to get around to the point \u2013 are the views put forward by Trump, both today and for the past nearly eight years.</p> <p>It couldn\u2019t just be his race \u2013 could it? \u2013 that set the right so against the president? Though, in America, one cannot \u2013 must not \u2013 ever discount the lowest sort of political urgings, and must never overlook race prejudice as a motive for most anything. If it quacks like a duck, etc.</p> <p>All of what I heard in the rightwing contumely, then and now \u2013 including Trump\u2019s stump speeches in the past week \u2013 certainly reminded me troublingly of the anti-integrationist, anti-black, so-called states rights \u2013 now hygienically rebranded as \u201cnativist\u201d or \u201cpopulist\u201d \u2013 calumny from my apartheid youth in Mississippi: the unrelenting attempt not just to disempower African Americans as political actors, but to extirpate them. How might I inform myself better about this growing sense of unease regarding the president\u2019s race being a primary consideration \u2013 acknowledged or unacknowledged \u2013 in the right wing\u2019s intransigence?</p> <p>Well, first, I thought, read about the civil war, the vast crucible of American race politics, the \u201cproving ground\u201d where vitriolic, mindless anti-black rhetoric found its full voice and first prominent advocates. And what was the best history of the American civil war? Everyone knew that \u2013 probably even Shelby Foote, who wrote two volumes of his own.

The eponymous antihero is a hypocrite and a conman. He has a patchy sexual past and a history of heavy drinking, yet sells himself as a convert to evangelical religion, teaming up with Sister Sharon Falconer, who leads impassioned revivals throughout the midwest. Manipulative and cunning, Gantry is driven to accrue wealth through religious hucksterism, but also power; he feeds off the roar of the crowd. He\u2019s a narcissist and a fraud who has left multiple ruined lives in his wake.</p> <p>The main difference between Gantry and Trump is that Gantry is portrayed as genuinely charismatic. Lewis\u2019s preacher gets his leg over figuratively and literally because, as a performer, he\u2019s mesmerising. Trump is not charismatic. He is artless and politically clumsy, and wears his egotism on his sleeve. Nor is Trump mesmerising, except in the sense that a train wreck is mesmerising. Gantry\u2019s success in pulling the wool over people\u2019s eyes is understandable: he has a silver tongue, and on stage he\u2019s larger than life. Trump can\u2019t string a single grammatical sentence together, and at the podium he is lumpen and awkward. As a fictional character, Gantry works, and Trump doesn\u2019t. As Mark Schorer, an American academic, observed: \u201cThe forces of social good and enlightenment as presented in <em>Elmer Gantry </em>are not strong enough to offer any real resistance to the forces of social evil and banality.\u201d Some things never change.</p> <p>\u2022 Lionel Shriver\u2019s latest book is <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/the-mandibles-a-family-2029-2047.html\"><em>The Mandibles</em></a> (Borough).</p> <h2><strong>David Hare</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e1b2a606d305bf47371498ff354ce348a0bcb372\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e1b2a606d305bf47371498ff354ce348a0bcb372/842_541_3967_2380/1000.jpg\" alt=\"David Hare - photographed in his writing studio in North London Photograph by DAVID LEVENE For SATURDAY\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">David Hare.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Levene/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Last December, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/10/08/trumps-repeated-claim-that-obama-is-accepting-200000-syrian-refugees/?tid=a_inl\">Donald Trump claimed </a>that President Obama planned to let 200,000 Syrian refugees into the US in 2016.

Woodard explores the US as a cluster of 11 different cultures, some of which we share with our neighbours, Canada and Mexico. In order to understand Trump and his appeal, I think we can focus on Appalachian culture, which was exported from the Scottish borders in the 18th century, and was marked by an affinity for conflict and evangelical protestantism. These people had been trained to do battle in the Scottish wars, were later put to work in the coal mines, and are now out of work (the most evocative portrait of the lives these immigrants left behind and what they did when they got to America is in <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/albion-s-seed.html\">David Hackett Fischer\u2019s <em>Albion\u2019s Seed</em></a>). Another intransigent American culture is that of the deep south, slaveholders who came to the US from the sugar plantations of Barbados and were much more hierarchical and ruthless than the slaveholders in Virginia.</p> <p>Perhaps the most interesting and relevant nation, though, is New Netherland, founded in 1624, a partly Dutch nation, very diverse, not religious, but authoritarian and corporate (run by the Dutch West Indies Corporation). Now New York City, it is the extreme capitalist nation, which has never minded making a buck from no matter what, including the slave trade. Woodard writes, \u201cIndeed, full on slavery was introduced to what is now the United States not by the gentlemen planters of Virginia or South Carolina but by the merchants of Manhattan.\u201d</p> <p>Three hundred slaves were imported by the Dutch West Indies corporation in 1655 and auctioned \u2013 \u201cIn the last decade before the [1685] English conquest, New Amsterdam was rapidly evolving into North America\u2019s greatest slave market.\u201d Woodard says that our 11 nations are only partly integrated with one another and have always been that way. I would say that the resistance to having a black man as president, which laid the groundwork for the current fix we are in, comes from the deep southern and Appalachian nations; but the mercenary and ruthless lack of conscience (hello, Donald Trump!) comes from the Manhattan nation.</p> <p>\u2022 Jane Smiley\u2019s most recent novel is <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/early-warning-322607.html\"><em>Early Warning</em></a> (Picador).</p> <h2><strong>Rich Benjamin</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"6db368bb75aa186b13c2a108a6f80e66fc270925\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6db368bb75aa186b13c2a108a6f80e66fc270925/0_93_2848_3558/800.jpg\" alt=\"Author Rich Benjamin\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rich Benjamin.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sharon Schuster</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This year I witnessed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/gallery/2016/apr/14/bernie-sanders-rally-washington-square-park-pictures\">Bernie Sanders supporters</a> occupy Washington Square Park to hear him speak and saw Black Lives Matter protesters<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jan/19/black-lives-matter-protesters-block-san-franciscos-bay-bridge\"> shut down city streets</a>, declaring, \u201cThis is what democracy looks like.\u201d And, travelling to America\u2019s whitest communities in recent years, I\u2019ve seen protests against immigration and taxes, a precursor to Trump supporters who denounce our \u201crigged\u201d economy and elections.</p> <p>Christopher Lasch\u2019s ornery 1994 book <em>The Revolt of the Elites and the Betrayal of Democracy</em> illuminates this election. An increasingly global, mobile and craven class, Lasch contended, isolates itself in its social networks and physical cocoons, a flight not only from daily experience in public spaces but a political abandonment of the working and middle class that also betrays basic democratic practices and values. Though they differ in temperament and outlook, both Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton personify versions of Lasch\u2019s self-protecting privileged class, whose careers and lives contribute to the breakdown of an inclusive, national democratic culture.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>A man who made a fortune from golf courses, Trump now presents himself as the voice of the silenced white masses</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Were he alive, Lasch might eviscerate these two very different elites, beholden to different privileged interests yet nonetheless falling over themselves to champion the \u201ccommon\u201d person. His book offers an implicit explanation of the elite\u2019s cynical exploitation of \u201cordinary\u201d people and the popular cynicism toward the elite. Lasch\u2019s book presciently exposes the hypocrisy of Trump\u2019s candidacy. A property developer who made a fortune from luxury condos and golf courses, Trump now presents himself as the voice of the silenced white masses. A onetime Democrat whose primary political allegiance is to himself, Trump precisely embodies the selfish elite Lasch dissected in the 80s and 90s.</p> <p>The physical segregation of Americans into economically or racially homogenous communities has its counterpart in the subdivision of our discussions and opinions. Roughly $7.5bn (\u00a35.7bn) will be spent on this election, the vast majority raised from the corporatised donor class. \u201cThe unreal artificial character of our politics reflects elites\u2019 insulation from common life,\u201d Lasch wrote, \u201ctogether with a secret conviction that the real problems are insoluble.\u201d Campaign chatter inundates us on social media, but dumb memes are no substitute for incisive information, rigorous analysis, or meaningful debate. Effectively excluded from public debate, most Americans no longer have any use for the information inflicted on them in such large amounts.

It is a triumph of faith, indeed.</p> <p>Trump is fond of claiming in messianic terms that he alone can save America, and restore the American Dream. The historian who coined the phrase \u201cAmerican Dream\u201d in a book called <em>The Epic of America</em>, would, I suspect, disagree. In 1931 James Truslow Adams argued that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/may/25/american-dream-great-gatsby\">chasing the spectre of wealth</a> is what got America into the mess of the Depression; he carefully traced that ideology back to the 19th century, when there developed a \u201cnew conception of business as somehow a social and patriotic duty\u201d. This is the ideology into which Trump has tapped so powerfully: the idea that business success is itself a virtue to be ranked above all others, to be worshipped. (We must put aside, evidently, concerns over what kind of \u201csuccess\u201d Trump is precisely held to have achieved, and by what means.)</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The world Fitzgerald envisioned was one in which character was increasingly sacrificed for wealth \u2013 Trump\u2019s world</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Faith in business was an idea much on the minds of Americans in the 20s, during the so-called boom presided over by three successive \u201cbusinessmen\u201d presidents, including Calvin Coolidge, who declared in 1925 that \u201cthe chief business of America is business\u201d. This idea was so widespread that it was itself the target of the bestselling American novel of 1922, Sinclair Lewis\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/aug/11/100-best-novels-babbitt-sinclair-lewis-robert-mccrum\"><em>Babbitt</em></a>. In its opening pages, George Babbitt gazes upon a bank tower and Lewis tells us: \u201cHe beheld the tower as a temple-spire of the religion of business, a faith passionate, exalted, surpassing common men.\u201d In 1926 Lewis\u2019s <em>Elmer Gantry</em> satirised the hypocrisy of selling religion, while a year earlier Scott Fitzgerald skewered the same attitudes when he said that Jay Gatsby was a son of God and must about \u201cHis Father\u2019s Business: the service of a vast, vulgar and meretricious beauty\u201d. The idea that someone in service to the American worship of wealth could through sheer force of will drive himself near to the top is at the heart of Fitzgerald\u2019s morality play. The world that he envisioned was one in which character was increasingly sacrificed for wealth \u2013 and that is the world that Trump embodies, and which he would like to rule.</p> <p>A decade after Barton said that Jesus was the best businessman of all, Lewis wrote <em>It Can\u2019t Happen Here</em>, a dystopian satire responding to the rise of fascism in Europe by imagining a populist demagogue who becomes a totalitarian president of the United States. But of course, that could never happen in America.</p> <p>\u2022 Sarah Churchwell\u2019s latest book is <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/careless-people-2.html\"><em>Careless People</em></a> (Virago).</p> <h2><strong>Steven Pinker</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cf1390177e303c1227a43a7992c62e24ba764499\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cf1390177e303c1227a43a7992c62e24ba764499/180_5_3790_2273/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Steven Pinker.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Steven Pinker.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Suki Dhanda/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Most people idealise democracy as a form of governance in which an informed populace deliberates about the common good and carefully selects leaders who carry out their preferences. By that standard the world has never had a democracy. Political scientists such as Christopher Achen and Larry Bartels, authors of <em>Democracy for Realists</em>, who study how democracies really work are repeatedly astonished by the shallowness and incoherence of people\u2019s political beliefs and the tenuous connection of those beliefs to their votes. Most voters are ignorant not just of current policy alternatives but of the most elementary facts about politics and history, such as the major branches of government or which countries have used nuclear weapons. Their opinions flip depending on how a question is worded: they say that the government spends too much on \u201cwelfare\u201d but too little on \u201cassistance to the poor\u201d, and that it should use \u201cmilitary force\u201d but not \u201cgo to war\u201d. When they do formulate a preference, they commonly vote for a candidate with the opposite one. Nor does voting provide a feedback signal on a government\u2019s overall performance. Voters punish incumbents for recent events over which they have dubious control, such as macroeconomic swings and terrorist strikes, or no control at all, such as droughts, floods or even shark attacks.</p> <p>Achen and Bartels suggest that most people correctly recognise that their votes are astronomically unlikely to affect the outcome of an election and so they prioritise work and family over educating themselves about politics. They use the franchise as a form of self-expression: they vote for candidates who they think speak up for their kind of people.</p> <p>\u2022 Steven Pinker is Johnstone professor of psychology at Harvard and author of <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/better-angels-of-our-nature.html\"><em>The Better Angels of Our Nature</em></a> and <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/a-sense-of-style.html\"><em>The Sense of Style</em></a> (Penguin).</p> <h2><strong>Mark Lawson </strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"857e26bc1bd021d9241c176aad4328b47b5c813a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/857e26bc1bd021d9241c176aad4328b47b5c813a/0_551_2945_1767/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mark Lawson\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mark Lawson.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Abigail Zoe Martin/BBC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>To the horror of the Washington establishment, a gabby maverick with no record of political office uses his celebrity, in a depressed and paranoid America, to fuel a furious movement that threatens the hegemonies of politics, corporations and the media. Considering the insurgent unthinkable, they plot to stop him.</p> <p>The year is 1934, and Upton Sinclair, a well-known journalist and author, has sensationally won the Democratic nomination to be governor of California. Sinclair is now most remembered as the writer of industrial documentary novels such as <em>The Jungle</em>, set in the Chicago meat yards, and <em>Oil!,</em> which was adapted as the Oscar-winning movie <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/feb/08/paulthomasanderson.drama\"><em>There Will Be Blood</em></a>. His most enduring legacy, though, has proved to be a quixotic bid for public office, which introduced two perversions \u2013 subsequently recurrent \u2013 of the political process. Sinclair\u2019s gubernatorial race was the beneficiary of one campaign innovation \u2013 the power of an anti-political candidate in times of crisis \u2013 and the victim of another: the use of negative media \u201cattack ads\u201d against an opponent. These tropes seem to have reached their apotheosis in the 2016 US presidential election.</p> <p>Ideologically, Sinclair most resembles Bernie Sanders. Both men were socialists who became Democrats for specific electoral purpose. However, in his takeover of a major party in a key campaign, Sinclair most spookily previews Donald Trump. Like Trump, he terrified the elders of his adopted affiliation and the media by being widely viewed as too peculiar to rule. Smeared as politically reckless (in his case, for \u201ccommunist\u201d views), Sinclair was attacked for his evangelical vegetarianism and tendency to speak from candour rather than calculation. The outsider\u2019s rise was seen as so threatening to the status quo that the incumbent Republican governor, Frank F Merriam, responded with a campaign that included the first recorded use of a hostile screen commercial, funded by Hollywood and screened in cinemas.</p> <p>Greg Mitchell\u2019s 1992 book about these events, <em>The Campaign of the Century</em>, although historical, has tended to find topical resonance. It was first published in the election year in which an independent presidential candidate, Texas oilman H Ross Perot, became the most successful non-politician presidential candidate until Trump. In 2011, it was released for the first time as an ebook, because, as Mitchell acknowledged in a preface, he saw, in the Occupy Wall Street grassroots movement, parallels with EPIC, and wanted to offer Sinclair as both a warming and warning example to the new wave of progressive protestors.</p> <p>As it turned out, the 1934 template had less relevance to the 2012 presidential election, when an incumbent president received a handsome re-endorsement, than had seemed likely in the febrile atmosphere leading up to the vote. <em>The Campaign of the Century</em>, though, proves a useful handbook to the present political convulsions in America, although liberals will read it now looking for clues to how a feisty outsider can be stopped.</p> <p>What ultimately finished Sinclair was that the intervention of a strong third party candidate, Raymond L Haigh of the Progressive party, split the anti-establishment vote and allowed Merriam to be re-elected, helped by the media touting him as the sensible or at least safer option.</p> <p>It\u2019s possible that, in November, either the Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson or the ex-CIA agent Even McMullin, a last-minute anti-Trump runner, can do a Haigh for Hillary, spreading the resentment. The larger question, though, is which candidate will be left standing after the Trump and Clinton campaigns and their proxies have engaged Merriam-like negative tactics against each other.</p> <p>The American decision in 2016 sees the polarities of California 34 reversed \u2013 the maverick a regressive rightwinger, a Democrat running as the defender of sanity and capitalism \u2013 but the parallels are otherwise uncanny. Upton Sinclair, an unfairly neglected writer of political fiction, is a more lasting presence as a ghost in the political machine.</p> <p>\u2022 Mark Lawson\u2019s latest book is <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/allegations.html\"><em>The Allegations</em></a> (Picador).</p> <h2><strong>Oliver Burkeman</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bfc6f8cefd235b9add7ce48efa2c7ffa88949430\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bfc6f8cefd235b9add7ce48efa2c7ffa88949430/0_1482_3840_2304/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Oliver Burkeman\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Oliver Burkeman.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Lane</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Long before Donald Trump started<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/09/trump-gun-owners-clinton-judges-second-amendment\"> dropping hints about political assassination</a>s, death was a looming presence in his speeches.

The book\u2019s trio of authors \u2013 Sheldon Solomon, Jeff Greenberg and Tom Pyszczynski \u2013 have spent many years running experiments in which participants are reminded of their inevitable fate (\u201cPlease briefly describe the emotions that the thought of your own death arouses in you\u201d, goes one typical mortality-reminder exercise) to see how it changes them. Their results endorse the hunch set forth with brilliance, but little scientific rigour, by Ernest Becker in his masterpiece <em>The Denial of Death</em>. Unable to accept the fact that our lives are finite, we seek symbolic immortality \u2013 often through child-rearing or creative work or devotion to great causes, but sometimes to demagogues instead.</p> <p>\u201cSensing a way to feel significant again,\u201d they write, \u201cpeople join the cause of the seemingly larger-than-life leader as a revitalised basis for self-worth and meaning in life.\u201d Whether he\u2019s conscious of it or not, Trump triggers the fear of death in his audiences, then presents them both with various specific \u201csolutions\u201d (a wall to keep out Mexicans, a ban to keep out Muslims) and one big implicit promise: merge symbolically with the wealthy, domineering Trump himself, and feel powerful again.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s popularity has been variously attributed to racism, misogyny and economic insecurity; but the authors show how all these only get their urgency from the unspoken, underlying fear of literal demise. And perhaps, in the end, there\u2019s a glimmer of hope in this. There\u2019s been a regrettable tendency among liberals to write off Trump supporters as utterly irredeemable \u2013 bigots we can never hope to understand, much less change.

All-American Dorothy and her charming sidekicks trip off to the dazzling Emerald City to seek help from the mighty wizard of Oz. The awesome eminence promises to give them everything they desire if they kill off his biggest (female) rival first. But when they return to claim their rewards, they discover that \u201cOz, the Great and Terrible\u201d is a cowering little ventriloquist from Omaha. \u201cAre you not a Great Wizard?\u201d Dorothy exclaims.</p> <p>\u201c\u2018Not a bit of it, my dear; I\u2019m just a common man.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018You\u2019re more than that,\u2019 said the Scarecrow, in a grieved tone; \u2018you\u2019re a humbug.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Since the 1960s it has been fashionable to read Oz as an allegory of turn of the century populism: the yellow brick road represents the gold standard, the Emerald City stands in for paper dollars, and so on.

But no issue has been more important to Trump\u2019s success than race. Trump has given vent to many white voters\u2019 fears and anxieties about the loss of racial privilege and status, and run the most avowedly ethnonationalist presidential campaign since <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/11/civil-rights-anniversary-11-june-1963\">George Wallace</a>. And while many have argued that the effectiveness of Trump\u2019s racially coded appeals is tied to rising inequality and the economic woes of the working class voters who constitute Trump\u2019s base, it would be more accurate to say that Trump is tapping into a vein of working class racism that has been a part of American politics for a long time.</p> <p>That\u2019s why <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/stan-greenberg\">Stanley Greenberg</a>\u2019s <em>Middle Class Dreams </em>helps explain so much about Trump\u2019s rise. It was published in 1995, but much of it is based on Greenberg\u2019s work in Macomb County, Michigan, following the 1984 presidential election. Macomb was a nearly all white suburban county just outside of Detroit. It had been a solidly Democratic county in the 60s, giving sizeable majorities to both JFK and Lyndon Johnson. But in 1972 66% of Democratic voters in Macomb supported George Wallace in the Democratic primary, and in the general election Richard Nixon carried the county easily. In 1980 Macomb voted for Ronald Reagan, and in 1984 he took two-thirds of the vote. In other words, these working-class voters, who had once supported progressive candidates, had shifted decisively to the right.</p> <p>What Greenberg discovered in his many interviews with Macomb voters was that they felt that the Democratic party had abandoned them, that it had stopped paying attention to the concerns of working people and the striving middle class, and started paying too much attention to the concerns of black people and other minorities. The fundamental problem Macomb voters had with the Democrats was the party\u2019s embrace of civil rights in the 60s.</p> <p>What <em>Middle Class Dreams</em> demonstrates is just how important race, and racism, was in shaping many voters\u2019 political attitudes. As Greenberg puts it, \u201cthese white defectors from the Democratic party expressed a profound distaste for black Americans, a sentiment that pervaded almost everything they thought about government and politics\u201d. More than that, \u201cnot being black was what constituted being middle class; not living with blacks was what made a neighbourhood a decent place to live\u201d. When the Democratic party started to take civil rights seriously and to embrace (however tepidly) antiracism, many white working class voters saw it as a betrayal.</p> <p>More than 40 years after Wallace, Trump is tapping into these same currents. The list of outsiders that many white voters fear the encroachment of is longer now: it includes Muslim and Latino immigrants as well as African Americans. But what <em>Middle Class Dreams</em> shows is that the conviction of Trump supporters that white Americans have been forgotten, and that the country is going to hell as a result, is not new. It\u2019s all too old.</p> <p>\u2022 James Surowiecki is author of <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/wisdom-of-crowds.html\"><em>The Wisdom of Crowds</em></a> (Anchor).</p>",

He has basically set the tone for the coming century in which an isolated authoritarian state could be a very real prospect for our country,\u201d he said.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/aug/09/trump-clinton-second-amendment-people-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/4q7nk\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2643266\"            data-video-name=\"Trump suggests 'second amendment people' could stop Clinton \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"Reuters\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57aa3839e4b03b51a99e18bf\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/08/10/160810TrumpUpdate_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/08/10/160810TrumpUpdate.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/08/10/160810TrumpUpdate_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/aug/09/trump-clinton-second-amendment-people-video\">Trump suggests \u2018second amendment people\u2019 could stop Clinton</a></figcaption> </figure>   <h2>Did Trump threaten to assassinate Clinton?</h2> <p>The Guardian also reached out to the 100 secret Trump supporters to get their take on Trump\u2019s comments this week that gun owners could exercise their second amendment right in protest of Clinton, a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/09/trump-gun-owners-clinton-judges-second-amendment\">line seen by many as a threat of assassination</a>. Here\u2019s a selection of their responses:<br></p> <p>A 56-year-old male casino supervisor from Oklahoma:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I think and do believe he was talking about taking it to court with the backing of all American gun owners.</p> </blockquote> <p>A 46-year-old male real estate agent from Colorado:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>He\u2019s not serious by any means, and you\u2019d be considered mentally ill to act on that delivery \u2013 he was trying to be distasteful/politically incorrect as usual, which is why I will vote for the man. PC has ventured into thought policing on things, and along with the ultra surveillance state we have moved towards, I don\u2019t want to be answering questions by the Gestapo after I text a tacky joke to someone.</p> </blockquote> <p>A 26-year-old Chinese citizen working in the US on an H1-B visa:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Trump was dumb to say that, but I don\u2019t judge him based on those words. Politicians are trained to not to take things personally, so Hillary shouldn\u2019t care less. Objectively speaking, if Hillary made the decision to be a politician, then dirty attacks are fair game. </p> </blockquote> <p>A 58-year-old retired ornithologist from Tennessee:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Hillary is too far left on this issue, the most radical position on gun control of any presidential candidate ever. She\u2019s inflamed half of America.</p> </blockquote> <p>A 55-year-old pilot:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I am getting tired of Trump\u2019s running of the mouth. It almost feels like he is trying to lose this election. To me this should be the easiest election to win against this corrupt woman, however Trump is not staying on message and it looks very childish the way he is behaving. I\u2019m now convinced he will lose unless he turns it around now.</p> </blockquote> <p>A small-business owner from Orlando, Florida:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>First I heard, I was incredulous. Then I listened \u2013 not to the sound bite \u2013 but the whole sentence (and I use the term \u2018sentence\u2019 under advisement due to how he speaks). My take? Just another mountain out of a molehill as created by generally left-leaning media. </p> </blockquote>",

  "<p>If this were any other weekend, the US intelligence community <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/oct/07/us-russia-dnc-hack-interfering-presidential-election\">formally accusing</a> Russia of hacking the Democratic National Committee and meddling in the presidential race would be the dominant story. But before anyone had time to process the implications on Friday, another story broke, and the immolation of Donald Trump\u2019s campaign became the only subject anyone wanted to discuss. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/oct/07/us-russia-dnc-hack-interfering-presidential-election\">US officially accuses Russia of hacking DNC and interfering with election</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Nonetheless, this new low point in US-Russian relations will be a major challenge for Hillary Clinton in the increasingly likely event that she is inaugurated in January.</p> <p>In the past few weeks, the already poor US-Russia relationship has taken a dramatic turn for the worse. In Syria, Russia has helped launched a brutal assault on the opposition stronghold in eastern Aleppo, shocking the world and prompting the secretary of state, John Kerry, to <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/03/politics/us-suspends-talks-with-russia-over-syria/index.html\">suspend</a> bilateral ceasefire efforts with Moscow. </p> <p>Russia, in turn, has <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-russia-usa-nuclear-idUSKCN1230YN\">suspended participation</a> in a nuclear arms treaty. Its government also lodged a complaint against a UN official who <a href=\"http://bigstory.ap.org/article/161afebf5804419b93f7c6306d438cc1/apnewsbreak-un-criticism-trump-prompts-russian-response\">condemned alleged Kremlin ties</a> with the Trump campaign, which have been frequently suspected though never proven.</p> <p>All of this forms a backdrop for Friday\u2019s unprecedented <a href=\"https://www.dni.gov/index.php/newsroom/press-releases/215-press-releases-2016/1423-joint-dhs-odni-election-security-statement\">joint statement</a> by the director of national intelligence and the Department of Homeland Security, which stated that the US intelligence community \u201cis confident that the Russian Government directed the recent compromises of emails from US persons and institutions, including from US political organizations\u201d.</p> <p>The real news here is the announcement, since its underlying substance has been suspected for months. Ever since WikiLeaks released hacked DNC emails on the eve of last summer\u2019s Democratic convention in Philadelphia, revealing the party\u2019s apparent bias against Bernie Sanders, US officials have pointed to Russia as the likely culprit. The Clinton campaign has encouraged this by implying that Trump is a Kremlin agent and that Vladimir Putin is trying to install him in the White House.</p> <p>But as I wrote for the Guardian <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/01/russia-hack-america-not-help-donald-trump-win-election\">last month</a>, this isn\u2019t necessarily Putin\u2019s plan. There are plenty of reasons for Russia to interfere with the US political process short of attempting to select a president, especially one as erratic as Trump. At the very least, such tactics are consistent with the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2015/apr/09/kremlin-hall-of-mirrors-military-information-psychology\">disinformation campaigns</a> Russia has launched in neighboring countries such as Ukraine and Estonia, spreading confusion and undermining faith in the legitimacy of democratic institutions. And if Clinton becomes president, Russia, if it is WikiLeaks\u2019 source, has already demonstrated an ability to cause her headaches by releasing damaging information about her at inopportune moments. </p> <p>Clinton is often accused of being a hawk on Russia, and certainly Putin seems to perceive her that way. When Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine in 2014, Clinton did not mince words, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/06/hillary-clinton-says-vladimir-putins-crimea-occupation-echoes-hitler\">comparing Putin\u2019s actions</a> to \u201cwhat Hitler did back in the 30s\u201d, a comment that was not received well in a country that sacrificed millions of people to defeat the Nazis.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/03/russia-putin-trump-us-politics-sanders-supporters-response\">Russia may be meddling in US politics. Where is the left-wing outrage? | David Klion</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But Clinton\u2019s history with Russia is more complicated than that. As Barack Obama\u2019s secretary of state, Clinton spearheaded a good-faith attempt to reset relations with Russia, which was taking a four-year break from Putin\u2019s presidency under the seemingly more liberal Dmitri Medvedev. As Michael McFaul, the former US ambassador to Russia, <a href=\"https://youtu.be/xxBvEXrG3_A?t=3472\">told me last year</a>, the reset broke down in part because of the 2011 US intervention in Libya, for which Clinton was a leading advocate and which Medvedev declined to veto in the UN security council. The overthrow of Muammar Gaddafi <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/russia/8958475/Vladimir-Putin-lashes-out-at-America-for-killing-Gaddafi-and-backing-protests.html\">infuriated</a> Putin, who returned to the presidency in 2012 and has clashed with the Obama administration on foreign policy ever since.</p> <p>Clinton\u2019s foreign policy is mostly consistent with Obama\u2019s. A notable exception is Syria; <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2014/08/hillary-clinton-failure-to-help-syrian-rebels-led-to-the-rise-of-isis/375832/\">as she told the Atlantic\u2019s Jeffrey Goldberg</a> in 2014, she advocated for more US support for the Syrian opposition as secretary of state, and there is reason to think she will be more confrontational in Syria than Obama has been. Regardless of one\u2019s feelings about the Syrian conflict itself, this approach will inevitably face pushback from Russia, which is deeply invested in preserving Bashar al-Assad\u2019s regime. Clinton will take office facing an already hostile Russia, and it\u2019s very possible things will get worse from there.</p> <p>Meanwhile, cyberwarfare between the US and Russia could become the new normal. Both countries have plenty of officials with potentially damaging secrets just waiting to be exposed. Absent any pretense of cooperation, the hacks could quickly escalate, and neither Clinton nor Putin may be prepared for the fallout.</p>",

But you asked me about her position on trade and her position on trade is very clear.\u201d</p> <p>Clinton\u2019s campaign manager, Robby Mook, similarly struggled to answer questions about the purported excerpts, including a 2013 speech to Goldman Sachs bankers which discussed Clinton having a separate \u201cpublic and a private position\u201d. </p> <p>\u201cIf everybody\u2019s watching, you know, all of the backroom discussions and the deals, you know, then people get a little nervous to say the least,\u201d Clinton told the bankers, according to the excerpt. \u201cSo you need a public and a private position.\u201d </p> <p>Mook told CBS: \u201cI think there\u2019s a distinction between what goes on in negotiations and what her positions are on the issues and have been on the issues.\u201d</p> <p>He tried to argue that Clinton had fought for financial regulation before the crisis and recession. </p> <p>\u201cHillary Clinton went to the floor of the Nasdaq in 2008 and said that these swaps and derivatives, and what was going on with the mortgage lending market, was wrong and was going to crash the economy,\u201d Mook said. \u201cShe\u2019s called for closing the interest loophole for some time now.</p> <p>\u201cHer public position and what she\u2019s going to fight for as president for are one and the same.\u201d</p> <p>Clinton did deliver a speech in <a href=\"http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=77069\">March 2007</a>, in the early weeks of the financial crisis, blaming mortgage industry practices and recommending a few reforms. She mentioned derivatives and further reform in <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2007/POLITICS/12/21/clinton.trans.economy/\">November</a> that year and on the campaign trail <a href=\"http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=96569\">in 2008</a>, well into the crisis.</p> <p>Years later, however, Clinton told her Goldman Sachs audience it was \u201can oversimplification\u201d to blame \u201cour banking system causing this everywhere\u201d, the email excerpts show. </p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s a lot that could have been avoided in terms of both misunderstanding and really politicizing what happened,\u201d she said in a 2013 speech, according to the leaked excerpts, \u201cwith greater transparency, with greater openness on all sides, you know, what happened, how did it happen, how do we prevent it from happening? </p> <p>\u201cYou guys help us figure it out and let\u2019s make sure we do it right this time.\u201d</p> <p>Throughout the Democratic primary, Clinton was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/11/bernie-sanders-hillary-clinton-democratic-platform-negotiations\">accused of an overly comfortable relationship with Wall Street</a> by her rival on the left, Bernie Sanders. He also mocked her for her refusal to release the text of the private speeches, saying: \u201cI kind of think if you\u2019re going to be paid $225,000 for a speech, it must be a fantastic speech.\u201d</p> <p>On Saturday, Sanders reaffirmed his support for Clinton, saying: \u201cWhatever Secretary Clinton may or may not have said behind closed doors on Wall Street, I am determined to implement the agenda of the Democratic party platform, which was agreed to by her campaign.\u201d</p> <p>Clinton\u2019s campaign chairman, John Podesta, insisted that the excerpts had been taken out of context. \u201cThere is nothing that she has said in private that she doesn\u2019t say in public,\u201d he told Fox News Sunday.</p> <p>\u201cShe has said all throughout this campaign that she will crack down on Wall Street,\u201d he said. \u201cShe has put forward the most aggressive Wall Street plan of any candidate, really.\u201d</p> <p>Referring to legislation passed in 2010 that took measures to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jul/19/two-cheers-dodd-frank-act-wall-street-culture-radical-change\">re-regulate</a> Wall Street after the 2008 financial <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/dec/28/markets-credit-crunch-banking-2008\">collapse</a> and recession, he added: \u201cShe stands behind Dodd-Frank, while [Donald] Trump wants to rip it away.</p> <p>\u201cPeople on Wall Street know how to game the system. What she wants to do is crack down on the system, make sure that there is no institution too big to fail and no person that\u2019s too big to jail. That\u2019s why Bernie Sanders yesterday, after looking at those scripts, says that he stands behind her.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/oct/07/us-russia-dnc-hack-interfering-presidential-election\">US officially accuses Russia of hacking DNC and interfering with election</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Although <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/08/john-mccain-donald-trump-sex-boast-tape\">divided by their own candidate</a>, some Republicans seized on the speeches as evidence of Clinton\u2019s penchant for secrecy, in line with her use of a private email server while she was secretary of state. Former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani, one of the top advisers in Trump\u2019s embattled campaign, said the excerpts would have been a deathblow to Clinton had they come out during the Democratic primary.</p> <p>\u201cHad those come out, Bernie Sanders would be the candidate now that we\u2019d be running against, not her. She fought so hard to keep those secret \u2013 we now know why,\u201d he told Fox News Sunday.</p> <p>\u201cShe pointed out in one of them that she is a different person to them [the bankers] than she has to be politically,\u201d he continued. \u201cSo we have two Hillary Clintons, which says we have a person who is a liar.

Early on Saturday evening, the billionaire emerged from his skyscraper, where he had been in crisis talks and debate preparation all day, to greet a group of 100 ardent supporters who had been demonstrating outside the building since morning. </p> <p>Trump shook his fist in the air, waved and pointed, without saying anything. He then went quickly back into the building. His appearance raised a huge commotion among those gathered on Fifth Avenue in midtown Manhattan, prompting cheers and chants of \u201cTrump for president\u201d and \u201cUSA!

This is like entertainment but it\u2019s scary because of the anger and aggression.\u201d</p> <p>The appearance came as it emerged Trump had made similarly crude comments about his relationships with women in a series of interviews with the US \u201cshock jock\u201d Howard Stern. The Republican candidate reportedly bragged about sleeping with 24-year-olds, described a woman reaching the age of 35 as \u201ccheckout time\u201d and described his daughter Ivanka as having \u201calways been very voluptuous\u201d.</p> <p>On Saturday afternoon Trump\u2019s wife, Melania, released a statement in which she said Trump\u2019s comments in conversation with the Access Hollywood presenter Billy Bush were offensive but asked the American people to see that her husband had \u201cthe heart and mind of a leader\u201d.</p> <p>Reached with a request for comment about the mounting controversy surrounding her father\u2019s campaign, Ivanka Trump hung up on the Guardian.</p> <p>McCain, locked in a tough re-election battle in Arizona, condemned Trump\u2019s comments after the release of the 11-year-old Access Hollywood recording on Friday but initially stopped short of rescinding his endorsement. As leading Republican officials launched <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/08/donald-trump-list-of-republicans-reject-support-endorsement\">an exodus</a> from Trump in the 24 hours that followed, he faced quickly mounting pressure.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>He missed the chance to show political courage.

Other Republicans who disavowed their support for Trump on Saturday included Senate candidates Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire, Rob Portman of Ohio, and Joe Heck of Nevada.</p> <p>Some Republicans formally called on Trump to step aside and allow his running mate, Indiana governor Mike Pence, to become the party\u2019s standard-bearer with just 30 days left until election day. Such voices included John Thune of South Dakota, the third-ranking Republican in the Senate.</p> <p>Democrats swiftly rejected the desertion of Trump by those who had endorsed him as political calculation \u2013 pointing out that Republicans had stood by the former reality TV star even as he disparaged Mexican immigrants, Muslims, prisoners of war, the disabled and the Gold Star parents of an Iraq war hero and repeatedly made crude statements about women.</p> <p>\u201cMcCain made it clear a long time ago: he is no longer a straight-talking maverick,\u201d Ann Kirkpatrick, the Democratic congresswoman challenging McCain for his seat, said in a statement. \u201cHe missed the chance to show political courage and lead.

With every blow Clinton delivered (discussing Trump\u2019s tax returns, his \u201cMiss Piggy\u201d comments, and so on), and with every one of Trump\u2019s own missed opportunities, the value of those S&amp;P 500 futures contracts rose. Investors clearly decided they would prefer to own US stocks under a President Clinton than a President Trump.</p> <p>In fact, Justin Wolfers, a professor of economics and public policy at the University of Michigan, calculated that based on the magnitude of the market movements during that first debate, if Trump wins the election next month, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/02/upshot/debate-night-message-the-markets-are-afraid-of-donald-trump.html?_r=0\">it could trigger a stock market selloff of between 10% and 12%</a>. </p> <p>It\u2019s not that investors care whether Trump did or didn\u2019t pay taxes, or that he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/07/donald-trump-leaked-recording-women\">brags about groping women</a> without their consent. The markets just don\u2019t worry about that kind of stuff.</p> <p>What does matter is whether investors believe Trump will create a stable, predictable, business-friendly environment. For all his claims to be friendly toward business, and despite a platform that offers favorable tax treatment to corporations and the wealthy, clearly investors are bothered about the \u201cstable and predictable\u201d part of the conundrum. </p> <p>Trump has threatened to embark on trade wars \u2013 that\u2019s enough to strike terror into the heart of any investor. Then there are <a href=\"http://www.marketwatch.com/story/citi-says-donald-trumps-odds-of-winning-in-november-are-increasing-2016-09-19\">some \u201cblack swan\u201d risks</a> to which analysts have begun alerting their clients, such as the potential fallout for financial markets if Trump pulls the US out of multilateral trade and security arrangements, from Nafta to Nato. </p> <p>What happens when Trump insults a foreign leader, or orders a US warship to fire on an Iranian vessel, triggering a war? Or \u2013 God forbid \u2013 decides to use some of the nuclear arsenal to \u201ctake out\u201d Isis? We can all forget about our retirement funds at that point; they\u2019ll vanish in the mushroom cloud. It doesn\u2019t help the market\u2019s confidence that Trump\u2019s team of economic and foreign policy advisers <a href=\"http://www.marketwatch.com/story/wall-street-starts-to-raise-alarm-bells-over-the-possibility-of-a-trump-presidency-2016-09-26\">don\u2019t seem to have extensive credentials or expertise</a>.</p> <p>Clinton is more of a known quantity. Despite her increasingly populist rhetoric against the financial institutions, the apparent <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/election-us-2016-37595047\">transcripts of speeches she gave to Goldman Sachs</a> and other banks before casting her hat into the ring suggest that as Bernie Sanders and his supporters had insisted, she was actually much more supportive than she now makes herself out to be. </p> <p>The speeches reveal a candidate who is pro-free trade and who suggested she would be amenable to maintaining the much-criticized \u201crevolving door\u201d between Wall Street and its regulators. \u201cThe people that know the industry better than anybody are the people who work in the industry,\u201d she said, according to the transcripts.</p> <p>That\u2019s the pragmatic Clinton of before the election, and it suggests that, if anything, her victory next month would at least be good news for those Americans with an interest in a stable economy and stable markets.</p> <p>But if you\u2019re hoping for a \u201cClinton rally\u201d, don\u2019t hold your breath.</p> <p>Especially in the wake of the first debate \u2013 and in light of the bombshell revelations about Trump\u2019s taxes and open mic comments about groping women \u2013 the markets now have largely priced in a Clinton victory. </p> <p>If Clinton wins, we won\u2019t see big changes in economic policies \u2013 she is, more or less, familiar, which is something that markets love, because it gives them something that they adore: \u201ctransparency\u201d or \u201cvisibility\u201d. If traders and big institutional investors, like the mutual fund managers at Fidelity, can look forward and predict, more or less, what is going to happen (or if they think they can), they\u2019ll be more comfortable with the valuations that they\u2019re paying for stocks today. If there are too many wild cards, they\u2019ll take their money off the table.</p> <p>But a Clinton victory, heading toward the eighth anniversary of the start of the current bull market in stocks, wouldn\u2019t give anyone any encouragement to think that this was the start of something dramatically positive either. Should she be elected, stock valuations would still be in nosebleed territory. Interest rates would still be too low, and would be heading upward, putting downward pressure on the prices of stocks and bonds simultaneously. </p> <p>There\u2019s a phenomenon known as the <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/presidentialelectioncycle.asp\">presidential election cycle theory</a>. In brief, it argues that the first year following a presidential election is always bad for markets, regardless of who wins \u2013 Republican or Democrat. Then, stock markets do better in the second year following the election and best of all in the third year, before turning in a lackluster year in the fourth year. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/09/women-share-sexual-assault-stories-on-twitter-after-donald-trump-comments\">Trump's groping boasts inspire millions of women to share sexual assault stories on Twitter</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I suspect we\u2019ll see a variant of that this year, if Clinton wins. We might experience a brief \u201cpop\u201d in the immediate aftermath of the election itself, in the form of a kind of relief rally. But once that is over, the grim work of unwinding a big asset bubble built up in the attempt to contain and resolve the financial crisis will have to start, beginning with the Fed raising interest rates. That is going to hurt the already sluggish economy, which has been <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-second-quarter-gdp-revised-up-to-1-4-gain-1475152328\">struggling to turn in an average annual growth rate of 2.1%</a> since the current expansion began. That\u2019s the lowest of any growth period since 1949. </p> <p>Those challenges will all remain in place in the unlikely event that either of the two third-party candidates triumphs on election day. They would be magnified by the fact that neither would have natural allies from their own party in Congress, making it infinitely more difficult to implement even basic economic policy. The predictability and stability factors that are an issue with Trump would exist with Gary Johnson or Jill Stein, albeit for different reasons. </p> <p>There are plenty of compelling reasons to cast a ballot on 8 November, heaven knows, without thinking about which result will be best for your investment portfolio. But if that\u2019s the one that is going to which lever you pull or box you check, well, there\u2019s no perfect solution, only a least worst option. </p> <p>Many of the issues that have the potential to wreak havoc on stocks are out there on the horizon, like an ominous dark cloud. Our choice of president won\u2019t banish them. It can only add to them.</p>",

  "<p>If the US presidential campaign conveys a flavour of unreality, that may be because it is rooted in fiction. In 1935, Sinclair Lewis sat down to write a novel about political radicalisation and social upheaval in the depression-ravaged US. What emerged after four months of feverish work was <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/It_Can%27t_Happen_Here\">It Can\u2019t Happen Here</a>, a runaway bestseller that quickly sold more than 300,000 copies.</p> <p>Lewis was alarmed by what was taking shape in the country. The New Deal had delivered a false sense of optimism to the Federal Reserve, if not to the millions queueing at the soup kitchens. The money supply was tightened in anticipation of a sustained rally, government spending was cut and taxes were raised. As a result, the US was pushed to the cusp of a double-dip depression, with manufacturing back to its 1934 level and unemployment up by 5%.</p> <p>This created fertile ground for <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Coughlin\">Father Charles Coughlin</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huey_Long\">Huey Long</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Randolph_Hearst\">William Randolph Hearst</a> and other fanatics to spread the gospel of bigotry. It was no fleeting backlash: on the eve of the second world war, the German American Bund <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0gU9op16rjQ\">packed more than 20,000 militants into Madison Square Garden in New York for a pro-Hitler rally</a>. To wild applause, their leader, Fritz Kuhn, derided the US President as Franklin D \u201cRosenfeld\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"266d3cee065b072c66a344d392e408ca1d1a7634\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/266d3cee065b072c66a344d392e408ca1d1a7634/110_0_2402_3000/801.jpg\" alt=\"Huey Long\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Controversial Louisiana senator Huey Long, who was accused of being a demagogue, was assassinated in 1935.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Lewis\u2019s antihero is the ignorant demagogue Berzelius \u201cBuzz\u201d Windrip, who wins the 1936 election with the support of millions of impoverished and angry voters.

We want Buzz!\u201d</p> <p>Windrip could count on a number of real-life champions who appear in the novel, such as the newspaper tycoon William Randolph Hearst. In 1935, the man widely regarded as responsible for goading the US into the Spanish-American war proclaimed: \u201cWhenever you hear a prominent American called a fascist, you can usually make up your mind that the man is simply a loyal citizen who stands up for Americanism.\u201d</p> <p>Lewis\u2019s hero, the New England journalist Doremus Jessup, attends a Windrip rally in Madison Square Garden. Jessup reports that Windrip\u2019s rhetoric was irresistible to his thousands of downtrodden admirers. He later can\u2019t remember a word Windrip said. But it doesn\u2019t matter: if Windrip contradicts himself, backtracks on policy or simply spews out a torrent of lies, he tells them what they want to hear. Every American will be guaranteed a minimum income of $5,000 ($88,000 in today\u2019s money), US-hating Mexico will be severely dealt with and Jewish bankers will be punished for landing the country in this mess.</p> <p>Windrip unveils his 15-point manifesto, which includes \u201cprison or the death penalty\u201d for anyone advocating communism and the recognition of Jews as \u201cfully Americanised\u201d, so long as they continue to support \u201cour ideals\u201d. Substitute \u201cMuslim\u201d for \u201ccommunist\u201d and \u201cHispanic\u201d for \u201cJew\u201d and there emerges an uncomfortable picture of what is taking place in the US today.</p> <p>Windrip wins the election. He orders the invasion of Mexico, after which his victorious militia returns singing When Johnny Comes Marching Home. Political opponents are herded into concentration camps, while a flood of refugees flee across the border to Canada.</p> <p>In the end, though, it is only a work of fiction \u2013 and millions of Americans cling to the belief that it will remain so.

Experts, however, seem to agree the language of the RNC rules only allows the party to \u201cfill\u201d a vacancy, not \u201ccreate\u201d one.</p> <p>If Republicans tried to change the rules now, Bopp said, it would probably incite \u201cchaos\u201d and further inflame Trump supporters, many of whom wholeheartedly believe the political system is \u201crigged\u201d against them and their candidate. </p> <p>\u201cThere is no authority in the RNC rules to remove a candidate for president or his vice-president,\u201d Bopp said. \u201cThere is only the authority if a vacancy arose \u2013 then they have the authority to fill that vacancy.\u201d</p> <p>Vikram Amar, dean and Iwan Foundation professor of law at the University of Illinois College of Law, discussed a largely fantastical scenario in which Trump could remain at the top of the ticket but pledge to declare himself incapacitated and allow Pence to take over as president if their ticket prevails. </p> <p>\u201cUnder the 25th amendment, the president can declare [him or herself] disabled,\u201d Amar said. \u201cIn that case, technically Trump would be president and Pence would be acting president with the full authority to exercise all of the powers and duties of the president.\u201d</p> <p>Amar said this would be the least disruptive option for the RNC to pursue, because it would not require attempts to change the nominee after ballots in many states have been printed. Trump, he added, would be bound by his word if he promised Republicans he would step down and allow Pence to take over after winning the White House. </p> <p>Regardless of whether Trump withdraws, Rick Hasen, a University of California-Irvine professor who runs the Election Law Blog, said Republicans had one <a href=\"http://electionlawblog.org/?p=87310\">\u201cHail Mary</a>\u201d pass left: the electoral college. </p> <p>Writing on the blog, Hasen said: \u201cWhen we cast our votes for president they are actually cast for electors from each state (based roughly on population size) who then cast ballots for president. If Trump is chosen in some states, those electors could vote for Pence, or Romney, or Kasich, or whoever.\u201d </p> <p>There are laws that bar \u201cfaithless\u201d electors from voting for a candidate who did not win the popular vote in their state, but Hasen argues that in the event of a Trump victory, neither the Republican-controlled Senate nor the courts would be likely to object.</p> <p>That scenario, however, would also require an extraordinary confluence of events that look increasingly hard to pull off, including Trump withdrawing or the party abandoning him, electors placing faithless votes and Hillary Clinton earning fewer electoral college votes than Trump. </p> <p>\u201cAll of this is possible, but not bloody likely,\u201d Hasen wrote.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/08/donald-trump-list-of-republicans-reject-support-endorsement\">The growing list of Republicans abandoning Donald Trump</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Ultimately, RNC officials appear reluctant to engage with any suggestion that Trump be removed from the ticket.

  "<p>Hours after a leaked video emerged in which Donald Trump bragged about groping women without their consent, Florida senator Marco Rubio condemned the Republican nominee\u2019s comments as \u201cvulgar, egregious [and] impossible to justify\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/08/donald-trump-forced-into-apology-as-sex-boast-tape-horrifies-republicans\">Donald Trump forced to apologise as sex boast tape horrifies Republicans</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/08/donald-trump-forced-into-apology-as-sex-boast-tape-horrifies-republicans\">Republicans fled from Trump</a> en masse on Saturday and in many cases called on him to step aside, Rubio did not rescind his endorsement of the former reality TV star. Rubio has avoided campaigning alongside the nominee, a notable absence from Trump\u2019s multiple appearances in Florida in recent months, and has no plans to campaign with him before election day.</p> <p>To Patrick Murphy, the Democratic congressman challenging Rubio for his Senate seat, the senator\u2019s silence raises questions about his character.<br></p> <p>\u201cIf he wasn\u2019t such a coward he would stand up immediately and withdraw his endorsement,\u201d Murphy said in an interview with the Guardian late Saturday.</p> <p>\u201cIt speaks, unfortunately, to who he is as a person. For Marco Rubio to continue putting his own political ambitions in front of what he knows is best \u2026 I don\u2019t know how he can look himself in the mirror after these comments and think it\u2019s OK.\u201d</p> <p>In the video from 2005, which emerged on Friday, Trump boasted that when approaching beautiful women he could <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/07/donald-trump-leaked-recording-women\">\u201cgrab them by the pussy\u201d and kiss and grope them because he is a star</a>.</p> <p>For Rubio, who endorsed Trump despite the two sparring bitterly in the Republican presidential primary, the routine of distancing himself from the real estate mogul\u2019s controversial rhetoric is nothing new. </p> <p>The senator constantly found himself rebuking Trump\u2019s statements \u2013 whether on immigrants, Muslims or women \u2013 during his unsuccessful bid for the Republican nomination. Rubio similarly denounced Trump\u2019s attacks on an American judge of Hispanic descent and the Gold Star parents of an Iraq war hero; but while seeking re-election to the Senate, Rubio has also openly advocated for electing Trump to the presidency even as he maintained prior criticisms that included not trusting his former rival with the nuclear codes.</p> <p>And as other Republicans have struggled to walk the fine line between supporting Trump and fully embracing him, for Rubio the balancing act has appeared to pay dividends. He overwhelmingly defeated a challenge from the right in the Florida Senate race \u2013 critical to Republicans\u2019 chances of holding on to an already precarious majority \u2013 and has run ahead of Murphy in most polls even as Trump has trailed Hillary Clinton.</p> <p>A new NBC/WSJ/Marist survey released on Sunday showed a potentially tighter race, with Rubio holding just a two-point lead.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/oct/08/donald-trumps-sex-boasts-when-you-are-a-star-they-let-you-do-anything-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/56ffv\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2786643\"            data-video-name=\"Donald Trump's sex boasts: 'When you are a star they let you do anything' \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"NBC\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57f87665e4b0e4aaeaa8d24b\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/10/08/161008TrumpUpdate2_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/10/08/161008TrumpUpdate2.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/10/08/161008TrumpUpdate2_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/oct/08/donald-trumps-sex-boasts-when-you-are-a-star-they-let-you-do-anything-video\">Donald Trump\u2019s sex boasts: \u2018When you are a star they let you do anything\u2019</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Trump\u2019s latest comments could open a new front for Democrats in a race they recently signalled was no longer competitive by pulling back resources such as ad spending.

But it was not a sufficient excuse, in his view, for Rubio to decline to weigh in further on Trump when dozens of Republicans in Congress had launched a mass exodus away from the nominee. </p> <p>\u201cThe fact that he\u2019s only going to tweet on this speaks volumes,\u201d Murphy said.</p> <p>\u201cA lot of people are waiting for some strong actions or some strong words on this. I think he\u2019s making a calculated decision about his political career and that having Donald Trump\u2019s support will help him long term.\u201d</p> <p>Complicating matters for Rubio was the growing list of Republicans dropping Trump by the hour. Among them was Rob Portman, a senator from the battleground state of Ohio, who like Rubio has succeeded thus far in running a parallel race to Trump\u2019s, absent the damage associated with the nominee\u2019s toxic brand of politics.</p> <p>\u201cWhile I continue to respect those who still support Donald Trump, I can no longer support him,\u201d Portman said in a statement late Saturday, while stating his intention to write in Trump\u2019s running mate, Indiana governor Mike Pence, for president.</p> <p>\u201cI continue to believe our country cannot afford a Hillary Clinton presidency\u201d.</p> <p>Senator John McCain, facing a tough re-election battle in Arizona, also pulled his endorsement of Trump. Ted Cruz, the Texas senator who reluctantly backed Trump last month after declining to endorse him at the Republican National Convention in July, was reportedly reconsidering his decision.</p> <p>Conventional wisdom holds that Cruz and Rubio will seek the presidency once more. Murphy, who has hammered Rubio for refusing to commit to serving a six-year term if re-elected to the Senate, told the Guardian his opponent\u2019s calculus with respect to Trump had only to do with a second presidential bid as early as 2020.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s hard to know who the real Marco Rubio is anymore,\u201d Murphy said. \u201cI just think he\u2019s going regret it\u201d.</p>"

In Europe the final scores showed:</p> <ul> <li><strong>The FTSE 100 finished virtually unchanged, up just 3.98 points or 0.06% at 6834.77</strong></li> <li><strong>Germany\u2019s Dax rose 0.41% to 10,436.49</strong></li> <li><strong>France\u2019s Cac climbed 0.48% to 4409.55</strong></li> <li><strong>Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB closed up 0.88% at 16,349.82</strong></li> <li><strong>Spain\u2019s Ibex ended up 0.83% at 8758.5</strong></li> <li><strong>In Greece, the Athens market added 0.27% to 562.12</strong></li> </ul> <p>On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently pretty flat, up just 2 points.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57e2ac06e4b080d3ee88b03a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-21T15:53:43.117Z\">4.53pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Markets are betting on a no-change statement from the Federal Reserve on US interest rates but will be keen to hear the tone of the central bank\u2019s comments, says strategist James Chen at City Index:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Not much has changed from the past several weeks in terms of the very low expectations for a rate hike. If anything, [today\u2019s Bank of Japan] announcement of new easing measures could even further discourage a Fed move, but as it already stands, there are very few market participants that are betting on such a move to higher interest rates, at least for this particular Fed meeting. Key Fed speakers and major US economic data releases have alternately shifted the discussion from one side to another in the past few weeks. Some members advocated a rate hike this year, even citing the possibility of one occurring in September, while others, like Fed Governor Lael Brainard, cautioned against raising interest rates too quickly.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"eac6e61ee921b5970f39ae3a4112c3b31fbe56d3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/eac6e61ee921b5970f39ae3a4112c3b31fbe56d3/0_0_2723_1634/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Federal Reserve board member Lael Brainard.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Federal Reserve board member Lael Brainard.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Evan Vucci/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <blockquote> <p>Additionally, September has thus far seen a general deterioration of US economic data in the form of substantially worse-than-expected releases regarding employment (NFP), both the manufacturing and services industries (PMI), retail sales, and housing, that were all significantly worse than expected. The one potentially brighter spot for the Fed was the Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation reading for August, which showed that both headline and core prices increased by more than expected. Despite this more buoyant view of inflation, however, it is still unlikely to be enough to sway the Fed into action today.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>Amidst all of these economic data releases and Fed member speeches, the market\u2019s view of the implied probability of a rate hike today has continued to hover in the low-to-high teens. Of course, there could always be a surprise move, but the much more likely scenario will be a characteristically unmovable Fed.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ad4d6875ec8a084a78a2ef359396ac1ae251fd2a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ad4d6875ec8a084a78a2ef359396ac1ae251fd2a/414_0_4091_2455/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Fed expected to keep rates on hold\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Fed expected to keep rates on hold</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kevin Lamarque/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <blockquote> <p>Therefore, the market\u2019s focus, as has consistently been the case from the beginning of the year, will be concentrated on the words emanating from the Fed statement as it relates to the indication of a possible rate hike in December and the potential pace of tightening going forward. The current market probability of a December hike remains around 60%.</p> <p>The key markets to watch today, as always, will be US equity markets, gold, and the US dollar, particularly US dollar/Japanese yen due the earlier Bank of Japan announcement. A more hawkish Fed today could lead to a rebound for the dollar/yen while a more dovish statement could lead to a further drop for dollar/yen towards the key 100.00 mark and below.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-09-21T15:55:13.267Z\">at 4.55pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57e2a2a2e4b05d653ca5f46d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-21T15:14:36.055Z\">4.14pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Predictions of the economic gloom which would follow the Brexit vote seem to be wide of the mark, according to a new Guardian project tracking the state of play as Britain prepares to leave the European Union.</p> <p>As a reminder, the UK Treasury for one forecast dire consequences in the immediate wake of the vote:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/NobleFrancis/status/778608821027700737\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/EdConwaySky\">@EdConwaySky</a> The HM Treasury document is clear &amp; specific.

The Federal Reserve will keep its main rate on hold at 0.25-0.50%, citing near-term, weak economic developments, yet insisting that enough progress has been made to warrant a rate hike at one of the upcoming meetings (hint: December, when the next SEPs are released).

Should the FOMC choose to be headstrong and tear down conventional wisdom - a small possibility with two prime dealers coming out and calling for a rate hike - global markets will be shocked. But assuming the Fed plays it safe as it usually does, a lack of a rate hike may not hurt the US Dollar significantly. By suggesting that a rate hike is still \u201con the table\u201d in the near-term, and by laying out an interest rate glide path for next year calling for multiple rate hikes, then the Fed could help insulate the US dollar, plain and simple.

After a stint as a miner he joined the Industrial Workers of the World (<a href=\"http://www.iww.org/content/about-iww\">IWW</a>), a radical labour union known as the Wobblies. The nickname\u2019s origin is unclear but the organisation\u2019s goal gleamed bright: a revolution to let workers \u2013 in fields, farms and mines \u2013 keep what they produced.</p> <p>The IWW\u2019s leaders and intellectuals \u2013 socialists, anarchists and Marxists \u2013 were based in Chicago but Little criss-crossed hamlets, towns and cities in western states, agitating, recruiting and evangelising with little more than the clothes on his back, oratorical power and a fearlessness bordering on suicidal.</p> <p>He preached to fruit pickers, lumberjacks, oil drillers and miners, urging them to strike for better pay and conditions and if necessary to impede \u2013 to sabotage \u2013 production. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"de51f4a6815480f5088187a0d06c549010432de2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/de51f4a6815480f5088187a0d06c549010432de2/0_48_640_384/500.jpg\" alt=\"Reverse view of Frank Little\u2019s grave in Butte, Montana\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Reverse view of Frank Little\u2019s grave in Butte, Montana</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rory Carroll/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He drew crowds by standing on street corners reading the Declaration of Independence. He appealed not just to white working men but women, blacks, latinos and hobos, insisting they had common cause.</p> <p>Business owners hated and feared Little. Newspapers denounced him and police jailed him. When that didn\u2019t work, hired thugs beat him up \u2013 but that didn\u2019t work either. Little was the \u201chobo agitator\u201d, fighting for freedom of speech and catching trains to flashpoints in Washington, California, New Mexico, anywhere where he could stir things up. </p> <p>The US\u2019s entry into the first world war in April 1917 raised the stakes. Patriotic hysteria swept the country. The Espionage Act virtually criminalised any opposition as treachery. IWW leaders opposed the war but hesitated to say so publicly. Little, in contrast, by then a board member, branded it a capitalist slaughter-fest for which no worker should die. When soldiers rounded up hundreds of striking Arizona mine workers in June 1917, an enraged Little denounced the troops as scabs.</p> <p>Weeks later he headed north to America\u2019s industrial crucible: Butte. The Montana town sat atop \u201cthe richest hill on Earth\u201d, a font of copper which drew tens of thousands of miners. It had been known as the Gibraltar of Unionism, with powerful unions and a socialist mayor. But by 1917 the aptly named Anaconda company, a global player, was crushing organised labour. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>In retrospect it was a death foretold, but Little ignored warnings.</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It controlled employment, newspapers, police, politicians and for good measure had a militia, said Gutfeld, the professor. \u201cIn many respects Montana at that time was a colony of the Anaconda company. If you wanted to commit suicide you went out against the company.\u201d</p> <p>A horrific accident in June 1917 killed 168 miners, infuriating survivors and giving the IWW, Little hoped, a chance to recruit. He arrived on 18 July. He was 38 and a physical wreck \u2013 thin, ill, a broken leg in a cast. Even so, he gave a barnstorming address to miners. He spoke with \u201cmaniacal fury\u201d and \u201cpractically threatened the United States government with revolution\u201d, the pro-company Butte Miner newspaper reported. For two weeks Little kept at it, urging miners to strike and \u201cfight the capitalists but not the Germans\u201d.</p> <p>Newspapers demanded authorities crack down \u201cwithout gloves\u201d on such \u201csedition\u201d and \u201ctreasonable tirades\u201d. In retrospect it was a death foretold, but Little ignored warnings. Maybe he thought he would escape with just a beating. Maybe he knew what was coming. \u201cIt would be better to go down slugging,\u201d he had told colleagues. </p> <p>There were no witnesses to the abduction besides Byrne, the boarding house owner. And there were no known witnesses to the lynching. A man called Robert Brown on his way to work found the body swinging from the trestle some time after dawn. Pinned to the underwear was a placard: \u201cOthers take notice, first and last warning, 3-7-77.\u201d</p> <p>Rumours swirl to this day: that Little was castrated, stabbed 27 times and lost his kneecaps; that the numbers referred to his draft number, or Montana\u2019s grave specifications, three feet wide, seven feet deep, 77 inches long; that he was killed by union rivals, or a patriotic mob.</p> <p>The grisly details, said Jane Little Botkin, are exaggerations. He was savagely beaten and tortured but didn\u2019t lose body parts and was likely unconscious when hanged. \u201cI believe they put him on top of the car and drove the car out from underneath him. He didn\u2019t struggle. He was strangled, the neck did not break. \u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"210cd7a85137fb0d9ec4172b4c3954abccaa4e84\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/210cd7a85137fb0d9ec4172b4c3954abccaa4e84/15_354_5882_3530/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The funeral procession for Frank Little.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The funeral procession for Frank Little.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Walter P Reuther Library, Archives of Labor and Urban Affairs, Wayne State University</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Little Botkin, more than anyone, should know.

The company had armed thugs, private detectives and police officers on its payroll. Which would explain why the official murder investigation went nowhere. </p> <p>There is a literary sub-plot. In his youth<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/sep/29/100-best-novels-the-maltese-falcon-dashiell-hammett-sam-spade-raymond-chandler\"> Dashiell Hammett</a>, who created the fictional detective Sam Spade, worked for the Pinkerton detective agency, which specialised in strike breaking. Hammett\u2019s first novel, Red Harvest, concerns a labour dispute set in a thinly veiled version of Butte. </p> <p>In her memoirs Lillian Hellman, Hammett\u2019s companion, said he told her he was offered $5,000 to murder Little. \u201cThrough the years he was to repeat that bribe offer so many times that I came to believe \u2026 that it was a kind of key to his life. He had given a man the right to think he would commit murder.\u201d</p> <p>Some have speculated the novelist actually did it. <a href=\"https://www.fantasticfiction.com/n/william-f-nolan/\">William Nolan</a>, one of Hammett\u2019s biographers, thinks not. \u201cHe didn\u2019t do it but the fact that someone even asked him, thinking that he would be that kind of person, and that he was that deep into the thing made him feel guilty. He never got over and it always haunted him.\u201d Hammett subsequently became a communist and ended up on a McCarthyite blacklist.<br></p> <p>Little\u2019s murder initially provoked flurries of defiance. Thousands attended the funeral and sang La Marseillaise. Protests flickered across the west. </p> <p>But instead of galvanising the movement, the lynching presaged a government crackdown: federal troops in Butte, martial law in Spokane, the Federal Sedition act of 1918 and the arrest of 165 alleged IWW members, resulting in jail terms of five to 20 years. \u201cThe wounded IWW ... seemed to lose all of its old dash, all of its genius for improvising guerrilla tactics,\u201d noted the historian Robert Tyler.</p> <p>Members of Little\u2019s family were arrested, terrifying the family into decades of silence, said Little Botkin. \u201cIf you had Frank\u2019s photo on you that could be sedition. We had no photos of him, not one. The family just stopped talking about him.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>His death signalled the end of the only truly radical and in some ways truly effective union of the time.</p> <footer> <cite>Arnold Stead</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>A movement which had mobilised the homeless and taught workers to take direct action never recovered, said Stead, the biographer. \u201cHis death signalled the end of the only truly radical and in some ways truly effective union of the time.\u201d </p> <p>Stead sees a continuum through the evolution \u2013 and weakening \u2013 of US unions. Instead of a wide movement infusing white, black and Latino workers with a shared class identity, unions narrowed and moderated their goals, seeking gains only for dues-paying members. </p> <p>Arguably this was a sensible, successful tack which benefited members. But globalisation and anti-union laws gradually drained their power. Only one in 10 American workers now belong to a union despite stagnant wages and widening inequality. </p> <p>Which brings us to Trump.</p> <p>In the absence of powerful unions, or a shared identity with the working poor of other races, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/14/opinion/sunday/the-decline-of-unions-and-the-rise-of-trump.html?_r=0\">blue collar white men are Trump\u2019s strongest supporters</a>. \u201cThey feel angry and left out so it\u2019s no surprise now that you have people willing to support someone who doesn\u2019t give a damn about them,\u201d said Stead.</p> <p>For CW Copeland, a Montana member of the IWW, which still limps on, the fault lies not just with unions but also the Democratic party and progressive academics. They neglected labour issues, he said. \u201cA lot of those going crazy for Donald Trump identify more with their whiteness than with their class. If more people knew about Frank Little \u2026 I think you\u2019d have fewer voting for Trump.\u201d</p> <p>Perhaps. But Little\u2019s grave sits amid yellowing grass and weeds in a lonely corner of the Mountain View cemetery, drawing few pilgrims</p> <p>\u201cSlain by capitalist interests for organizing and inspiring his fellow men,\u201d says the headstone.

A Butte reader pointed out that Butte does remember Little with an annual graveside commemoration, a sculpture and at the Labor History Center.<br></p>",
  "<p>Yesterday, 375 of the world\u2019s top scientists, including 30 Nobel Prize winners, published <a href=\"http://responsiblescientists.org/\">an open letter regarding climate change</a>. In the letter, the scientists report that the evidence is clear: humans are causing climate change. We are now observing climate change and its affect across the globe. The seas are rising, the oceans are warming, the lower atmosphere is warming, the land is warming, ice is melting, rainfall patterns are changing and the ocean is becoming more acidic.</p> <p>These facts are incontrovertible. No reputable scientist disputes them. It is the truth.</p> <p>Despite these facts, the letter reports that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2016/may/26/donald-trump-wants-to-build-a-wall-to-save-his-golf-course-from-global-warming\">the US presidential campaign has seen claims</a> that the earth isn\u2019t warming, or it is only a natural warming, or that climate change is a hoax. These claims are false. The claims are made by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2016/sep/14/trump-and-the-republican-party-are-doing-big-oils-bidding\">politicians or real estate developers</a> with no scientific experience. These people who deny the reality of climate change are not scientists. <br></p> <p>These claims aren\u2019t new. We see them every election cycle. In fact, f<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2016/jun/13/the-grand-oil-party-house-republicans-denounce-a-carbon-tax\">or the Republican Party</a>, they are a virtual litmus test for electability. It is terribly sad that the party of Lincoln (the president who initiated the National Academy of Sciences) has been rebuked by the National Academy today. It is sad that the party of Teddy Roosevelt, who created the National Park System, is acting in a way antithetical to his legacy. It is also sad that the party of Nixon, who created the Environmental Protection Agency, now is trying to eliminate that very organization.</p> <p>What is perhaps most sad is that the party of \u201cfiscal conservatism\u201d is leading us on a path that will result in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2016/jan/04/consensus-of-economists-cut-carbon-pollution\">higher economic and social costs</a> for all of us.</p> <p>What we don\u2019t know is what the future will bring. Will the warming be gradual or sudden? Will ocean rise increase at a faster rate or not? Will we continue to see major ice shelf collapse? Increased droughts and heat waves? Will we be able to adapt?</p> <p>A rational decision maker would take action to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2013/aug/23/climate-change-greatest-risk-management-failure\">manage the risks from climate change</a>. This threat is to our health, our communities, and our economies. A changing climate with warming seas and an acidifying ocean will cause real economic losses for our generation and for the future.</p> <p>In the letter, the scientists venture deeper into politics than scientists are generally willing to tread. They describe the <a href=\"https://prod-static-ngop-pbl.s3.amazonaws.com/media/documents/DRAFT_12_FINAL%5b1%5d-ben_1468872234.pdf\">inane Republican platform</a> and <a href=\"https://www.donaldjtrump.com/press-releases/unleashing-americamericas-prosperity-to-create-jobs-and-increase-wages\">the foolish position of the Republican nominee Donald Trump</a>. Basically, Trump wishes to scrap our environmental agreements, which have resulted in reductions to our own emissions as well as very strong agreements to reduce global warming through international agreements. <br></p> <p>Despite the excellent work over the past 7 years, we have not seen the increase in energy prices that the denialists claimed would occur. Instead, we\u2019ve seen huge reductions in the cost of wind, solar, and other renewable energy sources.</p> <p>We were right, they were wrong. We can deliver reliable energy to the USA at a low cost, with less pollution.</p> <p>We scientists have warned the country and the world about the dangers of climate change for decades. We are now seeing our predictions come true. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2016/apr/13/its-settled-90100-of-climate-experts-agree-on-human-caused-global-warming\">There are no longer any reputable scientists who disagree</a> that humans are the major factor changing the climate. </p> <p>We have also seen that real action can be taken to reduce pollution. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2014/jun/13/how-revenue-neutral-carbon-tax-creates-jobs-grows-economy\">That action will not hurt our economy</a>, rather it has built the new energy economy of the future.</p> <p>Despite this progress, some people want to take us backwards in time \u2013 they want to undo our progress. For those who vote in anti-science politicians who attack the scientific experts rather than our pollution problem, your legacy will be the climate change that you could have helped prevent. Those voters will own climate change. </p> <p>What will that conversation be like with your kids?</p>",

They described the 28 year old as friendly, generous with free food to regulars, and at least for a time obsessed with cars souped up for racing. Some have said the family was quiet, and that Rahami\u2019s father wore religious clothing but his sons did not.</p> <p>The family immigrated from Afghanistan some time before 2002, when Rahami was 14 and they opened First American Fried Chicken. Rahami became a naturalized citizen at some point; <a href=\"https://twitter.com/elisefoley/status/777961805939412993\">MSNBC has reported</a> that the family arrived in 1995 and were granted asylum in 2011, though the Guardian could not immediately confirm the dates. <br></p> <p>The family also had a decade-long clash with the city over the restaurant, whose 24-hour operations drew complaints from neighbors about rowdy crowds. City records show repeated complaints by both authorities and the family about their interactions, and one of Rahami\u2019s brothers pled guilty at one point to preventing police from enforcing a city ordinance. His lawsuit against the city, claiming anti-Muslim discrimination, is technically still pending although Mayor Chris Bollwage noted that courts have ruled in the city\u2019s favor.</p> <p>Bankruptcy court documents also showed that the family struggled with money; in 2005 Rahami\u2019s father filed for bankruptcy, saying in hte documents that he had only $100 in the bank and more than $35,000 in debt.</p> <p>Buzzfeed <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/mikehayes/here-is-what-we-know-about-the-suspected-new-york-and-new-je?utm_term=.nfBKbB7lB#.nbEE5Mb2M\">unearthed Rahami\u2019s freshman yearbook</a>, and spoke with one of his ninth-grade classmates, who said: \u201cVery funny, class clown.

  "<p>If there\u2019s one thing Donald Trump\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign has taught us it\u2019s to view every depraved moral nadir as a challenge, not a destination. You think this is bad? Wait for the tangy mouth garbage he\u2019s got stewing for tomorrow. Then forget about it instantly \u2013 everyone else will! I heard state department employees sometimes email each other!!!</p> <p>Just this week we\u2019ve seen Trump metabolise the Chelsea bombing into an incoherent anti-Clinton smear before the shrapnel had even settled. I\u2019ve listened to my Muslim friends express their fear of leaving the house after <a href=\"http://nymag.com/selectall/2016/09/new-yorkers-just-received-a-terrible-emergency-alert.html\">Monday\u2019s unconscionably irresponsible emergency alert</a>, the kind of histrionic racial profiling Trump vows to amplify. We\u2019ve read up on <a href=\"http://nymag.com/thecut/2016/09/donald-trumps-new-anti-abortion-letter-should-terrify-you.html\">Trump\u2019s alignment with an anti-abortion extremist group</a>, and his avowal to <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2016/09/19/donald-trumps-law-and-order-approach-wont-make-us-safer/\">\u201cget very tough\u201d</a> on \u201cthing[s]\u201d apparently including <a href=\"http://fusion.net/story/348568/donald-trump-free-speech-ny-bomb/\">freedom of expression</a>. We\u2019ve clocked Trump\u2019s pin-drop silence on the shooting deaths of Terence Crutcher and Tyre King, though \u2013 don\u2019t worry \u2013 over the summer he promised to make the streets safer \u2026 for police. Trump \u201cjoked\u201d (again!) <a href=\"http://www.vox.com/2016/9/16/12949204/trump-jokes-clinton-assassination\">about the assassination of Hillary Clinton</a>. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/20/donald-trump-jnr-compares-refugees-poisoned-skittles-twitter-reacted\">His son compared refugees, who are human beings who need our asylum to live, to Skittles</a>, which are sweets.</p> <p>It was a panoply of potentially career-ending gaffes extruded, clumped, scooped and forgotten in a single week \u2013 AKA business as usual in proto-Trump America. Baffled disgust turned to abject terror (in my circles, at least) when new poll numbers saw Trump climb to 42%.</p> <p>So, yesterday (like most days in these, surely, the end times), I wrote some snotty doom and gloom about Trump on Facebook and, to my surprise, was gently scolded by a friend. \u201cHating Trump isn\u2019t enough,\u201d she said, \u201cjust like hating W wasn\u2019t enough in 2004. We have to talk about Hillary.\u201d I was defensive for a second \u2013 I do talk about Hillary! \u2013 but couldn\u2019t quibble with her point. It\u2019s easy and fun (and compulsory for responsible human beings) to despise Trump, but treating Clinton like a barely-better-than-a-literal-white-supremacist cipher does her \u2013 and our future as a non-blown-up planet \u2013 no favours. Yes, Trump is an objectively, dangerously horrendous candidate. But we have to start acknowledging that even if we scrubbed Trump from this universe altogether (buy my fan fiction!), Clinton would still be an excellent one.</p> <p>I cannot wait to vote for Hillary Clinton, but not just because I want to see Donald Trump fail and cry.</p> <p>Clinton is pro-choice. This means she does not want to force anyone to give birth to their rapist\u2019s child, or carry a dead foetus inside of their body for 20 weeks, or derail their future because sex is great and everyone has it and accidents happen, or otherwise be a nonconsensual incubator of any kind. Clinton wants to make it harder, not easier, to buy guns. She believes in eliminating loopholes and expanding background checks on gun sales. She does not think domestic abusers should own guns, which is good, because abused women are five times more likely to be murdered if their abusive partner owns a gun. She would prefer your children not to get shot in schools or shopping malls or nightclubs. I agree.</p> <p>Clinton believes in guaranteed paid family leave, because fathers are parents too, and mothers shouldn\u2019t have to choose between career stagnation and going back to work while their episiotomy stitches are still oozing.</p> <p>Clinton wants to tax rich people more than poor people, which is a sentence that no one should have to type ever again.</p> <p>Clinton\u2019s platform addresses mass incarceration, the school-to-prison pipeline, climate change, violence against trans women of colour, the systemic neglect of veterans, mental health stigma, voting rights, student loan debt, public education and affordable health care. Clinton is the candidate whose views best represent my own.</p> <p>Whether or not you feel comfortable with every decision and position in Clinton\u2019s past (I do not), she is qualified for this job. She is a shrewd, savvy, tough politician.</p> <p>Clinton has weathered intrusive, insulting, gendered smear campaigns \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/2016/08/18/490478924/cooked-up-after-a-hillary-clinton-gaffe-the-first-spouse-cookie-battle-is-back\">cookies</a>, Benghazi, emails and pneumonia \u2013 with a grace rivalled only by Obama\u2019s unflappable handling of birthers. She swam through tar every single day of her career and still surpassed male opponents who swam through water. She has been scrutinised in bad faith and beyond all reason for her entire campaign (and decades prior), and Republicans have still had to manufacture baroque, toothless scandals out of dust motes. Yet, somehow, 42% of my country apparently believes that Donald Trump is more qualified to address foreign policy and \u201csafety\u201d than an actual seasoned diplomat. Do you guys think \u201csecretary of state\u201d is the kind of secretary who gets the president coffee? Is that the confusion?</p> <p>We cannot excise sexism from this election (and here I am talking predominantly to white dudes \u2013 the group most disproportionately supporting Trump \u2013 who just have a vague \u201cfeeling\u201d that they don\u2019t like Clinton). You might not overtly hate women. You might be a fantastic boyfriend, husband, brother or son. You might not beat women or harass them or even objectify them or belittle them. But do you trust them? Do you hire them? Do you hire them for management positions? You\u2019re building a house. Do you prefer a male contractor or a female contractor? You\u2019re having open heart surgery tomorrow. Do you want a male surgeon or a female surgeon? If your gut says \u201cman\u201d, you have some introspection to do.</p> <p>So let\u2019s try again: you\u2019re voting for a president soon. Do you want a graduate of Yale law school who served eight years as a US senator and four as secretary of state? Or a racist landlord who moonlights as a tie salesman?</p> <p>I cannot wait to vote for Hillary Clinton.</p>",
  "<p>Fashion week has been hijacked by the real world. For decades, \u201cthe shows\u201d existed in a champagne bubble, a parallel universe in which celebrities were jammed together on long benches, as if for a very glamorous school photo, and where mysterious diktats \u2013 Navy is the New Black; Minimalism is Dead \u2013 were pronounced six months ahead of time, as if by a cabal of fortune tellers.</p> <p>But this is 2016, and identity politics has trumped everything else. From Brexit to the presidential election, public debate centres on issues not of policy, or economics, but of class, race and gender. On social media, if you are not cooing over cute panda videos you are probably debating a hashtagged identity issue \u2013 Kim Kardashian and the politics of nude selfies, or diversity at the Oscars. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/24/french-police-make-woman-remove-burkini-on-nice-beach\">most striking image of summer 2016</a> was of a woman in a burkini, surrounded by armed police. On 4 September, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2016/sep/05/was-kanye-west-wrong-cast-multiracial-women-only\">Kanye West caused a furore</a> with a casting call requesting \u201cmultiracial women only\u201d for his Yeezy catwalk show. On 8 September, the day New York fashion week opened, Lionel Shriver wore a sombrero on stage during an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/13/lionel-shrivers-full-speech-i-hope-the-concept-of-cultural-appropriation-is-a-passing-fad\">instantly controversial speech</a> about cultural appropriation. In other words, this season\u2019s fashion headlines were never all that likely to be about the sleeve shapes.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2016/sep/05/was-kanye-west-wrong-cast-multiracial-women-only\">Was Kanye West wrong to seek to cast 'multiracial women only'?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>What\u2019s more, this is a moment of structural change in fashion. This London fashion week marked the beginning of a new era of immediacy in fashion, with Burberry leading the charge of straight-to-consumer shows. The cultural import of See Now Buy Now fashion is that the clothes on the catwalk relate not to the theoretical world of six months\u2019 time, but to the world as it is now. The new business model is still only embraced by a minority of designers, but its mindset is impacting everybody. Fashion week has simply become more relevant. In a world where you can order a delivery of milk on Amazon Prime and put the kettle on to make tea pretty much straight away, our relationship with time is shifting. \u201cSpeed is everything,\u201d said Christopher Bailey after his See Now Buy Now Burberry show on Monday evening. \u201cIt\u2019s changing how we think.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"220935621b5ba93f10dc51c28816e10efc01dbae\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/220935621b5ba93f10dc51c28816e10efc01dbae/0_291_5122_3074/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Outsider chic is the must-have look on the front row.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Outsider chic is the must-have look on the front row.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Phillips/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>You can tell fashion week has changed, because the people in its orbit look different. Look at the front row of any fashion show right now, and you will see oversized hoodies, tracksuit bottoms, flat shoes. The front-row look \u2013 high heels, sample-size dresses, everything dry clean only \u2013 was once all about signalling elite status. By contrast, this season\u2019s must-have pieces \u2013 jeans with raw, lopsided hems and sweatshirts whose extra-long sleeves give the impression of having been borrowed from a flatmate in a scruffy student house \u2013 present an uncompromising vision of outsider chic. (Some aspects of fashion, however, do not change. A pair of jeans from Vetements, the flagship label for this look, costs around \u00a3800.)</p> <p>Fashion\u2019s shift towards democracy, with catwalk streams livestreamed and increasingly open to consumers, is reflected in the clothes themselves, as a broader vision of what aspiration looks like. At London fashion week, Christopher Kane, one of the standout LFW talents of his generation, has made \u201cOutsider Art\u201d a theme of his recent collections. At his show at Tate Britain on Monday, pencil skirts in what he dubbed \u201croad kill fur\u201d represented \u201cthe alchemy of making something out of the humble and the discarded\u201d. Richard Malone\u2019s collection, part of the Fashion East show, was based on the aesthetic of workers\u2019 uniforms. Tunics were elevated, tailored versions of those worn by hospital cleaners. \u201cI wanted to integrate [workwear] into fashion, to make it a respected, beautiful thing,\u201d Malone said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c602d185d4fd4936610156ef2956dfb1b344d997\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c602d185d4fd4936610156ef2956dfb1b344d997/0_0_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Model Adwoa Aboah arrives for the Burberry show at LFW.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Model Adwoa Aboah arrives for the Burberry show at LFW.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Luke Macgregor/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Fashion week\u2019s intersection with identity politics is most high-profile where it is most photogenic. Gender fluidity is a talking point in public debate; fashion has turned it into a trend. London fashion week\u2019s current It girl, Adwoah Aboah, a model who walked for her friend Ashley Williams\u2019 show and sat front row at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2016/sep/19/burberry-september-show-seasonless-clothes-fashion-stream-of-consciousness-era\">Burberry</a>, has a staggering buzzcut beauty which does not conform to feminine tropes. What started with a menswear influence on womenswear has evolved into Gucci\u2019s aesthetic of velvet, pearls, rainbow colours and tumbling curls for both men and women, a look that is almost post-gender. Orlando was the inspiration for Burberry this week, where the clothes for men and women were an interchangeable collage of silk pyjama shirts, blazers, and \u2013 of course \u2013 trenchcoats. Backstage after his JW Anderson show this week, designer Jonathan Anderson talked about an \u201curban cultural reappropriation of Tudor silhouettes\u201d and borrowing \u201csomething of that masculinity and aggression\u201d of Henry VIII\u2019s wardrobe for modern womenswear.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5eaa2d37a1db0dcc55421413d63e1168bb62576d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5eaa2d37a1db0dcc55421413d63e1168bb62576d/0_112_2568_3652/703.jpg\" alt=\"Post-gender?

At the presentation for her Victoria Victoria Beckham secondary line in London this week, Beckham showed loose trousers with oversized jackets, an anti-bodycon look that is very different from the corset dresses that were the starting point for her main line. \u201cSoft tailoring is what I wear myself, most of the time, these days,\u201d she said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7d2b5a2e128556df62db848abb2c00391400bb49\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7d2b5a2e128556df62db848abb2c00391400bb49/0_199_1020_1180/864.jpg\" alt=\"Anti-bodycon look: loose trousers and oversize jackets at Victoria Victoria Beckham.\" width=\"864\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Anti-bodycon look: loose trousers and oversize jackets at Victoria Victoria Beckham.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of Victoria Victoria Beckham</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A fashion-show audience typically numbers around 500; two million people watched livestreams of the most recent New York fashion week. The exploding audience figures mean fashion week is being held to account on issues to which the fashion industry has for a long time been wilfully blinkered. Model health and body image was the first flashpoint, and continues to be a touchpaper issue, the glacial pace of change reflecting the resistance by an industry which has long played by its own rules to accept accountability. Those who have watched fashion shows for decades and long ago stopped registering the size of the models are bewildered by this new audience, who see jutting collarbones as something more significant than a handy clothes hanger. Who look at models and see not just \u201cgirls\u201d, as they are always known, but people.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e43d9ce637430b0d0b65a1fba5249adf5984697c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e43d9ce637430b0d0b65a1fba5249adf5984697c/0_94_3432_2059/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Models Bella Hadid (L) and Kendall Jenner wear Marc Jacobs pastel dreadlocks during New York fashion week 2106.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Models Bella Hadid (left) and Kendall Jenner wear Marc Jacobs pastel dreadlocks during New York fashion week 2106.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Angela Weiss/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>On the same night that the prime minister hosted Christopher Bailey and Vivienne Westwood at a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2016/sep/15/theresa-may-shows-britain-is-still-open-for-business-at-london-fashion-week\">Downing Street reception for British fashion</a>, Marc Jacobs walked into a furore by putting pastel woollen dreadlocks on white models on his New York catwalk. Jacobs\u2019 initial response to criticism \u2013 \u201cI don\u2019t see colour or race\u201d \u2013 displayed an insensitivity, for which he has since apologised. In the year of Black Lives Matter, not seeing colour is hardly a defensible position. Coco Chanel\u2019s line about fashion reflecting the world we live in has been reproduced more often than her boucle tweed jacket, but, a century later, many designers are still slow to recognise that if fashion wants to be taken seriously in the real world, it has to play by grown-up rules. With cultural power comes responsibility, after all. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d1d28790092e32ece8d46eceb46b2f1ac37f3363\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d1d28790092e32ece8d46eceb46b2f1ac37f3363/0_300_2717_2869/947.jpg\" alt=\"Exploring ideas of black male identity: Grace Wales Bonner\u2019s S/S 2016 collection.\" width=\"947\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Exploring ideas of black male identity: Grace Wales Bonner\u2019s SS16 collection.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Edward Quarmby</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>While some designers are still struggling to navigate their place in the newly accountable fashion industry, a generation is emerging who have an instinctive grasp of fashion\u2019s place in a connected world. Grace Wales Bonner, the British winner of this year\u2019s LVMH prize \u2013 the most valuable and prestigious in the global fashion industry \u2013 explores ideas of black male identity. \u201cI feel like I\u2019ve seen enough images of black men looking really aggressive, very hypersexualised or \u201cstreet\u201d. That\u2019s not how I think about men at all. That\u2019s not the men in my life,\u201d she said last year of her ultra-elegant menswear.</p> <p>The key trends of this London fashion week were a speeded-up business model, gender-fluidity, and outsider chic. Which is all very well, except it doesn\u2019t really explain what to wear. The more interesting fashion week becomes, the less significant the trends on the catwalk feel. My tip for the standout look as seen at this London fashion week? Forget Burberry\u2019s Cavalry jacket, or Christopher Kane\u2019s Roadkill skirt. I\u2019m calling it for the asymmetric white party shirt, as seen at Downing Street on Theresa May.</p>",

My father was a diplomat and a strong supporter of democracy in Czechoslovakia, so when the Communists took over, we were forced into exile as refugees. In November 1948, we were welcomed to the United States of America.</p> <p>Becoming a US citizen is the most important thing that ever happened to me.

If we were to slam the door in the faces of refugees with certain religious backgrounds, we would defy our history and our principles of pluralism and diversity. As we talk to other nations about what more needs to be done to tackle this crisis, it\u2019s important that President Obama is setting this example.</p> <p>When I came here as a child, I will never forget sailing into New York Harbor for the first time and beholding the Statute of Liberty. I did not have to face refugee camps or the kind of danger that many refugees endure. But like all refugees, I shared a hope to live a safe life with dignity and a chance to give back to my new country.</p> <p>Together, we can help refugees rebuild their lives and live with dignity once again.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57e1a621e4b0603ea33c4669\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-20T21:18:18.009Z\">10.18pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Fox News talking head Sean Hannity\u2019s outspoken and material support for Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has reached another milestone today, with the release of an eight-minute promotional video for the nominee in which Hannity makes an appearance.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0J_EKmvYZk\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/k0J_EKmvYZk?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Hannity, whose eponymous program has long been a favorite slot for Trump to answer softball questions and for the duo to <a href=\"https://vine.co/v/OeF3QBlnwlV\">soak up each others\u2019 awesomeness</a>, arrives about six minutes into #HEARTLAND4TRUMP, a promotional video studded with testimonials about the Republican nominee:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>One of the reasons I\u2019m supporting Donald Trump this year is, number one, he\u2019s going to put originalists on the supreme court - people that believe in fidelity to the constitution, separation of powers, co-equal branches of government.</p> <p>He\u2019s a guy that will vet refugees to keep Americans safe.</p> <p>And, of course, he\u2019s gonna build that wall.

  "<p>A former supreme court law clerk turned US senator warned on Wednesday that Republicans are \u201caiding and abetting in the destruction of the United States supreme court and the rule of law\u201d.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.blumenthal.senate.gov/\">Richard Blumenthal</a> delivered an impassioned plea at the steps to the court where a vacancy on the bench remains unfilled. Barack Obama\u2019s nominee, Merrick Garland, has now been waiting 175 days for a Senate hearing, longer than any other supreme court nominee in US history. </p> <p>For Blumenthal, an ex-federal prosecutor and state attorney who has argued cases before the supreme court, the battle is personal. Describing how he passes the court on Capitol Hill every day, the Democratic senator for Connecticut said: \u201cI can\u2019t help but think that its power is based on a very thin thread of credibility. It has no army, it commands no police force, it\u2019s unelected, its members serve for life. What more undemocratic institution could you imagine?</p> <p>\u201cAnd yet the American people are willing to obey its every order because they have that same respect for it, that it is above politics. The Republicans are dragging this institution into the muck and mire of gridlock and partisan paralysis. They are not only diminishing but greatly endangering this court and that is unforgivable.\u201d</p> <p>Blumenthal added: \u201cThe Republican majority in the United States Senate is aiding and abetting in the destruction of the United States supreme court and the rule of law. It\u2019s really that simple and that grave.\u201d</p> <p>The nine-seat court has been one justice short since the death in February of long-serving conservative <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/feb/13/antonin-scalia-dead-us-supreme-court-justice-obituary\">Antonin Scalia</a>. With four liberals and four conservatives now on the bench, several cases have been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2016/may/16/us-supreme-court-merrick-garland-president-obama-contraception-mandate\">deadlocked or delayed</a>.</p> <p>As senators return to work after a seven-week summer recess, Blumenthal and some Democratic colleagues, along with former judicial clerks to Garland and legal scholars, lined up on Wednesday to urge Republicans to act on the nomination before the presidential election on 8 November. But the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/18/mock-confirmation-hearing-merrick-garland-senate-supreme-court\">insists that Obama\u2019s successor</a> must make the pick.</p> <p>Praising Garland, whom he has known for many years, Blumenthal added: \u201cThe irony here is that a completely non-political public servant also has been dragged into the muck and mire of political partisanship.\u201d</p> <p>The standoff comes in an election year in which many voters have expressed frustration at congressional inaction and intransigence, allowing candidates such as Donald Trump, Ted Cruz and Bernie Sanders to thrive.<br></p> <p>Senator <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.booker.senate.gov/\">Cory Booker</a> of New Jersey said: \u201cSo many people now are surrendering to cynicism about Washington. So many people are dismissing what goes on in this town often as \u2018politics as usual\u2019, but I want to make it very clear that this is not usual. This is not ordinary. This is not the regular course of events.</p> <p>\u201cWhat this is is an assault on the very foundations and ideals of our country. It is a betrayal of the ideals of both parties represented here in Washington. What we are seeing now is folks who claim to be in line with conservative values betraying those very ideals. Those who say they are in allegiance with the rule of law betraying those very ideals.</p> <p>\u201cThis is an unprecedented moment in American history. We should sound the alarm because the pathway we are heading down now is dark and destructive.\u201d</p> <p>Senator <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.durbin.senate.gov/\">Dick Durbin</a> of Illinois warned that, with the court due to begin a new session in a few weeks, major legal questions are being left in limbo by the Republican agenda. </p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s an agenda that has really been pushed forward by corporate interests, by Wall Street banks and by the Koch brothers. Let\u2019s call it for what it is. Look at the advertising in the Senate races across the United States. Who\u2019s paying for it? Who is trying to stop the new voices who want to come to the Senate and make a difference and fill the vacancy on the supreme court?\u201d</p> <p>The Democratic nominee, Hillary Clinton, has said she supports the Garland nomination but has declined to commit herself to renominating him if she is elected president. Her rival Donald Trump <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.donaldjtrump.com/press-releases/donald-j.-trump-releases-list-of-names-of-potential-united-states-supreme-c\">has issued a list</a> of conservatives he would consider, encouraging some Republicans to shrug off other concerns about him.</p> <p>Wednesday\u2019s press conference, organised by <a href=\"http://weneednine.org/\">We Need Nine</a>, a White House-allied group, was also addressed by former judicial clerks to Garland including Craig Green, 43, from Philadelphia. He said: \u201cI believe failure to hold those hearings is disgraceful and dangerous.</p> <p>\u201cIn partisan times more than ever, we need to believe that the supreme court and American law are more than political footballs. We need to believe that supreme court nominees are more than \u2018hooray for our team\u2019. It is not a partisan issue to demand hearings for a supreme court nominee after 175 days. Only the worst kinds of partisans and cynics would say something like that.\u201d</p> <p>There is little sign of movement, however. McConnell \u201chas been crystal clear for the last seven months\u201d, <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-court-garland-idUSKCN11C2HM\">an aide to the senator told Reuters</a> on Tuesday. \u201cThe next president will select the nominee.\u201d </p>",
  "<p>The fight for democracy in Africa is, these days, centred on the tiny, oil-rich country of&#xa0;Gabon. It is not a new fight, by any means. In 2009, after the death of longtime leader Omar Bongo \u2013 who had ruled the former French colony for more than 40 years \u2013 riots broke out in several cities when it was announced that his son, Ali Bongo, was slated to become the next president. Opposition leaders called foul after presidential election results were announced, and they attempted to organise a nationwide strike. Now, seven years on, Ali Bongo has run up against a new, wider wave of protests, after he claimed he had won re-election, on 27 August, with a lead of just over 5,000 votes in a nation of 1.8&#xa0;million. Street clashes with police led to several deaths. Opposition supporters set fire to the parliament building. Yet Mr Bongo remains defiant. He has accused his critics of attempting a coup and he has rejected calls for a recount of votes and even for election results to be published in detail. At one point he had his main opponent, Jean Ping, who says the election is being stolen, placed under house arrest. There were also government efforts to impose a media blackout, including by cutting off the internet. The situation on the streets has since eased, but tensions still run high in this central African country.</p> <p>Gabon\u2019s crisis is watched closely by France and neighbouring African states. France has a key military base as well as important economic interests in the region and has called for a recount, but it wants to be careful not to appear to meddle directly for fear of being accused of neocolonial reflexes. Whether outside mediation can help resolve a situation where two men, Mr Bongo and Mr Ping, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/28/both-sides-in-gabon-presidential-election-claim-victory-ahead-of-count\" title=\"\">both claim to be the legally elected president</a> will now be put to the test: the African Union announced this week that it would send a delegation to Gabon.</p> <p>None of this is made easier by the complex web of family ties that have long stood at the heart of Gabonese politics. Mr Ping, 73 years old, a former president of the African Union commission, was one of Omar Bongo\u2019s closest and longest-serving ministers and married one of his daughters. He now describes Gabon as \u201ca dictatorship pure and simple, run by a clan\u201d \u2013 a \u201cdynastic regime\u201d that must be ended. But there is hardly any doubt that he has solid reasons to complain about vote manipulation. A mission of European Union observers <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-gabon-election-election-idUSKCN11C112?il=0\" title=\"\">said there were \u201cobvious anomalies\u201d</a>. Mr Ping hopes international pressure will bear down on Mr Bongo, who clearly believes time is on his side because no external player is ready to consider anything like outright intervention.</p> <p>Many of Gabon\u2019s citizens certainly want its political course to change. Its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/aug/16/gabon-yawning-poverty-gap-end-dependency-oil\" title=\"\">population is poor</a> and the economy has slumped with the fall of global oil prices. Families struggle for food day to day. Mr Bongo\u2019s rule has been tainted by many allegations of corruption, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/feb/06/france-africa-autocrats-corruption-inquiry\" title=\"\">not least the ownership of luxury cars and apartments in Paris</a>. Gabon has only had three presidents since its independence in 1960. Mr Bongo, 57, may have tried to project the image of a younger leader, but his repressive methods are fast placing him in the same category as other strongmen who hang on to power as if mandates were for life. The unrest that has broken out reflects deep-seated popular anger. Gabon\u2019s civil society, like those elsewhere in Africa, wants its voice to be heard, and democratic procedures to be respected. The votes should be recounted.</p>",

He <a href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/on-air/on-the-record/2013/02/24/trump-looming-sequester-its-being-overexaggerated\">told Fox News</a> in 2013 that concern about it was \u201cover-exaggerated\u201d and dismissed naysayers, saying \u201ca lot of things are not going to happen that people are thinking are going to happen.\u201d</p> <p>Clinton called for an end to the sequester at a speech to the American Legion in Cincinnati on 31 August. \u201cWe cannot impose arbitrary limits on something as important as our military,\u201d the Democratic nominee said. \u201cThat makes no sense at all. The sequester makes our country less secure. Let\u2019s end it and get a budget deal that supports America\u2019s military, our families, and our country.\u201d</p> <p>Trump proposed to use the increased defense budget to expand the army to 540,000 people, the navy to 350 ships, and the air force to at least 1,200 fighter aircraft, as well as to develop a missile defense system. A number of the recommendations were based on a report from the Heritage Foundation, a conservative thinktank based in Washington that Republicans have long relied on for policy recommendations.</p> <p>The size of the armed forces has been reduced in recent years, with the army <a href=\"https://www.armytimes.com/story/military/pentagon/2015/07/09/army-outlines-40000-cuts/29923339/\">moving towards a long-term goal</a> of reducing its force to 450,00 active duty soldiers.

Every state in the union will be able to take part rebuilding our military and developing the technologies for tomorrow.\u201d</p> <p>The Republican nominee provided few details about how this massive increase in spending would be funded. Trump talked vaguely of \u201ccommonsense reforms that eliminate government waste and budget gimmicks\u201d as well as \u201creducing the size of the federal bureaucracy through responsible workforce attrition\u201d. One specific measure Trump suggested was \u201crespectfully asking Germany, Japan, South Korea and Saudi Arabia to pay more for the tremendous security we provide them\u201d.

  "<h2>The crisis in America\u2019s public defender system</h2> <p>Ed Monahan, Kentucky\u2019s public advocate and chief defender, describes public defenders as \u201cthe pack mules of the system\u201d. Current statistics are hard to come by, but a 2008 study by the American Bar Association estimated that just 2.5% of the roughly $200bn spent on criminal justice by states and local government every year went on public defenders. Up to 90% of criminal defendants in the US qualify as indigent, and some public defenders are working 150 cases with a budget of just $350 for each.

  "<h2>Why is a $25,000 campaign donation Donald Trump made in September 2013 to Pam Bondi, a Republican running for re-election as Florida\u2019s attorney general, now such a big deal?</h2> <p>Trump circumvented Internal Revenue Service (IRS) rules by routing the money through a charitable entity, the Donald J Trump Foundation, which is prohibited by law from making political donations. More controversially, however, Bondi\u2019s office was at the time mulling whether to join a New York state probe into allegations that customers who paid thousands of dollars to Trump University, Trump\u2019s for-profit education company, for a real estate investment course were ripped off. Just days after Trump\u2019s donation arrived, Bondi dropped her investigation into the alleged fraud, citing \u201cinsufficient grounds\u201d to proceed. </p> <h2>The donation was three years ago.

But last week\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2016/09/01/trump-pays-irs-a-penalty-for-his-foundation-violating-rules-with-gift-to-florida-attorney-general/\">Washington Post report</a> that Trump had paid the IRS a $2,500 penalty for the \u201cimproper\u201d contribution sparked renewed scrutiny, quickly followed by a <a href=\"http://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/pam-bondi-trump-never-spoke-clarification\">\u201che-said, she-said\u201d disagreement</a> this week over whether Trump and Bondi had ever actually discussed the affair. </p> <h2>So if Trump paid the IRS a penalty, does he admit he did wrong?</h2> <p>Not at all. The fact that Trump\u2019s charity made the unlawful donation instead of Trump himself was \u201cjust an honest mistake\u201d <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2016/09/01/trump-pays-irs-a-penalty-for-his-foundation-violating-rules-with-gift-to-florida-attorney-general/\">according to Jeffrey McConney</a>, senior vice-president of the Trump Organization. So, apparently, was the fact that the Trump Foundation\u2019s tax filing for that year did not record the donation to Bondi\u2019s group, but did claim that a $25,000 gift was made to a charity in Kansas with a similar-sounding name, even though no such donation appears to have been made. In the words of the Washington Post, \u201cthe prohibited gift was, in effect, replaced with an innocent sounding but non-existent donation\u201d.</p> <p>That\u2019s nonsense, insists McConney, who said Trump immediately reimbursed his foundation and filed corrected paperwork with the IRS as soon as the \u201cerrors\u201d were brought to his attention in March by the Post and the watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington.</p> <h2>And what of Bondi?

The new revelation raises further questions over whether Trump was thanking Bondi, and could weaken his own line of attack against Clinton over the sourcing of her own campaign donations.</p>",
  "<h2>1) Christian Pulisic should start against Mexico</h2> <p>Head coach J\u00fcrgen Klinsmann has friendlies against Cuba and New Zealand in October to fine-tune his line-up for the first Hexagonal game at home to Mexico in November, but it will be hard to leave out Pulisic for the showpiece 2018 World Cup qualifier based on his performances <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/06/usa-world-cup-trinidad-tobago-hex-jozy-altidore\">against Trinidad &amp; Tobago</a>, and St Vincent &amp; the Grenadines.</p> <p>It\u2019s not only his pacy, direct running but his speed of thought that impresses, and makes him seem far older than his 17 years (he\u2019s 18 in eleven days). Allied with solid technique, he has already shown he can score chances and create them. In his first international start he was not merely comfortable against Trinidad &amp; Tobago \u2013 he was the best player on the pitch.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/06/usa-world-cup-trinidad-tobago-hex-jozy-altidore\">Altidore and Pulisic excel as USA clinch spot in the Hex with easy win over T&amp;T</a> </p> </aside>  <p>True, SVG and T&amp;T are hardly upper-tier opposition, but there\u2019s every reason to think that Pulisic could impress against tougher teams. He has the fearlessness that Klinsmann craves. The Borussia Dortmund man/boy also worked well with Fabian Johnson, which may reassure Klinsmann that he can continue to use the 28-year-old at the problem position of left back without entirely blunting his valuable attacking instincts.</p> <p>For consequential matches, Klinsmann has adopted a safety-first approach, preferring to pick what he believes is his best XI rather than opting to give his greenhorns work experience that would prove valuable down the line. While Pulisic is young enough to <a href=\"http://www.espnfc.com/team/united-states/660/blog/post/2944438/christian-pulisic-on-life-with-the-united-states-borussia-dortmund-and-being-a-justin-bieber-fan\">get excited about going to see Justin Bieber in concert</a>, he\u2019s also unquestionably one of the US\u2019s top 11 players. That, rather than fretting about whether Pulisic can handle the hype, should be the main guiding factor for Klinsmann when he selects his line-ups for the coming matches.</p> <h2>2) Mixed results up front</h2> <p>Jozy Altidore scored twice, and his first was a goal of some craftsmanship. Especially with Clint Dempsey absent because of <a href=\"http://www.foxsports.com/soccer/story/jurgen-klinsmann-thinks-clint-dempsey-will-be-fine-after-irregular-heartbeat-scare-090416\">tests for an irregular heartbeat</a>, Altidore\u2019s contribution was welcome \u2013 and his strikes saw him break Dempsey\u2019s all-time record for most USMNT World Cup qualifying goals, which had stood at 14. After he missed the Copa America Centenario through injury, it\u2019s easy to forget the key role the Toronto FC striker played for the US in the last Hex.</p> <p>Though he developed a good understanding with Pulisic, Altidore\u2019s partnership up front with Bobby Wood had all the chemistry of a busted Bunsen burner. It was jarring to see Wood looking ineffective, after his strong Copa, since T&amp;T were defensively weak and because he worked well enough with Altidore against SVG only last week. Jordan Morris replaced him off the bench on Tuesday and was bright; along with Gyasi Zardes, Klinsmann has decent options in attack - if he can fit the puzzle pieces together.</p> <h2>3) Sacha Kljestan\u2019s renaissance continues</h2> <p>Like many of his team-mates, Kljestan took a while to get going. When he did, scoring an opportunistic opening goal and looking lively in the second half, he underlined that his excellent club form with the New York Red Bulls has carried over to his unexpected return to the national team. Rewarded with a start following a notable cameo in St Vincent last Friday, against T&amp;T he outshone his fellow midfielders, Michael Bradley and Alejandro Bedoya, who had little impact. And his combination play with Pulisic was one reason why the teenager looked so good in the past two fixtures.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/may/31/christian-pulisic-usa-soccer-copa-america-2016\">Christian Pulisic: the making of a young man ready to step up</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Kljestan was not even on the 40-man preliminary roster for June\u2019s Copa. Now, aged 30, is he ready to replicate his consistently good MLS performances at international level for a sustained period? And will Klinsmann give him the chance once Jermaine Jones is back from injury?</p> <h2>4) Who\u2019s in goal?</h2> <p>The meeting with the hapless Vincy Heat or the clash with T&amp;T \u2013 knowing that the US had (barring a miracle) already secured a berth in the Hexagonal qualification stage \u2013 might have seemed good opportunities to blood third-choice goalkeeper Ethan Horvath. The 21-year-old, who plays for Molde in Norway, has yet to win a senior international cap. Instead, we\u2019re left wondering who the preferred goalkeeper is, after Tim Howard played on Tuesday while Brad Guzan was between the posts last Friday. This in a position where it\u2019s normally considered optimal to have a clear first choice, especially behind a back four that has been chopped and changed.</p> <h2>5) Familiarity breeds victory</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/ussoccer/status/773371584346193920\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/TheHex?src=hash\">#TheHex</a> schedule is set for the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/USMNT?src=hash\">#USMNT</a>.

Ohio may be a political swing state, but it\u2019s safely red, white and blue when the US face Mexico: dating back to 2001, the US have played their rivals in four World Cup qualifiers at the home of the Crew and won each, 2-0. </p> <p>It\u2019s especially important to get off to a good start since what is likely to be the second-toughest road game, Costa Rica, follows only four days later, so a bad week would leave Klinsmann\u2019s side playing catch-up.

  "<p>When <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/nicolas-sarkozy\">Nicolas Sarkozy</a> held his first comeback rally, he sweated profusely on a small stage in a stuffy and spartan gymnasium in the south of France.</p> <p>The rightwinger\u2019s modest choice of venue last month to launch his campaign to become his party\u2019s 2017 presidential nominee contrasted strikingly with the glitzy, US-style stadium gigs that became a trademark of the man once known as President Bling Bling. </p> <p>In 2012, when Sarkozy ran for re-election and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/may/06/francois-hollande-becomes-french-president\">lost to the Socialist Fran\u00e7ois Hollande</a>, his rallies were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/14/fraud-claims-nicolas-sarkozy-2012-campaign\">theatrical mega-productions</a>, slickly coordinated by dedicated film directors, with specially laid carpet for his luxury dressing rooms and tens of thousands of euros spent on French flags to be waved by a sea of adoring fans.</p> <p>Those mega-rallies came back to haunt him this week when the French state prosecutor recommended Sarkozy <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/05/nicolas-sarkozy-may-face-trial-alleged-illegal-campaign-funding-france\">should face a criminal trial</a> over alleged illegal campaign funding. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/19/le-comeback-kid-sarkozy-shapes-up-for-presidential-run-on-hardline-platform\">Le comeback kid?

The limit on presidential campaign spending in France is \u20ac22.5m (\u00a319m), and investigators suspect Sarkozy\u2019s campaign spent \u20ac23m on top of that. Sarkozy has always denied any wrongdoing in the case, or even any knowledge of Bygmalion, an events company that allegedly concealed the overspend.</p> <p>The prosecutor\u2019s recommendation that Sarkozy face trial is a serious knock to his attempt to win back power next year on a platform of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/19/le-comeback-kid-sarkozy-shapes-up-for-presidential-run-on-hardline-platform\">hardline identity politics and a security crackdown</a>. The man presenting himself as a model of \u201cFrench authority\u201d is suddenly facing the possibility of standing in the dock.</p> <p>But Sarkozy is defiant. He has hit back with the same argument he has used about a string of legal investigations that have dogged him since 2012: that he is innocent of any wrongdoing and that he is the victim of a plot against him by political enemies in cahoots with the justice system. </p> <p>\u201cNo controversy, no manoeuvring, no manipulation \u2013 however shameful it may be \u2013 will deter me from my absolute determination to bring about a change in power,\u201d Sarkozy told a rally west of Paris on Tuesday night. \u201cI love France!\u201d he thundered. \u201cTrying to discourage me from my passion is inhuman \u2013 it\u2019s not possible!\u201d The crowd cheered and applauded. \u201cI like people who have their ups and downs, who don\u2019t complain, who grit their teeth,\u201d he told supporters.</p> <p>Sarkozy\u2019s strategy of presenting himself as a victim is likely to comfort his unfailing support base inside his own Les R\u00e9publicains party. The news that the state prosecutor wanted Sarkozy to stand trial came on the same day as a major fraud trial opened against Hollande\u2019s onetime senior lieutenant and budget minister <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/apr/03/french-tax-fraud-hollande\">J\u00e9r\u00f4me Cahuzac</a>, who is accused of tax evasion and money-laundering \u2013 raising eyebrows on the right about the timing of the announcement. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"0b33e77082d0636a678a40564b9d016a56f86932\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0b33e77082d0636a678a40564b9d016a56f86932/0_95_4256_2554/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A Sarkozy election rally in 2012.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A Sarkozy election rally in 2012.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Eric Feferberg/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But outside this devoted, narrow support base, Sarkozy\u2019s legal woes could prove a slow poison that permeates the right\u2019s primary campaign. Voters on the broader right and centre who will nominate their presidential candidate in November might decide that the spectre of a court case is too damaging to Sarkozy\u2019s chances of winning back the presidency. <a href=\"https://www.mediapart.fr/journal/france/060916/corruption-les-yeux-grand-fermes\">Fabrice Arfi</a>, the investigative journalist for Mediapart, described Sarkozy\u2019s claims he was being victimised by the justice system as a \u201cBerlusconian gesture\u201d. It will be difficult to have to keep answering questions on this during the primary race TV debates.</p> <p>And yet, as has often been shown, legal investigations are not necessarily a mortal blow in French politics. Other political figures have happily skipped up the French ladder of power unburdened by hefty legal baggage that might have pulled them down in other countries \u2013 not least the former president <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/dec/15/jacques-chirac-guilty-corruption\">Jacques Chirac</a>.</p> <p>Nothing prevents Sarkozy from continuing to run to be his party\u2019s presidential candidate. He is innocent until proven guilty. It is now up to an investigating magistrate to decide whether to put Sarkozy on trial. This decision may or may not come before the right\u2019s primary vote. Any trial is unlikely to happen before the presidential race next spring.

Sarkozy is under investigation for corruption and influence-peddling in a case based on phone-taps about an alleged bid by him to get information from a judge ahead of a legal decision. Sarkozy denies any wrongdoing in all the cases. Some other key investigations against him have been dropped, including allegations he accepted campaign donations from the L\u2019Or\u00e9al shampoo heiress <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://.theguardian.com/world/2012/jul/03/loreal-nicolas-sarkozy-bettencourt\">Liliane Bettencourt</a> when she was too frail to know what she was doing. </p> <p>It\u2019s not clear how much political capital will be made out of Sarkozy\u2019s legal difficulties by his opponents. Alain Jupp\u00e9, the former prime minister and mayor of Bordeaux, who remains favourite to win the right\u2019s nomination, has vowed to avoid the issue and \u201crefrain from making personal attacks\u201d. For good reason. In 2004, he himself <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/feb/04/france.jonhenley\">received a 14-month suspended sentence</a> and was barred from holding elected office for a year over a corrupt 1980s scheme that illegally put workers for Chirac\u2019s political party on the payroll of Paris\u2019s town hall. <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/oct/14/france.jonhenley\">The conviction</a>, however, has not damaged him. It is accepted that he did not profit personally and instead he is seen as having selflessly taken the flak for Chirac.</p> <p>But another opponent, Sarkozy\u2019s former prime minister, Fran\u00e7ois Fillon, shows no sign of letting up. Even before the state prosecutor\u2019s recommendation, he warned in a scathing speech: \u201cThose who don\u2019t respect the laws of the Republic should not be allowed to run. There\u2019s no point in talking about authority when one is not beyond reproach. Who can imagine for a moment General de Gaulle being under criminal investigation?\u201d</p>",

In a passage that was remarkable for a Republican less than eight years after George W Bush left office, Trump condemned democracy promotion overseas. \u201cI believe in a foreign policy based on our national interests that focuses on American security and regional stability instead of using our military to create democracies in countries with no democratic history and couldn\u2019t care less about democracy,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are trying to force democracy down their throats and they don\u2019t even want it.\u201d</p> <p>At a town hall earlier on Tuesday, Trump criticized the US intervention in Libya as part of Nato in 2011. There, he said \u201cthis was a Hillary Clinton deal. We could have had a minor attack.\u201d Trump <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/andrewkaczynski/trump-claims-he-didnt-support-libya-intervention-but-he-did\">supported the intervention</a> at the time.</p> <p>The attack on Clinton\u2019s interventionist foreign policy came the night before Trump will hold a major address on defense policy in Philadelphia. He is expected to call for the end of the sequester and a significant increase in military spending. He is also expected to condemn Clinton\u2019s foreign policy of regime change and democracy promotion.</p> <p>In addition to policy, Trump used much of his speech to give a fervent indictment of the ongoing controversy of Clinton\u2019s emails, which he said was \u201cworse than Watergate\u201d. In his view, \u201cWe can\u2019t have someone in Oval Office who doesn\u2019t know meaning of words \u2018confidential\u2019 or \u2018classified\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>Trump condemned Clinton\u2019s use of the software BleachBit to wipe her servers \u2013 \u201cshe bleached her emails\u201d \u2013 and raised questions about a Clinton aide destroying her discarded phones with a hammer. \u201cWho uses 13 different iPhones in four years?,\u201d Trump asked. \u201cThe only people who use that many phones are usually involved in very, very \u2013 I mean very \u2013 shady activity.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7fe30b402afb42c89ca12c0d47da02a20fd6c948\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7fe30b402afb42c89ca12c0d47da02a20fd6c948/0_17_2837_1703/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Donald Trump gestures to supporters at the campaign rally in Greenville, North Carolina.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Donald Trump gestures to supporters at the campaign rally in Greenville, North Carolina.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mike Segar/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Trump also suggested that something ominous had happened to Bryan Pagliano, the IT worker who maintained Clinton\u2019s server and invoked the fifth amendment in lieu of testifying to Congress on the matter. \u201cHe pleaded the fifth and where is he? We never heard about him again,\u201d Trump said.</p> <p>As Trump summed it up: \u201cIn history there has never been a situation like what\u2019s going on with Justice and Hillary Clinton. There has never been a situation like what\u2019s going with the media and Hillary Clinton.\u201d</p> <p>Trump also continued to compare Clinton to German chancellor Angela Merkel, calling her \u201cAmerica\u2019s Merkel\u201d and saw potential parallels in Merkel\u2019s party losing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/04/mecklenburg-vorpommern-german-anti-immigrant-party-strong-regional-election-exit-polls-merkel\">regional elections in Germany on Sunday</a>. \u201cSee what happened to Angela Merkel? They had a massive defeat recently in the elections.\u201d</p> <p>Trump did outline one new policy detail at the rally. The Republican nominee pledged that, if elected, \u201cI am also going to notify all countries that refuse to take back dangerous illegal immigrants that they will lose access to our visa programs and many more little goodies.\u201d Losing access to US visa program would effectively mean that residents of those countries would not be able to visit the US for any reason.</p> <p>He tied the issue to risk from immigrants committing crimes, in particular Syrian refugees whom he once again called \u201ca Trojan horse\u201d. Unusually, Trump thought about history in expressing his concern about a potential threat from those fleeing the Syrian civil war. \u201cIn 200 years, 400 years, I don\u2019t want people to be reading about it or talking about it,\u201d said Trump.</p> <p>Trump also pledged that he would have the US military submit a plan to defeat Isis within 30 days of taking office. This marked a shift from <a href=\"http://www.mediaite.com/tv/donald-trump-i-know-how-to-defeat-isis-but-im-not-gonna-tell-yet/\">his statement</a> in May 2015, before he formally announced his candidacy, that he already had a plan to defeat Isis but that he wanted to keep it secret because: \u201cI don\u2019t want the enemy to know what I\u2019m doing.\u201d</p> <p>In addition to his speech on defense policy on Wednesday, Trump is also scheduled to address the presidential convention of the Conservative party in New York City and participate in a televised forum with NBC\u2019s Matt Lauer.</p>",

The results are occasionally eyebrow-raising.</p> <p>The Post poll, for example, finds a neck-and-neck race in Texas, the evangelically infused home state of the presidents Bush and global energy interests, where Republicans have reliably won since Richard Nixon (not counting the post-Watergate Jimmy Carter hiccup). The poll has Trump up by only two points in Mississippi, which might be seen as friendly territory for him, and which if it was going to vote for a Democrat might have voted for fellow southerner Bill Clinton, which it <a href=\"http://www.270towin.com/states/Mississippi\">did not</a>. </p> <p>In the northern battleground states of Michigan and Wisconsin, meanwhile, the Post poll reinforces the notion advanced by a number of parallel polls that Clinton may face an unexpected challenge.

The poll found Clinton ahead by only four points in Pennsylvania, where in August she averaged a <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/pa/pennsylvania_trump_vs_clinton-5633.html\">nine-point lead</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/08/state-factboxes/?id=MI\" data-alt=\"Michigan\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/08/state-factboxes/?id=MI\">Michigan</a> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/08/state-factboxes/?id=WI\" data-alt=\"Wisconsin\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/08/state-factboxes/?id=WI\">Wisconsin</a> </figure>  <p>The Post poll indicates, as other polls have, that Trump may fail to make good on his vow to win his home state of New York.

coverage of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-elections-2016\">this US election cycle</a>, we realized that this was already happening: people wanted to know what the situation looked like from outside and inside the US, and they had some real questions about what exactly is going on.</p> <p>And hey, we did too: we asked readers who live outside the US to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/16/us-voters-2016-election-international-perspective\">ask some questions</a> of our American audience. We also asked our American readers to<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/16/what-would-you-ask-us-citizens-about-clinton-trump-and-the-election\"> come up with a list</a> for readers abroad. Hundreds of people submitted. We read all of the responses, then edited them into the list below.</p> <p>The next step is getting some answers. This too will come back to our readers: AKA, you.</p> <p>If you\u2019re a US citizen, answer as many of the questions posed by our international readers as you\u2019d like. If you\u2019re not a US citizen, answer as many of the questions posed by our US citizens as you\u2019d like \u2013 just scroll down to find them.

He was criticized by Arizona senator Jeff Flake, who called his speech \u201cconfusing\u201d and said it was unrealistic to remove the estimated 11 million people living in the US without documents. </p> <p>In the interview, McCain appeared to disagree with that assessment.</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s\u2019 not doable is rounding up 11 million people and putting them across the southern border,\u201d McCain said. \u201cThat\u2019s not doable and, of course, not to mention what it would do in many other aspects.

This arbitrary number was put in place the year after third-party candidate Jesse Ventura won the governorship of Minnesota. Ventura was included in debates when he was at 10% in the polls, and his performance carried him to victory.

President Obama, who views Clinton\u2019s success as key to his legacy, will head to the all-important battleground Pennsylvania where Donald Trump has vowed to wrest the state from Democrats. </p> <p>Michelle Obama, who received widespread praise for a rousing speech at the Democratic National Convention, will campaign in northern Virginia, according to a campaign official.</p> <p>Warren, a progressive who has so far played the role of party unifier, will return to the trail this week to campaign in Philadelphia on Friday, the campaign official said. This appearance follows Bernie Sanders, who proved a tough adversary during the Democratic primary but stumped for Clinton in New Hampshire on Labor Day.</p> <p>The Mothers of the Movement, a group of African American women whose children have died at the hands of law enforcement or as the result of gun violence, will also return to the trail for Clinton at the end of the month.

Notably, a new CNN/Orc poll has Donald Trump a sliver ahead of Hillary Clinton, 45-43, in a four-way race, while NBC News/Survey Monkey\u2019s tracking poll shows the race unchanged, with Clinton ahead of Trump 48-42 in a two-way race and 41-37 in a four-way.</p> <p>What\u2019s the real state of the race? RealClearPolitics\u2019 polling average <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/?state=nwa\">has</a> Clinton up 3.3 points in a two-way race and 2.4 points in a four-way race. Huffpost Pollster\u2019s <a href=\"http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/pollster/2016-general-election-trump-vs-clinton\">average</a> has her up five points in both scenarios.

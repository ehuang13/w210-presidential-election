  "<p>In his excellent analysis of the roots of Trumpism in the American intellectual right, Timothy Shenk (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2016/aug/16/secret-history-trumpism-donald-trump\" title=\"\">The long read</a>, 16 August) says that for a long time the only major study of James Burnham\u2019s book The Managerial Revolution was Samuel Francis\u2019s Power and History. Yet in summer 1946, in a devastating essay, George Orwell demolished Burnham and his ideas. Orwell\u2019s Second Thoughts on James Burnham in Polemic was perhaps the most powerful argument he ever deployed. Orwell shows in his unique style how, in Managerial Revolution and in his second book The Machiavellians: Defenders of Freedom, Burnham had essentially predicted first the victory of fascism and then, after about 1943, the victory of communism. In short, he simply followed what he thought the wave of the future. \u201cThat a man of Burnham\u2019s gifts,\u201d Orwell concludes, \u201cshould have been able to think Nazism something rather admirable shows what damage is done by the cultivation of what is now called realism.\u201d I first read that essay as&#xa0;a student in the 1950s. It appeared in Orwell\u2019s collected works and Burnham never really recovered from it.<br><strong>Patrick Renshaw</strong><br><em>Sheffield</em></p> <p>\u2022 Perhaps the dean of Harvard Medical School is right to say that Donald Trump \u201cdefines\u201d narcissistic personality disorder, a disorder which might be associated with many politicians, past, present, and future.

As George F&#xa0;Will meticulously <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/how-to-cool-down-donald-trump/2016/02/26/14571f9e-dbeb-11e5-891a-4ed04f4213e8_story.html?utm_term=.434e0e5b7f06\" title=\"\">set out</a>, Trump had a predecessor in Louisiana Senator Huey Long \u201cwho as governor had made Louisiana into America\u2019s approximation of a police state\u201d and who, as Franklin Roosevelt reflected during the 1932 presidential election campaign, \u201cscreams at people and they love it.\u201d Long was a Democrat demagogue who, at the height of his fame, received 60,000 letters a week and attracted 25 million regular radio listeners, which could be multiplied many times in today\u2019s multi-media world. Long was shot down in the Lousiana Capitol on 8 September 1935, and died two days later. Had he lived, he&#xa0;would almost certainly have put himself forward against Roosevelt as a&#xa0;presidential nominee in 1936. Of course, examples from the past cannot necessarily be translated into the present, but whether Trump will seem un-American to all Americans eligible to vote in November remains to be seen. \u201cEvery man a king!\u201d was Long\u2019s best known slogan.

  "<p>The scene was Ostroh, western Ukraine, on the eve of parliamentary elections.</p> <p>A tall figure bounded on to a stage to cheers from a crowd of elderly flag-waving supporters. They chanted: \u201cYan-u-kov-ych, Yan-u-kov-ych.\u201d</p> <p>The man addressing them was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/viktor-yanukovych\">Viktor Yanukovych</a>, who at this point \u2013 autumn 2007 \u2013 was Ukraine\u2019s pro-Russian prime minister.

On Monday, Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign leapt on <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/15/us/politics/paul-manafort-ukraine-donald-trump.html?_r=0\">a report in the New York Times</a> that handwritten ledgers found in the Ukraine show $12.7m in undisclosed payments to Manafort from the Party of Regions.</p> <p>\u201cThis is a serious matter and there are real concerns about the pro-Kremlin interests engaged with the Trump team,\u201d said Clinton\u2019s campaign manager, Robby Mook.</p> <p>Manafort has denied any wrongdoing. A source who worked with him in Ukraine said on Tuesday: \u201cIf there was cash I would have known about it and seen it. I was going in and out of the Party of Regions HQ every day.\u201d </p> <p>Even before the latest allegations, Trump\u2019s links to Russia have raised eyebrows: Manafort\u2019s candidate has expressed admiration for Putin, encouraged Russia to hack Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails, and appeared unaware that Russian troops had seized the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea. <br></p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>If he can make Yanukovych president, I\u2019m sure he can do it with Trump</p> <footer> <cite>Oleg Voloshin</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Meanwhile, the Trump campaign was reportedly instrumental in rewriting the new Republican platform to remove calls for the donation of weapons to Ukraine to fight Russian and rebel forces.</p> <p>It remains unclear how much of this was down to Manafort. What is indisputable is that at the same time as he was advising Yanukovych, Manafort was also building personal business links with some of the most powerful figures in the post-Soviet world.<br></p> <p>Before his arrival in Kiev, Manafort had long <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/apr/27/paul-manafort-donald-trump-campaign-past-clients\">specialised in taking on unsavoury clients</a>, such as Ferdinand Marcos, the Filipino dictator, and Mobutu Sese Seko of Zaire, and subtly retooling their public reputations. <br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"574ff8bb5ff116f5c7507095fc82041c94c1b5df\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/574ff8bb5ff116f5c7507095fc82041c94c1b5df/0_84_4199_2520/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Trump\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Donald Trump has expressed admiration for Putin and encouraged Russia to hack Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jeff Swensen/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He was recruited to work in Ukraine in the summer of 2005 by the oligarch Rinat Akhmetov \u2013 the main financial backer of Yanukovych\u2019s Party of Regions. </p> <p>That autumn, Manafort and his team \u2013 including longtime aide Rick Gates, another future Trump hire \u2013 began work for the Party of Regions. They rented an anonymous office at number 4 Sophia Street in Kiev, opposite the stop for the 16 and 18 trolley buses. Typically, its white blinds were drawn.</p> <p>The Americans kept a low profile, but Manafort\u2019s efforts didn\u2019t go entirely unnoticed. In a 2006 cable to the state department in Washington, US diplomats reported that the Party of Regions had undergone a mysterious transformation. \u201cLong a haven for Donetsk-based mobsters and oligarchs it is in the midst of an \u2018extreme makeover\u2019,\u201d they observed.</p> <p>The party had enlisted \u201chelp and advice from veteran K street political tacticians\u201d, the diplomats said, referring to Washington DC\u2019s lobbying district. Manafort\u2019s firm \u2013 Davis, Manafort &amp; Freedman \u2013 was busy \u201cnipping and tucking\u201d. Its goal was to rid the party of its gangster image and to change it into a \u201clegitimate political force\u201d.</p> <p>I met Manafort in September 2007, on the eve of the Ostroh rally. This was just before the parliamentary elections, and Yanukovych was frantically touring the regions on a campaign helicopter. </p> <p>Close up, Manafort looked every inch the classic Washington lobbyist. He wore an expensive suit and tie and exuded seriousness. He also bore a faint physical resemblance to his client \u2013 even their hairstyles were similar. (Manafort, I was told later, had instructed Yanukovych to blow-dry his hair. Manafort\u2019s camp denies this.)</p> <p>The American had an interesting story to tell \u2013 one which may sound familiar to observers of Donald Trump\u2019s campaign \u2013 of how his candidate had been almost wilfully misunderstood by the west, especially by its media.<br></p> <p>The new Yanukovych was nothing like the old one, Manafort suggested. He had absorbed the lessons of his previous defeats, was studying English \u2013 and was even playing tennis with the US ambassador.</p> <p>\u201cPeople are still looking at the political system in this country through the prism of 2004,\u201d Manafort told me. \u201cThat\u2019s not at all the situation here.\u201d <br></p> <p>Yanukovych was no puppet of Putin, Manafort said; he wanted a pragmatic foreign policy \u2013 good relations with Russia and the EU. </p> <p>\u201cAs a person, he [Yanukovych] is growing,\u201d Manafort assured me. \u201cI think the time out of power helped him.\u201d</p> <p>Manafort introduced professional techniques. He gathered polling data, worked on messaging and distributed talking points. His efforts were at least partially successful: Yanukovych\u2019s Party of Regions won the 2007 parliamentary elections, and in 2010 Yanukovych beat his rival Yulia Tymoshenko in a presidential runoff. Within a few months, it had become clear that he was hellbent on reversing the modest democratic gains of the Orange Revolution. </p> <p>Yanukovych moved quickly to consolidate all instruments of power: the courts, parliament, the prosecutor\u2019s office, <a href=\"https://www.opendemocracy.net/od-russia/sergii-leshchenko/two-worlds-of-viktor-yanukovych%E2%80%99s-ukraine\">the media and TV</a>. Tymoshenko was charged with corruption and jailed; Yankovych repeatedly shrugged off western calls for her release. </p> <p>In late 2013, Yanukovych was due to sign an association agreement with the European Union, but at the last minute he dumped the plan and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/dec/17/ukraine-russia-leaders-talks-kremlin-loan-deal\">instead accepted a $15bn Kremlin bailout</a>. </p> <p>Pro-EU demonstrators flooded the Maidan, Kiev\u2019s main square, and protests turned violent after a brutal crackdown by security forces.</p> <p>In February 2014, riot police shot dead 100 people in downtown Kiev. Yanukovych abandoned his palace on the outskirts of town, <a href=\"https://www.opendemocracy.net/od-russia/serhij-leschenko/yanukovych-luxury-residence-and-money-trail-that-leads-to-london\">Mezhyhirya</a> \u2013 a Versailles of sorts with a pirate-themed restaurant and private zoo \u2013 and escaped to Russia. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3d96d39038f41cbb24a9ca8038b0b742af18a045\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3d96d39038f41cbb24a9ca8038b0b742af18a045/0_50_2400_1440/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Viktor Yanukovych, then president of Ukraine, in 2014.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Viktor Yanukovych, then president of Ukraine, in 2014.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Itar-Tass/ Barcroft Media</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Putin exploited this crisis to seize Crimea and launch a covert military invasion of eastern Ukraine.

Earlier this month, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/10/russia-accuses-ukraine-of-armed-crimea-incursion\">Russia claimed Ukrainian agents had attacked Crimea</a>, further fueling tensions in the region.<br></p> <p>Those who worked with Manafort say that he cannot be blamed for the Ukrainian disaster. Oleg Voloshin, a former aide to Kostyantyn Gryshchenko, Yanukovych\u2019s 2010-12 foreign minister who now works as a political consultant, says Manafort urged Yanukovych to press ahead with the EU integration agenda.</p> <p>Voloshin still has ties with the ex-Party of Regions, which Manafort rebranded in 2014 as the Opposition Bloc. (Manafort\u2019s consultancy in Ukraine continued until at least parliamentary elections in 2014.)</p> <p>He suggests that Yanukovych \u201clistened to what Paul said\u201d between 2007-2010, but then, once he became president, stopped listening \u2013 with catastrophic results.</p> <p>Manafort\u2019s advice was always non-ideological, Voloshin recalls. He would calmly explain: \u201cThese people won\u2019t vote for you, don\u2019t bother with them,\u201d and then suggest he \u201cpromote this message, promote that message\u201d. \u201cIt was a very American approach. Do this, do that.\u201d And, crucially: \u201cHe was the person dragging Yanukovych to the west.\u201d<br></p> <p>According to Voloshin, Manafort was an advocate of US interests and promoted American oil companies such as Chevron \u2013 so much so that the joke inside the Party of Regions was that Manafort was actually from the CIA. \u201cYou can blame him for whatever. The only thing you can\u2019t blame him for is lack of will in lobbying for American interests in Ukraine in the commercial sphere.\u201d</p> <p>Voloshin insists that it was Manafort who persuaded Yanukovych to press ahead with the EU integration agenda, arguing that it would counter Yanukovych\u2019s sagging ratings. Manafort also strongly objected to Tymoshenko\u2019s imprisonment, telling Yanukovych bluntly: \u201cYou are going to have very bad times with the west.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not Paul\u2019s fault that Yanukovych didn\u2019t listen to him. If it weren\u2019t for Paul, Ukraine would have gone under Russia much earlier,\u201d Voloshin claims. </p> <p>During the period that he was advising Yanukovych, Manafort\u2019s interests in the post-Soviet world were not restricted to politics.<br></p> <p>In 2007, he set up a private equity firm called Pericles Emerging Partners LP.<br></p> <p>Based offshore in the Caymans, the firm had three American partners \u2013 Manafort, Rick Gates and Rick Davis. Davis had cofounded Davis Manafort, Manfort\u2019s lobbying company in Delaware. The new firm\u2019s aim was to make investments in the Ukrainian cities of Kiev, Odessa and Mariupol. It would acquire small companies, consolidate them into larger national enterprises, then sell them on.</p> <p>One of those tempted by this prospectus was the Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska, an aluminum baron and close friend of Putin, who stumped up almost $19m. Gates, Manafort\u2019s right-hand man, sealed the agreement in trips to Moscow.</p> <p>What happened next was strange indeed. Only one investment by Pericles was ever made, in a Ukrainian telecoms company called Black Sea Cable. According to court documents, <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2016-07-20/trump-s-manager-is-a-master-of-post-soviet-business\">the cash was funnelled into various offshore companies</a>, including one called CardMan ImpEx Corp, registered in the tax haven of the British Virgin Islands. The trail wound through other opaque shell firms, including Cascado AG, set up by the Panamanian law firm Mossack Fonseca.</p> <p>A search of the Panama Papers leak gives a few details. Cascado has two Latvian directors, <a href=\"https://www.icij.org/offshore/faux-corporate-directors-stand-fraudsters-despots-and-spies\">Erik Vanagels and Stan Gorin</a>. In reality, they are mere nominees. The pair have been <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2016-07-20/trump-s-manager-is-a-master-of-post-soviet-business\">linked on paper to a network of offshore companies and multimillion-dollar scams involving Ukrainian state assets</a>.<br></p> <p>When the global financial crisis hit in 2008, Deripaska wanted out \u2013 and his cash back. In 2011, the Americans emailed to say that it was proving tricky to sell Deripaska\u2019s stake because of \u201cmarket conditions\u201d. Further emails went unanswered.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6888bef114164dde81ae3754fac68b6d909db459\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6888bef114164dde81ae3754fac68b6d909db459/0_98_3469_2082/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Yulia Tymoshenko\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The former Ukrainian prime minister Yulia Tymoshenko alleged that Manafort \u2018played a key role in [a] conspiracy and racketeering enterprise\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Genya Savilov/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cIt appears that Paul Manafort and Rick Gates have <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/in-business-as-in-politics-trump-adviser-no-stranger-to-controversial-figures/2016/04/26/970db232-08c7-11e6-b283-e79d81c63c1b_story.html\">simply disappeared</a>,\u201d <a href=\"https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/2814130/Pericles-Winding-Up-Petition.pdf\">Deripaska\u2019s frustrated lawyers wrote</a>, in a 2014 petition to have Manafort\u2019s firm wound up.</p> <p>It\u2019s unclear if Deripaska ever got his money. Either way, the episode illustrates Manafort\u2019s personal links to figures close to Putin. </p> <p>Later, Manafort introduced Deripaska to Senator John McCain, when the oligarch was having problems travelling to the US. (In 2006, the US had revoked Deripaska\u2019s visa, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/31/oleg-deripaska-us-visa-rusal\">citing alleged \u201ccriminal associations\u201d</a>. Deripaska denies the allegation, and his visa was subsequently reinstated.)</p> <p>This wasn\u2019t the only embarrassing legal scrape arising from Manafort\u2019s capitalist adventures. In November 2011, Tymoshenko unsuccessfully sued him and several of her political opponents in the district court in New York. <a href=\"http://freebeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/manafort-complaint-2.pdf\">Her lengthy writ</a> alleged that Manafort \u201cplayed a key role in [a] conspiracy and racketeering enterprise\u201d to launder cash for Yanukovych\u2019s oligarch friends and invest it in New York real estate.</p> <p>In particular, she pointed the finger at Dmitry Firtash, a Ukrainian businessman whose generous contributions helped Yanukovych. Firtash is a shareholder and public face for RosUkrEnergo, an intermediary company co-owned by Gazprom, which imports gas from Russia and resells it to Ukraine. Tymoshenko tried unsuccessfully to get rid of it. </p> <p>The RusUkrEnergo scheme was a mechanism for corruption, she alleged in legal filings. Its real owner, she claimed, was Semyon Mogilevich, a Ukrainian-Russian mobster, and one of the FBI\u2019s top fugitives. Firtash denies this.</p> <p>According to her writ, Firtash and his companies and associates were able to skim billions of dollars from gas transactions. The cash was laundered \u201cthrough a labyrinth of shell companies\u201d. It was then returned to Ukraine, with the money used to bribe Ukrainian officials. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Manafort sells the unsellable product.

The US is appealing, and Firtash remains in Austria.</p> <p>Firtash did invest money in Manafort\u2019s real estate projects, however. The two met in 2008. Manafort\u2019s plan was to buy the site of the demolished Drake Hotel in Manhattan and to redevelop it at a cost of almost $900m. <a href=\"http://freebeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/manafort-complaint-2.pdf\">Firtash transferred at least $25m to the project</a>. Tymoshenko alleged that the plan was never serious, with the cash merely transferred for the purposes of money laundering.<br></p> <p>\u201cGroup DF and Firtash never had any intention to purchase the Drake property, but instead used the real estate project as a vehicle for investing $25 million in New York bank accounts,\u201d her writ stated.</p> <p>Manafort did not respond to a request by the Guardian for comment on Deripaska\u2019s loan or the Drake Hotel allegations.</p> <p>In the run-up to November\u2019s vote, Trump\u2019s own real estate transactions <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/06/us/politics/donald-trump-soho-settlement.html?_r=1\">have been extensively investigated,</a> but it remains unclear if any Russian cash has actually been leveraged in these deals. </p> <p>In a statement on Monday, Manafort denied that he had received any irregular payments in Ukraine. \u201cThe simplest answer is the truth: I am a campaign professional.

We all welcome this, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p> <p>These are the only comments Putin has made on Trump, but nevertheless, Trump\u2019s potential Russia links have become <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/30/donald-trump-paul-manafort-ukraine-russia-putin-ties\">one of the biggest stories of the election campaign</a>, as the media investigates everything from his dubious business links in Russia, to his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/apr/27/paul-manafort-donald-trump-campaign-past-clients\">campaign manager\u2019s links</a> to Russian and Ukrainian cashflows, to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/07/carter-page-donald-trump-foreign-policy-advisor-russia\">Gazprom links and Kremlin-friendly ideology</a> of one of his campaign advisers. </p> <p>Some have even gone as far as to insinuate that Trump could be a Russian agent, sent to implement the Kremlin\u2019s nefarious plans.</p> <p>So, is Putin hatching a cunning plan to put Trump in the White House? The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/31/clinton-blaming-russia-emails-dnc-hack\">apparent hacking</a> of Democratic party emails by Russian hackers might suggest so. There certainly has been what appears to be coordinated chatter among pro-Kremlin Twitter accounts, ranging from low-level spammers to Alexey Pushkov, one of Russia\u2019s top foreign policy officials, who has been surprisingly forthright about his admiration for Trump.</p> <p>But Kremlin watchers say the picture may be more nuanced. In Moscow, there is sniggering at the idea of Trump as a Manchurian candidate.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s been amazing to see that hysteria and paranoia about external interference is not just a Russian thing,\u201d said Gleb Pavlovsky, a political analyst who advised the Kremlin until 2011. <br></p> <p>A source close to the Kremlin said: \u201cI think Putin has conflicted feelings about Trump ... Of course, he says nice things about Russia. But Hillary is more predictable. With Trump, who knows what would happen?\u201d <br></p> <p>The potential appeal of Trump is his willingness to dismiss \u201cpolitical correctness\u201d, and work outside the rules. While Trump\u2019s fiery rhetoric has alarmed many world leaders, Pushkov has hailed it as \u201ccommon sense\u201d. Putin believes all world leaders are cynical, merely cloaking their cynicism with high-minded rhetoric about democracy and human rights \u2013 and at least Trump does not attempt to hide his contempt for convention and willingness to flout established norms.</p> <p>\u201cI think Putin probably likes Trump from an aesthetic point of view,\u201d said Valery Garbuzov, director of the Institute for US and Canadian Studies, a government-linked thinktank set up in 1967 to give the Soviet leadership analysis and advice on how to deal with the US. \u201cBut he should be aware that the reality could be very different.\u201d<br></p> <p>Putin\u2019s attitude toward Trump is bound up in his thoughts about US power in general, as well as a personal dislike for Trump\u2019s rival, Hillary Clinton.</p> <p>Putin came to power in 2000 determined to restore Russia\u2019s position as a \u201cfirst-tier nation\u201d and have its voice respected in the international arena. During the 1990s, a weak, ailing Russia had been unable to influence events internationally. </p> <p>In 1998, when Bill Clinton called Boris Yeltsin to tell him the US was considering airstrikes on Serbia, Yeltsin was furious, recounted Clinton\u2019s Russia advisor Strobe Talbott in his memoirs. He screamed \u201c<em>Nelzya</em>!\u201d \u2013 a strong Russian imperative which means something like \u201cit is impermissible!\u201d \u2013 several times down the phone at the US president and then hung up. The airstrikes went ahead, of course.<br></p> <p>Putin was determined that under his presidency, Russia\u2019s objections were going to be taken into account. </p> <p>Years later, when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/22/ukraine-european-union-trade-russia\">his officials said</a> Ukraine turning towards the west and signing a trade agreement with the EU was also <em>Nelzya</em>, Putin was willing to do what Yeltsin could not: back his words up with brute force. After pro-European protests led former Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovych to flee, Putin moved to annex Crimea. </p> <p>During the early part of his rule, though, he thought he could attain this seat at the table by becoming friends with the Americans.<br></p> <p>\u201cHe started off thinking we could work with them \u2013 we just needed them to understand Russia better. He genuinely believed that one day Russia might even join Nato; it didn\u2019t seem ridiculous then,\u201d said the source close to the Kremlin.</p> <p>There were a number of episodes that changed Putin\u2019s mind about American intentions. First came his belief that the US was funding Chechen fighters through American embassies in the South Caucasus. Then came <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/dec/10/ukraine.jamesmeek\">the 2004 Orange Revolution in Ukraine</a>, which Putin believed was directed by US operatives. As the years went by, Putin became more convinced that the US was an enemy, and that it had designs of regime change in the Kremlin.<br></p> <p>\u201cHe has certain assumptions about American power that are locked in, and we struggled mightily trying to convince him that that\u2019s not what we do,\u201d said Michael McFaul, formerly US ambassador to Russia. Putin assigned the Americans all kinds of agency in Russia and genuinely believed the ultimate policy to be regime change, McFaul recalled. </p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019d accuse us of things, and Obama would say to him: \u2018We\u2019re not doing that,\u2019 and he\u2019d look Obama in the eye and say \u2018Yes, you are. We know.\u2019 I was never sure if he really believed this stuff or not, but I came to the conclusion he did.\u201d</p> <p>Pavlosky said Putin has become bored with the day-to-day decision-making involved in running the country, and is much more interested in foreign policy. \u201cForeign policy has also become very personal now. He sees himself as the personification of the country. He genuinely thinks the US is trying to overthrow him,\u201d he said.<br></p> <p>Putin has made this claim explicitly on occasion. When mass protests broke out in Russia over falsified elections in 2011, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/dec/08/vladimir-putin-hillary-clinton-russia\">he claimed the Russian protesters were acting according to a signal</a> from the US state department, then run by Hillary Clinton.<br></p> <p>\u201c[Opposition leaders] heard the signal and, with the support of the US state department, began active work,\u201d Putin said at the time. \u201cWe are all grownups here. We all understand the organisers are acting according to a well-known scenario and in their own mercenary political interests.\u201d</p> <p>It was not the first time Putin had tough words for Clinton. During her 2008 campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination, Clinton said Putin \u201cdoesn\u2019t have a soul\u201d, referencing George W Bush\u2019s claim that he looked into Putin\u2019s eyes and \u201cgot a sense of his soul\u201d. </p> <p>Putin shot back: \u201cAs a minimum, a head of state should have a head.\u201d</p> <p>Those who know Putin say he is unlikely to forget the spat.</p> <p>\u201cIn the US, politics is like a sport: you say all kinds of horrible things and then you\u2019re friends again, like Obama and Clinton in 2008,\u201d said the source close to the Kremlin. \u201cIn Russia it\u2019s not like that; there\u2019s no culture of throwing insults around and then making up. Putin is a pragmatist. He will work with whomever he needs to. But of course, he will remember forever the things Hillary said.\u201d</p> <p>Whether or not Putin is rooting for a Trump presidency, some doubt that having the controversial tycoon in the White House would really be good for Russia.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s an incredibly simplistic view; it\u2019s the view of propagandists, not analysts,\u201d said Garbuzov. Analysts from his institute sit on various advisory boards to the foreign and defence ministries, but Garbuzov admits he does not know how much weight their more nuanced views on the US hold. </p> <p>\u201cWe can\u2019t exclude that if Hillary wins, Russia and the US could end up having productive dialogue in a number of areas, and likewise if Trump wins, there could be total chaos. It\u2019s clear that she\u2019s anti-Russian, but she is an experienced politician who understands the world. He has no experience at all of politics; he\u2019s a demagogue and a populist.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>The Republican party, its leaders like to say, is a party of ideas. Debates over budgets and government programmes are important, but they must be conducted with an eye on the bigger questions \u2013 questions about the character of the state, the future of freedom and the meaning of virtue. These beliefs provide the foundation for a conservative intellectual establishment \u2013 thinktanks such as the American Enterprise Institute, magazines such as National Review, pundits such as George Will and Bill Kristol \u2013 dedicated to advancing the right\u2019s agenda.</p> <p>Over the last year, that establishment has been united by one thing: opposition to Donald Trump. Republican voters may have succumbed to a temporary bout of collective insanity \u2013 or so Trump\u2019s critics on the right believe \u2013 but the party\u2019s intelligentsia remain certain that entrusting the Republican nomination to a reality television star turned populist demagogue has been a disaster for their cause and their country. Whatever Trump might be, he is not a conservative.</p> <p>That belief is comforting, but it is wrong. Trump is a unique character, but the principles he defends and the passions he inflames have been part of the modern American right since its formation in the aftermath of the second world war. Most conservative thinkers have forgotten or repressed this part of their history, which is why they are undergoing a collective nervous breakdown today. Like addicts the morning after a bender, they are baffled at the face they see in the mirror.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/16/the-past-present-and-future-of-trumpism\">The past, present and future of Trumpism | Letters</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But not all of the right\u2019s intellectuals have been so blind. While keepers of the conservative flame in Washington and New York repeatedly proclaimed that Trump could never win the Republican nomination, in February a small group of anonymous writers from inside the conservative movement launched a blog that championed \u201cTrumpism\u201d \u2013 and attacked their former allies on the right, who were determined to halt its ascent.

Posts analysing the campaign with titles such as The Twilight of Jeb! alternated with more ambitious forays in philosophy such as Paleo-Straussianism, Part I: Metaphysics and Epistemology. More intellectually demanding than the typical National Review article, the style of their prose also suggested writers who were having fun. Disquisitions on Aristotle could be followed by an emoji mocking the latest outraged responses to Trump.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2016/sep/02/the-dark-history-of-donald-trumps-rightwing-revolt-podcast\">The dark history of Donald Trump's rightwing revolt \u2013 podcast</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The authors at JAG were not all backing Trump himself \u2013 officially, they were \u201celectorally agnostic\u201d \u2013 but they were united by their enthusiasm for Trumpism (as they put it, \u201cfor what Trumpism could become if thought through with wisdom and moderation\u201d). They dismissed commentators who attributed Trump\u2019s victory to his celebrity, arguing that a campaign could not resonate with so many voters unless it spoke to genuine public concerns.</p> <p>JAG condensed Trumpism into three key elements: economic nationalism, controlled borders and a foreign policy that put American interests first.</p> <p>These policies, they asserted, were a direct challenge to the views of America\u2019s new ruling class \u2013 a cosmopolitan elite of wealthy professionals who controlled the commanding heights of public discourse. This new ruling class of \u201ctransnational post-Americans\u201d was united by its belief that the welfare of the world just happened to coincide with programmes that catered to its own self-interest: free trade, open borders, globalisation and a suite of other policies designed to ease the transition to a post-national future overseen by enlightened experts. In the language of JAG, they are the \u201cDavoisie\u201d, a global elite that is most at ease among its international peers at the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jan/21/-sp-davos-guide-world-economic-forum\">World Economic Forum</a> in Davos and totally out of touch with ordinary Americans.</p> <p>Mainstream conservatives and their liberal counterparts were equally complicit in sustaining this regime, but JAG focused its attention on the right. Leading Republican politicians and the journalists who fawned over them in the rightwing press were pedlars of an \u201cintellectually bankrupt\u201d doctrine whose obsessions \u2013 cutting taxes, policing sexual norms, slashing government regulation \u2013 distracted from \u201cthe fundamental question\u201d Trump had put on the agenda: \u201cdestruction of the soulless managerial class\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>A dissenting minority has been waging a guerrilla war against the conservative establishment for three decades</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>JAG unleashed salvo after salvo against \u201cConservatism Inc\u201d, the network of journals and thinktanks that, along with talk radio and Fox News, has made defending the party of ideas into a lucrative career path. \u201cIf Trump ends up destroying the Republican party,\u201d they wrote, \u201cit is because the Republican party, as it exists today, is little more than a jobs programme for failed academics and journalists.\u201d</p> <p>News of JAG began circulating on the right shortly after its debut early in the primary season. \u201cThe first time I heard someone refer to it, I thought it was a joke,\u201d says former George W Bush speechwriter David Frum. But it quickly found an audience. \u201cThey got a huge response almost immediately,\u201d says conservative activist Chris Buskirk, who recalled excited emails and frantic texting among his colleagues. In June, the Wall Street Journal columnist and former Ronald Reagan speechwriter Peggy Noonan alerted her readers to the \u201csophisticated, rather brilliant and anonymous website\u201d. A link from the popular rightwing website Breitbart News drove traffic even higher, and JAG seemed poised to shape the discussion over the future of conservatism.</p> <p>Then it disappeared. Months of posts, totalling more than 175,000 words, were scrubbed from the internet, replaced by <a href=\"http://journalofamericangreatness.blogspot.co.uk/\">a note labelling the site an \u201cinside joke\u201d </a>that had spiralled out of control. Within the right, rumours swirled about the real motives behind the vanishing act; fans of JAG took its self-immolation as further evidence that the conservative establishment would not tolerate any dissent. But the brief life of the Journal of American Greatness did more than provide grist for feverish speculation on Twitter. Patrolling the boundaries of acceptable thought on the right has always been one of the central duties of the conservative intellectual, and JAG\u2019s voluntary purging was the latest chapter in a long battle to define the meaning of conservatism.</p> <p>Conservatives tend to portray their cause as the child of a revolt against the liberal status quo that began in the aftermath of the second world war, gained momentum in the 1950s when a cohort of intellectuals supplied the right with its philosophical underpinning, attained political consciousness in Barry Goldwater\u2019s 1964 presidential campaign, and won vindication with Ronald Reagan\u2019s election to the White House. Ideas have consequences, they proclaimed. Just look at us.</p> <p>But there is another way of interpreting the history of the American right, one that puts less emphasis on the power of ideas and more on power itself \u2013 a history of white voters fighting to defend their place in the social hierarchy, politicians appealing to the prejudices of their constituents so they can satisfy the wishes of their donors, and the industry that has turned conservatism into a billion-dollar business.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"ae7d7b44419c18020b88dc87a97c874e7ed3802a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ae7d7b44419c18020b88dc87a97c874e7ed3802a/0_168_5100_3060/1000.jpg\" alt=\"White segregationist demonstrators protesting at the admission of the Little Rock Nine, to Central High School, 1959\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">White segregationist demonstrators protesting in Little Rock, Arkansas, in 1959.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Universal History Archive/UIG via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This is the explanation preferred by leftwing critics, who typically regard the Republican party as a coalition fuelled by white nationalism and funded by billionaires. But this line of attack also has a long history on the right, where a dissenting minority has been waging a guerrilla war against the conservative establishment for three decades. Now the unlikely figure of Donald Trump has brought in a wave of reinforcements \u2013 over 13 million in the primaries alone. Their target is the managerial elite, and their history begins in the run-up to the second world war, when a forgotten founder of modern American conservatism became a public sensation with a book that announced the dawning of a civilisation ruled by experts.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>The Managerial Revolution: What Is Happening in the World was the most unlikely bestseller of 1941. The author, James Burnham, was a philosophy professor at New York University who until the previous year had been one of Leon Trotsky\u2019s most trusted counsellors in the US. Time called Burnham\u2019s work a grim outline of \u201cthe totalitarian world soon to come\u201d that was \u201cas morbidly fascinating as a textbook vivisection\u201d.</p> <p>The son of a wealthy railway executive, Burnham graduated near the top of his class in Princeton in 1927 before studying at Oxford and then securing his post at NYU. But the Great Depression radicalised him, and he began a double life, lecturing on Aquinas by day and polemicising against capital by night. By 1940, Burnham had lost his faith in the revolution of the proletariat. While Trotsky denounced his erstwhile disciple as an \u201ceducated witch doctor\u201d, Burnham started work on the book that would justify his apostasy.</p> <p>According to Burnham, Marxists were right to anticipate capitalism\u2019s imminent demise but wrong about what would come next. Around the turn of the 20th century, he claimed, the scale of life had changed. Population growth surged, immense corporations gobbled up smaller rivals, and government officials struggled to expand their powers to match the growing size of the challenges they faced.</p> <p>These structural changes fundamentally altered the distribution of power in society. In the 18th century, authority had rested with aristocrats; in the 19th century with capitalists; in the 20th century it had passed on to the managers, whose authority derived from their unique ability to operate the complex institutions that now dominated mass society.</p> <p>Technocrats had become the new ruling class. According to Burnham, fascism, Stalinism and Franklin D Roosevelt\u2019s New Deal were all products of this transformation, and there was no use struggling against the world that was coming into being \u2013 a world where state ownership of the means of production had become the norm, where sovereignty had shifted to a bureaucratic elite, and where the globe was divided into rival superstates.</p> <p>Burnham was not the first to foresee a society run by managers, but the arguments he borrowed from others took on a different meaning when brought together in this form. His sweep was global, his narrative reached back centuries, and he almost seemed to welcome a totalitarian future. For Burnham, the only sensible response to the managerial revolution was to recognise that it had occurred and accept there was no point in trying to bring back a world that was already lost. This bleak forecast captured the public imagination. Fortune called it \u201cthe most debated book published so far this year\u201d and it went on to sell more than 200,000 copies.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"aa3e0ba00d4ccf09fa0677b95894a780e68dac59\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/aa3e0ba00d4ccf09fa0677b95894a780e68dac59/0_115_1992_1195/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Richard C Levin with William F Buckley Jr, Yale University, 2000\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">William F Buckley Jr collects an honorary doctorate from Yale University, 2000.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bob Child/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But Burnham quickly moved on to new territory. His true subject, he concluded, was power, and to understand power he needed a theory of politics. Marx had been his guiding influence in The Managerial Revolution; now he turned to Machiavelli, constructing the genealogy of a political theory that began with the author of The Prince and continued into the present.</p> <p>For a Machiavellian, Burnham wrote, politics was an unending war for dominance: democracy was a myth, and all ideologies were thinly veiled rationalisations for self-interest. The great mass of humanity, in Burnham\u2019s dark vision, would never have any control over their own lives. They could only hope that clashes between rival elites might weaken the power of the ruling class and open up small spaces of freedom.</p> <p>Burnham\u2019s newfound zeal for defending freedom led him, in 1955, to a conservative magazine called National Review, and to the magazine\u2019s charismatic young founder, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/27/business/media/27cnd-buckley.html?_r=0\">William F Buckley Jr</a>. Buckley\u2019s goal was to turn a scattered collection of reactionaries into the seeds of a movement. His journal set out to make the right intellectually respectable, stripping it of the associations with kooks and cranks that allowed liberals to depict it as a politics for cave-dwellers who had not reconciled themselves to modernity. Burnham was there at the start, one of five senior editors on the masthead of the first issue.</p> <p>Soon Burnham was Buckley\u2019s ranking deputy. But in an editorial staff riven by abstract debates between ardent libertarians and devout Christians, Burnham was the pragmatist who urged his colleagues not to ask politicians for more than the electorate would accept. For the right to win over working-class voters, Burnham argued, the movement had to embrace a more populist economic policy \u2013 contrary to the wishes of his anti-statist colleagues and their corporate backers, who wanted to lower taxes on the rich and roll back the welfare state. \u201cMuch of conservative doctrine,\u201d Burnham wrote in 1972, \u201cis, if not quite bankrupt, more and more obviously obsolescent.\u201d Less than a decade later, Ronald Reagan was president, and it was Burnham who seemed like a relic of the past.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>For a long time, the only major study of Burnham\u2019s work was a slim volume published in 1984 by a minor academic press under the title Power and History. The book\u2019s author, Samuel Francis, seemed a typical product of the insurgent conservative movement Burnham had helped to create \u2013 though by the late 1990s, when Francis published an updated version of Power and History, it made more sense to speak of a new conservative establishment. Outsiders who arrived at the White House with Reagan had become senior executives in Conservatism Inc. With the end of the cold war, the right had lost the glue that had bound its coalition, but there were still battles to be waged, and the money was better than ever.</p> <p>Francis was never going to become a star in the emerging rightwing infotainment complex. Shy and overweight, with teeth stained from smoking, he had difficulty making it through cocktail parties. After completing a PhD in British history at the University of North Carolina, Francis left academia for Washington \u2013 first working at a rightwing thinktank, then serving as an aide to a Republican senator, and finally joining the editorial staff of the capital\u2019s influential conservative daily newspaper, the Washington Times.</p> <p>Francis retained his academic interests while he ascended into the ranks of the conservative establishment. He published six books in his lifetime, but he worked in private on one massive volume that he hoped would bring together all the disparate strands of his thought. Finished in 1995 but not discovered until after his death a decade later, the result was published earlier this year under the title Leviathan and Its Enemies. It is a sprawling text, more than 700 pages long, digressive, repetitive and in desperate need of an editor.</p> <p>It is also one of the most impressive books to come out of the American right in a generation \u2013 and the most frightening. It is a searching diagnosis of managerial society, written by an author looking for a strategy that could break it apart.</p> <p>Like much of Francis\u2019s writing, Leviathan and Its Enemies began with Burnham \u2013 in this case, quite literally. \u201cThis book,\u201d Francis announced in the first sentence, \u201cis an effort to revise and reformulate the theory of the managerial revolution as advanced by James Burnham in 1941.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Paleoconservatives depicted themselves as spokesmen for the forgotten residents of flyover country</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Francis agreed that society had been taken over by managers, but he believed the new ruling class was far more vulnerable than Burnham had realised. Not everyone had benefited from the rise of the experts \u2013 and Francis saw this unequal distribution of rewards as the managerial regime\u2019s greatest weakness.</p> <p>For reasons he never quite explained, he insisted that the cosmopolitan elite threatened the traditional values cherished by most Americans: \u201cmorality and religion, family, nation, local community, and at times racial integrity and identity\u201d. These were sacred principles for members of a new \u201cpost-bourgeois proletariat\u201d drawn from the working class and the lower ranks of the middle class. Lacking the skills prized by technocrats, but not far enough down the social ladder to win the attention of reformers, these white voters considered themselves victims of a coalition between the top and bottom against the middle.</p> <p>According to Francis, this cohort had supplied the animating spirit of rightwing politics since the death of Franklin Roosevelt in 1945. They had supported Goldwater \u2013 but Francis regarded Goldwater\u2019s programme, like the \u201cmovement conservatism\u201d of the National Review, as a \u201cquaintly bourgeois\u201d throwback to the oligarchic politics of the 19th century, with nothing to offer the modern working man. Their tribune was not Goldwater but <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1998/09/14/us/george-wallace-segregation-symbol-dies-at-79.html?pagewanted=all\">George Wallace</a>, the notorious segregationist and Democratic governor of Alabama \u2013 who won five southern states as an anti-civil rights third-party candidate in the 1968 presidential election. Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan had appealed to this group, too, but neglected their interests after taking office. Despite having elected multiple presidents, the post-bourgeois proletariat had yet to find a voice.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"b9f9fe228b411a3f9b75c94215a7aaa10509c370\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b9f9fe228b411a3f9b75c94215a7aaa10509c370/76_16_2917_1750/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Third-party presidential candidate George Wallace campaigns in Boston, 1968\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Third-party presidential candidate George Wallace campaigns in Boston, 1968.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Yet Francis had difficulty explaining why managerial society would generate so much opposition in the first place. In Leviathan and Its Enemies, he argued that resistance to the cosmopolitan elite would be driven by \u201cimmutable elements of human nature\u201d that \u201cnecessitate attachment to the concrete and historical roots of moral values and meaning\u201d.</p> <p>He was more candid in a speech he gave while working on the book. \u201cWhat we as whites must do,\u201d he declared, \u201cis reassert our identity and our solidarity, and we must do so in explicitly racial terms through the articulation of a racial consciousness as whites.\u201d Where mainstream conservatives depicted the US as a nation whose diverse population was linked by devotion to its founding principles, Francis viewed it as a racial project inextricably bound up with white rule. The managerial revolution jeopardised this racial hierarchy, and so it must be overthrown.</p> <p>Francis delivered his remarks on racial consciousness at a conference organised by <a href=\"http://www.amren.com/\">American Renaissance</a>, an obscure journal devoted to promoting white nationalism. Years earlier, Francis had struck up a friendship with Jared Taylor, who went on to found the magazine with Francis\u2019s encouragement. From their first encounter, Taylor recalled, he and Francis \u201cunderstood each other immediately\u201d.</p> <p>Francis\u2019s employers at the Washington Times were not as sympathetic. The paper fired him after his comments were released, a move that was part of his larger expulsion from the respectable right. Buckley himself dismissed Francis as \u201cspokesman\u201d for a group that had \u201cearned their exclusion from thoughtful conservative ranks\u201d.</p> <p>Yet Francis would not be so easily purged. For years he had cultivated a relationship with Pat Buchanan, a one-time Nixon protege who had become one of the country\u2019s most recognisable conservatives thanks to his role as co-host of CNN\u2019s popular debating programme Crossfire. In 1992, Buchanan launched a long-shot campaign against incumbent president George HW Bush that, against all expectations, garnered almost 3m votes in the primaries. While all this was going on, Buchanan was growing closer to Francis, whom he later called \u201cperhaps the brightest and best thinker on the right\u201d.</p> <p>Francis and Buchanan were linked by their association with a breakaway faction on the right known as paleoconservatism. While mainstream conservatives had taken advantage of cushy gigs in New York and Washington, paleocons depicted themselves as spokesmen for the forgotten residents of <a href=\"http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2016/03/160314-flyover-country-origin-language-midwest/\">flyover country</a>. Francis urged Buchanan to make another run for the White House in 1996, this time as the candidate of the post-bourgeois resistance. That campaign would be based on three issues: protectionism, opposition to immigration and an \u201cAmerica First\u201d foreign policy that repudiated global commitments and foreign interventions in order to focus on defending the national interest.</p> <p>Buchanan listened, and he went on to a surprise win in New Hampshire\u2019s pivotal early primary, convincing Francis that the managerial elite was more vulnerable than at any point in his lifetime. While mainstream Republicans and Democrats celebrated forecasts that the US population was on track to become less than 50% white as a sign of America\u2019s capacity to adapt and grow, Francis believed that the members of his post-bourgeois proletariat regarded these shifting demographics as another reminder of their dwindling power.</p> <p>Buchanan\u2019s campaign fizzled after New Hampshire, but Francis had a ready explanation for the collapse: Buchanan was too loyal to the Republican party to seize the opportunity he had been granted. \u201cDon\u2019t even use the word \u2018conservative,\u2019\u201d Francis told Buchanan. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean anything any more.\u201d The managerial class had absorbed Buckley and his followers. They, too, were the enemy.</p> <p>After Buchanan\u2019s defeat and his own exile from mainstream conservatism, Francis devoted himself to what he called \u201cracialpolitik\u201d. He was a regular contributor to outlets promoting white racial consciousness \u2013 becoming, in Jared Taylor\u2019s words, \u201cthe intellectual leader of a small but growing movement\u201d. Francis denied that he was a white supremacist, but he condemned interracial sex, warned of \u201cincipient race war\u201d and drafted a manifesto for a white nationalist group arguing: \u201cThe American people and government should remain European in their composition and character.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"088706af3fbf2b6b4d0d62ec41dfa8b18a8d90ac\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/088706af3fbf2b6b4d0d62ec41dfa8b18a8d90ac/0_74_2039_1223/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pat Buchanan\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Republican presidential candidate Pat Buchanan at the Cross Roads of the West gun show in Phoenix, Arizona, 1996.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jim Bourg/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When he looked ahead, Francis was especially concerned with the threat that one rising political star posed to his vision of the future. Barack Obama, he remarked in 2004, was \u201cthe model of what the New American is supposed to be\u201d. Ivy League-educated, effortlessly cosmopolitan, promising to transcend barriers of race \u2013 Obama was the embodiment of the managerial elite. He represented everything Francis loathed about the contemporary United States.</p> <p>The fact that Obama, Francis\u2019s symbol for American decadence, became one of the most popular figures in the country brought the great contradiction of his thought into relief. The 19th century belonged to the bourgeoisie and the 20th century to the managers, he argued, because these rising classes had performed necessary social functions. His post-bourgeois proletariat, by contrast, were on the decline.</p> <p>So was Francis. The supposed realist who cast hunger for power as the driving force of world history spent most of his time writing for journals with subscribers in the low five figures. In his last years, he was a lonely man. Before his sudden death from a cardiac aneurism in 2005, he had begun a study of conservatism and race. His masterpiece, Leviathan and Its Enemies, was still tucked away in a box of floppy disks; when it was published 11 years later, it would be under the auspices of a white-nationalist press. The right-leaning Washington Examiner ran one of his few obituaries. \u201cSam Francis,\u201d it said, \u201cwas merely a racist and doesn\u2019t deserve to be remembered as anything less.\u201d It seemed just as likely that Francis would not be remembered at all.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>\u201cI want you to really listen<strong> </strong>to this,\u201d Rush Limbaugh told his listeners in January this year. The king of rightwing talk radio was lecturing his audience, which averages around 13 million people a week, on Samuel Francis. Prompted by a magazine article casting Francis as the prophet of Trumpism, Limbaugh read aloud from one of Francis\u2019s post-mortems on the Buchanan campaign. \u201cWhat\u2019s interesting,\u201d Limbaugh said, \u201cis how right on it is in foretelling Trump.\u201d Before abandoning the subject, he added one point. Francis, Limbaugh noted, \u201clater in life suffered the \u2013 acquired the \u2013 reputation of being a white supremacist\u201d, a reputation Limbaugh insisted was undeserved.</p> <p>The white nationalists who rallied to Francis in the last decade of his life disagree on that point, but they also see Trump as a vindication of their longtime inspiration. \u201cSam would have said that Trump is doing exactly what he advised Patrick Buchanan to do,\u201d maintains Jared Taylor, who made news in the primary season when it was revealed that he had recorded automated phone messages endorsing Trump. (\u201cWhite Supremacist Robocall Heartily Urges Iowa Voters to Support Trump,\u201d reported a headline in the conservative Daily Caller.) According to Taylor\u2019s American Renaissance, \u201cFrancis would be very pleased to see the GOP and conservative establishments mocked and destroyed.\u201d</p> <p>Even liberal commentators are looking back at Francis \u2013 whose prediction of a white working-class backlash against a globalist ruling elite seems to be coming true not just in the US but across Europe. \u201cIf you just drop the white nationalism a lot of Francis makes sense,\u201d says Michael Lind, who once worked as an assistant to Buckley but now describes himself as a \u201cradical centrist\u201d. According to Lind, conservatives have been \u201cspurning their natural constituency \u2013 the mostly white working class\u201d, creating space for the rise of Trump.</p> <p>Francis was also an inspiration for the team at the Journal of American Greatness, who called him \u201cthe closest thing to what could be described as the source of Trumpian thought\u201d in their very first post. They admitted that Francis\u2019s writing \u201covertly indulges various Southern nostalgias\u201d, but insisted that his \u201cdeservedly criticised statements on race\u201d could be separated from the core of his analysis. The managerial class was still the enemy, and only Trump seemed even dimly aware of what it would take to mount an effective challenge.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The authors of JAG looked at the problems facing the US and concluded that Donald Trump might be the answer</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But the authors at JAG wanted to do more than add chapters to the history Francis had already sketched. While they remain anonymous, sources have identified them as part of a conservative establishment located outside the Washington-New York axis that dominates the intellectual life of the American right \u2013 probably associated with the California-based <a href=\"http://www.claremont.org/\">Claremont Institute</a> and the midwestern <a href=\"https://www.hillsdale.edu/\">Hillsdale College</a>.</p> <p>Trump the candidate, they admitted, was at best an imperfect messenger. But it was the message that counted: \u201cThe American regime \u2013 like nearly all its cousins in the west \u2013 has devolved into an oligarchy.\u201d JAG was not just arguing that Trump\u2019s campaign had a coherent agenda \u2013 a controversial assertion, given that many on both the left and right have dismissed Trump as an unhinged demagogue jabbing randomly at pressure points in the electorate. It was arguing that Trump succeeded <em>because</em> of his platform. Without those ideas, he would have been just another novelty candidate. Armed with them, any of Trump\u2019s more disciplined rivals might have stolen the nomination from him \u2013 but instead they opted for recycled bromides from the Reagan era.</p> <p>The site could be fiery in its defence of Trump, but the best moments came when its targets were the grandees of the right. There are plenty of scathing articles about rightwing thinktanks written from the left, but none of their authors could write a sentence such as \u201cSeeing conservatives court billionaires \u2013 which I have had occasion to do dozens, if not hundreds, of times \u2013 is like watching dorks tell cheerleaders how pretty they are.\u201d</p> <p>For all that, the authors of JAG were still thinkers who looked at the problems facing the US and concluded that Donald Trump might be the answer. They denounced conservatives for accepting \u201cthe leftist lie\u201d that having a \u201cnatural affinity for people who look, think and speak\u201d alike \u201cis shameful and illegitimate\u201d. \u201cThe ceaseless importation of people unaccustomed to liberty,\u201d they wrote \u2013 referring to \u201cmass third world immigration\u201d \u2013 \u201cmakes the American people less fit for liberty every day\u201d. Islam was a subject of particular concern. \u201cWhat good,\u201d they asked, \u201chas Muslim immigration done for the United States and the American people?\u201d Francis would have approved.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>With its archive deleted, JAG\u2019s internet presence is now confined to the occasional mournful tweet from one of its former readers, but the problems it identified on the right are more glaring than ever. \u201cThe conservative movement\u2019s mission has become providing comfortable professional livelihoods to literally hundreds of people,\u201d David Frum told me recently. Although this behemoth has proved effective at turning a profit, the intellectual returns on the investment have been paltry. \u201cConservatism was a lot more creative and effective when it had less money,\u201d Frum said.</p> <p>This narrowing of intellectual ambitions has coincided with a crisis of authority. When asked to name the dominant theme of the right\u2019s intellectual history since George W Bush left office, conservative journalist Michael Brendan Dougherty responded with one word: \u201cdisintegration\u201d. Buckley has been dead for the better part of a decade, and no successor has emerged with the clout to take up his role as arbiter of the true faith.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the little magazines that once set the tempo of debate have struggled to maintain their influence in the age of social media. \u201cTwenty years ago if you got the summer internship at National Review you were high-fiving everyone you knew,\u201d one conservative activist told me. \u201cThat was like getting the Goldman Sachs internship. You were set.\u201d</p> <p>Charles Kesler, a senior fellow at the Claremont Institute and professor at nearby Claremont McKenna College, sees a generational change underway. His best students, he says, used to seek out three paths: some went into academia, others into politics, and a third group tried to navigate a path between the two as writers for middlebrow journals such as National Review. But that middle ground has eroded in the last decade, Kesler says. Now many feel \u201crevulsion\u201d at the state of public debate and take refuge in academia \u2013 or they succumb to a \u201cpopulist tug\u201d and end up at rightwing clickbait factories such as <a href=\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/03/01/how-breitbart-unleashes-hate-mobs-to-threaten-dox-and-troll-trump-critics.html\">Breitbart News</a>. That pull will only grow stronger now that Trump has shown how little influence establishment conservatives have over the constituency they claim to represent.</p> <p>In Washington, a policy-minded cohort dubbed the <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/republican-conservative-reformicons-put-new-twist-on-tax-debate-1423010939\">reformicons</a> has become the great hope for conservatives planning their response to the rise of Trump. Long before this year\u2019s campaign, they had begun to devise a more populist agenda to appeal to the working-class voters who have become an increasingly significant part of the Republican electorate. With an eye to the future, they are also convinced that Republicans need to reject Trump\u2019s brand of white identity politics if it hopes to win elections in a country becoming more diverse by the day.</p> <p>From the reformicon perspective, Trump represents a pathological response to the legitimate complaints of voters whose concerns have been overlooked for too long. The challenge for savvy Republican politicians is to convert the impulses that have propelled Trump\u2019s rise into a platform that can appeal to a multiracial coalition.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"4e54fa933163284de5893fa844788d8525b4f65f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4e54fa933163284de5893fa844788d8525b4f65f/0_56_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Donald Trump\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Donald Trump speaks at the Republican national convention in Cleveland, Ohio, July 2016.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mike Segar/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Yet the well-intentioned reforming wonks have struggled to find an audience outside the capital. Part of the problem is financial. \u201cThere\u2019s no money from rich donors even for reasonable populism,\u201d says Michael Lind. To the ears of conservative billionaires, pleas for economic policies that appeal to workers sound like the prelude to tax hikes on the wealthy. For a Washington-based movement offering what the sceptics at JAG called \u201cmanagerialism with a human face\u201d, a lack of wealthy donors is a potentially fatal obstacle.</p> <p>Of all the forces unleashed by the rise of Trump, the one that may pose the greatest threat to the relevance of the conservative intellectual establishment is the gleefully offensive movement known as the alt-right. Nurtured by online forums such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/reddit\">Reddit</a> and 4chan, along with white-nationalist standbys such as American Renaissance, the alt-right has become a vehicle for the simmering anger of mostly white and mostly young men \u2013 with strong links to the earlier varieties of racialpolitik promoted by Francis, who is sometimes cited as a founder of the alt-right. Mainstream conservatives have reacted with shock and horror to this development. \u201cThe nasty mouth-breathers Buckley expelled from conservatism have returned,\u201d declared a typical response from Commentary, one of the major journals of the establishment right.</p> <p>But the new iconoclasts of the alt-right can\u2019t be purged from a conservative movement they have no desire to join, especially when they can reach an audience of millions on social media. If there is an heir today to the young William F Buckley \u2013 who launched his career with exuberant attacks on the hypocrisy of the liberal establishment and managed to make conservatism look like a stylish rebellion against the powers-that-be \u2013 it might be someone like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jul/20/milo-yiannopoulos-nero-permanently-banned-twitter\">Milo Yiannopoulos</a>, a professional provocateur who has become a spokesman for the alt-right. At one typical event this spring, Yiannopoulos, who refers to Trump as \u201cDaddy\u201d, delivered a lecture with the title Feminism Is Cancer after being ushered into the auditorium on a throne held aloft by students wearing \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d hats. Yiannopoulos\u2019s critics are rightly concerned that his main agenda is promoting himself, but Brand Milo is a booming business.</p> <p>The future looks more precarious for the guardians of True Conservatism. They have strong support from leading figures in the Republican party such as Paul Ryan, and retain control over an infrastructure of donors, thinktanks and journals. A landslide defeat for Trump could still revive their cause, but they could just as easily be swept aside by a rising generation of rightwing activists with a more Trumpian set of concerns.</p> <p>Their brand of conservatism won\u2019t disappear, but it could become more a curiosity than a movement, as it was in the days before the birth of the modern right over half a century ago. \u201cThe whole Buckley experiment may have been a passing phase,\u201d says Lind \u2013 a strange interlude when a cohort of writers mistook their ideological preferences for the will of the people and, even stranger, provided the basis for an industry based on that delusion. The anxiety that its time has passed lurks underneath all the conservative establishment\u2019s impassioned denunciations of Trump: a fear that his unprecedented victory in the Republican primary has demonstrated it is already obsolete. \u201cI\u2019m a conservative,\u201d Trump said in April, \u201cbut at this point who cares?\u201d</p> <p>But Trump may have unintentionally pointed the way for a new kind of American conservatism, driven by resentment at the globalist diktats of the hated managerial class. Over the last year, that anger has emerged in surprising venues. In language that Francis would have recognised, the billionaire <a href=\"http://nymag.com/selectall/2016/06/peter-thiel.html\">PayPal co-founder and Silicon Valley guru Peter Thiel</a> declared that America is no longer a democracy \u2013 since it has become a country \u201cdominated by very unelected, technocratic agencies\u201d.</p> <p>Thiel has been an outspoken libertarian since his days as an undergraduate at Stanford in the 1980s, and in 2008 he supplied $500,000 for an attempt to create manmade islands that would provide an \u201cescape from politics in all its forms\u201d, but lately he has started to associate himself with a different crowd. In July, following an outpouring of criticism, <a href=\"https://news.fastcompany.com/peter-thiel-to-speak-atconference-thrown-by-group-tied-to-white-nationalists-4010060\">he cancelled a planned appearance</a> in front of a group that has provided a meeting ground for libertarians and white nationalists, including Francis\u2019s close friend Jared Taylor. But a similar public outcry did not persuade him to drop another speaking engagement earlier that month: a speech on the final night of the Republican national convention, where he had come as a delegate to cast his vote for Donald Trump.</p> <p>\u2022 Follow the Long Read on Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/@gdnlongread\">@gdnlongread</a>, or sign up to the long read weekly email <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2015/jul/20/sign-up-to-the-long-read-email\">here</a>.</p>"

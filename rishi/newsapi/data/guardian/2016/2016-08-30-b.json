The list spans some 400 years of US society, from the barbarism of the slave trade to the outsized cultural achievements of black Americans in decades past.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"12400049fa8e105e1b7fed8b4cf6cfed7c485cad\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/12400049fa8e105e1b7fed8b4cf6cfed7c485cad/0_238_4570_2741/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Museum director Lonnie Bunch stands in front of one of the museum\u2019s engraved walls.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Museum director Lonnie Bunch stands in front of one of the museum\u2019s engraved walls.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Paul Holston/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Arranged chronologically from the building\u2019s basement up through its three glass stories, exhibitions about pre-colonial, pre-enslavement Africa greet visitors. In short order, the exhibitions turn to the transatlantic trade that brought more than 12 million Africans to the western hemisphere in shackles, displaying a genuine pair of 17th- or 18th-century iron wrist locks. </p> <p>They are probably one of the most poignant objects we have in our collection,\u201d said Kinshasha Holman, deputy director of the museum. \u201cIt\u2019s something that doesn\u2019t ever allow us to forget that we as African Americans were born of a county built on the enslavement and the ownership of human beings.\u201d </p> <p>\u201cIf these shackles could speak, they would say it took the resources of an entire society to create slave ships,\u201d Charles Johnson, scholar and author of the historical novel Middle Passage told Smithsonian magazine about the artifact. \u201cEveryone in slave-trading societies, even those who never owned a slave, was implicated.\u201d </p> <p>The original ambrotype portrait \u2013 an early form of photography captured on glass \u2013 of Frederick Douglass is on display marking the nation\u2019s fight for abolition and subsequent civil war. The abolitionist, speaker, writer and freedman was also the most photographed American of the 19th century. Deborah Willis, a scholar of African American photography at New York University, told Smithsonian Magazine that Douglass believed the emerging technology of photography \u201cwas a powerful instrument of racial uplift\u201d.</p> <p>According to Willis, \u201cDouglass believed photos \u2018could challenge the racist caricatures of black people that pervaded the United States and beyond with images that communicated black humanity, self-worth and achievement\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>In the 1940s, in the pre-dawn of the civil rights era, Dr Kenneth Clark and his wife Mamie conducted what may be one of the most far-reaching social science studies of the 20th century. Clark\u2019s \u201cdoll tests\u201d demonstrated the way white supremacist ideology infects black people at miraculously young ages, asking black schoolchildren from segregated and unsegregated schools to pick whether they preferred a white or a black doll. The Clarks\u2019 findings, that black children from segregated schools were more likely to prefer white dolls, played a part in the landmark supreme court decision in Brown v Board of Education that made segregation illegal in the US. One pair of black and white dolls used in the experiments are exhibited in the museum as well. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e1e71a1795f5d1c08bd9e2536d2d2e0ab8b0d16b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e1e71a1795f5d1c08bd9e2536d2d2e0ab8b0d16b/0_173_5184_3110/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An exhibit depicts the life and presidency of Barack Obama and his family.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An exhibit depicts the life and presidency of Barack Obama and his family.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Paul Holston/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Fast-forward through time about 50 years: the museum\u2019s third floor will feature a tambourine from Prince\u2019s 1990 Nude tour. \u201cHe was always looking forward, working to expand his knowledge and understanding,\u201dSheila E, a musician and longtime Prince collaborator said to Smithsonian Magazine. \u201cHe pushed every boundary of art and challenged every concept of the way things were \u2018supposed\u2019 to be, in music and life.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/gallery/2016/may/13/smithsonian-national-museum-african-american-history-culture-sneak-peak-tour-washington-dc\">First look at the Smithsonian's museum of African American history \u2013 in pictures</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The music section of the museum also features singer Chuck Berry\u2019s trademark red Cadillac and film reels of jazz musician Cab Calloway\u2019s home movies.</p> <p>More than 100 years in the making, plans for an African American history museum in the nation\u2019s capital date back to a 1915 meeting of black Union army veterans, frustrated with discrimination and racism.

  "<p>It is being described as the political equivalent of the Super Bowl, World Cup final and Rumble in the Jungle rolled into one \u2013 or the smartest person in the room versus the class clown.</p> <p>When Hillary Clinton faces Donald Trump in the first presidential debate on 26 September, a record TV audience of tens of millions is expected to watch a fascinating clash of styles that could go a long way to determining who wins the White House.</p> <p>Clinton, the Democratic candidate, is said to be deep in books and painstaking rehearsal, mastering every policy detail and leaving nothing to chance. Republican rival Trump, characteristically, is understood to be taking a more freewheeling approach, hoping that his experience as a reality TV celebrity will carry the day. </p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s really different this time because Trump is such a wild card,\u201d said <a href=\"https://twitter.com/lanheechen?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">Lanhee Chen</a>, who helped prepare Senator Marco Rubio for this year\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/mar/10/republican-debate-trump-rubio-cruz-kasich-policy-us-election\">Republican primary debates</a> against Trump. \u201cThe most important thing as someone facing him is to have your own strategy and not get thrown off. The danger is to chase ever shiny objects that he throws out there. She should ignore the shiny objects and stay disciplined.\u201d</p> <p>The first contest, at Hofstra University on Long Island, New York, will take place 56 years to the day after the first ever televised debate between John F Kennedy and Richard Nixon; the more telegenic Kennedy went on to win a narrow election. The setpiece duels have not always been so consequential, but there is a sense that, in this most extraordinary of election years, Clinton v Trump could be a game changer.</p> <p>Chen, a research fellow at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University, who also prepared Mitt Romney for his 2012 debates with Barack Obama, said: \u201cPeople have an impression of these candidates from TV ads, but the debate is the first opportunity people have to see them in their own words one-on-one. They are going to be crucial to the arc of the campaign. If Donald Trump is not able to perform in these debates then the election\u2019s over.\u201d</p> <p>For Trump, <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/us/general_election_trump_vs_clinton_vs_johnson_vs_stein-5952.html\">consistently trailing in opinion polls</a>, the three upcoming debates now represent the best chance to shift the narrative, perhaps a last throw of the dice. Chen said he <a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/2016/08/29/opinions/five-debate-prep-tips-trump-chen/index.html\">needs to make the case</a> against Clinton without exaggeration, demonstrate that he has the right temperament and judgment, and show a grasp of policy.</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s very experienced with TV,\u201d he said. \u201cNo one should underestimate Donald Trump\u2019s ability to have a good debate. I\u2019m not convinced that, as some people are saying, he\u2019s going to be a disaster of a debater.\u201d</p> <p>Trump\u2019s rallies and tweets reflect a tension between scripted material and the improvised, shoot-from-the-hip approach that he favours. The bombastic businessman has reportedly held informal meetings about the debates but is eschewing methodical homework, trying to make his political inexperience a virtue. He <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/30/us/politics/hillary-clinton-donald-trump-debate.html?_r=0\">told the New York Times last week</a>: \u201cI believe you can prep too much for those things. It can be dangerous. You can sound scripted or phony \u2013 like you\u2019re trying to be someone you\u2019re not.\u201d</p> <p>He boasted: \u201cI know how to handle Hillary.\u201d</p> <p>His advisers reportedly include Roger Ailes, who was <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/22/business/media/roger-ailes-fox-news.html\">ousted</a> as Fox News chairman last month over allegations of sexual harassment. A friend of Trump\u2019s, who did not wish to be named, said: \u201cThe debates are an area that Roger Ailes knows better than anyone else in the world.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bbd3b9d6480d416d27a81a63a5141586a4a8ed60\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bbd3b9d6480d416d27a81a63a5141586a4a8ed60/0_108_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Senator Marco Rubio and Donald Trump\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Senator Marco Rubio and Donald Trump at a Republican primary debate in March.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Joe Raedle/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Clinton, meanwhile, mindful of her 2008 primary defeat by Obama and 2016 scare from Bernie Sanders, is taking nothing in this campaign for granted and aiming to be hyper-prepared. \u201cI\u2019m running against someone who will say or do anything, and who knows what that might be,\u201d she was <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2016/08/29/i-dont-know-which-donald-trump-will-show-up-clinton-says-of-debating-trump/\">quoted as saying by the Washington Post</a>. \u201cI do not know which Donald Trump will show up.\u201d</p> <p>Her advisers are amassing data and in talks with <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tonyschwartz\">Tony Schwartz</a><strong>, </strong>the ghostwriter of Trump\u2019s book The Art of the Deal, to gain insights into his deepest insecurities, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/30/us/politics/hillary-clinton-donald-trump-debate.html\">the New York Times reported</a> on Monday. Schwartz, who has expressed regret over the book, tweeted: <strong>\u201c</strong>Trump isn\u2019t preparing for debates because he can\u2019t. No attention span = deep ignorance about issues. He will be all bluster, no substance.\u201d</p> <p>The Clinton team are also studying Trump\u2019s performances in 11 Republican primary debates, when he was the dominant figure on stage, and memorably once even made reference to the size of his manhood. Her press secretary Brian Fallon wrote on Twitter: \u201cFor all his lack of substance, Trump\u2019s showmanship, as ex-TV star, makes him a formidable debate foe. He thrashed his rivals in GOP debates.\u201d</p> <p>Joel Benenson, chief strategist for the Clinton campaign, told CNN on Tuesday: \u201cWhat Donald Trump had in the primaries was a different ball of wax entirely. He had a free-for-all with eight people on the stage. In 90 minutes, he spoke for about 12 minutes. I don\u2019t think he can go toe-to-toe with her.</p> <p>\u201cI think he\u2019ll be very aggressive. I don\u2019t think he can go toe-to-toe with her on policy; I don\u2019t think he can go toe-to-toe with her on substance. I think we\u2019ll see a lot of the same kind of hyper-over-the-top rhetoric from him that we\u2019ve seen. That\u2019s who he is. I don\u2019t think he can control himself.\u201d</p> <p>One big, unresolved question for the Clinton camp is who to cast in the role of Trump during mock debates, a vital part of the preparation process. That person faces the unenviable duty of attacking her over her husband Bill\u2019s sexual indiscretions and bringing up other humiliating talking points.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cd3d2fd4e8ffa58234a12cdd86014342f3027e46\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cd3d2fd4e8ffa58234a12cdd86014342f3027e46/0_0_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders debate\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders debate in April during the Democratic primaries.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lucas Jackson/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Kennedy v Nixon pulled in 66 million viewers and the four debates between the two drew 60% of US households on average. The 1980 debate between Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan was watched by 81 million viewers. Less than 40% of US households tuned in for Obama and Romney in 2012, according to Nielsen, although the clash generated more than 10 million posts on Twitter. </p> <p>It remains to be seen whether Clinton v Trump can rival the biggest TV event in US history, the 2015 Super Bowl, which was watched by 114 million people.</p> <p>Robert Shrum, who helped prepare Democrats Al Gore and John Kerry for their debates with George W Bush in 2000 and 2004, said: \u201cShe has to prepare for mild Trump, wild Trump and somewhere-in-between Trump. This means not only getting a grasp of the substance but doing lots of practice. You can figure out predictable things he\u2019s going to say and ways to come back at him.\u201d</p> <p>Shrum added: \u201cCandidates under pressure in these debates tend to say things they\u2019ve said on the road. We knew in 2004 that Bush would probably say we invaded Iraq because of 9/11. Kerry had a mantra in his head and said: \u2018<a href=\"http://www.debates.org/index.php?page=september-30-2004-debate-transcript\">Saddam Hussein didn\u2019t attack us. Osama bin Laden attacked us</a>.\u2019 Bush looked like he\u2019d been hit by a wet fish. Kerry won all three debates but, unfortunately, didn\u2019t win the election.\u201d</p> <p>This time, however, he believes the debate is critical to Trump\u2019s chances. \u201cIt\u2019s fundamental. Trump has one chance and one chance only to pass the commander-in-chief test. He needs people to say this man can be president of the United States, he\u2019s got the temperament and we can trust him with the nuclear codes.\u201d</p> <p>Some analysts suggest that Trump is thin-skinned and could easily be tempted to lash out against Clinton, an experienced and skilled debater. But Roger Stone, a political consultant and friend of Trump\u2019s for more than three decades, said: \u201cI have a lot of confidence in his instincts. He\u2019s going to do fine. It\u2019s a great opportunity: the debates benefit the candidate who\u2019s behind. Within the political realm, she\u2019s better known and has more experience.</p> <p>\u201cThe only thing predictable about Donald Trump is that he\u2019s entirely unpredictable. She\u2019s never going to know which way he\u2019s going to come at her.\u201d</p> <p>This, along with the constant hum and hype of 24-hour cable news, will make for a very American spectacle. \u201cI\u2019m going to open some popcorn and watch them all,\u201d Chen said.</p>",

It was the revival of those reform efforts that Donald Trump skewered so effectively in the GOP primaries, as he demolished his three biggest foes: Marco Rubio, Ted Cruz and, yes, Bush\u2019s brother, Jeb.</p> <p>George W<strong> </strong>Bush \u2013 along with every other sane Republican \u2013 realized long ago that the Republican party had no future as a nativist rump, hostile to the fastest-growing demographic bloc of voters in the country.</p> <p>It\u2019s unclear whether Trump\u2019s new management team can move their candidate into this space. Despite their half-hearted spin, Trump left the indelible impression that he would deploy a deportation force against all undocumented immigrants, especially the \u201cmurderers and rapists\u201d he claimed Mexico was exporting to the US.</p> <p>The second most contentious issue of this election: how to treat Muslims and Arabs, and particularly Muslim Americans. In this area, Bush\u2019s approach was vastly more enlightened than Trump\u2019s, although it\u2019s fair to say that Genghis Khan also crossed this low bar.</p> <p>Bush visited a mosque in Washington less than a week after the 9/11 attacks to declare that \u201cIslam is peace\u201d and that Muslim Americans \u201cneed to be treated with respect\u201d. He added: \u201cWomen who cover their heads in this country must feel comfortable going outside their homes.\u201d (In those days it was hard to imagine a European country banning a burkini.)</p> <p>But you could also make the case that Bush stoked the politics of fear \u2013 especially in the 2002 and 2004 elections \u2013 that led directly to this point of peak Islamophobia. It was under Bush\u2019s watch, just one year after his second inauguration, that the fever took over. </p> <p>And it\u2019s outlasted the war on terror, although Trump is doing his best to revive both. His party refuses to disown him for trashing a Muslim American family who lost a son in Iraq, or for wanting to close US borders to a billion Muslims. It cannot or will not condemn him for proposing to torture detainees, in direct breach of international laws of war.<br></p> <p>Republicans cannot say where they stand on the Bush spectrum of the war on terror. Trump naturally hates it, pretending to have opposed the war in Iraq, as well as Bush\u2019s hostile turn against Russia. And the Republican foreign policy establishment hates Trump for all that and more.</p> <p>Before the Democrats feel too smug about the Bush conundrum, they should consider their own internal struggles. Much of the Clinton-Sanders battle was defined by the singular question of how to treat Wall Street: whether the bailout was justified and whether bank regulation went far enough. Many Sanders supporters remain opposed to Clinton because of her hawkish views on the Middle East.</p> <p>And for all their hatred of all things Bush, Democrats in Congress voted overwhelmingly with Republicans to stop President Obama from closing Guant\u00e1namo Bay.</p> <p>After eight years of an economic turnaround, we have yet to resolve the debate about rescuing Wall Street. After eight years of troop withdrawals, we are considering sending troops back to Iraq and maintain what looks like a lot like a permanent force in Afghanistan.</p> <p>After eight years of Obama, we have not escaped the legacy of George W Bush. And no matter who wins, we are unlikely to do so any time soon.</p>",

  "<p>British and French interior ministers have ordered a fresh review of security in Calais and confirmed they will continue with the treaty under which British border checks are carried out on French soil.</p> <p>A joint statement issued by the home secretary, Amber Rudd, and her French counterpart, Bernard Cazeneuve, says they will work together to strengthen security around the \u201cshared border\u201d in Calais and \u201cstrongly diminish\u201d the migratory pressures that have attracted 7,000 migrants to the Channel tunnel port.</p> <p>The statement from the two ministers confirms their commitment to the 2003 Le Touquet treaty but makes no reference to calls from some French politicians for an asylum \u201chotspot\u201d processing centre to be set up in Calais to consider claims for asylum in Britain.</p> <p>French rightwing politicians, including Nicolas Sarkozy, have called for Le Touquet to be scrapped or changed, raising the prospect of the UK border returning from Calais to Dover. But the joint statement issued by Rudd and Cazeneuve after a meeting in Tuesday clearly says they are committed to \u201cpreserve the vital economic link\u201d.</p> <p>The two ministers say they recognise the humanitarian situation in Calais and they will step up their joint efforts to improve the situation. They say that additional work, including by Britain, to protect the shared border will \u201creflect the outcome of the UK/France security reviews and the steps that need to be taken to continue to manage the common border effectively\u201d.</p> <p>On Monday the president of the region around Calais, Xavier Bertrand, had called for the Le Touquet agreement to end, telling the BBC: \u201cIt\u2019s not possible to keep people here without a new agreement between the two governments.\u201d<br></p> <p>The issue was highlighted during the EU referendum campaign when both David Cameron and Fran\u00e7ois Hollande suggested the deal could be threatened by Brexit.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/30/calais-asylum-hotspot-proposal-main-questions-answered-uk-refugees\">Calais asylum hotspot proposal: the main questions answered</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Bertrand suggested allowing migrants to apply for asylum in Britain from \u201chotspot\u201d application centres in France.

Government officials have reportedly said Britain could threaten to review security cooperation with France if it tries to tear up Le Touquet and push the border from Calais into Kent.</p> <p>Earlier the prime minister\u2019s spokesman sought to play down tensions between the two governments. He said: \u201cThis meeting between the home secretary and her counterpart has been in the diary for some time.

It is one of our closest allies.\u201d</p> <p>The spokesman said the French government continued to support the agreement with Britain as it stands, dismissing Bertrand\u2019s suggestions on both the treaty and the asylum centres.</p> <p>Former president Sarkozy, who hopes to make a comeback next year, has also said the \u201cJungle\u201d migrant camp should be shut down and moved to Britain, but the prime minister\u2019s spokesman said he wouldn\u2019t comment on a hypothetical situation that was a \u201clong way off\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--showcase\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/08/calais_locator-zip/giv-31075MSeZdE3QkZ5S\" data-alt=\"Calais migrant camp locator\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/08/calais_locator-zip/giv-31075MSeZdE3QkZ5S\">Calais migrant camp locator</a> </figure>  <p>\u201cIn terms of relationship with France it remains as strong as it ever has done, it remains absolutely critical.

Sarkozy said in a speech at the weekend: \u201cI\u2019m demanding the opening of a centre in Britain to deal with asylum seekers in Britain, so that Britain can do the work that concerns them.

The Labour party has a code of conduct on this, and it does have to be dealt with.<br></p> <p>\u201cEveryone should learn that when they put something on Facebook or Twitter or online in an email, that is exactly the same as if you\u2019d put it in the print media in any other way, with exactly the same protective laws of libel or slander.</p> <p>\u201cMany people use instant access to Twitter more or less like they\u2019re continuing a pub conversation, and deeply regret the abuse that they sent to people at that time.

But they do it on Facebook and they do it on Twitter and they do it online.\u201d</p> <p>Speaking in east London, Corbyn unveiled a series of ideas to \u201cdemocratise the internet\u201d, including an online learning hub; publicly funded software and hardware to help teach <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/programming\">programming</a>; a voluntary \u201cdigital citizen passport\u201d to create a secure portable identity; and more use of technology to debate and devise legislation.</p> <p>Corbyn said the plans would \u201crebuild and transform Britain so that no one and no community is left behind\u201d.</p> <p>In parallel, the Labour leader said new technology could transform the party\u2019s election chances, saying he would use innovations pioneered in his leadership campaign against Owen Smith, such as a digital phone canvassing app which allows volunteers to make calls from anywhere, whenever possible.</p> <p>The phone bank app was devised by a group called <a href=\"http://www.codersforcorbyn.com/\">Coders for Corbyn</a>.

  "<h2>Apple hit by EU tax ruling</h2> <p>Apple is facing a $14.5bn fine from the European commission over unpaid back taxes, stemming from arrangements it made over nearly 25 years with the Irish government. The ruling found that <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/30/apple-pay-back-taxes-eu-ruling-ireland-state-aid\">Dublin afforded Apple illegal state aid</a>, allowing the US tech company to pay as little as 1% corporate tax rate on two-thirds of its global earnings, and levies a heavier fine than expected.

Now we have to deliver those reforms beset by the disastrous uncertainty of leaving the world\u2019s greatest trading bloc ... Larry Elliott, the Guardian\u2019s current economic editor, is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/20/brexit-eu-referendum-economy-project-fear\">upbeat about Brexit</a>. I, a former one, am profoundly concerned. Readers in the years ahead will judge which of us was right.</p> </blockquote> <p>In the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/11a7bab6-7107-3efb-86b1-fb7d1fdfa2d9\">Financial Times, lawyer and blogger David Allen Green</a> argues that Brexit may of course happen, but it will not come about just because people say it will: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Brexit also needs to be capable of happening, and that requires a policy as well as resources. Instead of just asserting that Brexit \u201cshall\u201d happen, the government now needs to explain \u201chow\u201d it will happen. It seems not to have any idea.</p> </blockquote> <p>The LSE\u2019s professor of European political economy, Paul de Grauwe, argues that for its own sake, the EU can and must offer the UK only two options: a Norwegian-style model (accepting EU rules, allowing freedom of movement and paying into the budget), or leaving entirely and negotiating a free trade agreement \u00e0 la Canada:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Clarity is essential for those who consider leaving the EU. This clarity can only be achieved by excluding a privileged trade agreement with the UK ... The century-old British strategy remains the same, ie to weaken the forces that can make Europe stronger. The UK can achieve this by insisting on a special deal whereby the UK maintains the benefits of the union while not sharing in the costs. Such a deal would signal to other member countries that by exiting, they can continue to enjoy the benefits of the union without the costs. Such a prospect would fatally weaken the European Union.</p> </blockquote> <p>At the <a href=\"http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/brexit/2016/08/top-10-reasons-brexit-isnt-working-according-brexiteers\">New Statesman, Ian Leslie has a light-hearted but actually fairly accurate sounding guide to the top 10 reasons why Brexit isn\u2019t working \u2013 according, of course, to Brexiters</a> (sabotage by Whitehall, remainers talking down the country, untrustworthy experts, EU bureaucrats, etc etc):</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Over the next few years, it is likely that the economy will shrink, the entire government will be consumed by trade negotiations, and EU leaders will use their considerable negotiation advantages to theatrically screw us. As this unpretty story unfolds, those who argued confidently for Brexit, in parliament and in the press, will feel compelled to maintain that they were right, and that if it hadn\u2019t been for some other impossible-to-foresee factor everything would be going splendidly. </p> </blockquote> <h2>Tweet of the week</h2> <p>The obvious silver lining?

Nicolas Sarkozy, the former French president, who is seeking his party\u2019s nomination to run in 2017, used a speech at the weekend to call for the main Calais camp to be relocated to the UK.</p> <p>Sarkozy said: \u201cI\u2019m demanding the opening of a centre in Britain to deal with asylum seekers in Britain, so that Britain can do the work that concerns them. The Jungle should not be in Calais or anywhere else, because this is a republic and those with no rights to be here should return to their country.\u201d</p> <p>Sarkozy, who is running a hardline rightwing primary campaign, in effect called for a renegotiation of the Le Touquet agreement. Yet it was Sarkozy, when he was interior minister, who signed the agreement with Britain in 2003.</p> <p>Alain Jupp\u00e9, the mayor of Bordeaux who is favourite to become the right\u2019s candidate for the presidency next year, has also questioned the agreement, saying over the summer that \u201clogic dictates\u201d that border controls should happen on UK soil. </p> <p>Marine Le Pen, of the far-right Front National, who has strong support in Calais in northern France, is also campaigning on scrapping the current immigration deal. </p> <p>But at government level, the issue is complex as France battles to sort out its own asylum system issues. After the UK voted for Brexit in June, the Socialist government said there would be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/25/french-border-deal-wont-be-affected-by-brexit-paris\">no renegotiation</a> of the British-French immigration deal because it would not be in French interests. </p> <p>Cazeneuve warned that a change to the deal would send a signal to traffickers and smugglers that they could legitimately leave people at the French border to cross to England and would lead to tens of thousands more migrants in northern France. President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande said there would be \u201cno sense\u201d in changing the deal.</p> <p>The Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, declined to comment directly on the fate of the Le Touquet agreement when asked after a campaign event in London, instead saying the burden of taking refugees should be better spread across the EU.</p> <p>\u201cThe point I always make about the refugee crisis across Europe is it has to be shared across the whole of the European union,\u201d he said. \u201cAt the moment Germany takes by far the largest proportion of Syrian asylum seekers and others. Some countries take none, and some take a very small number. The whole of Europe must recognise that we do have a moral duty to take a far greater number of asylum seekers all across Europe.\u201d</p> <p>He said the UK should particularly be more ready to process asylum claims for people with family links to the country, adding: \u201cWhere there are family connections of people in the camps with family in Britain then clearly they can apply, and often do.\u201d</p> <p>Corbyn condemned conditions in the main Calais camp, and similar ones along the coast in Dunkirk, both of which he has visited. \u201cI\u2019ve seldom seen anything so disgusting as those fetid camps in a land of plenty. It\u2019s not necessary,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Sir Peter Ricketts, a former British ambassador to France, warned on Monday that if a rightwing candidate won the presidential election next year, Britain \u201cis going to have to deal with a pretty serious conversation with France about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/25/french-border-deal-wont-be-affected-by-brexit-paris\">the Le Touquet agreement</a>\u201d.</p> <p>He said the UK was unlikely to accept the hotspot idea \u2013 adopted by the EU to tackle the crisis of mass migration from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East to Greece and Italy \u2013 warning that it would attract many more people to Calais. \u201cAs soon as you suggest that, it becomes a huge magnet,\u201d added Ricketts.</p>",

  "<p>The village headman, or <em>muhtar</em>, is the plankton in the food chain of Turkish politics. He \u2013 or, less often, she \u2013 is an elected local official who counts heads, settles feuds, and finds cats.</p> <p>On the night of 15 July, Can Cumurcu, the <em>muhtar</em> of the affluent neighbourhood of \u00c7engelk\u00f6y, on the Asian shore of Istanbul, led the defence of his manor against soldiers who had joined a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/18/military-coup-was-well-planned-and-very-nearly-succeeded-say-turkish-officials\">military coup</a> to topple President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan. \u00c7engelk\u00f6y was the scene of a thrilling people\u2019s defence against the rebels. Cumurcu was shot just above the hip; now he\u2019s reckoned a <em>gazi</em>, or holy warrior.</p> <p>When I met him a couple of weeks after the coup failed, Cumurcu was propped up on the sofa in his flat in \u00c7engelk\u00f6y. His amiable face darkened when he mentioned his dead nephew, who had been cut down by army bullets during the coup \u2013 but the resolve in his voice, and his references to the \u201cesteemed\u201d president, the \u201csacred\u201d national flag, and God, made it clear that he felt that he had done his duty as a Turk and a Muslim.</p> <p>\u201cI got home at around 10pm that night,\u201d he remembered, wincing from his sore side, \u201cand my neighbours told me there were tanks on the Bosphorus Bridge.\u201d Cumurcu went down to the coastal road, where people were discussing the announcement on TV that the army had taken over the country. Then he saw an army captain entering \u00c7engelk\u00f6y on foot, firing his gun into the air.</p> <p>\u201cThe captain saw me and said, \u2018get these people inside!\u2019 I said sharply, \u2018Have you been drinking? Are you all right in the head?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>The captain retreated but Cumurcu guessed he would come back with reinforcements to clear the road. The <em>muhtar</em> arranged for a barricade of vehicles to be formed, and more locals were roused using social media. Some were armed; so were the handful of pro-Erdo\u011fan duty officers at \u00c7engelk\u00f6y\u2019s small police station. Shortly after midnight, the soldiers stormed back into the neighbourhood with a burst of automatic fire. Cumurcu was flung into the air by a slug that passed through his side.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2016/sep/16/welcome-to-demokrasi-how-erdogan-got-more-popular-than-ever-podcast\">Welcome to demokrasi: how Erdo\u011fan got more popular than ever \u2013 podcast</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The stricken <em>muhtar</em> was rushed to a nearby hospital \u2013 which would receive 60 dead and wounded over the course of the night. Back in \u00c7engelk\u00f6y, the putschists had seized the police station but were unable to advance further. They took hostages and forced them to their knees in the road. According to media reports, one officer shouted, \u201cYou dogs! Don\u2019t you know there\u2019s only one God? Your God is Erdo\u011fan. Let him come and save you now.\u201d</p> <p>All the accounts of the coup \u2013 even allowing for the fact that they have since been tidied into a seamless epic \u2013 agree that the president did indeed have a decisive effect on events. Erdo\u011fan had been holidaying in the southern resort of Marmaris; he was still there at 24 minutes past midnight, when he issued a televised appeal for Turks to come into the streets and defend the regime, for, as he put it, \u201cI\u2019ve yet to see a force stronger than the people.\u201d</p> <p>The number of civilians resisting the soldiers in \u00c7engelk\u00f6y suddenly leaped from a few score to thousands, a pattern replicated outside the Istanbul mayoralty, the Ankara parliament, and other flashpoints across the country. When Erdo\u011fan\u2019s plane landed at Istanbul airport at around 3am, he was met by huge crowds of supporters; three hours later, when news arrived that the Bosphorus Bridge had been liberated, the soldiers in \u00c7engelk\u00f6y turned tail. The coup was over.</p> <p>For the next few days, following the example of the loyalist media, the people of Turkey doused themselves in anger, pride, grief and exhilaration. The putschists had killed some 240 civilians, 18 of them in \u00c7engelk\u00f6y. Parliament had been bombed by F-16s. But democracy had won.</p> <aside class=\"element element-membership element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Membership Event: </span><a href=\"https://membership.theguardian.com/event/the-long-read-live-at-the-hospital-club-27192843527\">The Long Read live - at the Hospital Club</a> </p> </aside>  <p>What followed, however, looked less like a democratic victory than an authoritarian purge. In six weeks, more than 80,000 soldiers, civil servants, teachers, and private sector employees have been arrested, sacked or suspended. Not all of those who have been targeted appear to be connected to the movement led by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/16/fethullah-gulen-who-is-the-man-blamed-by-turkeys-president-for-coup-attempt\">Fethullah G\u00fclen</a>, the influential US-based preacher and educationalist whom Erdo\u011fan has accused of masterminding the coup. Scores of journalists have been detained, and around 100 media outlets have been forcibly shut down. Amnesty International has raised the possibility of <a href=\"https://www.amnesty.ie/latest/stories/2016/07/28/turkey-taking-big-step-backwards-human-rights/\">\u201cmass repression, torture and arbitrary detention\u201d</a> under the cover of the state of emergency that Erdo\u011fan declared on 20 July.</p> <p>For onlookers in the west, Erdo\u011fan\u2019s clampdown confirms his well-established tendency to regard his own popularity as a mandate to crush opponents. The spontaneous civilian uprising against the military coup may have represented the ultimate affirmation of the popular will \u2013 but the events that followed have deepened the contradiction between Erdo\u011fan\u2019s unquestionable democratic legitimacy and his equally indisputable authoritarian rule.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Erdogan\u2019s demokrasi may be \u201cilliberal\u201d in its practice, but it represents a forceful expression of the people\u2019s will</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The immediate reaction to the coup from American and European politicians provided evidence of their unease: both John Kerry, the US secretary of state, and Federica Mogherini, the EU\u2019s foreign policy chief, issued warnings to the Turks demanding that Erdo\u011fan <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/18/european-leaders-urge-turkey-to-respect-rule-of-law-after-failed-coup\">respect democracy and the rule of law</a>. The clear implication, for listeners inside Turkey, was that Europe and America were more concerned for the thugs who had tried to seize the state than they were for its democratically elected leaders. In response, Erdo\u011fan excoriated the west for \u201csiding with the putchists\u201d.</p> <p>Words often change meaning when they change language. If Erdo\u011fan is correct to suspect that the US and EU would not have mourned his overthrow, this is because he now presides over a bespoke form of government that western leaders do not understand or appreciate. Erdogan\u2019s <em>demokrasi</em> may be \u201cilliberal\u201d in its practice, but it represents a forceful expression of the people\u2019s will \u2013 a blunt majoritarian riposte to an imagined democratic gold standard that in reality no longer exists.</p> <p>Turkey under Erdo\u011fan may be compared with Putin\u2019s Russia, Modi\u2019s India and Netanyahu\u2019s Israel. In all these places the forms of democracy have been suborned by majoritarian nationalism, bolstered to varying degrees by the security state. In fact, Erdo\u011fan\u2019s programme does not look very different to the prospectus unveiled by France\u2019s would-be strongman, Nicolas Sarkozy, whose campaign for the presidency looks likely to be defined by his promises to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/22/nicolas-sarkozy-declares-candidacy-french-presidential-election\">enforce majority prejudice over minority interests</a>. (His support for the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/26/frances-highest-court-suspends-burkini-ban-in-test-case\">burkini ban</a> is a case in point.) Of course, Erdo\u011fan is an Islamist \u2013 while the others are anti-Islamists. But the new wave of elected authoritarians are nothing if not indulgent of many different varieties of nationalist phobia.</p> <p>From this perspective, Erdo\u011fan is less an aberration than the vanguard of a global trend: the dissolution of the supposedly universal democratic ideal into many indigenised \u201cversions\u201d of democracy. What makes Kerry and Mogherini\u2019s lectures even harder for Erdo\u011fan to stomach is that Europe and America are hardly exceptions to this tendency. Under the state of emergency that France\u2019s government introduced after last November\u2019s terrorist attacks, the rights of French citizens to freedom of movement and association have been formally suspended. (Turkey\u2019s government did the same following the coup.) Xenophobia has once more become a widely accepted electoral tool: consider the loud and deceitful warnings of leading Brexit campaigners that Britain would soon be swamped by millions of Turkish migrants if the UK remained inside the EU. As for the paternalistic American pluralism preached by John Kerry, this could soon be washed away by a demagogue whose conception of democracy consists of a soapbox and a baseball bat.</p> <p>It is unsurprising that Erdo\u011fan views the west\u2019s stated concern for democracy as nothing but a cynical tool of foreign policy: after all, these same countries mutely acquiesced in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/04/egypt-revolution-coup-military-intervention-analysis\">military overthrow</a> of his friend Mohamed Morsi, the democratically elected Muslim Brotherhood president of Egypt, only three years ago.</p> <p>For all Erdo\u011fan\u2019s democratic shortcomings, furthermore, his country isn\u2019t a dictatorship and he isn\u2019t a fascist. Turkey\u2019s president has neither stolen elections nor launched pogroms against the country\u2019s minority Kurdish or Alevi communities. The awkward fact for Erdo\u011fan\u2019s critics is that his popularity has not been hurt by his authoritarianism; if anything, his legitimacy has been further enhanced. Two years after he ascended from the prime minister\u2019s office to the presidency, his electoral record is almost peerless: after leading his party to victory in one presidential election and five general elections, he is arguably the world\u2019s most successful democratic politician.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"a4daf0c6352cd2f734cc7c96125da27bd9f4810e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a4daf0c6352cd2f734cc7c96125da27bd9f4810e/0_23_3480_2234/1000.jpg\" alt=\"President Erdo\u011fan chairs a cabinet meeting, sitting beneath a portrait of the Turkish republic\u2019s founder Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk,\" width=\"1000\" height=\"642\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">President Erdo\u011fan chairs a cabinet meeting, sitting beneath a portrait of the Turkish republic\u2019s founder Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: HANDOUT/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>* * *</h2> <p>During his 13 years in power, Erdo\u011fan and his Justice and Development party (AKP) have presided over a transformation in Turkey\u2019s fortunes: on the back of strong and stable leadership and a raft of liberalising political and economic reforms, Europe\u2019s basket case became a major economic power and a candidate for EU membership. The impetus for this transformation dates back to the 1980s and 1990s, when Turkish Islamists of Erdo\u011fan\u2019s generation were a numerical majority, and yet in political and social terms a repressed minority. The country\u2019s ruling establishment was exclusively peopled by secular-minded Kemalists, named after the founder of the Turkish republic, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2013/nov/08/ataturk-turkey-photography-ersoy-emin\">Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk</a>; the Kemalist army repeatedly intervened to prevent governments from reflecting the wishes of a mostly devout, intermittently anti-western electorate.</p> <p>Such was the Turkey I came to know after 1996, when I went to live in Ankara as the Economist\u2019s correspondent. Atat\u00fcrk and his successors had designed their new capital in the 1920s and 1930s to be a secular, republican contrast to Istanbul, the old imperial capital and former seat of the caliphate. Three-quarters of a century later, the Kemalist regime remained militaristic and unliberalised: one constantly saw staff officers being driven from one gaunt military building to another in ancient Turkish-made Fiats. Looking back from the big hill in the south of the city, with the Sheraton blocking your view of the only major mosque, it was possible to survey the capital of one of the world\u2019s biggest Muslim countries without seeing a single minaret.</p> <p>I was struck by the hatred with which the secular elite regarded their devout compatriots. \u201cReactionary\u201d and \u201cretarded\u201d were the kinder adjectives that bureaucrats, army officers and newspaper editors attached to members of banned Islamic brotherhoods or people who sent their children to religious schools. A physical revulsion seemed to come over my emancipated female friends at the rare sight of a woman wearing the long, black body covering known in Turkey as the <em>\u00e7ar\u015faf</em>; they called these women \u201ctwo-legged cockroaches\u201d. At night, the secularists drank raki toasts to their hero Atat\u00fcrk and chain-smoked Samsun cigarettes in a line of fish restaurants in the centre of town.</p> <p>Each day, in and out of the ministry buildings went clean-shaven men in ties and women in skirts. Beards or head coverings were banned for public servants, and the only scarf one saw was on the head of the tea lady. Even after Erdo\u011fan became prime minister, in 2003, the arch-Kemalist President Ahmet Necdet Sezer refused to invite the covered Mrs Erdo\u011fan to attend Republic Day celebrations; when a reporter asked what he felt about this, Erdo\u011fan replied, \u201cput yourselves in my wife\u2019s place and decide for yourself\u201d.</p> <p>The only time I had a strong impression of being in a Muslim city was while driving to Ankara airport, past slums that were home to migrants from rural Turkey. Here, the women were covered and the men bearded; spindly minarets rose like Anatolian poplars against the sky.</p> <p>Kemalism was a big institutional fantasy according to which Turkey was a kind of warm-water Sweden. In the troubled 1990s, the country\u2019s secular establishment was associated with economic instability (inflation averaged 70%), a pitiless war against the Kurdistan Workers\u2019 party (PKK), and a spiteful policy that banned girls in headscarves from public universities. Turkey\u2019s allies in Nato and the EU were alive to these failures; in a country whose politicians constantly solicited the affirmation of the west, the eventual rejection of Kemalism could only take place with outside approval.</p> <p>The big winner from the west\u2019s growing disenchantment with Kemalism was Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan \u2013 a ferry captain\u2019s son with roots in the conservative Black Sea region, who had served as a popular mayor of Istanbul since 1994. Rather than impose Islamic law on Turkey\u2019s most cosmopolitan city, as the secularists had predicted he would, Erdo\u011fan had devoted himself to improving the city\u2019s transport system, water supply, and air quality.</p> <p>When I met Erdo\u011fan in the spring of 1997, he was quick to point to the many ways in which Istanbullus\u2019 lives had got better since he became mayor. His account was hard to fault; even his secularist critics concurred that this sclerotic, corrupt old wreck of a place finally had a competent, hard-working mayor who wasn\u2019t on the take. We met on the terrace of an imperial Ottoman house that he had had restored and then opened to the public. The house itself was a symbol of his departure from the ruling order; the secularists were so disdainful of the defunct empire that they had let most of these relics crumble.</p> <p>Erdo\u011fan came out on to the terrace where I was sitting with one of his aides; he was athletic and youthful and looked good in a dark suit. We were brought superb early strawberries and ate them while admiring the Bosphorus view. He smiled often as we talked, without any of the glowering pompousness he now displays regularly \u2013 but even then, I sensed a wariness that was more than the usual politician\u2019s caution; he knew that the west was still making up its mind about him.</p> <p>He flashed one of his smiles when I reminded him of the Kemalists\u2019 criticism of his decision not to allow booze in this and other municipal establishments. \u201cWhen I became mayor they said I would ban alcohol in Istanbul, but anyone who wants to drink may do so.\u201d He seemed to be saying, \u201ctime will tell\u201d.</p> <p>The doubts that many in Turkey felt towards him concerned his intentions; the previous year he had caused outrage by describing democracy as a \u201ctram ... it goes as far as we want it to go, and then we get off\u201d. That evening I upset my Turkish friends by defending too fervently a man they continued to regard as a theocrat in disguise.</p> <p>The following year, Erdo\u011fan was sentenced to 10 months in jail on risible charges of inciting a religious insurrection (he ended up serving four). He had recited some lines of martial poetry by an early Turkish nationalist, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ziya_G%C3%B6kalp\">Ziya G\u00f6kalp</a>. The US consul in Istanbul came to the mayoralty to commiserate; the case, she said, would \u201cweaken confidence in Turkish democracy\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"91a14cc9676774c7038c8347debef08a76dbac1b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/91a14cc9676774c7038c8347debef08a76dbac1b/0_57_2048_1228/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Erdo\u011fan with his wife Emine in 1999, the day before he was sent to prison for inciting a religious insurrection\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Erdo\u011fan with his wife Emine in 1999, the day before he was sent to prison for inciting a religious insurrection.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Reuters Photographer / Reuter/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Four years after he was released from prison, Erdo\u011fan\u2019s rise to prime minister in 2003 was applauded not only by conservative Turks but also by western politicians and academics who hoped that his democratic Islamism would provide an alternative path to the \u201cclash of civilisations\u201d that many regarded as inevitable in the wake of 9/11. Erdo\u011fan was praised for his commitment to something called \u201cmoderate\u201d Islam, although he bridled at the term, as most Muslims would; Islam is a God-given truth and in no need of improving qualifiers. His domestic opponents continued to accuse him of hiding his true beliefs until he had purged Kemalist institutions like the army and the judiciary.</p> <p>In its first few years in power, Erdo\u011fan\u2019s AKP introduced a slew of liberalising and democratic reforms. The notorious state security courts were scrapped, torture was curtailed, and the government put out feelers aimed at a political settlement with the Kurds. Political stability and fiscal discipline helped to cut inflation, while in pious central Anatolia \u2013 the AKP\u2019s heartland \u2013 ambitious family-run firms invested in future growth. Between 2002 and 2013 the economy expanded by an average of 5% per annum: the government used the proceeds of that growth to invest in housing, health, and education. The slums I used to drive past on the road to Ankara airport in the 1990s were replaced with smart modern flats.</p> <p>The high water mark for Erdo\u011fan and the west was 2005, when the EU and Turkey opened accession negotiations. At the time, Erdo\u011fan expressed a worldview that was notably open and optimistic. \u201cCountries on their own,\u201d he said, \u201cdo not mean \u2026 much any more. They can achieve a lot more in solidarity with their friends.\u201d</p> <p>By making himself and Turkey indispensable to the west \u2013 there was, the veteran US diplomat Richard Holbrooke declared, \u201cno country in the world of more strategic importance\u201d \u2013 Erdo\u011fan was also protecting himself against his Kemalist foes. The wisdom of this approach was demonstrated in 2007, when the general staff threatened a coup if he went ahead with plans to elevate his AKP confrere Abdullah G\u00fcl to the presidency. Instead, the EU and the US weighed in with statements of support for the elected government, Erdo\u011fan called the generals\u2019 bluff by holding early elections which he resoundingly won, and G\u00fcl moved into the presidential palace \u2013 along with his covered wife.</p> <p>Erdo\u011fan was now strong enough to accelerate a process that had begun years earlier, changing the ethos of the army, which had earlier toppled three governments. Kemalist officers were retired, and Islamists brought in. In this endeavour, Erdo\u011fan was assisted by the followers of Fethullah G\u00fclen \u2013 the secretive Islamist movement that was allied with the AKP against the secular establishment for a decade until a dramatic split in 2013.</p> <p>It is likely that Erdo\u011fan\u2019s vulnerability in the early stages of his premiership made it easier for him to make friendly gestures to Kurds and liberals \u2013 constituencies well beyond the typical ambit of the Turkish Islamist. In 2004, a ban on teaching in the Kurdish language was lifted, and the prime minister repeatedly overruled plans by the military to attack PKK camps in northern Iraq; some Kurds, particularly the conscientious Muslim ones, rewarded him with their votes.</p> <p>Perhaps most surprising, in the mid-2000s Turkey gained the most vocal feminist, environmentalist and LGBT movements in the Muslim Middle East. The organisers of Istanbul\u2019s annual gay pride march called it the biggest in the Muslim world. (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/19/police-use-teargas-against-lgbt-activists-in-istanbul\">This year\u2019s march was banned</a> by the authorities in Istanbul, however, citing security concerns after nationalist groups warned they would not allow it to take place.) For a while \u2013 with the exception of Turkey\u2019s roughly 15 million Alevis, whom many in the Sunni mainstream regard as renegade Muslims \u2013 Erdo\u011fan could claim to be a leader for all Turkey.</p> <p>The tragedy of modern Turkey is that all of these relationships that had begun to blossom under Erdo\u011fan \u2013 with the Kurds, with Turkish liberals, with the EU and the US \u2013 have now fallen apart again under his leadership, which only becomes more authoritarian and isolated with the crumbling of each alliance.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"89c09e2f2480f7d5124effd0cb0143d54f0d8444\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/89c09e2f2480f7d5124effd0cb0143d54f0d8444/0_30_1993_1196/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Erdo\u011fan greets his Justice and Development party supporters in Istanbul, about a month after the party won the 2002 general election.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Erdo\u011fan greets his Justice and Development party supporters in Istanbul, about a month after the party won the 2002 general election.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Murad Sezer/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Erdo\u011fan is a proud man, sensitive to slights. He turned decisively against his old friend Bashar al-Assad when the latter rejected Erdo\u011fan\u2019s appeal for leniency towards the Syrians who began protesting against the dictator in the spring of 2011. (It has also been reported that Mrs Assad made rude remarks about the Erdo\u011fans after the two couples holidayed together, which were intercepted by Turkish intelligence.)</p> <p>Turkey\u2019s support for Syrian opposition fighters reflected Erdo\u011fan\u2019s one-time hope that a Sunni-dominated Syria would become a loyal Turkish client. Instead, the Turks have seen an influx of millions of Syrian refugees, and watched helplessly while the Syrian Kurdish allies of the PKK, which Turkey designates as a terrorist organisation, have set up autonomous cantons across the border. When Turkey bowed to American pressure and joined the coalition against Islamic State in 2014, the jihadis responded with a string of suicide attacks inside Turkey \u2013 the most recent of which, in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/20/several-dead-in-suspected-terrorist-blast-at-wedding-in-turkey\">southern city of Gaziantep</a>, on 20 August, killed 50 people.</p> <p>In the summer of 2013, weeks of protests initially sparked by the government\u2019s plans to bulldoze an Istanbul park decisively snapped whatever understanding still remained between Erdo\u011fan and Turkish liberals, millions of whom came out to demonstrate against the AKP\u2019s growing authoritarianism. (As if to prove their point, the protests were harshly put down, injuring thousands.) Finally, last summer, amid the ruins of his Syria policy, Erdo\u011fan launched a new round of fighting against the PKK that has so far cost some 1,800 lives and devastated towns across Turkish Kurdistan.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Erdo\u011fan\u2019s capacity for umbrage knows no bounds: he has brought some 2,000 suits for defamation</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Turkey\u2019s unresolved application for EU membership has arguably been the most painful reverse of all. Even back in 2005, it was clear that there was a strong chance that Austria, France or Germany would block Turkey\u2019s membership because the country is too big and too Muslim. Since then, various pretexts have been found to slow the accession process to a crawl. It is now clear that Turkey will not join, but formally ending negotiations would cause yet more ill-will and jeopardise what cooperation there is, particularly on Syrian refugees.</p> <p>Erdo\u011fan is a bully who has insulted his political opponents and locked up critical journalists. His reflexive response to criticism is to demand, in public: \u201cWho do you think you are?\u201d (At the end of July, he directed this question at General Joseph Votel, the commander of American forces in the Middle East, who suggested that Erdo\u011fan\u2019s purge of military officers would damage the ongoing campaign against Islamic State.) Erdo\u011fan\u2019s capacity for umbrage knows no bounds: he has brought some 2,000 suits for defamation, including one against a German comic who recited a poem about him copulating with a goat.</p> <p>Even now, after 13 years of uninterrupted power and the accumulation of untold wealth, Turkey\u2019s ruling Islamists seem still to be responding to humiliations that were meted out to them by the superior, snobby, Europeanised Kemalists. Erdo\u011fan has not got where he is by taking fancy degrees or showing off his restaurant French (he is defiantly monolingual) \u2013 but through straightforward piety and political nous. Just as the Kemalists used to disparage the \u201cprimitive\u201d ways of Turkey\u2019s Islamists, so too does Erdo\u011fan deplore liberal freedoms that he regards as obstacles to development and virtue. He has compared abortions to mass murder and derides all drinkers as alcoholics; environmentalists, he has said, should move to a forest.</p> <p>During Erdo\u011fan\u2019s honeymoon with the west, foreign journalists used to remark that his rough edges had been smoothed in office; his trips abroad as prime minister, it was implied, had been the making of him. But these pats on the head reflected their wishes rather than his: in the contemptuous words of a Turkish opposition leader, Erdo\u011fan still had the style of a <em>maganda</em> \u2013 a boorish lout. (Erdo\u011fan promptly sued.)</p> <p>The liberals protesting against Erdo\u011fan in the summer of 2013 enjoyed mocking the monstrous <em>maganda</em> palace he was building for himself in Ankara \u2013 which ended up costing more than $600m and was built in brazen violation of a court ruling that it was illegal. Last October Erdo\u011fan castigated opposition leaders who dared to criticise the palace for trying to weaken a \u201cdemocratically-elected president\u201d. For Erdo\u011fan, what justifies his contempt for both the opposition and the law is the fact that he wins elections. In this view, the defeat of the attempted coup was the biggest election of all, and his most decisive victory. It was a huge and spontaneous plebiscite, and Turkey will probably never hear the end of it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"06f6129cc8adbc6419287b2a142ea46cf5898626\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/06f6129cc8adbc6419287b2a142ea46cf5898626/426_922_4081_2448/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Police and civilians celebrate the thwarting of the coup, on the Bosphorus bridge in Istanbul.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Police and civilians celebrate the thwarting of the coup, on the Bosphorus bridge in Istanbul.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Emrah Gurel/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>* * *</h2> <p>For the past few years \u2013 but especially in the past six weeks \u2013 Erdo\u011fan has redefined Turkish democracy to give himself a mandate to interpret and even anticipate the will of the majority while absolving himself of the responsibility to protect minorities.</p> <p>In his obvious aspiration to personify the nation, there is only one man who can rival him: Atat\u00fcrk. Until the final defeat of the Kemalist establishment in the late-2000s, Atat\u00fcrk was everywhere: his handsome features on the TV screens, his aphorisms emblazoned in bus stations, his name intoned in every speech. Erdo\u011fan now is as visible as Atat\u00fcrk was then \u2013 and equally protected from criticism. \u201cWith your elevated permission,\u201d the TV interviewers tiptoe, as they nervously pose their questions.</p> <p>The events of this summer have taken his popularity to a new level: a poll taken several weeks after the coup found that 68% of Turks approve of his handling of the situation. This is a lot more than the 52% of voters who propelled him to the presidency in 2014, when it seemed that the blush might be coming off the Erdo\u011fan bloom. Erdo\u011fan\u2019s ad hoc supporters include Kurds \u2013 Kurdish nationalists have been sorely mistreated by G\u00fclenist policemen and judiciary officials \u2013 as well as secularists who despise the G\u00fclen movement\u2019s secretive, cultish character.</p> <p>The president\u2019s standing was not harmed by the fact that he seems to have faced considerable personal danger on the night of the coup. He escaped capture in Marmaris by a matter of minutes and the presidential jet was buzzed mid-air by rebel F-16s on its way to Istanbul\u2019s Atat\u00fcrk airport; it could only land once the control tower had been liberated from the putschists. Erdo\u011fan is a bruiser from a hardscrabble Istanbul neighbourhood, whose legendary stare of disapproval has been known to terrify grown men; few Turks would have been surprised to hear that his sang-froid did not falter even when it looked as if the coup might succeed.</p> <p>When Erdo\u011fan played semi-professional football as a young man \u2013 he declined to turn pro because his father disapproved \u2013 he was known for warning his teammates about the perils of drinking and looking at girls. Now, at 62, he is Turkey\u2019s own severe father, who refuses to let the country\u2019s honour be soiled.</p> <p>His brilliance as a communicator \u2013 an aspect that tends to be ignored by his critics \u2013 is shown to best effect when he addresses his supporters directly. But none of his speeches that I have seen can compare in intensity and sophistication to the address he delivered nine days after the coup, praising the \u201cmartyrs\u201d who lost their lives defending the nation against the coup.</p> <p>The setting was a vertiginous conference hall attached to Erdo\u011fan\u2019s ostentatious new palace in Ankara. Among the crowd were the families of the martyrs, some holding framed photos of a husband or son. Some of the heroes of the resistance were also present \u2013 one on a stretcher. The president took to the stage in a dark suit and purple tie. Soon he was feeling expertly for the limits of his voice, alternating between hoarse denunciations of the coup, and low confiding riffs on the sanctity of death in the service of a holy cause.</p> <p>\u201cAfter prophethood,\u201d he said, \u201cmartyrdom is the next highest station\u201d; he confessed that he envied those who had fallen on the night of the coup. Then, he attacked the credulous G\u00fclenists, \u201cpoor fools\u201d and \u201capostates\u201d who had deluded themselves into believing that their leader was touched by divinity; for as Erdo\u011fan remonstrated sternly, \u201cwe are the slaves only of our God \u2026 only in prayer, in God\u2019s presence, do we genuflect.\u201d</p> <p>Rarely in Ankara \u2013 Atat\u00fcrk\u2019s citadel of secularism \u2013 can a speech by a politician have been so suffused with ideas of faith and infidelity. But for all his religiosity, Erdo\u011fan is arguably more of a nationalist than he is an Islamist: he is too much of a Turkish patriot to subscribe to a pan-Islamist ideology that would dissolve borders of land and ethnicity. His speech was as much about the pain and ecstasy of Turkishness as it was about God, and he quoted many stanzas of patriotic poetry \u2013 he has an excellent memory for verse and a fine delivery.</p> <p>\u201cThe martyrs\u2019 graveyard is not empty,\u201d the president declaimed, \u201cthe heroes await the earth, and the flag awaits the breeze to flutter.\u201d Returning the obvious adoration of his audience, he interrupted himself wonderingly: \u201cWhat a happy, what a blessed people we are \u2026 nowhere in the world can your equal be found.\u201d</p> <p>Of course a nation is nothing without enemies, and in Erdo\u011fan\u2019s depiction the failed coup exposed not one, but many. Referring to the mealy-mouthed reaction of Turkey\u2019s erstwhile western allies, he asked, \u201cAre we surprised?\u201d and then answered his own question with a no. \u201cAre we saddened? Yes, we are human.\u201d But what he called the \u201crebirth\u201d of 15 July had shown the Turks, he continued, that \u201cwe can expect neither justice, nor help, nor support, nor understanding from anyone \u2026 whatever we do, we\u2019ll do it ourselves.\u201d</p> <p>In this way, uniting the themes of faith, nation and death, the president piped his followers to a state of weeping, cheering helplessness. In their front rooms, at \u201cdemocracy vigils\u201d in main squares across the country, millions more watched him on screen. The following day, in conversations with ordinary Istanbullus, I heard many of them repeat phrases borrowed from Erdo\u011fan\u2019s speech \u2013 the sentiments of the leader, absorbed among the people as if by osmosis.</p> <p>The president\u2019s habit of referring to \u201cmy people\u201d; his promise to remake the Turkish state \u201croot and branch\u201d to undo the damage done by the G\u00fclenists; the economic objectives he has set for 2023, the centenary of the republic\u2019s founding \u2013 nothing here suggests a man who expects to become irrelevant. Erdo\u011fan has hollowed out the country\u2019s institutions \u2013 including the military, at long last \u2013 and has made himself even more indispensable. No problem is not of his making, and no solution possible without him.</p> <p>The constitution allows the president two five-year terms, which would take Erdo\u011fan to 2024 \u2013 21 years after he first became prime minister. But constitutions can change.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"b3e24740b88c456f61431147eb395b79696ff872\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b3e24740b88c456f61431147eb395b79696ff872/0_84_1579_1721/917.jpg\" alt=\"The then Prime Minister Erdo\u011fan shows ioff his football skills to the Queen, in 2008\" width=\"917\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The then Prime Minister Erdo\u011fan shows off his football skills to the Queen, in 2008.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Firat Yurdakul/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>* * *</h2> <p>The world\u2019s growing ranks of elected authoritarians may be refashioning democracy in their own image, but they still face considerable obstacles to out-and-out despotism. These regimes are defined in part by their proud disregard for the views of the minority \u2013 but an unrelenting majoritarianism hardens the opposition of the excluded.</p> <p>Erdo\u011fan still operates under significant political constraints. The country\u2019s Kurdish, Alevi, and secularist communities, who distrust him intensely, add up to roughly half of Turkey\u2019s population of 75 million. For all the AKP\u2019s status as Turkey\u2019s unrivalled party of government, under Erdo\u011fan\u2019s unquestioned dominance, he has not been able to compel parliament to give him the enhanced powers of the executive presidency he covets.</p> <p>Nor does Erdo\u011fan\u2019s authority as an embodiment of Turkish Sunni conservatism mean that he is about to turn on those who do not embrace this identity; it is doubtful that he would have the support of his base to do so. A recent privately commissioned poll to which I have had access shows that while a majority of Turkish voters want a ban on alcohol and almost half would support the use of illegal means in the fight against terrorism, there is also wide support for abstract notions such as liberty and freedom of expression.</p> <p>Erdo\u011fan trumpets his adherence to the will of his people, but he does not blindly pursue its whims. Having oscillated between Europhilia and Islamic fervour, universalism and isolationism, war and peace, it is clear that his political trajectory is that of a pragmatist who likes to keep his options open. His failure to pursue a ban on alcohol, despite the fact that it would please the base, is another instance of his pragmatism. That he regards secularism as useful \u2013 perhaps as a means of averting sectarian conflict \u2013 was demonstrated when he urged Mohamed Morsi to build a secular state after coming to power in Egypt in 2011.</p> <p>Even amid the purges, Erdo\u011fan has withdrawn all the suits he brought for insulting him \u2013 with the exception of the German comic, that is. He has also suspended hostilities with the main opposition party, the Alevi- and secularist-dominated Republican People\u2019s party (CHP). The CHP leader, Kemal K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7daro\u011flu, himself an Alevi, was Erdo\u011fan\u2019s guest at a huge rally in Istanbul on 7 August, which allowed the president to stress the broad nature of the coalition against the coup, including people \u201cfrom all roots and of all spirits\u201d.</p> <p>Turkey is now trying to back out of its Syrian dead-end, and softening its opposition to the idea that Assad might retain a role in the postwar transition. Last week, the Turkish army joined the United States in a major cross-border offensive against Islamic State \u2013 with the additional aim of preventing the Syrian Kurds from establishing their own state on Turkey\u2019s southern border. To the north, the PKK may be preparing for a possible return to negotiations with Erdo\u011fan, having denounced the coup and announcing its readiness to help \u201cbuild a democratic Turkey\u201d.</p> <p>What that might look like is anyone\u2019s guess. The reign of Erdo\u011fan and other leaders in his mould is a clear sign that there is no longer a single model of democracy, stamped with EU or US approval, to which all countries aspire. It has long been common to contrast the emphasis laid by emerging non-western democracies on the will of the majority with the care taken by \u201cmature\u201d democracies to protect minority rights. But this flattering distinction may no longer be valid. The picture from France, the United States, and to an extent Britain suggests that a brazen majoritarianism has emerged from the crises and upheavals of the past decade. Erdo\u011fan may not resemble our stated democratic ideals, but he may be their future.

An investigation published by Human Rights Watch in July <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2016/07/07/us-deaths-immigration-detention\">found evidence of substandard medical care</a> at a number of facilities, while protests at privately operated family detention centres in Texas <a href=\"http://www.mysanantonio.com/news/local/article/Hundreds-protest-Obama-s-immigration-policy-in-6238231.php\">have become commonplace</a>.</p> <p>The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) detains a total of 33,676 people, as of the beginning of August, with an overwhelming 24,567 (or 72%) of these held in the country\u2019s 46 private detention facilities.

His 2013 New York City mayoral bid foundered on a similar scandal.</p> <p>Weiner\u2019s Twitter account has been deleted. The Clinton campaign did not immediately reply to a request for comment. </p> <p>The Post on Monday published texts and images said to have been sent and received by Weiner about a year ago, in July 2015. The images include one that appears to have been sent by Weiner in which his young son, asleep, is visible in the background.</p> <p>As his mayoral bid collapsed, Abedin, already anticipating Clinton\u2019s presidential run, appeared alongside Weiner and expressed support for him. She did not appear at a concession speech he gave at the end of the campaign.

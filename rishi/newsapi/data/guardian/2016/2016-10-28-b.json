  "<p>The FBI is investigating newly discovered emails related to Hillary Clinton\u2019s personal server, its director has announced.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2016/oct/28/us-election-live-donald-trump-news-hillary-clinton\">FBI to reopen investigation of Clinton private email server \u2013 campaign live</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The FBI had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/05/fbi-no-charges-hillary-clinton-email-investigation\">announced in July</a> that its investigation into the Democratic presidential candidate\u2019s private email server had concluded with a recommendation of no criminal charges in the matter, although James Comey, the FBI\u2019s director, criticised Clinton as \u201ccareless\u201d.</p> <p>But in a letter sent to members of Congress on Friday, Comey said new emails had been discovered in an \u201cunrelated\u201d case.<br></p> <p>\u201cIn connection with an unrelated case, the FBI has learned of the existence of emails that appear to be pertinent to the investigation,\u201d Comey wrote. \u201cI am writing to inform you that the investigative team briefed me on this yesterday, and I agreed that the FBI should take appropriate investigative steps designed to allow investigators to review these emails to determine whether they contain classified information as well as to assess their importance to our investigation.\u201d<br></p> <p>Comey added: \u201cAlthough the FBI cannot yet assess whether or not this material may be significant and I cannot predict how long it will take to complete this additional work, I believe it is important to update your Committees about our efforts in light of my previous testimony.\u201d</p> <p>At an evening press conference in Des Moines, Iowa, Clinton briefly addressed the letter to reporters. \u201cThe American people deserve to get the full and complete facts immediately,\u201d she said. \u201cThe director himself has said he doesn\u2019t know whether the emails referenced in his letter are significant or not.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m confident whatever they are will not change the conclusion reached in July,\u201d she concluded, alluding to Comey\u2019s finding of \u201c<a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/05/fbi-no-charges-hillary-clinton-email-investigation\">extremely careless</a>\u201d email practices but no criminal wrongdoing.</p> <p>Her rival, Donald Trump, also remarked on the letter, telling rallygoers: \u201cThe system might not be as rigged as I thought.\u201d</p> <p>A US security source firmly ruled out that the \u201cunrelated case\u201d Comey referred to in his letter was the investigation into the hacking of the Democratic National Committee earlier this year. US intelligence officials have <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/oct/07/us-russia-dnc-hack-interfering-presidential-election\">blamed Russia</a> for hacking the DNC and releasing its internal communications online.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>The source, who would not speak on the record, said neither that inquiry nor its adjuncts were related to the new investigative developments related to Clinton. Nor is the recent criminal <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/08/accused-nsa-contractor-harold-martin-ex-wife-interview-classified-information\">investigation into a National Security Agency contractor</a> accused of hoarding highly classified intelligence data.</p> <p>Later the Associated Press, citing an unnamed official, claimed the newly discovered emails \u201c<a href=\"https://twitter.com/AP_Politics/status/792076589190316032\">did not come from her private server</a>\u201d. Several outlets <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/29/us/politics/fbi-hillary-clinton-email.html?hp&amp;action=click&amp;pgtype=Homepage&amp;clickSource=story-heading&amp;module=span-ab-top-region&amp;region=top-news&amp;WT.nav=top-news\">have reported</a> that the emails came from devices seized from top Clinton aide Huma Abedin and her husband, former congressman Anthony Weiner, in connection to an investigation of inappropriate text messages that Weiner sent to an underage girl.</p> <p>The letter from Comey comes 11 days before the presidential election and nearly four months after the FBI director <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/05/fbi-no-charges-hillary-clinton-email-investigation\">announced</a> the bureau would not recommend criminal charges against Clinton for what it dubbed \u201cextremely careless\u201d use of a private email server while secretary of state. The FBI director said then: \u201cAlthough there is evidence of potential violations of the statutes \u2026 our judgment is that no reasonable prosecutor would bring such a case.\u201d</p> <p>Clinton was campaigning in Iowa. It was not immediately clear if she would address the matter publicly and she ignored shouted questions from reporters waiting on the airport tarmac. She did not raise the issue after taking the stage in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, sticking with her routine stump speech.</p> <p>In Des Moines, she referred to the news only obliquely, saying: \u201cWe have got to keep our foot on the gas. Donald Trump says he can still win and he is right. You know this has been such an unusual election. I don\u2019t take any place, anyone or anything for granted. I am going to work as hard as I can until the end.\u201d</p> <p>Her campaign chairman, John Podesta, called on Comey to \u201cimmediately provide the American public more information than is contained in the letter he sent to eight Republican committee chairmen\u201d. </p> <p>\u201cAlready, we have seen characterizations that the FBI is \u2018reopening\u2019 an investigation, but Comey\u2019s words do not match that characterization,\u201d he said. \u201cDirector Comey\u2019s letter refers to emails that have come to light in an unrelated case, but we have no idea what those emails are and the director himself notes they may not even be significant.\u201d</p> <p>He added that he was \u201cconfident this will not produce any conclusions different from the one the FBI reached in July\u201d.</p> <p>Clinton\u2019s running mate, Virginia senator Tim Kaine, told reporters he had to \u201cread a little more\u201d when asked about the matter on the campaign trail in Florida.</p> <p>The Dow Jones fell more than 100 points after the release of Comey\u2019s letter.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/oct/28/trump-responds-fbi-investigation-clinton-emails-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/59yj8\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2850182\"            data-video-name=\"Trump gleefully responds to new FBI investigation into Clinton emails \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"Reuters\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-5813975ce4b08d944ba4bb6c\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/10/28/161028Trump_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/10/28/161028Trump.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/10/28/161028Trump_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/oct/28/trump-responds-fbi-investigation-clinton-emails-video\">Trump gleefully responds to new FBI probe into Clinton emails</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>The controversy over Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server while at the state department has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/mar/11/hillary-clintons-candidate-un-press-conference-republicans\">loomed over her candidacy</a> since before she even announced her intent to seek the White House in April. Clinton\u2019s use of a \u201chomebrew\u201d email server left emails containing classified information potentially <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/oct/13/hillary-clinton-email-server-connection-vulnerable-to-hackers\">vulnerable to foreign hackers</a>, and her <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/05/hillary-clinton-emails-fbi-investigation-next-steps\">deletion of 33,000 emails</a> deemed personal has been a major campaign issue.</p> <p>Trump took the stage to a cheering crowd in New Hampshire shortly after the news broke. \u201cThey are reopening the case into her criminal and illegal conduct that threatens the security of the United States of America,\u201d the Republican nominee said to loud chants of \u201clock her up\u201d.</p> <p>He continued to assail his rival in deeply personal terms. \u201cHillary Clinton\u2019s corruption is on a scale we have never seen before \u2013 we must not let her take her criminal scheme into the Oval Office,\u201d Trump said. </p> <p>Trump, who has long claimed that the former secretary of state was only allowed to run for the White House because of a \u201crigged system\u201d, added: \u201cI have great respect for the fact that the FBI and Department of Justice are now willing to have the courage to right the horrible mistake that they made.\u201d</p> <p>Trump\u2019s running mate, Indiana governor Mike Pence, also pounced on the news while campaigning in Pennsylvania \u2013 bringing the crowd to its feet when informing supporters of the FBI\u2019s announcement. <br></p> <p>\u201cWe commend the FBI for having the courage to reopen this case, because no one is above the law,\u201d Pence said.</p> <p>The Republican vice-presidential nominee also called on the FBI to make public all emails pertinent to the investigation.<br></p> <p>In a statement, the House speaker, Paul Ryan, condemned Clinton\u2019s behavior. \u201cYet again, Hillary Clinton has nobody but herself to blame. She was entrusted with some of our nation\u2019s most important secrets, and she betrayed that trust by carelessly mishandling highly classified information.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/frankthorp/status/792049114624163840\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">BIG: The FBI is reopening its investigation into <a href=\"https://twitter.com/HillaryClinton\">@HillaryClinton</a>&#39;s email server.

Feinstein had praised Comey in July for a \u201cthorough, objective review\u201d, after the FBI director declined to recommend an indictment over Clinton\u2019s private email service.</p> <p>Comey had \u201cplayed right into the political campaign of Donald Trump,\u201d Feinstein said, adding that his departure from the FBI\u2019s \u201chistory of extreme caution near Election Day\u201d was \u201cappalling\u201d.</p> <p>Democrats also complained in private that Comey\u2019s letter was vague and raised more questions than it answered.<br></p> <p>The Republican National Committee was quick to cast the FBI\u2019s announcement as a reopening of the investigation into whether Clinton engaged in criminal behavior \u2013 even though the nature of the new inquiry remained unclear.<br></p> <p>\u201cThe FBI\u2019s decision to reopen their criminal investigation into Hillary Clinton\u2019s secret email server just 11 days before the election shows how serious this discovery must be,\u201d the RNC chairman, Reince Priebus, said in a statement. <br></p> <p>\u201cThis stunning development raises serious questions about what records may not have been turned over and why, and whether they show intent to violate the law.<br></p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s indisputable is that Hillary Clinton jeopardized classified information on thousands of occasions in her reckless attempt to hide pay-to-play corruption at her State Department,\u201d he added. \u201cThis alone should be disqualifying for anyone seeking the presidency, a job that is supposed to begin each morning with a top secret intelligence briefing.\u201d</p>",

The fact that the evidence in question reportedly comes from a separate investigation into a sex scandal engulfing Anthony Weiner, the estranged of husband of Huma Abedin, one of Clinton\u2019s key aides, should make it less relevant to her security case, not more.</p> <p>But there is little doubt it gives everyone something to talk about in the 11 days left before election day. Unless the FBI moves far faster than is normal to clarify that there is nothing new of significance here, Democrats may also struggle to come up with convincing answers to questions that will undoubtedly weigh on the minds of some voters.</p>",
  "<p>The election approaches; the nation seethes; the hatred festers; the dead start to talk. Old intolerances have come roaring back as the United States finally reaches the end of the most virulent, vacuous presidential contest in living memory.

Against the current backdrop of racist demagoguery and national disbelief, it arrives as a godsend. This stone-cold stunner of a retrospective \u2013 spanning two floors of the Met\u2019s luxury rental on Madison Avenue, and organized with judicious restraint by <a href=\"http://www.metmuseum.org/blogs/now-at-the-met/features/2013/spectrum-spotlight-ian-alteveer\">Ian Alteveer </a>and Meredith Brown \u2013 proudly insists on the place of African Americans in the American artistic imagination. And yet that is only one of its achievements. It also, and perhaps more powerfully, grounds that placement <em>inside</em> a larger western artistic tradition, and utilizes the very tropes and techniques once used in exclusionary imagery to new, more moral ends.<strong> </strong>(The show opened last April at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Chicago, Marshall\u2019s hometown; <a href=\"http://chicago.suntimes.com/entertainment/first-lady-michelle-obama-visited-the-museum-of-contemporary-art/\">Michelle Obama made time to see it</a>.

Not the shades of brown skin we misleadingly call \u201cblack\u201d, but <em>black</em>. It\u2019s achieved through the admixture of several different pigments \u2013 coal black, or an ivory black produced from charred bones, or else something called <a href=\"http://www.wetcanvas.com/forums/showthread.php?t=591544\">mars black</a>, which is made from iron oxide. The blacks gain further richness through blue or golden undertones, but no white is mixed into the pigment to model the actual flesh tones of African Americans.</p> <p>His small, breakthrough painting <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/artwork/kerry-james-marshall-a-portrait-of-the-artist-as-a-shadow-of-his-former-self\">A Portrait of the Artist as a Shadow of His Former Self</a> (1980) features a man whose jet-black skin just barely can be distinguished from the dark gray background. A fedora perches on his head cartoonishly, and teeth and eyeballs disrupt the crepuscular surface with shocks of white. Lean into this disturbing, uncanny work when you encounter the portrait in one of the early galleries here. At first the indeterminate, half-visible figure appears an instantiation of <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/invisible-man.html\">Ralph Ellison\u2019s invisible man</a>. Seen up close, the portrait\u2019s gemlike hardness recalls the exactitude, but also the opacity, of Flemish portraiture \u2013 and, indeed, this is a rare work done with old-style, fast-drying egg tempera, rather than the malleable acrylic he would later embrace. (The exhibition\u2019s title, Mastry, is a brilliant, misspelled rejoinder to the old designation of skilled northern European artists as masters.) This \u201cshadow\u201d of Marshall has been cast by Renaissance depictions and minstrel shows alike, and by the constraints of not just American life but European high art.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"06dc2ad5a7085c29681498ea05635b75fc09845e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/06dc2ad5a7085c29681498ea05635b75fc09845e/0_0_3250_2247/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Souvenir I, 1997\" width=\"1000\" height=\"691\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Souvenir I, 1997.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Joe Ziolkowski, \u00a9 MCA Chicago/Kerry James Marshall</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>So Marshall\u2019s uncanny, intense blackness has both a personal derivation and a conceptual underpinning. His figures are not faithful depiction of black individuals. They\u2019re signs, and they channel and frustrate a centuries-long history of representations of blackness as evil, inferior, or simply absent \u2013 before then, gloriously, asserting the prestige afforded to those representations as Marshall\u2019s rightful inheritance. Marshall paints barbershops and housing projects, spaces of black community and independence, and he also frequently turns to interiors: black people in bed, in their living room, reading a book, listening to music. But these depictions are not ends in themselves, any more than C\u00e9zanne\u2019s still lifes are advertisements for apples. His black-pitched portraits and genre scenes gain their force, rather, from the historical tradition they partially embrace, partially refute, and ultimately expand.</p> <p>Sometimes Marshall can dip into a citational mode that gets a bit facile, a bit look-what-I-know, as in a barbershop panorama that features a cartoon white girl in the manner of <a href=\"https://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/hans-holbein-the-younger-the-ambassadors\">the distorted skull in Holbein\u2019s Ambassadors</a>. He is far better when he trusts his art history to serve as the mood music for his contemporary visions, above all in the largest gallery of this retrospective: a suite of nine giant paintings of Chicago and Los Angeles housing projects, plus suburban landscapes that wink heavily at the pastoral tradition. A black family sprawled out at a lakeside picnic recalls, but hardly imitates, the bourgeois snackers of <a href=\"http://www.musee-orsay.fr/index.php?id=851&amp;L=1&amp;tx_commentaire_pi1%5BshowUid%5D=7123\">Manet\u2019s D\u00e9jeuner sur l\u2019Herbe</a>; children in an LA project frolic in the grass like rococo pleasure-seekers, and paintball-like flowers stud the painting\u2019s surface.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f8e47a6777ac79f27cf15d62a1c1697e353aca08\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f8e47a6777ac79f27cf15d62a1c1697e353aca08/0_0_5233_3014/1000.jpg\" alt=\"7am Sunday Morning, 2003\" width=\"1000\" height=\"576\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">7am Sunday Morning, 2003.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kerry James Marshall/Museum of Contemporary Art Chicago</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>These paintings draw on art history not as a crutch, and not as a clapback. They draw on the past as a set of procedures, which Marshall combines and reworks to depict black bodies with a sophistication and intricacy usually not afforded them. Only that way, Marshall seems to insist, can black lives be seen as lives that matter. You can neither junk the past nor outrun it, but you can recode its values, and make the past your own. (A pendant show here, Kerry James Marshall Selects, offers a revealing glimpse of the artist\u2019s sources and inspirations: a stern portrait from the workshop of Hans Holbein, flowing figure studies by Veronese, <a href=\"http://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/491419\">a social-realist lithograph</a> by his former teacher Charles Wilbert White, and <a href=\"http://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/267361\">a photograph of Gerhard Richter\u2019s wife, smudged with paint</a>.)</p> <p>The very conception of western artistic beauty, <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=124700316\">as the historian Nell Irvin Painter has written</a>, springs from a racialized misunderstanding of the Greek ideal, as 18th-century aesthetes elevated the white marbles they venerated into the very standard of elegance.

A broad-nosed woman wearing a patterned smock stands before an in-progress canvas, seemingly a self-portrait, that slyly reveals a paint-by-numbers outline.

That guy from The Apprentice is running. He\u2019s already been caught on tape bragging about groping women against their will. Also, he\u2019s suggested suspending the democratic process so that he can be awarded the presidency without a single vote being cast. He\u2019s also emboldened his supporters to publicly threaten an armed resistance if Hillary Clinton wins. Plus, there\u2019s a Lethal Weapon remake on Fox starring Damon Wayans and some guy you\u2019ve never heard of. This has been a horrible year for our country. I\u2019m so sorry that you had to live through this, plus endure Wolf Blitzer narrating the whole thing from the Situation Room.

Leaving the EU will also significantly diminish the U.K.\u2019s capacity to influence EU policy on key sectors of the U.K. economy, such as financial services, that are vital to the U.K.\u2019s economic performance.</p> <p>Brexit could also, over time, diminish sterling\u2019s role as a global reserve currency.

This decision will be followed by at least two years of negotiations on the terms of EU departure. While two years may suffice to negotiate a successor treaty that will have to be endorsed by European national parliaments and the European parliament, and could face referendums in one or more member states, the process could take much longer.</p> <p>The risks of an inconclusive or detrimental outcome are also material. While some believe the U.K. can arrive at a beneficial agreement with the EU, others take the view that the remaining EU members will have no incentive to accommodate the U.K. Rather, their focus will be on detering other potential departures and containing the rise of their own national eurosceptic movements.</p> <p>In particular, it is not clear if the EU will permit the U.K. access to the single market on existing tariff-free terms, or impose tariffs on U.K. products. Further arrangements regarding the export of services, including by the U.K.\u2019s important financial services industry, are even more uncertain, in our view.</p> <p>Given that curtailing immigration was a major motivating issue for leave voters, it is also uncertain whether the U.K. would agree to a trade deal that requires the country to accept the free movement of labor from the EU. The negotiation process is therefore fraught with potential challenges and vetos, making the outcome unpredictable.</p> <p>We also believe that the divisions, both within the ruling Conservative Party and society as a whole over the European question, may not heal quickly and may hamper government stability and complicate policymaking on economic and other matters.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a64b67309f7f2c0444f9b0e1b8f06fa12cd3c9c5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a64b67309f7f2c0444f9b0e1b8f06fa12cd3c9c5/0_39_1638_1165/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Scotland\u2019s First Minister Nicola Sturgeon .\" width=\"1000\" height=\"711\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Scotland\u2019s First Minister Nicola Sturgeon .</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Milligan/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <blockquote> <p>In addition, we take the view that the Scottish National Party will push for another referendum on Scottish independence, given that the Scottish population voted overwhelmingly in favor of remaining within the EU.

Northern Ireland is another source of potential issues.</p> <p>These multiple and significant challenges will be very demanding and will detract from macroeconomic goals, such as maintaining growth and consolidating public finances. The lack of clarity while negotiations ensue will also significantly deter private investment. At the same time, we continue to recognize many of the U.K.\u2019s institutional strengths. </p> <p>The U.K. benefits from its flexible and open economy and, in our view, has prospered as an EU member. We believe that the U.K. economy has been able to attract higher inflows of low-cost capital and skilled labor than it would have without the preferential access that EU membership delivers.

Experts expect the Fed to go for a quarter-point rise in December. </p> <p>Greg Valliere, chief global strategist at Horizon Investments, said: \u201cThis is still another reason why Trump will probably lose. The economy is in decent shape \u2013 so decent that the Fed will have to raise interest rates later this year.</p> <p>\u201cThis report shows a solid economy with \u2013 ironically \u2013 decent export growth. Hillary Clinton simply has to avoid gloating. But this is a big plus for her, and she may get another pleasant surprise when the October jobs report is released next Friday.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>One of the frontrunners to become the new Ukip leader has used his official campaign launch to defend Donald Trump and to call for a national referendum on banning women from wearing the niqab.</p> <p>Speaking in front of a few dozen supporters at a pub in Westminster, Raheem Kassam also appeared to cast doubt on the veracity of women accusing the US Republican presidential candidate of sexual assault, and said he did not believe Trump had anti-Muslim views.</p> <p>Kassam, 30, a former staffer for Nigel Farage who now runs the <a href=\"http://www.breitbart.com/london/\">UK arm of the rightwing US news network Breitbart</a>, is second favourite with bookmakers behind Paul Nuttall, an MEP and deputy leader, to be voted the next Ukip leader.</p> <p>Suzanne Evans, a former Conservative councillor who compiled the party\u2019s 2015 election manifesto, is also standing.

And we shouldn\u2019t be trying to drag this party to the squishy centre ground. </p> <p>\u201cWe should be proud of what I call Faragism \u2013 a belief in your country, a belief in your culture, a belief in the people of this great nation.\u201d </p> <p>Kassam\u2019s candidacy has attracted immediate controversy, notably over his <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://twitter.com/RaheemKassam?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">prolific and often robust Twitter feed</a>, which has <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/raheem-kassam-ukip-leadership-election-twitter-deleted_uk_580cf387e4b056572d82f392\">included a deeply personal insult against Nicola Sturgeon</a>, for which he again apologised.</p> <p>He has also attracted attention for his appreciation of Trump \u2013 Kassam\u2019s campaign slogan of \u201cMake Ukip Great Again\u201d echoes the Republican candidate\u2019s motto.</p> <p>While describing his slogan as \u201ca bit tongue in cheek\u201d, Kassam reiterated that he would supported Trump in the 8 November election, saying: \u201cI hope he wins over crooked Hillary, certainly.\u201d</p> <p>Kassam told reporters after his speech: \u201cI\u2019m not endorsing him. What I\u2019ve said it that I prefer him to win than Hillary Clinton. I\u2019ve got no problem with endorsing him, it\u2019s just that I don\u2019t think my endorsement makes any difference either way.\u201d</p> <p>He declined to condemn Trump\u2019s policies, such as the mooted <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/dec/07/donald-trump-ban-all-muslims-entering-us-san-bernardino-shooting\">proposal to bar all Muslims from entering the US</a>, saying: \u201cI don\u2019t believe he has anti-Muslim views.\u201d Kassam added: \u201cI can see where his supporters\u2019 frustrations were in supporting the blanket ban, but I think we have a much better plan of how to deal with radical Islam.\u201d</p> <p>Asked about the series of women who have accused Trump of sexual assault, Kassam said he had doubts about the claims, saying: \u201cI don\u2019t know. I think it\u2019s strange that somebody who was a celebrity for so many years only has these things come out right at the tail end of a presidential campaign.\u201d</p> <p>It was possible that the women \u201cdid not feel that he had enough support to speak out\u201d in the past, he added.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.makeukipgreatagain.com/\">Kassam\u2019s personal manifesto</a> is strongly rightwing, including massive cuts to the foreign aid budget, and a focus on cutting immigration and measures targeting elements of Islam, including an end to forms of halal slaughter.</p> <p>Kassam, who was brought up in a Muslim family but says he now has no religious faith, said he supported a referendum on banning the use of the niqab, the most conservative form of Islamic dress for women, which covers the face. </p> <p>\u201cI think most people in this country are OK with the hijab,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I would want a referendum on the niqab.\u201d</p> <p>After James resigned, the immediate favourite to replace her was Steven Woolfe, a former barrister and now an MEP. However, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/17/ukip-mep-steven-woolfe-quits-party\">he left the party</a> in the wake of a scuffle with a fellow Ukip MEP, Mike Hookem, amid a dispute about Woolfe\u2019s admission he had almost defected to the Conservatives.</p> <p>Woolfe spent three days in hospital after the fracas, and said Hookem had punched him. However, a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/26/ukip-blames-mep-steven-woolfe-row-hookem-european-parliament-police\">party investigation into the incident</a> said Woolfe appeared primarily to blame. </p>",
  "<p>An unusual election year has ushered in an unusual silence: the issue of abortion, almost always a cause for pitched battles between presidential candidates, has been all but invisible on the national stage as the campaign between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton draws to a close.</p> \n<p>There have been moments of high drama. Trump\u2019s call for \u201cpunishment\u201d when women get abortions in illegal circumstances collided with Clinton\u2019s demand, unprecedented for a major party presidential candidate, to roll back a 40-year restriction on public funds for abortion. And the third presidential debate saw Trump unleash an inflammatory line of attack, saying Clinton supported policy allowing doctors to \u201crip\u201d infants out of the womb days before birth.</p> \n<p>But contrast that with 2012, when the Republican ticket struggled to escape accusations that the party had waged a war on women\u2019s reproductive health. This year, only a handful of ballot races have revolved around issues of abortions.</p> \n<p>It\u2019s causing major abortion rights groups, a fixture in modern politics, to readjust.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/16/donald-trump-abortion-coalition-public-funding-planned-parenthood\">Trump forms anti-abortion coalition and would ban public funding for procedure</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>\u201cTrump\u2019s record with women took up a lot of air in this election,\u201d said Marcy Stech, a spokeswoman for Emily\u2019s List.

Some of its canvassing is aimed at discouraging support for Clinton. But a substantial proportion is aimed at keeping control of the Senate seats, in states such as Missouri and Florida, that are crucial to a Republican majority. </p> \n<p>These canvassers are highlighting Clinton\u2019s longtime support for abortion rights, said Mallory Quigley, a spokeswoman for SBA List, including her \u201cextremist\u201d vote as senator in 2003 against a ban on a method of second- and third-trimester abortion. </p> \n<p>Trump\u2019s record as an anti-abortion rights crusader, by contrast, is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/16/donald-trump-abortion-coalition-public-funding-planned-parenthood\">much shorter</a>. In an August 2015 primary debate, Trump said he could not commit to defunding Planned Parenthood without considering how the organization was \u201cgood for women\u201d. He did not commit to stripping Planned Parenthood of federal funds until this past February. Then, in April, Trump suggested that as president he would make no effort to overturn Roe v Wade. \u201cThe laws are set,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I think we have to leave it that way.\u201d He reversed himself one month later, telling Fox host Bill O\u2019Reilly that as president he would nominate \u201cpro life judges\u201d to the supreme court. </p> \n<p>But the reaction of pro- and anti-abortion rights activists alike has been to gloss over Trump\u2019s bumpy journey on abortion rights. </p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/30/planned-parenthood-state-repeal-abortion-restrictions\">Planned Parenthood: eight states now striving to repeal abortion restrictions</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>\u201cWe can only go by what he has said in this campaign,\u201d Long said. \u201cThat has ranged from saying that a woman should be punished for having an abortion\u201d if the procedure were illegal \u201cto taking advice, we assume, and talking points from anti-choice politicians like Mike Pence\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t doubt his sincerity,\u201d said Quigley of Trump\u2019s current anti-abortion views. \u201cIn the third debate, you could really feel his passion.\u201d Trump himself, she added, has acknowledged that he is a convert to the cause. </p> \n<p>Still, it was only nine months ago that Marjorie Dannenfelser, the president of SBA List, <a href=\"https://www.sba-list.org/home/pro-life-women-sound-the-alarmdonald-trump-is-unacceptable\">pleaded</a> with Iowa caucus-goers in an open letter to \u201csupport anyone but Donald Trump\u201d.</p> \n<p>Pressed on this, Quigley replied: \u201cWell, when it came down to a general election scenario, and we had two candidates, there is no question.

Asked about abortion late in a pregnancy, Trump opened up an inflammatory line of attack. \u201cIf you go with what Hillary is saying,\u201d Trump said, \u201cyou can take the baby and rip the baby out of the womb in the ninth month on the final day.\u201d</p> \n<p>Clinton shot back that many terminations late in pregnancy take place when \u201csomething terrible has happened or just been discovered about the pregnancy\u201d.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/19/abortion-trump-clinton-debate\">Clinton condemns Trump's abortion 'scare rhetoric' in debate question</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>\u201cUsing that kind of scare rhetoric is just terribly unfortunate,\u201d she said.</p> \n<p>The exchange concerned one of the least understood and most controversial types of abortion \u2013 those taking place when the fetus approaches or passes the point of viability.</p> \n<p>It is a topic wracked by falsehoods. Wallace raised the issue of \u201cpartial birth abortion\u201d, a political term that doesn\u2019t readily correspond to a specific medical procedure, but which Congress nonetheless banned more than a decade ago. In 2003, the ban was upheld by the supreme court. </p> \n<p>Clinton has never campaigned on overturning the ban, but as a senator she voted against it. In the final debate, she explained that she voted \u201cno\u201d because the bill didn\u2019t make an exception for the health of the mother. Prior to the debate, she has said she supported \u201clate-pregnancy regulation that would have exceptions for the life and health of the mother\u201d.</p> \n<p>Trump, meanwhile, has committed to signing a ban on abortion in the 20th week of pregnancy \u2013 before a fetus is viable outside the womb. </p> \n<p>But his suggestion that pregnancies are ended days before a pregnancy is full term doesn\u2019t appear to be supported in fact.</p> \n<p>The percentage of women having abortions past the midpoint of their pregnancy is very small. The <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/ss6410a1.htm\">latest estimate</a> by the CDC is that fully 98.7% of abortions take place before 21 weeks\u2019 gestation. Most fetuses are not viable outside the womb for another three weeks. The Guttmacher Institute, a pro-abortion rights thinktank, estimates that proportion of terminations after 20 weeks is slightly higher, or about 15,000 procedures every year.</p> \n<p>Clinton\u2019s remarks, which characterized these terminations as being done in cases of severe fetal anomaly, do not fully capture what we know about later abortions. </p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/26/donald-trump-feminism-election-jessica-valenti\">Grab Trump by the ballot: either our bodies are our own, or they\u2019re not</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>\u201cWe know very little about women who seek later abortions,\u201d reads a 2013 study published in the journal of the Guttmacher Institute. \u201cBut data suggest that most women seeking later terminations are not doing so for reasons of fetal anomaly or life endangerment.\u201d (The study characterized \u201clater abortions\u201d as those taking place after 20 weeks.)</p> \n<p>Dr Warren Hern, who is one of only a handful of doctors in the country performing third-trimester abortions, agreed to speak in as much detail as he could about his own patients. </p> \n<p>Hern estimates that in a majority of his later abortion cases, the women are there because of a severe fetal anomaly. The rest of his clients are a mix. Hern objects to the term \u201celective abortion\u201d. \u201cIt makes it sound like you decided to have curls instead of bangs as a hairdo,\u201d he said. But he allows that many \u2013 although not a majority \u2013 of patients having later abortions are not there because of fetal anomaly.</p> \n<p>\u201cWithout doing the kind of analysis I would need to do to be sure, I would say that more than half of the patients who come in [post-viability] are there because of fetal abnormalities, and this was a very desired pregnancy,\u201d he said. \u201cThe other, smaller proportion are usually very young women, 12 or 13 years old, who are victims of sexual assault, of incest. Or they are adult women who have been told by a doctor they can\u2019t get pregnant, or who thought they were post-menopausal.\u201d</p> \n<p>Hern says he turns many women away. For one, after about 33 weeks, termination carries more serious risks. </p> \n<p>\u201cOne of the things I have to decide is, first of all, do I feel comfortable ending the pregnancy at a late stage when there is no obvious problem, such a fetal abnormality or a rape? If I have someone who\u2019s 33 weeks pregnant, and she should have had this done four or five months ago, I\u2019m not going to do that, because there\u2019s a certain amount of risk involved.\u201d</p> \n<p>Trump, he said, \u201cis totally and abysmally ignorant about this subject. His statements are highly inflammatory and obscene and designed to inflame his followers, who don\u2019t need to be inflamed.\u201d</p> \n<p>But it is unclear if Trump\u2019s comments won him any followers.</p> \n<p>Wallace also asked Trump whether or not he wanted Roe v Wade to be overturned. Trump declined to answer, saying the issue \u201cwill go back to the states\u201d. But when Trump reiterated his promise to appoint anti-abortion justices to the supreme court, his support among a group of undecided voters judging the debate for CNN <a href=\"https://twitter.com/FrankLuntz/status/788911972959989760\">plummeted</a>. </p>",

We interviewed Dr Coutinho who felt that having periods is unnatural and spoke to artist Jenn Lewis, who strongly disagreed. A number of commenters were inclined to agree with Jenn, as they wrote in to tell us:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The first episode in this series was about appreciating the natural beauty of the vulva. Having a period is natural, too.</p> <p>\u2013 Camille (<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/theguardian/videos/1490883294272066/?comment_id=1491069710920091&amp;reply_comment_id=1493522497341479&amp;comment_tracking=%7B%22tn%22%3A%22R9%22%7D\">on Facebook</a>)</p> </blockquote> <p>Mae and I explain in the video that we have a hormonal IUD which stops our periods. Viewers also had some valuable thoughts about this method of contraception:<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I wanted to point out that there are IUDs that aren\u2019t hormonal and don\u2019t affect the period. I have used a copper IUD (commercial name Paragard) for years and years, I love it because it very effectively and conveniently does the job of birth control and does not change my hormonal balance in the process. Your show gives the impression that IUDs are beneficial because they affect your hormones and stop your periods, first and foremost. Because some women don\u2019t want to tamper with their hormones, you may be discouraging them from IUD use. </p> </blockquote> <p>It\u2019s true. And we\u2019re reading through all of your responses, questions, and concerns about stopping your periods \u2013 and taking them very seriously.

In <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/oct/24/period-pain-menstruation-cramps-dysmenorrhea\">her words</a>:<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I started having two-week-long periods accompanied by cramps so bad I couldn\u2019t move for days. I bled heavily for 12 to 30 days at a time, often with only days of a break in between. Put another way, the average ovulating woman has bled for a total of nearly one year since the 2012 election but I\u2019ve nearly doubled that. Added together, I\u2019ve had my period for longer than Trump\u2019s presidential campaign.

Within a day or two, increases in progesterone seem to suppress sex drive (estrogen has the opposite effect) so women are typically horniest between days 13 and 15 of their menstrual cycle. Those days just so happen to also be the window when women are ovulating and at their most fertile.

  "<p>Hillary Clinton has not won the presidential election. Granted, the polls look good. The New York Times gives her a <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/upshot/presidential-polls-forecast.html?_r=0\">92% chance</a> at taking the White House as of Thursday morning, and more Republican elites are defecting from their party\u2019s nominee each day. Data hub FiveThirtyEight\u2019s numbers are a little more modest, putting Trump\u2019s odds of victory just north of 15%. Evan McMullin \u2013 the once-laughable conservative independent candidate \u2013 <a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/polls-may-be-underestimating-evan-mcmullins-chances-in-utah/\">could even win</a> his home state of Utah, fueled by Republican recoiling. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/04/bernie-sanders-supporters-young-voters-hillary-clinton\">No, Hillary, young voters aren't naive. The system doesn't work for them | Alexander Zaitchik</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But not every picture is so rosy. A recent <a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/2016/10/22/trump-gains-on-clinton-poll-shows-rigged-message-resonates.html\">Reuters/Ipsos poll</a> saw Clinton with just a 4-point lead nationwide, with Trump undershooting his campaign high by just one point. That a full 15% of voters <a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/election-update-where-are-the-undecided-voters/\">remain undecided</a> leaves a huge potential for the election to swing at the last minute. Worryingly, the candidates remain neck in neck in several swing states. </p> <p>By all accounts, Trump (to speak generously) has a slim hope of walking away with a win come 8 November. But that there is still any chance he could become commander in chief, America\u2019s ambassador to the world and a central player in literally any decision about the future of the United States should inspire not just concern, but a trip to knock on doors in your nearest swing state.</p> <p>Mind, this isn\u2019t a call to silence dissent about Clinton, let alone to start phone banking for her campaign. But those savvy enough to hold principled and well-founded critiques of her role in the Honduran coup and ending \u201cwelfare as we know it\u201d, for instance, can also recognize the stakes of voting for anyone besides her in a swing state.</p> <p>There are more than a few good reasons to help make sure Clinton wins that have almost nothing to do with her. Anything but victory by a sizable margin will feed Trump\u2019s omens about election \u201crigging\u201d, potentially tying up the news cycle for several months in some horrific recount debacle like the one in 2000. A narrow defeat is also likely to embolden Trump\u2019s most irascible supporters, many of whom happen to be armed. </p> <p>Assuming the election is over could further hit down-ballot candidates by driving down voter turnout at a time when Democrats have a real potential to flip the Senate and render Bernie Sanders chairman of the budget committee. (By fear-mongering about that possibility, Paul Ryan inadvertently helped Sanders raise <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://berniesanders.com/thankspaul/\">$2.4m</a> to aid in down-ticket races.) </p> <p>So whether you want to avert open revolt, take back Congress or just be done with this hellscape marathon of an election cycle, assuming Clinton has already coasted to victory is a dangerous move. </p> <p>Perhaps the best reason to double down on electing Clinton, though, is to aid the movements that will be a thorn in her side. Especially after reading the transcripts of her speeches to Goldman Sachs and other major banks, few progressive activists have illusions as to where Clinton\u2019s priorities \u2013 and donor pools \u2013 lie. </p> <p>Veterans of Occupy Wall Street, the movement for black lives and the climate fight know that major egalitarian change in the United States has never come straight from the Oval Office.

  "<p>As the owner of the New Jersey Generals in the short-lived United States Football League, Donald Trump took on the NFL and lost.

The NFL game scheduled against last month\u2019s first presidential debate was down by 40% compared with the game at the same time last year, <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/2016/10/10/presidential-debate-ratings-giants-packers-sunday-night-football/91859434/\">USA Today reported</a>.

You would never say that about a debate between George Bush and Al Gore.\u201d</p> <p>The theory that Clinton v Trump has siphoned attention from the likes of the Green Bay Packers v the New York Giants will be easier to measure once the election is \u2013 finally \u2013 over. More subjective is the impression that while politics may be unusually captivating this year, the NFL\u2019s storylines are less enjoyable than usual. Roger Goodell, the commissioner, <a href=\"http://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2016/10/19/roger-goodell-nfl-not-losing-viewers-but-some-are-watching-less/\">told reporters last week</a> that he believes the league has not lost viewers, but they may not be watching for as long as they used to.</p> <p>In an impatient culture with many entertainment options, one risk is that fans conclude that a competition where three-hour matches might <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704281204575002852055561406\">contain 11 minutes of actual play</a> is best enjoyed through highlights on social media, especially if a lack of narratives and drama erodes the sense of a fixture as viewing that demands to be seen live and in full.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s a lack of compelling product on the field this year, which is not unusual \u2013 you have slow baseball seasons and slow NBA seasons and slow NHL seasons and we\u2019ve had NFL seasons in the past which haven\u2019t exactly been the greatest. And I think people notice that,\u201d Cramer, a former president of the Texas Rangers MLB team and Dallas Stars NHL franchise, said.</p> <p>\u201cSome seasons just don\u2019t have a compelling story, and if you asked me what the compelling story was in the NFL this year I\u2019d kind of have to put my feet up and think about it. There\u2019s no compelling game, there\u2019s no compelling on-field story. There are a lot of stories off the field that are eating up news time and broadcast time and none of them are particularly favorable for the league.\u201d</p> <p>No teams remain undefeated, leaving some to wonder whether parity is a synonym for mediocrity. Last Sunday\u2019s 6-6 tie between the Seattle Seahawks and Arizona Cardinals <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/24/there-are-no-undefeated-teams-left-in-the-nfl-and-thats-a-problem\">was a primetime festival of incompetence</a>. In <a href=\"http://www.nfl.com/standings\">four of the league\u2019s eight divisions</a>, only one team has a winning record. Several franchises are stagnant; the only way the league has been able to generate buzz around the Jacksonville Jaguars <a href=\"http://www.foxsports.com/nfl/story/nfl-jacksonville-jaguars-indianapolis-colts-london-international-series-093016\">is by dispatching them to a different continent</a>; last year\u2019s most entertaining team, the Carolina Panthers, are struggling badly.</p> <p>The absences of two famous quarterbacks have been felt, with Peyton Manning retiring to pursue his true calling, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEw4pyf3aeA\">acting in commercials</a>, and Tom Brady \u2013 of the New England Patriots and <a href=\"http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/football/tom-brady-explains-supports-good-friend-trump-article-1.2466564\">the first-class carriage of the Trump Train</a> \u2013 suspended for four games thanks to the Deflategate saga (since his return, Brady has been excellent but, at the age of 39, he is hardly an exciting new talent). The league is becoming younger, <a href=\"https://theringer.com/the-nfl-has-an-age-problem-7068825845e4#.q3acdoom6\">which may be adversely affecting the quality of play</a> as inexperienced players struggle to adapt to complex gameplans.</p> <p>San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick has been the highest-profile player of the season \u2013 not for his performances, but his refusal to stand for the national anthem in protest against racism and police brutality. Some commentators have cited his actions as a contributing factor to the ratings slide, suggesting that fans are turned off because their escapist fun is being politicized. Fans seem to agree, too: a poll this week found 56% of those surveyed thought player protests had contributed to the drop in ratings (although crucially the poll did not ask whether the respondents themselves had been put off by the players\u2019 actions).</p> <p>\u201cIs it so hard to imagine that a majority-conservative, NFL-watching fanbase might have issue with an overpaid, overrated child of privilege putting his ill-conceived \u2018look at me\u2019 campaign over and above the national anthem?\u201d <a href=\"http://www.breitbart.com/sports/2016/10/18/nfl-ratings-drop-kaepernick-protests-continue/\">opined a writer</a> for the rightwing website Breitbart.</p> <p>This claim was dismissed by the NFL\u2019s memo, and football fans have previously stuck by the league amid domestic violence scandals, inept officiating, and a concussions problem so alarming <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2016/09/will-smith-concussion-reaction\">it was turned into a Will Smith movie</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"46d85e02ed97549c6d448ea4dd56326271a87fdd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/46d85e02ed97549c6d448ea4dd56326271a87fdd/0_120_4096_2458/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Raiders fan\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Football fans are still coming to stadiums in large numbers.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John G Mabanglo/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It\u2019s not just fans who are turning away.

I believe it is mostly the casual fans, those who simply look at the NFL as entertainment, who have cut back on their viewership,\u201d said Clark Haptonstall, a sport management professor at Rice University, citing the national anthem protests and concussion concerns as possible reasons. \u201cWhen big hits occur during a game, the casual fan cringes because they know about the health problems that could be coming down the road for that player,\u201d he said.</p> <p><a href=\"http://digiday.com/publishers/facing-cash-flow-problems-fanduel-draftkings-ad-spend-vanished/\">The legal struggles and reduced promotional activities</a> of two big daily fantasy sports sites, DraftKings and FanDuel, may have prompted the \u201cunwinding of the fantasy sports bubble\u201d and turned off viewers, according to a report from MoffettNathanson, a research company.</p> <p>All the same, with every NFL team enjoying attendances averaging more than 80% of stadium capacity, and <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/attendance/_/sort/homePct\">almost all above 90%</a>, supporters are still packing the stands. Regional broadcast ratings remain strong. But if it continues, the national ratings slide will challenge the NFL\u2019s image as a bulletproof property in a state of perpetual growth, with each colossal broadcasting contract worth more than the last.</p> <p>Major networks placed long-term, multi-billion dollar bets that in the age of video on-demand on multiple devices, live sport, and especially the most popular sport in the nation, would continue to be irresistible to advertisers and subscribers.</p> <p>Of course, it\u2019s possible that scenarios specific to this season have exacerbated a fade that says more about the state of cable television than the sport. The NFL\u2019s memo aimed for a reassuring tone. Over the past 15 years, it soothed: \u201cNFL viewership has increased 27% while primetime broadcast viewership has decreased 36%.\u201d</p> <p>This, though, raises the question of how the biggest fish can continue to thrive in a shrinking pond. As Awful Announcing noted in June, <a href=\"http://awfulannouncing.com/2016/espn-down-1-5-million-subscribers-as-cable-sports-networks-keep-shedding-viewers.html\">ESPN\u2019s reach has fallen</a> from 99 million subscribers in 2013 to an estimated 89.5m last summer, and Fox Sports 1 and NBC Sports Network also trended downwards.</p> <p>In the UK, ratings for some Premier League and Champions League soccer games <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/24/sky-sports-bt-sport-people-switching-football-off\">have recently sunk by 20-40%</a>, with broadcasters arguing \u2013 and no doubt praying \u2013 that this is a blip with logical explanations, such as match-ups with limited appeal, rather than a sign that the competitions have peaked.</p> <p>In a media market where prices are pushed up by bidding wars and fear of missing out, there may be a time when rising costs and decreasing returns create a point where the gaudy numbers no longer make sense. And, as newspapers have found, embracing social media and internet distribution can boost content consumption, but it is not easy to monetize them.</p> <p>\u201c[The NFL] still continues to be head and shoulders above other categories of sports programming in terms of ratings and viewership,\u201d said Lee Berke, a sports network development specialist. He pointed out that although changes are afoot for next year, a leading ratings measurement service, Nielsen, does not yet track out-of-home viewership, which has grown as technology has evolved to make it easy to watch TV on portable devices.</p> <p>\u201cI think it\u2019s a short-term issue and it\u2019s based on specific issues in terms of how you measure audiences. Because in part you\u2019ve got audiences now that are consuming NFL games and other sports content across a number of screens, and the measurement data doesn\u2019t capture all that,\u201d he said. \u201cI thought media rights were starting to crest 10 years ago and I wasn\u2019t alone. And yet they\u2019ve continued because for all of its challenges, all of the cord-cutting, all of the seeming decline across the board, [the NFL] is still compelling television \u2013 you\u2019ve heard the phrase \u2018appointment television\u2019,\u201d Cramer said.</p> <p>He believes the NFL\u2019s future prosperity is less a matter of technological change than of potential cultural shifts. Will we still be sports-obsessed in a decade or two? \u201cPeople want to watch a sports event on the biggest, best, screen available. The real question is: will we maintain an interest in sports as a society the way we have grown it over the past 50 years? And I think right now that\u2019s still very much up in the air,\u201d Cramer said. </p> <p>Amid all the league\u2019s challenges, shortcomings and competing pastimes, he said, viewers \u201cmay just say: \u2018I don\u2019t need it\u2019.\u201d</p>",

She praised Obama\u2019s accomplishments in the role \u2013 including her White House vegetable garden \u2013 and expressed sympathy over how tough the role can be. </p> <p>She also expressed admiration for the first couple\u2019s dance moves and said Obama had \u201cdazzled the world\u201d with her memorable speech <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/26/michelle-obama-convention-speech-female-president\">at the Democratic national convention in July</a>.</p> <p>\u201cSeriously, is there anyone more inspiring than Michelle Obama?\u201d she said, in closing.</p> <p>The women clasped each other. Taking the microphone, Obama said she was somewhat overwhelmed by Clinton\u2019s \u201cmini-tribute\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cI know that there are some folks out there who have commented that it\u2019s unprecedented for a sitting first lady to be so actively engaged in a campaign,\u201d Obama said of her own forays into the campaign against Donald Trump. \u201cThat may be true. But this is truly an unprecedented election.\u201d</p> <p>The first lady has emerged as one of Clinton\u2019s most potent surrogates in battleground states, delivering stirring speeches that have served both as cogent rebukes of Trump and powerful endorsements of Clinton, all in an optimistic tone counter to the vulgar tenor of this election cycle.</p> <p>In terms of popularity, the first lady outshines either presidential nominee and even her husband. In <a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/poll/194567/michelle-obama-popular-bill-clinton-melania-trump.aspx?g_source=FAVORABILITY&amp;g_medium=topic&amp;g_campaign=tiles\">August a Gallup poll</a> found Michelle Obama to have a 64% approval rating, notably higher than either of her potential successors: Bill Clinton earned 49% and Melania Trump 38%.

  "<p>Political violence in Zimbabwe has increased dramatically in 2016, with record levels of assault, abduction and torture recorded <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2016/aug/31/zimbabwe-facing-most-intense-unrest-in-almost-a-decade-mugabe-video-report\">as opposition to Robert Mugabe\u2019s 36-year rule</a> escalates. </p> <p>Around 654 cases of political violence were recorded by a local NGO, the Counselling Services Unit (CSU), as of 21 October, compared to 476 cases in the whole of 2015.<br></p> <p>The CSU found that assaults were overwhelmingly perpetrated by the state\u2019s security forces \u2013 including police, military and the secretive Central Intelligence Organisation \u2013 while opposition supporters and civil society activists had been on the receiving end of the increasingly violent treatment.</p> <p>One activist interviewed by the Guardian, Ostallos Gift Siziba, a student protest leader at the University of Zimbabwe, said he was abducted by state security agents in August and taken to the headquarters of Zanu-PF, the ruling party, where he was hung from the ceiling by his feet.</p> <p>\u201cIt is at this time that I experienced brutal, callous and inhumane treatment,\u201d he said. \u201cI was tortured and assaulted with my feet hanging upwards and my head downwards as 21 youths and men exchanged chances to beat me until I passed out.\u201d</p> <p>Siziba said his interrogators demanded information about other human rights defenders, and claims at one point he was dangled over a large drum of sulphuric acid.</p> <p>Siziba was then transferred to the Harare central police station, where the beatings continued. \u201cAt this instant I had lost a lot of blood and I was still bleeding. I was injured in almost all parts of my body. I was denied water, and the right to call my parents, a lawyer, or anyone. I received no treatment and had to become my own doctor,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Siziba\u2019s experience tallies with testimonies from other victims, indicating that it is not just the frequency of political violence that is on the rise, but the severity too. </p> <p>Others victims reported being injected with unknown substances during interrogations, kept in solitary confinement, and subjected to sexual threats.</p> <p>Frances Lovemore, the director of the NGO, said the allegations of torture had become increasingly shocking. </p> <p>\u201cThe injecting unknown substances during torture is of concern, as is the abduction of relatives of human rights defenders when the target cannot be found. The sheer force of the beatings by the police, resulting in long bone fractures and life-threatening soft tissue injuries, is reminiscent of the previous violent responses by the state and ruling party when opposition parties were deemed a threat to power,\u201d Lovemore said.</p> <p>Lovemore\u2019s NGO provides medical and rehabilitation services to survivors of organised violence and torture in Zimbabwe. The statistics are a record of people who have sought medical and counselling assistance from the organisation, and therefore provide an indicative rather than complete picture of political violence in Zimbabwe. The real number of incidents of political violence is likely to be even higher.</p> <p>Popular resistance to Mugabe, the 92-year-old president, has intensified this year before the presidential election scheduled for 2018. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/14/zimbabwe-protest-leader-calls-for-more-strikes-against-mugabe-rule\">Opposition has been increased by a severe drought</a>, which has left millions hungry, and a cash shortage that is disrupting businesses and has left the government struggling to pay wages. <br></p> <p>CSU\u2019s statistics show that of the 654 incidents of political violence recorded, the vast majority occurred in Zimbabwe\u2019s two largest cities, Harare (334 incidents) and Bulawayo (92), both of which have become centres for the recent wave of political opposition.</p> <p>The CSU found that 45% of victims were of indeterminate political affiliation, and of those with clear links to the opposition movement, more than 52% were supporters of the official opposition party, the Movement for Democratic Change-Tsvangirai (MDC-T).</p> <p>Obert Gutu, MDC-T\u2019s spokesperson, responded to the findings by saying the ruling Zanu-PF\u2019s regime had \u201cover the years routinely targeted MDC supporters for assault, torture and intimidation\u201d.</p> <p>He added: \u201cWe are the largest and most popular political party in Zimbabwe and the regime is acutely aware of the fact that we command massive support throughout the length and breath of Zimbabwe. Hence, the regime has always targeted our supporters for victimisation.\u201d</p> <p>Linda Masarira, a former National Railways employee turned independent political activist, also suffered at the hands of the Zimbabwean police. She was arrested on 6 July and charged with engaging in violent demonstrations, and spent 84 days in jail before being released on bail.</p> <p>She says she experienced constant physical and psychological abuse while in detention, beginning on the day of her arrest.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/12/zimbabwe-protests-leader-charged-inciting-public-disorder-evan-mawarire\">Zimbabwe protests leader charged with inciting public disorder</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cI was the only female person that had been arrested, made to sit between male people\u2019s legs [on the prisoner transfer vehicle]. They were touching me all over. Police were poking me with baton sticks. They try to take away your dignity and self-esteem,\u201d she said.</p> <p>After leading a protest by prisoners against the poor conditions of the Chikurubi female prison, she was moved to the notorious Chikurubi maximum security facility, usually reserved for male prisoners. There she was kept in solitary confinement for 18 days, and forced to wear leg irons.</p> <p>\u201cThese are some things I had to deal with. When you oppose the ruling party, you know you\u2019re going to go through hell. I told myself all this, that I had to be strong. And it actually made me stronger.

Trump\u2019s invocation at the debate of Clinton\u2019s WikiLeaks emails and support for the Trans-Pacific Partnership was designed to turn off Sanders supporters. The parade of women who say they were sexually assaulted by Bill Clinton and harassed or threatened by Hillary is meant to undermine her appeal to young women.

This sexy Donatello ... we mean, Donatell<em><em>a</em></em> costume will have all the guys saying \u201cCowabunga!\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.esquire.com/news-politics/news/a49556/sexy-ken-bone/\">And now we have Sexy Ken Bone</a>, promoted with a \u201cwink, wink\u201d by Esquire and many nudges about his name. Ken Bone, for those not up on the latest internet memes, is a man fond of a red sweater who asked an anodyne question about energy policy in the second presidential debate. The internet instantly turned the man into a meme. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g540n3sLh68\">Ellen created a brilliant dance-off between him and Hillary Clinton.</a> <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2016/10/15/the-rise-and-fall-of-ken-bone-this-is-what-happens-when-real-humans-become-internet-memes/\">Salon claimed</a> he \u201crepresented the humanity lacking in this year\u2019s election\u201d. It follows, therefore, that this internet hero had to become a sexy Halloween costume.</p> <p>In so far as we need to find humanity in the crappy year that is 2016, then Ken Bone is a great character to dress up as for Halloween. But we don\u2019t need to sex him up to do so. There is no sexy Ken Bone for men. There is no sexy nurse for men. Or sexy doctor. And so far I haven\u2019t seen male costumes coming with <a href=\"http://www.cosmopolitan.com/style-beauty/fashion/a5973947/dripping-blood-choker-asos/\">collars of \u201cblood\u201d around their neck.</a></p> <p>Look, there\u2019s nothing wrong with being sexy. And let\u2019s face it, for singletons, there is no better strike rate for pulling than a drunken dress-up party, in which case we should all dress in the sluttiest, sexiest, most flattering costumes we can find. But those three adjectives are not the same thing, and that\u2019s my point. </p> <p>What we are now served up for Halloween is a cartoon cliche version of sexy that is pretty much the only choice for female costumes, <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/susan-stiffelman/daughter-wants-inappropri_b_12517160.html\">even for eight-year-old girls. </a></p> <p>Right now, we\u2019re having a moment. Donald Trump has exposed in all its ugliness the deep-seated misogyny that exists in our society. His crude treatment of women has forced thousands of women to talk about their harassment and humiliation at the hands of men. What struck many of us about the infamous Trump-Billy Bush recordings were not just how disgusting it was but also how common it was.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/08/trump-has-crossed-a-line-his-views-are-as-old-as-misogyny-itself\">As Suzanne Moore pointed out</a>, we\u2019ve heard men talk about women like this our whole lives. We can\u2019t put all this back in the closet. We can no longer ignore how women have been treated as not quite equal, and judged \u2013 always \u2013 first and foremost on how we look. We\u2019re more than our bodies. </p> <p>No matter how hilarious sexy Ken Bone is, now seems the right time to ditch the sexy Halloween costume and just dress up as some awesome women, scary or not. And what a year for it \u2013 we\u2019ve had female Ghostbusters, and Jane Got a Gun, Alice Through the Looking Glass and Eleven from Stranger Things. And none of these are exactly a turn-off. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/08/trump-has-crossed-a-line-his-views-are-as-old-as-misogyny-itself\">So Trump has crossed a line? His views are as old as misogyny itself | Suzanne Moore</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I decided to ditch the sexy Halloween costumes in 2010 when I dressed up as Margaret Thatcher, complete with a remarkably life-like latex mask I pulled on over my head. I expected to be a bit like Cady from Mean Girls and have people horrified at my terrifying costume. I didn\u2019t expect the horror to begin before I arrived at the party.</p> <p>Walking down Shoreditch High Street in London, people beeped their car horns and screamed out windows, \u201cFuck off\u201d, \u201cDie!\u201d (Thatcher was in hospital with flu at the time), some flipped me the bird. At the party, a man approached me, pointed his finger in my face and growled, \u201cYou ruined my family\u2019s life.\u201d In retrospect, the latex mask may have been a step too far. </p> <p>But the mask did not go to waste. Upon discovering my friend was marrying a Tory with quite strong affections for the Iron Lady, I passed on the mask to her as a wedding gift. She appeared in it as a surprise (and nothing else), morning after wedding night, and well, let\u2019s just say that the moral of the story is that there are all sorts of sexy in this world and they don\u2019t have to come in thigh-high boots and a skin-tight costume on Halloween.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/video/2014/oct/21/california-company-ebola-halloween-costume-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/42j24\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2179039\"            data-video-name=\"California company defends Ebola Halloween costume \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"ITN\"            data-video-poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2014/10/21/1413883054445/Ebola-Halloween-costume--001.jpg\"> <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-450273968\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2014/10/21/1413883054445/Ebola-Halloween-costume--001.jpg\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2014/10/21/141021EbolaHalloween-16x9.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2014/10/21/141021EbolaHalloween.webm\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2014/10/21/141021EbolaHalloween/141021EbolaHalloween.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2014/10/21/141021EbolaHalloween_3gpSml16x9.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2014/10/21/141021EbolaHalloween_3gpLg16x9.3gp\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/video/2014/oct/21/california-company-ebola-halloween-costume-video\">California company defends Ebola Halloween costume</a></figcaption> </figure>"

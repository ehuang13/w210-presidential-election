  "<p>A federal judge has ordered Hillary Clinton to answer written questions about her use of a private email server while at the state department in response to a lawsuit by a conservative watchdog group, though he declined to make her submit to a sworn deposition.</p> <p>District court judge Emmet Sullivan said Clinton must reply in writing to questions posed by the group, Judicial Watch, about why she set up a system to conduct state department business, a decision that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/05/hillary-clinton-emails-fbi-investigation-next-steps\">led to an FBI investigation</a> and has haunted the Democratic nominee\u2019s campaign for over a year.</p> <p>The judge said the group failed to demonstrate that an hours-long deposition was necessary to clarify why Clinton set up the private server, as opposed to seeking the information \u201cthrough other, less burdensome or intrusive means such as interrogatories\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cJudicial Watch\u2019s argument that a deposition is preferable in this case because of the ability to ask follow-up questions is not persuasive,\u201d Sullivan wrote. \u201cGiven the extensive public record related to the clintonemail.com system, a record which Judicial Watch has acknowledged, Judicial Watch will be able to anticipate many follow-up questions.\u201d<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/06/hillary-clinton-email-investigation-fact-check\">'What I did was allowed': fact-checking Clinton's statements on email inquiry</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Judicial Watch made a name for itself by dogging former president Bill Clinton, and has now filed a number of lawsuits under the Freedom of Information Act (Foia) seeking records from the state department about Hillary Clinton\u2019s time spent as the nation\u2019s top diplomat. </p> <p>Judicial Watch\u2019s president, Tom Fitton, praised the judge\u2019s decision in a statement. \u201cWe are pleased that this federal court ordered Hillary Clinton to provide written answers under oath to some key questions about her email scandal,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will move quickly to get these answers. The decision is a reminder that Hillary Clinton is not above the law.\u201d</p> <p>The decision means Clinton will probably not have to step away from the campaign trail to sit for an interview with some of her fiercest critics, but ensures that the controversy will continue to follower her throughout the final weeks of the presidential campaign. </p> <p>Judicial Watch has until 14 October to submit questions to Clinton, who must respond within 30 days, according to the decision. </p> <p>Separately, Sullivan approved Judicial Watch\u2019s request to depose John Bentel, a senior state department aide who has since retired, due to \u201ccontradictory evidence\u201d about the extent of his knowledge of Clinton\u2019s server and email practices. However, he declined the group\u2019s request to depose Clarence Finney, a state department official handling Foia requests. </p> <p>In July, the FBI <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/05/fbi-no-charges-hillary-clinton-email-investigation\">closed its investigation into Clinton\u2019s email server</a> after she sat for a three-hour interview. Director James Comey said that while she and her staff had been \u201cextremely careless\u201d in their handling of emails, a handful of which contained classified information at the time, the FBI would not recommend prosecutors seek charges in the case.</p> <p>The judge also ordered the federal government to begin releasing the \u201cthousands of work-related emails\u201d that the FBI said it had recovered in its investigation.</p> <p>Clinton has apologized for setting up the server, maintaining that the decision was a \u201cmistake\u201d and not an attempt to obfuscate her actions or skirt reporting laws. She also noted that this was the practice of her predecessors, though the law was tightened by the Obama administration.</p> <p>Earlier this week, the New York Times <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/19/us/politics/hillary-clinton-told-fbi-colin-powell-advised-her-to-use-private-email.html?ref=politics\">reported</a> that former secretary of state Colin Powell was said to have advised Clinton to use a personal email account. The report was based on notes from the FBI handed over to Congress. </p> <p>In a <a href=\"http://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-usa-election-clinton-fbi-idUKKCN10U0FO\">statement</a>, Powell\u2019s office said he wrote Clinton an \u201cemail memo describing his use of his personal AOL email account for unclassified messages and how it vastly improved communications within the State Department\u201d while also noting that \u201cat the time there was no equivalent system with the department\u201d. </p>",
  "<p>Enemies in politics and opposed on nearly all fronts, Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton have found themselves united together against Barack Obama and a tradition that has kept America in charge of the world economy\u2019s rules for more than 70 years. The next president of the United States is rethinking free trade.</p> <p>In Washington, that tradition was taken for granted for so long that it rarely attracted much attention even in the business press, let alone dominated the politics pages of an entire election season. But in 2016, America\u2019s faltering faith in free trade has become the most sensitive controversy in DC \u2013 never before have both main presidential candidates broken with the orthodoxy that globalisation is always good for Americans.</p> <p>The proposed Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP), between 12 countries around the Pacific rim, excluding China, suddenlyfaces a wall of political opposition among lawmakers who had, not long ago, nearly set the giant deal in stone. Parallel negotiations between the US and Europe, known as the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP), are suddenly even more behind: hamstrung by similar opposition as well as complications created by Britain\u2019s vote to leave the European Union.</p> <p>The White House has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/oct/10/obama-defends-tpp-deal-dismisses-secrecy-concerns\">refused to give up</a>, however, as it weighs the stakes of a <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/011916/brief-history-international-trade-agreements.asp\">system of multilateral deals largely invented by the US after the second world war</a>.

But for Alden it is more about the alternative challenge posed by China, which is <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-ups-ceo-trade-idUSKCN10Q1NS\">seeking its own deal</a> with the TPP participants if the US cannot fulfill its promise.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/30/donald-trump-free-trade-foreign-policy-china-republicans\">How Donald Trump upended Republican orthodoxy on free trade</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cIt\u2019s about the architecture going forward,\u201d says Alden. \u201cChina would like to see a very different set of trade rules. If TPP fails, the rest of the countries in Asia will have no choice but to go in the direction that China wants to move. The irony of it all is that opposing TPP will probably help China most.\u201d</p> <p>For the White House, this is the biggest reason to keep battling for TPP. If China seizes control of the Asian trade agenda, then it could quickly assert political and security dominance over the region and leave Obama\u2019s \u201cpivot\u201d toward the region in tatters.</p> <p>But few insiders think Clinton or congressional Republicans, much less Trump, will drop their opposition. \u201cThe idea that we are going to sacrifice manufacturing jobs to suit some esoteric foreign policy goal is just really not going to fly,\u201d one senior DC lobbyist said.</p> <p>Even the fabled influence of corporate America may not be enough to swing the argument, as illustrated by the scene of Clinton\u2019s speech, Detroit.</p> <p>\u201cWe export $140bn of finished vehicles and parts. We have supported every trade agreement in history, but we remain sceptical of this one,\u201d said Matt Blunt, president of the American Automotive Policy Council and a former governor of Missouri.</p> <p>Among the three big members, Ford openly opposes TPP because it fears the deal does nothing to stop Japan manipulating its currency at the expense of US rivals. But even General Motors and Fiat Chrysler have refused to come out swinging for a deal that would, in theory, open up important new markets in Vietnam and Malaysia.</p> <p>For many US businessmen, the lack of political support for trade is perplexing, even in rust belt states where the most is at stake.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Given that the economy is kind of coming back right now, I just didn\u2019t understand why trade was so prominent this race</p> <footer> <cite>David Lawrence, vice-president, AlphaUSA</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cGiven that the economy is kind of coming back right now, something that is so key to the economy [as trade], I just didn\u2019t understand why it was so prominent this race, and not some other issue,\u201d said David Lawrence, vice-president of AlphaUSA, a fastener manufacturer based in suburban Detroit.</p> <p>Alpha opened in Detroit nearly six decades ago, later moving to the suburbs.

We used to write on a bar napkin the price, and whoever the highest was, we\u2019d submit it and get the work.\u201d</p> <p>The trade debate has particularly resonated in Michigan\u2019s Macomb County, which produced the band of \u201cReagan Democrats\u201d who helped propel the former Republican president to victory, and whom Trump has promised to reinvigorate. </p> <p>Kurt Larson, 66, a retired auto worker who lives in Macomb County\u2019s seat, Mount Clemens, recalled living in Arizona and how his father used to work for Motorola and witnessed first-hand the effect of jobs moving out of the US. \u201cHe would go to other countries,\u201d Larson said, \u201cthey would build factories and get people to assemble semiconductors for 30 cents an hour.\u201d And as trade deals came into place, the trend continued. </p> <p>\u201cI never want to see jobs that Americans do go overseas or abroad,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s counterproductive to our country.\u201d</p> <p>Walking along the quiet streets of downtown Mount Clemens, Dwayne Johnson, a construction worker who lives in the city of Dearborn, said he believes re-negotiating new trade deals is a \u201cgreat idea\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIt depends on whether we\u2019re making money or how good the trade [agreement] is for the United States,\u201d said the 57-year-old. \u201cWhat I mean by that is, they\u2019re taking all the jobs from over here and they\u2019re putting them in other countries,\u201d he added. \u201cIt don\u2019t seem like we\u2019re making money off it.\u201d </p> <p>Though Johnson said he supports Clinton over Trump \u2013 \u201cI can\u2019t see myself voting for him\u201d \u2013 he said the Republican nominee\u2019s relentless anti-trade rhetoric, elevating it to a major issue in the race, is the \u201conly thing I see in him that makes any sense\u201d. \u201cIf he [does] lose the election, he did offer something,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Lawrence, the chief administrative officer at AlphaUSA, agreed there was some truth to the feeling that trade deals had contributed to the decline in the quality of life in the US, particularly for the middle class.</p> <p>\u201cA lot of these workers have seen jobs leave this country and go to other countries,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we\u2019ve certainly seen that in the automotive marketplace.\u201d</p> <p>But trade has its advantages, Lawrence said, and no deal should be viewed as \u201cgood\u201d or \u201cbad\u201d alone.</p> <p>\u201cTrade agreements happen not just so we can find the lowest cost to produce our products,\u201d he said, noting that deals also create customers for American companies and open access to foreign resources.</p> <p>To Lawrence, deals are made in the details: \u201cIt\u2019s how we write them \u2013 and how do we come to the table with those other countries, take a leadership position, and make something that works for everyone. And that\u2019s not easy, but it\u2019s certainly possible.\u201d</p> <p>For politicians back in Washington, the trick will be to convince voters that deals can be in their interests.</p> <p>\u201cThe problem is that over the years the interest of American corporations and the interests of Americans have diverged,\u201d Alden, of the Council on Foreign Relations, said. \u201cOne of the mistakes is that corporate American has just said: \u2018If it\u2019s good for us, it\u2019s good for America,\u2019 and the approach needs to be more sophisticated than that.

Bannon has no experience running a campaign, but a number of employees who left Breitbart under his stewardship had warnings for campaign staff: expect expletive-laced phone calls at all hours of the night.</p> <p>\u201cThere will be screaming matches between Steve and every other person in the office,\u201d said Ben Shapiro, a former editor at Breitbart News. </p> <p>\u201cBut there will be no screaming matches between Steve and Trump. Steve knows where his bread is buttered.\u201d</p> <p>A steady stream of emails leaked in the days following Trump\u2019s hiring of Bannon paint a picture of a shrewd businessman with a scorched-earth approach to the Republican establishment. Former Breitbart staffers interviewed by the Guardian recall a man driven less by an ideological crusade than the desire to emerge on top \u2013 not unlike the candidate who now employs him.</p> <p>To some, the Trump-Bannon partnership simply marks the consummation of a long, happy rapport. During his tenure as the executive chairman of Breitbart, Bannon spent the greater part of the last year promoting Trump\u2019s candidacy: where others fled or scolded Trump\u2019s declaration that Mexican immigrants were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jun/16/donald-trump-mexico-presidential-speech-latino-hispanic\">\u201crapists\u201d and \u201ckillers\u201d</a>, Breitbart News echoed the call.</p> <p>Bannon was a presence in the newsroom, often hopping on daily editorial calls and making his views clear. Staff present for the discussions, including Shapiro and Kurt Bardella, who previously served as a media consultant to Breitbart, said Bannon aggressively pushed stories against immigrants, and supported linking minorities to terrorism and crime. </p> <p>It was catnip for the site\u2019s growing audience of the so-called \u201calt-right\u201d, a far-right group that merges race and nationalism and has largely embraced Trump. For all his antagonism toward the media, the Republican nominee has publicly lavished praise on Breitbart, even though his former campaign manager Corey Lewandoski was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/mar/14/breitbart-writers-resign-trump-manager-assault-reporter-michelle-fields\">charged with battery</a> against one of the website\u2019s reporters, Michelle Fields, when she tried to ask Trump a question.</p> <p>Bannon, rather than defend Fields, used Breitbart as a vehicle to discredit her story and her character. Fields resigned, as did Shapiro and Bardella.</p> <p>\u201cThat was really a crystallization of how his pursuit of a relationship with Trump superseded the welfare of his reporters,\u201d Bardella said. \u201cIt was that moment of clarity where they\u2019re so in for Trump that they\u2019re willing to throw one of their own overboard even when that person is the victim of the situation.\u201d</p> <p>Shapiro soon rebranded Breitbart as \u201cTrump Pravda\u201d, and said that many staffers were increasingly concerned about their future. The site was spinning away from its crusade to hold liberal media and establishment Republicans to account, they felt. They worried about instead turning into shills for the Trump campaign. </p> <p>It was not just the obvious support for Trump that troubled employees, but also the clear objective of Bannon to diminish the former reality TV star\u2019s opponents in the Republican primary. The website ran overwhelmingly unfavorable coverage of Marco Rubio and Jeb Bush, both established Florida politicians, especially with articles about the bilingual candidates\u2019 support for immigration reform.</p> <p>\u201cHis whole mindset in general was: \u2018We need to go after Rubio, we need to go after Bush,\u2019\u201d said Bardella.</p> <p>The focus on Rubio was particularly relentless, as the Florida senator emerged as one of the final candidates in the race. Stories ran near daily with headlines asserting that, if Rubio were elected president, immigrants and terrorists would stream across the US border.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"acac04ea7fb13264e590a102eda46c8812e3035f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/acac04ea7fb13264e590a102eda46c8812e3035f/0_0_4000_2402/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Marco Rubio: a friend to immigrants and terrorists, according to Steve Bannon\u2019s Breitbart.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Marco Rubio: a friend to immigrants and terrorists, according to Steve Bannon\u2019s Breitbart.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lynne Sladky/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cHe hates Marco,\u201d said one former employee, who requested anonymity to speak freely. \u201cThere was definitely a decision to promote the work of writers with an extreme anti-Rubio bent.\u201d</p> <p>Similar treatment has been directed toward House speaker Paul Ryan in recent months, with Bannon working behind the scenes to push his long-shot primary challenger, Paul Nehlen. One story criticized Ryan for having a fence around his home in Wisconsin, with the implication that the speaker was willing to wall off his own house but not the US border. </p> <p>Bannon was \u201cabsolutely fuelling the energy\u201d behind Nehlen, a former staffer said. </p> <p>Spokespeople for Ryan and Rubio declined to comment.</p> <p>Even Ted Cruz, an ultraconservative senator once covered favorably by Breitbart, was not spared the site\u2019s acidic treatment of Trump\u2019s opponents. A report published by the Hill <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/presidential-races/292028-how-breitbart-turned-on-ted-cruz\">detailed</a> how Bannon slowly turned against the Texas senator. In particular, Breitbart seized on Trump\u2019s attacks on Cruz\u2019s citizenship \u2013 the senator was born to an American mother in Canada \u2013 much in the way it spread false \u201cbirther\u201d ideas against Barack Obama.</p> <p>It was a remarkable turnaround, given that just under a year prior, Breitbart reporter Matthew Boyle had been invited to observe Cruz\u2019s bedtime ritual with his children \u2013 and subsequently produced <a href=\"http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/03/23/exclusive-photos-potential-first-family-gets-ready-for-bed-before-sen-cruzs-presidential-campaign-announcement/\">a report</a> portraying the senator in a glowing light.</p> <p>Although they criticized his methods, those who worked under Bannon acknowledged a tireless devotion to creating an empire too influential to ignore, and his success so far.</p> <p>Given its popularity among grassroots conservatives and Bannon\u2019s \u201ctake-no prisoners\u201d approach, few Republican candidates or lawmakers are brazen enough to pick a fight with the website.</p> <p>Both Rubio and Bush continued to engage with Breitbart during the Republican primary, for example, even as they were targeted by much of its coverage. </p> <p>At the height of the primary, a visibly frustrated Rubio mocked Breitbart\u2019s credibility on Fox News, <a href=\"http://www.theblaze.com/stories/2016/02/20/rubio-slams-breitbart-after-publishing-scathing-remarks-by-immigration-union-president-theyre-basically-conspiracy-theories/\">accusing them</a> of publishing \u201cconspiracy theories\u201d. He has nonetheless continued to provide at least some of their reporters with interviews dubbed exclusives.</p> <p>Bannon \u201chas taken where the Breitbart brand essentially was before the election \u2013 considered by many as outliers \u2013 and made it a sheer force of will\u201d, Bardella said. \u201cHe\u2019s been able to advance an agenda.</p> <p>\u201cAnd now he\u2019s the right-hand person to a would-be president.\u201d</p> <p>Though Bannon has only had a few days in charge of Trump\u2019s campaign, his former employees said he would stand in stark contrast to former chairman Paul Manafort, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/19/paul-manafort-resigns-donald-trump-campaign\">who resigned on Friday</a>. While Manafort tried to steer Trump toward a more moderate general election strategy, little will be off limits for Bannon, they said.</p> <p>His motto, as Shapiro put it, will be simple: \u201cLet Trump be Trump.\u201d</p>"

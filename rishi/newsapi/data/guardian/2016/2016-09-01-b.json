Weak prospects for growth could depress investment and slow down trade, leading to even weaker demand and limiting the scope for productivity gains. \u201cAt the same time, income growth has not only been meagre, it has bypassed low-income earners in many countries, raising anxiety about globalisation and worsening the political climate for reform.\u201d</p> <p>The report said there were more downside than upside risks to its forecasts, with low inflation, China\u2019s transition to an economic model less dependent on exports and the uncertainties caused by Brexit \u2013 particularly for other European countries \u2013 singled out as specific concerns. <br></p> <p>\u201cFinancial markets have largely recovered from their lows following the United Kingdom referendum, but potential weaknesses remain in the financial sector.

Trump assured us this speech would be different. \u201cToday, on a very complicated and difficult subject, you will get the truth,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Now unlike lots of other policy stuff \u2013 such as whether Russia has invaded Ukraine or whether you can really win a trade war with China \u2013 it\u2019s fair to say that Trump knows a thing or two about immigration. </p> <p>His first wife was born in the Czech Republic, and his third wife was born in Slovenia. His own family (original name: Drumpf) came from Germany, settling in the US a little more than a decade before the first world war.</p> <p>And yet, Candidate Trump proposed what he called \u201cideological certification\u201d of immigrants to check their real intent. That was the only way to weed out criminals and terrorists, who somehow blended into one giant alien blob in his combed-over cranium.</p> <p>Trump painted a portrait of a nation overrun by hordes of unassimilated aliens stampeding across the southern border, determined to butcher innocent Americans.</p> <p>Never mind that most undocumented immigrants enter the country by plane and overstay their visas. Never mind that Barack Obama has <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/obamas-deportation-policy-numbers/story?id=41715661\">deported</a> more people than any other president, and more than every president in the 20th  century combined.</p> <p>The US government apparently knows about all these criminal aliens, often detains them, but just keeps on releasing them back into society to wreak havoc. \u201cWe\u2019re like the big bully that keeps getting beat up,\u201d Trump lamented. \u201cDidya ever see that? The big bully that keeps getting beat up.\u201d</p> <p>No, we\u2019ve never seen that \u2013 except in one presidential candidate\u2019s recent trip to Mexico. <br></p> <p>Trump thinks of himself as a tough negotiator who knows the art of the deal. So when he travels to Mexico to confront the leader of a country that he thinks is ripping us off with bad trade deals, and sending its bad guys over the nonexistent border, we know exactly what to expect.</p> <p>A polite and friendly conversation that doesn\u2019t discuss his plan to force the Mexicans to pay for the wall he wants to build.</p> <p>This is clearly a cunning negotiation tactic. He has already confused the Mexican president, Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto, who told the world that Mexico would not pay for the Great Wall of Trump. \u201cI made it clear that Mexico will not pay for the wall,\u201d the president said bluntly.</p> <p>Trump himself had a different take. \u201cWe did discuss the wall,\u201d he said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t discuss payment of the wall. That will be for a later date. This was a very preliminary meeting. I think it was an excellent meeting.\u201d</p> <p>Other people hear \u201cno\u201d and think it means \u201cno\u201d. Other people negotiate by trying to move the other side closer to their own price. Other people speak up in a discussion. </p> <p>Not Trump. He negotiates by saying the discussion never happened. That\u2019s what \u201cvery preliminary\u201d means. An \u201cexcellent meeting\u201d is one where you lull the opposition into a false sense of victory.</p> <p>\u201cToday was the first part of the discussion, and a relationship-builder between Mr Trump and President Pe\u00f1a Nieto,\u201d said Jason Miller, a senior communications advisor to the nominee. \u201cIt was not a negotiation, and that would have been inappropriate.\u201d</p> <p>More appropriate was what came out of Trump\u2019s mouth when he returned to the land of the free. \u201cWe will build a great wall along the southern border,\u201d Trump told his cheering supporters in Phoenix, Arizona. At this point, he walked across the stage and applauded himself. </p> <p>\u201cAnd Mexico will pay for the wall. 100%. They don\u2019t know it yet, but they\u2019re going to pay for it.\u201d</p> <p>No, they clearly don\u2019t know it. But there were some clues left by some Trump staffers.

I am certain I can say, \u2018See you soon,\u2019\u201d she told supporters in Brasilia. </p> <p>In keeping with her pledge to fight until the end for the 54 million voters who put her in office, Rousseff \u2013 a former Marxist guerrilla \u2013 ended her presidency this week with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/29/brazil-president-dilma-rousseff-impeachment-trial\">a gritty 14-hour defence of her government\u2019s achievements</a> and a sharply worded attack on the \u201cusurpers\u201d and \u201ccoup-mongers\u201d who ejected her from power without an election.<br></p> <p>Her lawyer, Jos\u00e9 Eduardo Cardozo, said the charges were trumped up to punish the president\u2019s support for a huge corruption investigation that has snared many of Brazil\u2019s elite. This follows secret recordings of Romero Juc\u00e1, the majority leader of the senate and a key Temer ally, plotting to remove the president to halt the Lava Jato (car wash) investigation into kickbacks at state oil company Petrobras.</p> <p>While Rousseff was in the upper chamber, her critics heard her in respectful silence. But in a final session in her absence on Tuesday, they lined up to condemn her. As in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/18/dilma-rousseff-congress-impeach-brazilian-president\">an earlier lower house impeachment debate</a>, the senators \u2013 many of whom are accused of far greater crimes \u2013 clearly revelled in the spotlight of their ten-minute declarations. Reflecting the growing power of rightwing evangelism, many invoked the name of God. One cited Winston Churchill. Another sang. Another appeared to be in tears. </p> <p>\u201cI apologise to the president, not for having done what did, because I could not have done anything else, but because I know her situation is not easy,\u201d claimed a sobbing Jana\u00edna Paschoal, one of the original co-authors of the impeachment petition. \u201cI think she understands I did all this in consideration of her grandchildren.\u201d<br></p> <p>The result was never in doubt, though Workers\u2019 party figurehead and former president Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/04/brazil-ex-president-luiz-ignacio-lula-da-silva-interview\">who also faces a trial of his own</a> \u2013 had lobbied hard until the last moment to try to swing enough senators to avoid impeachment.</p> <p>At the end of the marathon 16-hour session of speeches, the final nail was hammered in by the former Brazilian footballer Rom\u00e1rio, who had been rumoured to be among the few senators who might change their minds and save the president. Instead, he wound up the debate by confirming that he would once again vote for impeachment. \u201cIt\u2019s a sad moment when you decide to remove a president,\u201d he told the chamber. However he said he was convinced that Rousseff had committed a crime of responsibility.<br></p> <p>Ahead of the verdict, senator Vanessa Grazziotin, of the Communist Party of Brazil, arrived with a sense of resignation. \u201cI\u2019ve worn a mixture of red [for the Workers\u2019 party] and black because today is a day of mourning,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m going to cry.\u201d However, she and other Rousseff allies hoped they could minimise Rousseff\u2019s punishment.<br></p> <p>Workers\u2019 party senator Lindbergh Farias said the president\u2019s accusers were cowards. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing how everyone who didn\u2019t have the gall to look Dilma in the eyes, spoke so bravely today in her absence,\u201d <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LindbergFarias/status/770700380242083840\">he tweeted</a>.</p> <p>The final result was comfortably more than the two-thirds (54 seats) needed to finalise the president\u2019s removal from office.</p> <p>Shortly after <a>1.30pm</a>, suspense filled the floor as senators watched as the upper house reached a quorum. Among the last to vote was the Workers Party\u2019s Jorge Viana as a hush fell across the packed room. There were cheers of \u201cBrazil!\u201d from the pro-impeachment camp as the numbers flashed up on the screen before a group of senators burst into a rendition of the national anthem. </p> <p>There were modest exchanges of \u201ccongratulations\u201d and backslapping between impeachment supporters as Juc\u00e1, who was drawn into the Lava Jato corruption scandal, said he was \u201crelieved\u201d by the result.</p> <p>Edison Lobao, of the PMDB, who voted for Rousseff\u2019s ouster, said: \u201cI couldn\u2019t have voted differently regardless of who was the president. I would have voted for the impeachment of any president who acted outside the law.\u201d</p> <p>The musician and democracy activist Chico Buarque, who was among Rousseff\u2019s supporters in the gallery, said the debate was rigged against her. \u201cIf the game were clean, she would have won,\u201d <a href=\"https://twitter.com/midianinja/status/770392899125063680?refsrc=email&amp;s=11\">he told local media</a>.</p> <p>Others noted that Rousseff\u2019s removal from office less than halfway through her mandate reinforced the impression that the country\u2019s political class remains uncomfortable with democracy although more than 30 years have passed since the end of Brazil\u2019s military dictatorship. Only two of the last eight directly-elected presidents have completed their terms. Two have been impeached, one removed in a military coup, one killed himself, one died before taking power and another resigned.</p> <p>It also marks a dramatic downfall of a woman who was once one of the world\u2019s most popular politicians with approval ratings of 85%. But she had struggled with a hostile congress and a dire financial climate. When Rousseff took office in January 2011, the economy was growing at a quarterly clip of 4.9%. <a href=\"http://saladeimprensa.ibge.gov.br/noticias?view=noticia&amp;id=1&amp;idnoticia=3245&amp;busca=1 \">It has been downhill ever since and she leaves the presidency with output shrinking by 4.6%</a> though this is partly because the price of Brazil\u2019s oil exports is now below half of its peak in 2011.</p> <p>Rousseff\u2019s achievements in office were mainly an expansion of equality policies put in place by her predecessors, particularly the <em>bolsa familia</em> poverty relief program, <a href=\"http://aplicacoes.mds.gov.br/sagi/RIv3/geral/relatorio.php#\">which now reaches almost 14 million households</a>. </p> <p>Thanks to affirmative action and wider access to higher education, university enrolments <a href=\"http://portal.inep.gov.br/superior-censosuperior-sinopse\">jumped 18% during her first term</a>. Since 2009, 2.6 million homes have been delivered by <a href=\"http://www.brasil.gov.br/infraestrutura/2016/03/minha-casa-minha-vida-chega-a-3a-fase-com-2-milhoes-de-novas-moradias-ate-2018\">the government housing program \u2013 <em>Minha Casa Minha Vida</em></a>. But her record in other key areas is mixed. After falling in her first two years in power, deforestation of the Amazon <a href=\"http://www.obt.inpe.br/prodes/index.php\">has started to rise again</a>. Her replacement has a lot to do.<br></p> <p>Temer \u2013 who was widely criticised for appointing an all-male, all-white cabinet when he took power on an interim basis in May \u2013 was sworn in again on Wednesday afternoon and is set to continue until the next presidential election in 2018, when he has promised he will not stand. </p> <p>After being sworn in, Temer promised a \u201cnew era\u201d for Brazil during a televised cabinet meeting. </p> <p>\u201cFrom today on, the expectations are much higher for the government. I hope that in these two years and four months, we do what we have declared \u2013 put Brazil back on track,\u201d he said. Regarding his upcoming trip to China, he said it was important to show that stability had returned. \u201cWe are traveling precisely to reveal to the world that we have political and legal stability,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to show that there is hope in the country.\u201d<br></p> <p>Temer received support from the United States, which implicitly rejected claims that Rousseff had been removed in a coup. US State Department spokesman, John Kirby said, \u201cWe are confident we will continue our strong bilateral relationship. This was a decision made by the Brazilian people and obviously we respect that ... Brazilian democratic institutions have acted within its constitutional framework.\u201d</p> <p>Shortly after the ceremony, he is due to fly to China to attend the G20 summit in Hangzhou, where he will hope to restore some of the credibility of an administration that has been battered by accusations of treachery and three ministerial resignations due to corruption scandals.<br></p> <p>He has promised to introduce austerity measures that will restore Brazil\u2019s credit ratings, which under Rousseff fell to junk levels. This is popular with investors, but not with the public. His approval ratings are only a fraction above those of his predecessor and he was roundly booed during the Olympic opening ceremony.<br></p> <p>During the final stages of the senate trial, there was no repeat of the mass rallies in Brasilia that marked earlier stages of the process. However, a small group of Rousseff supporters staged a candlelit vigil in the main esplanade. Bigger protests have been seen in other cities this week. In S\u00e3o Paulo anti-impeachment protesters and riot police <a href=\"http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2016/08/1808669-manifestantes-pro-dilma-entram-em-confronto-com-a-pm-em-sao-paulo.shtml\">clashed on Monday night</a>. Demonstrators claim the security forces made excessive use of tear gas and percussion grenades in what they fear will be a precursor of more clampdowns on opposition. Police claimed the protesters \u2013 many from the Landless Workers\u2019 Movement \u2013 blocked roads and detonated a home-made bomb.<br></p> <p><em>Additional reporting by Shanna Hanbury</em></p>",

There was no softening. There was just Donald Trump.</p> <p>In Trump\u2019s much heralded immigration speech, the Republican nominee finally put to rest any pretense that he would moderate his views for a general electorate. \u201cThere will be no amnesty,\u201d Trump proclaimed to a cheering crowd.</p> <p>He seemingly went further than that, making clear that he opposed so-called \u201ctouchback amnesty\u201d, under which qualifying illegal immigrants could return to their home countries to apply for an expedited path to legal status: \u201cThose who have left to seek entry under this new system will not be awarded surplus visas, but will have to enter under the immigration caps or limits that will be established.\u201d<br></p> <p>The speech came after Trump had spent weeks hinting at a \u201csoftening\u201d. He even seemed to indicate in an interview with Fox News\u2019 Sean Hannity last week that <a href=\"https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/us-news/2016/aug/24/donald-trump-immigration-reform-sean-hannity-fox-news\">he might support a path to legal status</a> for undocumented immigrants, though he quickly <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/08/25/politics/trump-no-legal-status-for-undocumented-immigrants/\">backed off</a> that statement.</p> <p>There were even signs of a moderate tone earlier Wednesday when Trump <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/31/donald-trump-mexico-meeting-president-pena-nieto-immigration\">met with Mexican president Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto</a> on a surprise visit to Mexico City. At a press conference with Pe\u00f1a Nieto, Trump was restrained and talked about illegal immigration as a humanitarian crisis.</p> <p>It\u2019s clear now that the debate is over. There will not be a more moderate Trump, there will not be a more compassionate Trump. Instead, the same candidate who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jun/16/donald-trump-announces-run-president\">warned the day he announced his run</a>, \u201cWhen Mexico sends its people, they\u2019re not sending their best \u2026 They\u2019re bringing drugs.

It\u2019s pretty long. Here are just a couple:</p> <h2><strong>On people illegally in the US</strong></h2> <p><strong>Trump</strong>: \u201cThey\u2019re treated better than our vets.\u201d</p> <p><strong>The facts:</strong> People in the country illegally do not have the right to work, vote or receive most government benefits. A modest number have been exempted from deportation because of an Obama administration action, but most live under the risk of being removed from the country.</p> <p>Veterans are guaranteed government health care and because almost all are citizens, the right to vote and other government benefits.</p> <p>The quality of their care has been criticized by Trump and others, but people in the country illegally do not have equivalent rights to health care, except for emergency treatment. Public hospitals are required to provide emergency medical care regardless of immigration status.</p> <h2>On the number of people in the US illegally</h2> <p><strong>Trump:</strong> \u201cOur government has no idea. It could be 3 million, it could be 30 million. They have no idea.\u201d</p> <p><strong>The facts:</strong> The government actually has an idea. The homeland security department estimates there are 11.4 million people in the United States illegally. Few in the immigration debate challenge that estimate.</p> <p>The figure comes from an analysis of the most recent census data. The government compares the number of people whom the census reports as foreign-born with the number of people who have been admitted legally and gained citizenship. The most recent estimate dates to January 2012. It roughly matches the estimates of demographers from the Pew Foundation, which issues its estimates more rapidly than the government.</p> <p>Experts believe the number of people in the US illegally has been steadily declining as Mexicans and others return to their home country and illegal border crossings dwindle.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57c7967be4b0df5f040dc160\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-01T03:00:52.067Z\">4.00am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Today in Campaign 2016</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Let\u2019s just focus on the key aspects of Donald Trump\u2019s speech:</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"51af965c8b9d2f6a24fa4df8ecc7f17981d1ed44\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/51af965c8b9d2f6a24fa4df8ecc7f17981d1ed44/0_0_4128_2752/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Donald Trump.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Donald Trump.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Evan Vucci/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Donald Trump\u2019s speech on immigration, anticipated by some to be a \u201csoftening\u201d - as the candidate himself described it - on the issue, instead was a retrenchment in some of his most aggressive policies, including ideological tests for would-be visa applicants and the creation of a deportation force to hunt down undocumented immigrants residing in the United States, and included some new ones that have never been mentioned by a mainstream presidential candidate in the modern era.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s proposals included: the construction of a 2,000-mile border wall along the US-Mexico border, to be paid for by Mexico; the implementation of new restrictions on legal immigration into the US; a \u201csunset\u201d on visa laws requiring Congress to rewrite them every few years; a ban on taxpayer funding for cities that don\u2019t deport undocumented immigrants.</p> <p>The tone of the speech was not dissimilar to that of a Breitbart News article on the subject - appropriate, given that Trump campaign operatives revealed to reporters after the speech\u2019s commencement that former Breitbart chair Stephen Bannon was instrumental in the speech\u2019s crafting.</p> <p>The tone of the speech outpaces even Trump\u2019s own aggressive rhetoric on undocumented immigrants, and effectively puts the lid on any claims that he is moving towards the center with less than 70 days to go until the general election.</p> <p>Not all conservatives are pleased, however.</p> <p>A member of Donald Trump\u2019s evangelical advisory board:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/tonysuarez80/status/771176763166646272\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Extremely disappointed.</p>&mdash; Tony Suarez-NHCLC VP (@tonysuarez80) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tonysuarez80/status/771176763166646272\">September 1, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57c795c3e4b0f6cb85628bed\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-01T02:45:53.618Z\">3.45am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <h2>Donald Trump, in conclusion:</h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Now is the time for the media to begin asking questions on their behalf.

We rec the right of either country to build a physical barrier or wall on any of its borders to stop the illegal movement of people, weapons and drugs,\u201d Trump said. The move is \u201cparamount to both the United States and to Mexico.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNumber three: Dismantling drug cartels,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThis can only be done with cooperation, and intelligence and intelligence sharing.</p> <p>\u201cImproving Nafta, number four. Nafta is a 22-year-old agreement that must be update to reflect the realities of today,\u201d Trump said, which would make both countries \u201cstronger and keep industry in our hemisphere.

All of the above have sent Mexican confidence in its president plunging.</p> <p>The embarrassing thing is that we can actually see Pe\u00f1a Nieto\u2019s logic at work in real time as this disaster unfolds. The president thinks that he will see the bad man, appear stern to the bad man, tell everyone that he was indeed stern to the bad man and then his poll numbers will rise. Easy. There\u2019s only one problem with this plan.

  "<p>Following a successful run in the United States, a vibrant stage production reimagining American political history as a rollicking musical has arrived in Australia.

Bulging with racy, crowd-pleasing gags and mostly memorable show tunes, Clinton: The Musical offers welcome respite from that other sideshow: the current US election campaign.</p> <p>The curtain rises on a tableau that will delight its presumably left-leaning audience and terrorise any masochistic Republicans scattered among them: the first lady, Hillary Rodham Clinton, reclining in the Oval Office, cigar in hand, unfazed by decades of public tumult. </p> <p>Tumult, it is suggested, is what helped her run \u2013 so successfully she can almost taste it \u2013 for president in 2016.<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/may/03/hamilton-broadway-musical-tony-awards\">Hamilton: the Broadway musical sensation that's changing lives</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In the two hours that follow, we learn what led HRC to her Cersei-like state (an evolution actress Lisa Adam devours with her vigorous, hilarious performance) \u2013 specifically, her husband, Bill, getting caught conducting an affair with intern Monica Lewinsky while serving as 42nd president. Remember that?</p> <p>This is a play concerned with the infamous hardening of a Clinton (just not the Clinton we usually think of when we think of that word). And while Hillary\u2019s rise may be presented as merely a consequence of Bill\u2019s betrayal, no one leaving the theatre will be unclear about who pulls the strings in the relationship. </p> <p>Australian playwrights Michael and Paul Hodge deconstruct the contradictions of William Jefferson Clinton by dividing him into two separate characters, with the positively presidential WJ (Simon Burke) at odds with his sunglasses-wearing, sax-playing, dress-ruining alter ego, Billy (Matt Dyktynski). They share the stage and argue, despite none of the other characters \u2013 save HRC \u2013 ever seeing the split personality at work. </p> <p>The show, directed in Australia by Adam Mitchell, is making its Antipodean debut in Perth, having premiered at the Edinburgh fringe festival in 2012 before being refined for an <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/jul/23/clinton-review-musical-should-be-impeached\">off-Broadway staging in New York</a>.

Luke Hewitt plays Newt Gingrich as a simpleton, forever under Starr\u2019s thumb.</p> <p>The other two members of the cast, Megan Kozak and Clare Moore, pull out all the stops in a variety of roles.

But the teenager said Wednesday\u2019s rematch on the faster blue DecoTurf of Queens played more to her strengths.</p> <p>\u201cI played a little bit better today than the last time, too,\u201d the 17-year-old from Atherton, California, said. \u201cSay I went down the line in the last match. I\u2019d go for a cross-court heavy in this match and then would end up winning that point just because I played that shot a little bit smarter this time.\u201d</p> <p>Bellis, who has given a verbal commitment to play at Stanford University, earned $140,000 in prize money with Wednesday\u2019s win, a windfall she must forfeit to maintain her college eligibility. But NCAA by-laws grant leeway for travel expenses, which allowed the two-time tournament darling to upgrade her hotel room.</p> <p>\u201cI just moved up to a regular suite,\u201d she said with a laugh. \u201cMaybe the presidential suite this time.\u201d</p> <p>So far the world No158 has resisted the impulse to turn professional, even as it\u2019s become increasingly clear she can compete at the tour level. She defeated another French Open quarter-finalist, Belgium\u2019s Alison Van Uytvanck, in Friday\u2019s final qualifying match to book a place in the main draw. But for the time being, Bellis reasserted her plan to stay the amateur course.</p> <p>\u201cI think it\u2019s the same for now,\u201d she said. \u201cBut, you know, we\u2019ll see how the rest of the tournament goes for me.\u201d</p> <p>It certainly won\u2019t get any easier. Bellis will be a decided underdog in Friday\u2019s third round against No2 seed and Australian Open champion Angelique Kerber, a match almost certain to be scheduled for a show court. And with Team CiCi presumably back on the grounds for a sixth time in a week and a half, the home-court advantage will be palpable.</p> <p>\u201cI never played on Ashe before,\u201d she said. \u201cI think it would just be even better for me, more fun for me.\u201d</p>"

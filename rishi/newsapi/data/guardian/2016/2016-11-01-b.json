The Democratic candidate has repeatedly lambasted high pricing \u2013 describing that of EpiPen, drug firm Mylan\u2019s emergency treatment of anaphylaxis, as \u201coutrageous\u201d and accusing <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/feb/04/martin-shkreli-refuses-to-testify-congress-drug-daraprim\">entrepreneur Martin Shkreli of \u201cprice gouging\u201d vital medicines</a>.</p> <p>Shire\u2019s chief executive, Flemming \u00d8rnskov, admitted that firms that managed prescription US drug plans wanted to \u201cmanage a number of categories more tightly\u201d including haemophilia.</p> <p>\u201cWe live in an environment, certainly during a presidential campaign, where price is in high focus,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cWe can expect for all our categories, not just haemophilia, tighter management, but we have the programmes in place to make sure this does not affect our patients and has limited impact on our overall business. I remain incredibly confident about the outlook for haemophilia.\u201d</p> <p>\u00d8rnskov said existing patients would not be forced to switch haemophilia medications as this would be considered too risky.</p> <p>The Danish businessman was upbeat about Shire\u2019s new drug for dry eye disease. Launched in August, Xiidra has already taken a 16% market share in the US. The eye drop is expected to generate annual sales of more than $1bn by 2020.</p> <p>Shire said its integration of Illinois-based Baxalta, which specialises in treatments for rare blood conditions, cancer and immune system disorders, was ahead of schedule. </p> <p>Sales of haemophilia medicines, also acquired from Baxalta, fell by 6% to $884m in the three months to 30 September, which Shire blamed on the timing of some large orders. </p> <p>Overall, sales more than doubled to $3.3bn after the acquisition, but this was slightly lower than analysts had expected. Excluding Baxalta, revenues rose 12%.</p> <p>Costs related to the takeover were also higher than Shire expected, partly because it has accelerated some factory closures in the US.</p> <p>Shire is based in Dublin for tax purposes and run from Boston. As announced in the spring, it is pushing ahead with the closure of its Basingstoke office, where 270 people work. </p> <p>The company wants to open an office in the Paddington, London, as its UK commercial base, so it can be \u201ccloser to the heart of life science communities\u201d. There has been <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.basingstokeobserver.co.uk/job-loss-blow-for-basingstoke\">speculation that some staff may be moved to Dublin</a>.</p>",

According to the ABC/Washington Post tracking <a href=\"http://www.langerresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/1184a102016ElectionTrackingNo10.pdf\">poll</a> published on Tuesday (conducted October 27-30), the Democratic candidate has now slipped behind Donald Trump, on 45% to her Republican opponent\u2019s 46%.

Far more important will be the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2016/oct/29/voter-turnout-us-election-2016-register\">turnout</a> - especially since the two leading presidential candidates are so <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/31/polls-donald-trump-hillary-clinton-unpopularity\">close in terms of unpopularity</a>. And the candidates know it. A senior adviser to Donald Trump reportedly <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/presidential-races/303034-trump-aide-we-have-three-major-voter-suppression\">revealed</a> last week that \u201cwe have three major voter suppression operations under way\u201d intended to reduce votes for Clinton among African Americans, white liberals and young women.</p> <p>Even though election day is still a week away, we already have some clues about whether turnout is lower among those groups \u2013 because more than <a href=\"http://www.electproject.org/early_2016\">25m</a> ballots have already been cast under the US early voting system. Approximately 125 million to 145 million Americans are <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.predictit.org/Market/2188/What-will-be-2016-voter-turnout-for-the-presidential-election\">predicted</a> to vote in the 2016 election, so those early votes represent a significant share of the expected total. </p> <h2><strong>Higher turnout than at this time in 2012</strong></h2> <p>Of the 15 states that provide detailed information about those ballots,  North Carolina, California and nine other states report <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/10/31/us/elections/earlyvoters.html?_r=0\">more</a> early voters than at the same point in the 2012 election. Ohio, Nevada, Colorado and Iowa showed a decline in early voting, and those declines were small.</p> <h2><strong>Early signs of declining turnout from black voters and young voters</strong></h2> <p>The early results offer mixed news for Clinton. Early votes suggest that young voters \u2013 who are much <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.people-press.org/2015/04/07/a-deep-dive-into-party-affiliation/\">more likely</a> than older voters to lean Democratic \u2013 might be staying at home. In 12 states, fewer Americans aged 18 to 29 have cast a ballot so far in this election compared with this point in 2012.  This could be especially problematic for Clinton if this group is indicative of a broader \u201c<a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/1031867576877207/\">Bernie or bust</a>\u201d sentiment in which supporters of the former Democratic candidate Bernie Sanders choose to stay at home rather than voting for Clinton.</p> <p>Young voters aren\u2019t the only demographic group that appears put off. Early votes suggest that black turnout has fallen in eight states \u2013 especially in North Carolina, a state that yields <a href=\"https://www.archives.gov/federal-register/electoral-college/allocation.html\">15 of the 270</a> electoral college votes needed to win the election and where polling suggests Clinton is in a <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/nc/north_carolina_trump_vs_clinton-5538.html\">close contest</a>. If Trump\u2019s strategy is indeed to suppress the black vote, that makes a lot of sense \u2013 those voters could be crucial for Clinton to secure the White House.</p> <h2><strong>\u2026 but up among Hispanic voters</strong></h2> <p>The good news for Clinton is that Hispanic turnout is up across all states where early voting data is available. More votes from this strongly Democratic-leaning group is good news for Clinton, but it might not be enough to offset declines in black and young votes. Because Hispanic turnout has historically been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/datablog/2016/jan/25/us-hispanic-latino-voters-us-election-2016\">low</a>, it needs to increase significantly for this voting bloc to have a real impact. </p> <p>There\u2019s one other source of potential comfort for both candidates in all this. Maybe early voting behavior is a bad predictor of overall voting behavior. It could be that fewer young voters are casting their ballots now because they are just less likely to plan ahead than they were in 2012. Or Hillary Clinton might not be relying on young people for victory, choosing instead to base more of her potential winning coalition on older Americans who have <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.census.gov/prod/2014pubs/p20-573.pdf\">consistently</a> been a more reliable voting group historically. </p>",

This election isn\u2019t just going to be studied by political historians; I reckon Hollywood is going to be mining it for inspiration.</p> <p>By election day the campaign will have run for more than 600 days. Nobody is sure how it\u2019s going to end, although theories abound. However, I do have one spoiler for you. We\u2019re going to miss this election. Really, we are. Sure, we\u2019ll be relieved it\u2019s all over but we\u2019ll also be changed. Sad! So before the dramatic climax, let\u2019s look back at some of the elements that have made Election 2016 a must-watch.</p> <p><strong>Strategic targeting of a female audience </strong></p> <p>Previous instalments of American Democracy have focused on male protagonists. This year, of course, central casting decided to shake things up and make the Democratic nominee a woman. If you\u2019re from the UK, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Moldova, South Korea, Kyrgyzstan, Nepal, or around 60 other countries, the whole first-female-head-of-state thing is an old plot device. But women have been waiting a long time for this moment in the US. Indeed, there are women who have been waiting 96 years for this. Women didn\u2019t get the right to vote in America until 1920, meaning there are women born before female suffrage who are now getting the opportunity to vote for a female president.</p> <p><strong>An inspirational outsider</strong></p> <p>As if potentially having the first female president wasn\u2019t groundbreaking enough, you get a guy like Trump entering the race. An outsider. A guy who inherited a fortune and, through hard work and determination, is still very rich. A guy no one thought would make it in America, let alone run for president. But he pushed through. He said things like they were. He stood up for the small folk: the racists and the misogynists and the homophobes. Truly, Trump is an inspiration to us all. A reminder that if you\u2019re born rich and act like an entitled bigot you too can make it in America.</p> <p><strong>A cameo by an evil Brit</strong></p> <p>The British villain is a Hollywood staple. There\u2019s Daniel Day-Lewis as Bill the Butcher in Gangs of New York. Anthony Hopkins in Silence of the Lambs. Ian McKellen as Magneto in X-Men. And this election keeps that trope alive and well with Nigel Farage starring as the smarmy sidekick.</p> <p><strong>The threat of an imminent apocalypse </strong></p> <p>How many Trump supporters think he will start a nuclear war? It\u2019s 22%. And yet they are still supporting him. Proof that some people are really committed to drama.</p> <p><strong>Always-on immersion</strong></p> <p>Believe it or not, this isn\u2019t the craziest election ever. There\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/oct/02/how-did-hamilton-become-broadway-breakout-hit\" title=\"\">Hamilton</a>, of course, and an election that caused so much bother it resulted in Aaron Burr, a sitting vice president, killing a Founding Father in a duel in 1804. In 1860, Lincoln won the election but lost the south. Gore v Bush in 2000 resulted in a recount. But what none of those elections had was Twitter.</p> <p><strong>A will-he-won\u2019t-he cliffhanger</strong></p> <p>If Clinton wins, is Trump actually going to concede? During the third presidential debate, Trump told the moderator: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/oct/19/donald-trump-accept-election-result-debate-video\" title=\"\">\u201cI will tell you at the time. I\u2019ll keep you in suspense, OK?\u201d</a> Clinton called Trump\u2019s response \u201chorrifying\u201d, but I\u2019ve got to say, the guy sure knows how to keep a storyline going.</p>",

But a second, more substantial, response chased behind it in the form of a rather basic, and recurrent, question. Why is the UK establishment in general, and UK intelligence in particular, so fixated on a supposed threat from Russia?</p> <p>The cold war is a quarter-century behind us. The Warsaw Pact was dissolved; the Soviet Union collapsed. Today\u2019s Russia has three quarters of the territory but only half the population of the old Soviet Union. <a href=\"http://www.tradingeconomics.com/russia/gdp\" title=\"\">Its GDP</a>, whether overall or per capita, is far below that of the US, or ours. Its 2015 military budget took 5% of that \u2013 <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_budget_of_the_Russian_Federation\" title=\"\">$70bn in actual money</a> \u2013 less than an eighth of the nearly <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_budget_of_the_United_States\" title=\"\">$600bn spent by the US</a>. \u201cTsar\u201d Vladimir Putin may have played a weak hand magnificently, as judged by admirers and detractors alike, but a weak hand is still a weak hand.</p> <p>If Russia really harbours ambitions to reconstitute an empire, its only success to date is the expensive (in every respect) reacquisition of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/crimea\" title=\"\">Crimea</a>, a contested no-man\u2019s land of ragtag rebels in the rust belt of eastern <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine\" title=\"\">Ukraine</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jul/14/georgia-accuses-russia-of-violating-international-law-over-south-ossetia\" title=\"\">two miniature enclaves</a> inside independent Georgia. That recent \u201cshow of force\u201d, when the might of the Russian navy made its stately progress through the English Channel, demonstrated only the obsolescence of the erstwhile superpower\u2019s fleet.</p> <p>In the same interview, Parker disclosed that there were around 3,000 \u201cviolent Islamic extremists in the UK, mostly British\u201d, and that cyber, not just in Russia\u2019s hands, was the threat of the future. So let me repeat the question: why does Russia remain bogeyman-in-chief?</p> <p>Here are a few ideas. The first is that blaming Russia carries little cost. Russia is not China. Investment is not a big consideration. For all sorts of reasons, political relations have long been dire. Applying the same virulent rhetoric to terrorism conducted in the name of Islam, on the other hand, risks fomenting social and cultural strife here at home.</p> <p>A second reason, now as in the past, is that blaming Russia aligns us comfortably with the US, where stalwarts in Congress and at the Pentagon have never emerged from their old thinking about the threat. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/31/trump-organization-server-russia-bank-slate-report\" title=\"\">Russia card</a> has been played to exhaustion during this presidential campaign, to the point where it could swing the election \u2013 and I don\u2019t mean in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\" title=\"\">Donald Trump</a>\u2019s favour.</p> <p>A third factor is the consensus about a strong and malevolent Russia that still rules the \u201cexpert\u201d community, and will probably do so for a few years yet \u2013 helped along by the hatchet-faced Putin. There are younger specialists who take a rather different view, but they are drowned out by the ingrained cliches. Note how quickly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/boris\" title=\"\">Boris Johnson</a> was \u201cturned\u201d from the realist of his journalist days to the fierce cold warrior foreign secretary. Such a U-turn makes him look intellectually foolish \u2013 but no more foolish, some might argue, than he has made himself look on so many other scores.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/10/vladimir-putin-theresa-may-cooperation-litvinenko\">Theresa May should beware Putin: he doesn\u2019t do \u2018cooperation\u2019 | Luke Harding</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Then again, all this anti-Russianism from MI5 could just be a front. Although it is hard to understand what purpose would be served by presenting Russians as scarier than jihadis or the gangsters who supposedly roam London in search of machine guns, disinformation is the stock in trade of intelligence services everywhere. Or \u2013 perish the thought \u2013 the judgments could just be wrong. There have, after all, been egregious mistakes, even where the material has been gathered and interpreted in good faith. Look no further than the data on Iraq\u2019s chemical weapons, as assessed by Parker\u2019s colleagues and institutional rivals across the Thames.</p> <p>I wonder, though, whether the real secret behind the MI5 chief\u2019s Russia focus is that it is starting to become harder to demonise Russia now. Time was when James Bond and the pantomime idea of a Russia threat were an easy sell \u2013 able to bolster departmental claims to a bigger budget. But look at the \u201cbelow the line\u201d comments on what Parker had to say and there is a current of dissent that cannot come exclusively from so-called Kremlin \u201ctrolls\u201d. You hear something similar in phone-ins on Russian topics, where the voice of a sceptical public comes across loud and strong.

  "<p>Evangelicals in the 2016 election have proven loyal to the Republican Party in spite of Donald Trump\u2019s continued ... moral issues. In the latest <a href=\"http://www.prri.org/spotlight/religion-vote-2016/\">PRRI poll</a>, white evangelicals are the largest religious group, with 66% of them supporting Trump. This support has created fissures in the movement, with some evangelicals<a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2016/10/trump-evangelicals-letter-condemning-bigotry-229271\"> protesting</a> Trump, while others such as Jerry Falwell Jr are <a href=\"https://www.liberty.edu/champion/2016/03/falwell-speaks/\">comparing</a> Trump to King David. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/17/liberty-university-protest-donald-trump-jerry-falwell-endorsement\">I never thought I'd find common ground with evangelicals. Enter Donald Trump | Michael Arceneaux</a> </p> </aside>  <p>If Trump loses the election, the only unifying issues evangelicals will have left are abortion and their hatred of Hillary Clinton. Even with these, they stand to become less influential in political activity.</p> <p>In the past, candidates\u2019 performances of \u201cChristianity\u201d have been strong points for voters, but Trump\u2019s ascendancy with evangelicals has eviscerated that expectation. Evangelicals, like other voters, can be very pragmatic about the issues they want addressed by the leadership they support. In the 2016 election cycle, evangelicals are concerned about the supreme courts, Isis, Islam and nostalgia, as Robert Jones <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/11/opinion/campaign-stops/the-evangelicals-and-the-great-trump-hope.html?_r=0\">shows</a>. For evangelical voters, these issues trump the candidate\u2019s personal morality. <br></p> <p>Loyalty to Trump has not only a moral but also a structural cost. It will not mean the \u201cReligious Right\u201d is finished, rather that Catholics, Mormons and other religious conservatives will be better positioned to carry its values, lessening evangelical influence. Mormons have been very <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/10/us/politics/utah-mormons-republicans-donald-trump.html\">opposed</a> to Trump, and Catholic voters are evenly <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.prri.org/research/prri-brookings-october-19-2016-presidential-election-horserace-clinton-trump/\">split</a> between Trump and Clinton. They, not evangelicals, will be able to claim the values high ground post-election.</p> <p>Trump has also proven that Republican presidential candidates do not necessarily have to pander to power brokers such as Bob Vanderplaats, head of the Family Leader in Iowa, or Tony Perkins of Family Research Council. Trump amassed his own coterie of Prosperity Gospel preachers who were not traditional evangelical leaders, such as Paula White, and as a result reached a whole other segment of the religious population more in tune with Trump\u2019s promise of returning economic prosperity and his use of the media. Even James Dobson, longtime evangelical leader of Focus on the Family, had to use <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2016/07/donald-trump-pastor-paula-white-225315\">White</a> to convince his following that Trump was really a \u201cbaby Christian\u201d because she had led him to Christ. </p> <p>Trump has changed the ecosystem of the evangelical world, breaking the usual evangelical <a href=\"https://newrepublic.com/article/130422/ted-cruz-lost-evangelical-vote\">synergies</a> that Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio worked diligently during the 2016 presidential campaign. As a result, it will be difficult for those choosing to run in the 2020 election cycle to play the cycle of business as usual in courting the evangelical vote. Merely spouting faith-based language and talking about religious freedom did not gather evangelical votes this cycle as well as Trump\u2019s language of the decline of America, terrorism and fear of immigrants did. Whether Trump knew it or not, his strong language tapped into evangelical beliefs about the \u201clast days\u201d and America\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.breakingisraelnews.com/67748/biblical-numerology-predicts-trump-will-usher-messiah/\">role</a> in biblical prophecy. </p> <p>Samantha Bee jokingly asked: \u201cAre evangelicals that ready to get the apocalypse going?\u201d by <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/samantha-bee-donald-trump-evangelicals_us_5739d7e2e4b08f96c18396a2\">voting</a> for Trump, but their fear of a Hillary Clinton presidency has activated their apocalyptic fervor. Trump has benefitted indirectly from a strong belief of evangelicals that the two terms of Barack Obama has led the country to the <a href=\"http://www.cnsnews.com/blog/michael-w-chapman/pastor-cruz-we-are-brink-destruction-country\">brink</a> of destruction. Obama was bad enough in their eyes; having the Clintons back in the White House would be the end. </p> <p>So while evangelicals are coming together to support Trump, internal frictions are many. Evangelical women are upset about Trump and the accusations of sexual and verbal abuse of women, and <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/acts-of-faith/wp/2016/10/13/no-more-evangelical-women-are-done-with-donald-trump-and-his-misogyny/\">many</a> are angered that their male counterparts have been silent about it. Evangelical women are also large consumers of evangelical media and ministries, and their support of these organizations is crucial. Should they shun both Trump and the predominately male evangelical leadership, it may have a ripple effect in these organizations\u2019 fundraising abilities and their ministerial efforts. </p> <p>Similarly, younger evangelicals and evangelicals of color are very <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/17/us/donald-trump-evangelicals-republican-vote.html\">opposed</a> to Trump. Jim Wallis of Sojourners is very <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2016/10/23/evangelicals-trump-white-conservatives-identity-theft-jim-wallis/92355326/\">vocal</a> that \u201cnot all evangelicals\u201d support Trump, but only white evangelicals are being polled about their political support, not African Americans or Latinos. This brings up the biggest issue that evangelicals face with their support of Trump: that they will be seen as agreeing with Trump\u2019s \u201calt right\u201d <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/17/us/donald-trump-evangelicals-republican-vote.html\">contingent</a> that is not interested in religion, but rather in white nationalism and the restoration of white America. As a result, evangelicals who have claimed to be \u201ccolorblind\u201d find themselves aligning with hate groups who support Trump and are also against Jews and Israel, both important to evangelicals and their beliefs. </p> <p>All of these issues pose important structural and political problems for evangelicals after the 2016 election. I believe that the various coalitions under the evangelical umbrella will be in disarray. Evangelicals will fade in political and social clout on the national stage regarding religious liberty, abortion and the coveted replacement of Antonin Scalia on the US supreme court. Supporting Trump on election day may have many evangelicals gritting their teeth in the ballot box, but it is nothing compared to the aftermath if their \u201cKing David\u201d loses. </p>",

Right now, as far as I know, nobody knows what the appropriate response should be.\u201d</p> <p>Domestically, the online snooping by Russian intelligence agencies is believed to be at least as invasive as that of the National Security Agency revealed by the US whistleblower Edward Snowden. Russian agencies are limited only by geography, hence a recent law that requires websites such as Facebook and Twitter to move servers for Russian users to Russian soil. It is believed that the internet giants have not complied with the demand. </p> <p>A law passed earlier this year also obliges telephone and internet providers to store records of all communications for six months and all metadata for three years, as well as help intelligence agencies decode encrypted messaging services.</p> <p>The law even prompted <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/26/russia-passes-big-brother-anti-terror-laws\">Snowden to attack</a> his Russian protectors for the first time.

In 2011, when Abedin was five months pregnant and working as deputy chief of staff in Clinton\u2019s state department, her husband was forced to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jun/16/anthony-weiner-resigns-twitter-scandal\">stand down</a> from his congressional seat after he inadvertently tweeted a lewd photograph intended for a woman in Seattle to his 45,000 followers.</p> <p>Two years later, when he attempted a comeback run for New York mayor, he was struck low again when his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/23/anthony-weiner-new-york-explicit-photographs\">digital dealings</a> with a woman calling herself Sydney Leathers were exposed. Then this summer Weiner was revealed to have had an <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3790824/Anthony-Weiner-carried-months-long-online-sexual-relationship-troubled-15-year-old-girl-telling-hard-asking-dress-school-girl-outfits-pressing-engage-rape-fantasies.html\">online relationship</a> with an allegedly underage girl, leading to the announcement of Abedin\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/30/nyregion/anthony-weiner-sexting-huma-abedin.html\">legal separation</a> from him in August, and in time to the current FBI investigation into his and Abedin\u2019s emails.</p> <p>Through the thick of all this, Clinton has stood by her woman. It may have had something to do with their shared experience of marital pain: Abedin first started as an intern in \u201cHillaryland\u201d, as the then first lady\u2019s coterie was called in the East Wing, in 1996, two years before President Bill Clinton was impeached for his liaison with a West Wing intern.</p> <p>Or it may be that the two women have simply grown inseparable with the passing of the years, to the extent that Abedin has variously been dubbed \u201cmini Hillary\u201d, Clinton\u2019s \u201csecond daughter\u201d and her \u201cyounger sister\u201d. From that modest beginning as a 19-year-old intern, Abedin has risen from \u201cbody woman\u201d \u2013 a glorified maid \u2013 through travelling chief of staff during Clinton\u2019s first run at the presidency in 2008, to the state department position and now vice-chair of Clinton\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign.</p> <p>The union is so close that Abedin is said to carry Clinton\u2019s cellphone in her bag, prompting Bill Clinton to <a href=\"http://www.newsweek.com/2016/05/06/huma-abedin-hillary-clinton-anthony-weiner-453204.html\">complain</a> that even he can\u2019t get past the gatekeeper.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/30/hillary-clinton-donald-trump-fbi-director-comey-emails\">Clinton emails: FBI gets warrant as Comey told he may have broken law</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cOver the years, we\u2019ve shared stories about our lives, we\u2019ve shared more meals than I can count, we\u2019ve celebrated together, we\u2019ve mourned together,\u201d Abedin told <a href=\"http://www.vogue.com/13464218/huma-abedin-family-job-hillary-clinton-campaign-strategist/\">Vogue</a> earlier this year. </p> <p>What\u2019s different about the current crisis is that though its root may have been Weiner \u2013 yet again \u2013 its danger stems directly from Abedin\u2019s own conduct rather than indirectly in her role as wronged wife. Though it remains unclear exactly what, if any, transgressions might be revealed by the latest FBI investigation, her position is <a href=\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/10/29/huma-abedin-swore-under-oath-she-gave-up-all-the-devices-containing-state-department-emails.html\">complicated</a> by the fact that in June she swore under oath that she had already handed over all devices on which she may have had state department emails \u2013 a deposition in which she appears to have forgotten to have mentioned the shared laptop.</p> <p>So far there is no sign of Clinton turning against her faithful adviser, with John Podesta, chair of the presidential campaign, stating: \u201cWe fully stand behind her.\u201d But with <a href=\"http://nation.foxnews.com/2016/10/30/perjury-huma-abedin-reportedly-pleads-ignorance-after-swearing-turn-over-all-devices\">Fox News</a> invoking the word perjury, a new rightwing conspiracy appears to be well under construction.</p> <p>Could this be one wrench too far for the Clinton-Abedin partnership? \u201cDespite the closeness of the two women,\u201d Baker said, \u201cthere\u2019s an agreement among political people that even friendship must give way to necessity \u2013 and no one understands that better than Hillary Clinton.\u201d</p>",
  "<h2><strong>What\u2019s the problem with Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails?</strong></h2> <p>Clinton used a private email server, situated in her New York home, while she was secretary of state, from 2009 to 2013. She has admitted that this was a mistake. In July, the FBI concluded that Clinton and her aides had been \u201cextremely careless\u201d in their handling of classified information but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/05/fbi-no-charges-hillary-clinton-email-investigation\">should not face criminal charges</a>.

As many as 650,000 messages were reportedly found on a laptop seized during an unrelated investigation of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/29/anthony-weiner-hillary-clinton-fbi-emails\">Anthony Weiner</a>, a former New York congressman who is the estranged husband of longtime Clinton aide <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/29/huma-abedin-anthony-weiner-hillary-clinton\">Huma Abedin</a>.</p> <p>Abedin and Weiner separated after Weiner was caught in 2011, 2013 and again in 2016 sending women sexually explicit text messages and pictures of himself undressed. Federal authorities in New York and North Carolina are investigating online communications between Weiner and a 15-year-old girl. </p> <p>Senior officials at the Department of Justice expressed concern that Comey\u2019s decision to inform Congress would be inconsistent with protocols designed to avoid the appearance of interference in an election. But the FBI director went ahead.</p> <h2><strong>What is in the emails?</strong></h2> <p>We don\u2019t know. Comey himself admitted: \u201cThe FBI cannot yet assess whether or not this material may be significant.\u201d Those mails with a connection to Clinton\u2019s server could merely be duplicates of emails already analysed. Or they could contain a smoking gun that compromises Clinton even after the election. On Sunday, the FBI obtained a warrant to begin reviewing the newly discovered emails. The process will not be finished before election day.</p> <h2><strong>What was the reaction to Comey\u2019s announcement?</strong></h2> <p>The timing, less than two weeks before a presidential election, drew harsh criticism from Democrats and even some Republicans. At an organising event in Daytona Beach, Clinton called Comey\u2019s actions \u201cunprecedented\u201d and \u201cdeeply troubling\u201d.</p> <p>Her campaign launched an all-out war on Comey. Chairman John Podesta said: \u201cBy providing selective information, he\u2019s allowed partisans to distort and exaggerate in order to inflict maximum political damage and no one can separate what is true from what is not because Comey has not been forthcoming with the facts.\u201d </p> <p>The wider Democratic establishment also weighed in: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/30/democratic-senators-fbi-director-comey-clinton-emails-letter\">four senators demanded a briefing from Comey</a> and nearly 100 former Department of Justice officials and prosecutors, both Republican and Democratic and led by the former Obama attorney general Eric Holder, <a href=\"https://www.hillaryclinton.com/briefing/statements/2016/10/30/open-letter-from-former-federal-prosecutors-and-high-ranking-officials-of-the-u-s-department-of-justice/\">signed a letter</a> criticising Comey\u2019s decision.</p> <p>The Trump campaign, meanwhile, was elated. \u201cWe never thought we were going to say \u2018thank you\u2019 to Anthony Weiner,\u201d the Republican presidential nominee told a rally in Nevada.</p> <h2><strong>Did Comey abuse his power?</strong></h2> <p>The nearly 100 former officials criticised his actions in their open letter, which was released by the Clinton campaign. \u201cDirector Comey\u2019s letter is inconsistent with prevailing department policy, and it breaks with longstanding practices followed by officials of both parties during past elections,\u201d they said.</p> <p>In another scathing letter to Comey, the Democratic Senate minority leader, Harry Reid of Nevada, accused him of clear intent to aid one party over another. \u201cI am writing to inform you that my office has determined that these actions may violate the Hatch Act, which bars FBI officials from using their official authority to influence an election,\u201d Reid wrote. \u201cThrough your partisan actions, you may have broken the law.\u201d</p> <p>Richard Painter, chief White House ethics lawyer from 2005 to 2007, <strong>s</strong>aid he <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/30/opinion/on-clinton-emails-did-the-fbi-director-abuse-his-power.html?_r=0&amp;wpisrc=nl_daily202&amp;wpmm=1\">had filed a complaint</a> against the FBI for a possible violation of the Hatch Act.</p> <h2><strong>What is the Hatch Act?</strong></h2> <p>Passed in 1939, it forbids anyone in the executive branch (apart from the president or vice-president) from using his or her official position to engage in political activity. </p> <p>Carolyn Lerner, head of the US Office of Special Counsel, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/31/opinion/the-hatch-act-a-law-misused.html\">wrote in the New York Times five years ago:</a> \u201cAt its best, [the act] prevents people in political power from abusing their positions. It prohibits coercion by a government supervisor \u2013 such as pressuring employees to volunteer for or contribute to a campaign \u2013 and shields the civil service and the federal workplace from politicking.\u201d</p> <p>In July, the housing secretary, Julian Castro, was found to have <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2016/07/18/investigation-hud-secretary-julian-castro-broke-law-endorsing-clinton-hatch-act/87263314/\">violated</a> the Hatch Act when he expressed support for Clinton. Comey\u2019s action, however, is less blatantly partisan and a case against him would be tough to prove in court.</p> <p>The Republican congressman Trey Gowdy told Fox News on Monday: \u201cIt is laughable that Jim Comey committed a violation of the Hatch Act. I actually know what the Hatch Act is.\u201d</p> <p>Demonstrating a selective reading of the act, he continued: \u201cIf the president of the United States actively campaigning on company time for another candidate to be president of the United States is not a violation of the Hatch Act, then how is Jim Comey supplementing the record and telling the truth to Congress a violation of the Hatch Act?</p> <p>\u201cHarry Reid knows that this is not a violation.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>So why did Comey do it?</strong></h2> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/30/hillary-clinton-lose-election-fbi-email-investigation\">Will Hillary Clinton lose the US election because of the FBI email investigation?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>He told FBI colleagues in a memo on Friday he was aware his letter was at risk of being misunderstood, but felt obliged to notify Congress about the new emails after having told lawmakers that the matter was closed. </p> <p>There have been reports that some members of the FBI were in revolt over Comey\u2019s earlier decision not to recommend charges against Clinton, and that he feared word of the new email investigation would leak to the media, leading to accusations of a cover-up, especially if it happened after 8 November. He therefore regarded going public now as the least worst option.</p> <h2><strong>Will these events affect the election result?</strong></h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/30/hillary-clinton-lose-election-fbi-email-investigation\">Possible but not probable</a>. More than 23 million people have already voted and there is little evidence of movement so far. Clinton still has a three-point lead over Trump, according to <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2016/10/clinton-emails-comey-poll-politico-morning-consult-230519\">a Politico/Morning Consult poll</a> conducted after Comey\u2019s intervention. And a CBS/YouGov survey of likely voters across 13 battleground states showed that only 1% of Clinton supporters were less likely to vote for her after the announcement. </p> <p>Her campaign said its own volunteers had been fired up and this would kill any danger of complacency. Nevertheless, Trump believes he has some fresh momentum from a saga he has described as \u201cbigger than Watergate\u201d. </p> <p>Whichever candidate is dominating the headlines tends to find their poll ratings going down. Clinton probably has enough of a cushion but the bombshell might yet affect tight races for the House and Senate.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 1 November 2016.

Two stops on Monday in Ohio were to be followed by three in Florida on Tuesday and another swing to North Carolina later in the week.</p> <p>\u201cMost people have decided quite a long time ago what they think about all this,\u201d she told a rally in Ohio on Monday. \u201cNow what people are focused upon is choosing the next president and commander-in-chief.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI am sure a lot of you may be asking what this email business is about and why in the world the FBI would decide to jump into an election without any evidence and it\u2019s a good a question,\u201d she said, to boos from a young crowd at Kent State University. \u201cBy all mean they should look at [the emails] and I am sure they will reach the same conclusion as when they looked at my emails: there is no case.\u201d</p> <p>Meanwhile, Clinton suffered another blow from a separate source: the ongoing WikiLeaks release of emails from her campaign chairman, John Podesta. The latest batch appeared to show that Donna Brazile, the interim head of the Democratic National Committee and a CNN contributor, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/31/donna-brazile-hillary-clinton-debate-question-podesta-emails-cnn\">gave Clinton a heads up</a> about a likely debate question the day before she was due to take on Sanders in a primary debate.</p> <p>CNN spokeswoman Lauren Pratapas said: \u201cCNN never gave Brazile access to any questions, prep material, attendee list, background information or meetings in advance of a town hall or debate.\u201d</p> <p>Brazile has subsequently announced <a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/2016/10/31/media/donna-brazile-cnn-resignation/index.html\">her resignation from CNN</a>.</p>",
  "<p>Just a week to go. The overwhelming sense I get from people here in Muncie is that they just want it to be over. Their impatience isn\u2019t just election fatigue \u2013 it\u2019s feels like a kind of nervous exhaustion brought on by the clear fragility of the whole enterprise formerly known as American democracy. But the other thing that\u2019s happened, since <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/28/fbi-reopens-hillary-clinton-emails-investigation\">the email leaks</a> on Friday, is that Democrat supporters are abandoning the notion that Hillary Clinton\u2019s victory will be a formality and are now trying to get their heads around the possibility of a Trump victory. </p> <p>With all the drama and hoopla it\u2019s possible to lose sight of the fact that after eight years of Barack Obama, America may now be set for another milestone with the election of its first female president. The fact that it has achieved this later than many other western nations, amid a campaign seeped in misogyny and machismo, should not detract from the fact that it is happening. </p> <p>So this week I asked women in Muncie how they felt about the chance that Clinton might become president. The town is divided ideologically, generationally, racially and by party on the matter \u2013 but the bottom line seems to be that many will vote for her even if only a few are enthused by her. Some loathe her but most, including those who are not enamoured with her, are angry that she\u2019s being judged by a double standard and believe that this speaks to a broader problem in American society.</p> <p>You can <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/membership/ng-interactive/2016/oct/11/view-middletown-gary-younge-us-presidential-election\">catch up on the project in full here</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/membership/2016/oct/11/us-election-gary-younge-muncie-indiana\">send us your thoughts or recommendations here</a> and <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/events/183617795414091/\">get involved on Facebook</a> here.<br></p> <p><strong>Gary Younge</strong><br>editor-at-large <br>The Guardian</p>",
  "<p>As Bea Sousa went to cast her vote early at Muncie\u2019s courthouse a couple weeks ago, the historic symbolism of the moment crept up on her unawares.

It lasted only 10 seconds or so. I thought about the women suffragists who had been force fed, who had done amazing things, who had stood up to such abuse. Who put off the fight for women\u2019s votes during the civil war.

The most obvious difference is partisan. Like other Trump voters, women who are voting Republican <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/membership/2016/oct/27/middletown-trump-muncie-clinton\">can\u2019t bear her</a>. At last week\u2019s meeting of the Citizens of Delaware County for Good Government (CDCGG), a conservative campaigning group where half of those in attendance were women, one woman asked: \u201cWhat has she ever done for women?\u201d Another replied: \u201cLook at the kind of women who are standing behind her.\u201d</p> <p></p> <p>Responses to Trump\u2019s statements also broadly divide on partisan lines.\u201cThey said he was sexist because he called that beauty queen who\u2019d put on weight Miss Piggy,\u201d said one of the women at CDCGG. \u201cBut women say that kind of thing about women all the time.\u201d</p> <p>When it comes to Trump\u2019s assertion that he \u201cgrabs women by the pussy,\u201d Jamie Walsh, who is in her early 30s and whose only previous presidential vote was for Obama in 2008, said: \u201cIt does bother me but personally I\u2019m not easily offended. I\u2019ve heard worse, I\u2019ve seen worse, I\u2019ve experienced worse \u2013 and all of a sudden these people haven\u2019t heard all these things before. You\u2019re kidding me. I think the outrage is overplayed for votes.\u201d </p> <p>Cathy Day, 48, an English professor at Ball State University who originally backed Bernie Sanders, says: \u201cSince Trump has started boasting about sexually assaulting women the importance of her being a woman has definitely started to speak to me more.\u201d</p> <p>But like many women here who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/membership/2016/oct/20/middletown-bernie-sanders-hillary-clinton-muncie\">originally voted for Sanders</a>, Clinton still does not appeal to Day, who displays a sign for every other Democratic candidate in her front yard but the presidential nominee, even if she will vote for her. \u201cAs a woman it was kind of hard for me to hear some of the anti-Hillary stuff when I was campaigning for Sanders because I think a lot of it came from a place of misogyny,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd sometimes it was women saying it. But I identify as a working-class woman. My class identity is very important to me and her candidacy didn\u2019t really speak to me on that level.\u201d</p> <p>Morgan Aprill, 23, of the Progressive Student Alliance, backed Sanders and is now voting for the Green candidate, Jill Stein. \u201cI think it\u2019s extremely important that there could be a female president,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019ll be good for us too and it\u2019s about time. Of course it\u2019s emblematic. I just wish it was a different woman. I\u2019m voting for another female candidate.\u201d</p> <p>Sousa, who says she is not a \u201crabid Hillary fan\u201d herself, believes a higher bar is being set for Clinton than her male counterparts of the past. \u201cI\u2019ve met a lot of women who detest her intensely,\u201d she says. \u201cI can\u2019t take credit for this statement but I heard someone say: \u2018We\u2019ve gotten used to voting for males we don\u2019t like. We\u2019ve held our nose and we\u2019ve voted for them for whatever reason. But we aren\u2019t used to doing that with a woman.\u2019 Our culture holds women to a higher standard. </p> <p>\u201cI always thought that was an excuse not to treat women equally. It hasn\u2019t been that long since women got the vote \u2026 not even a century yet. So you couldn\u2019t find the perfect woman to run for president any more than you could find the perfect African American to be the first African-American president.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"78734a0c224ee0149a6cf955c455c8ea859e71f9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/78734a0c224ee0149a6cf955c455c8ea859e71f9/0_429_5000_3000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Runners on the Greenway park development that follows the route of the White River through Muncie\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Runners on the Greenway park development that follows the route of the White River through Muncie</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Levene/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Views are also shaded quite heavily by race. Sanders won Delaware County, where Muncie resides, but Clinton won handily in Whitely, the black part of town on the east side. \u201cI\u2019m 33 years old,\u201d says Monique Armstrong, the executive director of <a href=\"http://www.motivateourminds.org/about-us/\">Motivate Our Minds</a> which is based in Whitely and offers after-school and recreational activities to children and teens.</p> <p>\u201cI remember when Hillary was first lady. I\u2019m married but I have not changed my name [as Clinton didn\u2019t initially in her career]. I\u2019m a leader in an organisation. I\u2019ve chosen to dedicate my professional life to improving the lives of children. So when I think about the things they don\u2019t like about her as a candidate they are probably the same things they don\u2019t like about me.\u201d</p> <p>Finally, there seems to be a generational divide. For younger women, who are far more likely to vote for Clinton than older women, the historical relevance of her possible election may not resonate so much.</p> <p>\u201cI think it\u2019s very hard for women who are in their 20s or 30s to understand what women in their 60s and 70s went through when they were coming up that age,\u201d explains Sousa, who several readers suggested we spoke to. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of women of my age who felt themselves passed over because they were female or were verbally harassed just in thoughtless ways rather than mean ways who do value what she has come through. Women who know that they can get into law school and medical school have a whole different perspective on our history as women.\u201d</p> <p>Earlier in the campaign season, the local LWV proposed a forum at which candidates from all the parties could explain their policies as it related to women, as they have often done in the past. The Republicans refused to participate.</p> <p>\u201cIf you look at the things we raise as being of concern to our members they are consistent,\u201d says Hanson. \u201cThey\u2019ve been there for decades. They are pretty mainstream. But now those positions have been identified by some on the far right as being too far left. So the Republican party chair said the candidates didn\u2019t have to participate in our forum and that meant the Democrats couldn\u2019t either.

To that extent it is fairly typical of America.</p> <p>According to a recent poll, women think more progress has been made in overcoming sexism than racism in the past 20 years by a ratio of almost two to one. Roughly <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/17/us/politics/president-poll-women-hillary-clinton.html\">three-quarters of women</a> think there\u2019s some or a lot of sexual harassment in the workplace and believe women doing similar work are getting paid less than men.

Almost three-quarters translates as millions of disabled voters possibly being denied their vote.</p> <p>The report also says stigma is a huge problem, especially for people with learning and mental disabilities. According to research, in <a href=\"http://www.bazelon.org/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=1kgFTxMFHZE%3D&amp;tabid=315\">27 US states</a> large numbers of people in these groups are barred from or have <a href=\"http://disabilityjustice.org/right-to-vote\">restrictions placed on voting</a>.</p> <p>It might be tempting to think of voting access for people with disabilities as a predominantly US problem but as the last UK general election showed, it is far from alone. During that election activists including Operation Disabled Vote, which <a href=\"http://www.disabilitynewsservice.com/election-2015-bus-tour-highlights-disabled-peoples-voting-power\">campaigned</a> on voter registration, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/mar/25/disabled-people-shut-out-lack-access-polling-stations\">highlighted the obstacles</a> in place across Britain.

None of these problems, be they in Britain or the US, are universal or irreversible. During the 2016 presidential campaign it has been encouraging to see positive perspectives on disability. Hillary Clinton has repeatedly highlighted disabled people\u2019s employment rights and other areas where exclusion and underrepresentation are common.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/19/eu-referendum-push-to-improve-voting-turnout-for-psychiatric-inpatients\">EU referendum: push to improve voting turnout for psychiatric inpatients</a> </p> </aside>  <p>And in the run-up to next week\u2019s election, activists in the US have been mobilising and <a href=\"http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/09/22/a-political-profile-of-disabled-americans/\">political engagement is high. </a>The American Association of People With Disabilities launched a successful campaign in the summer promoting voting accessibility and registration among the millions of people with disabilities who are eligible to vote.

He\u2019s a war hero because he was captured. I like people who weren\u2019t captured.\u201d</p> <p>It later emerged that Trump had been granted four education draft deferments and one medical.

Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Facebook, who has Thiel on his board of directors, defended his politics as an important part of his company\u2019s diversity. In his 1995 book <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.independent.org/store/book.asp?id=38#t-0\">The Diversity Myth: Multiculturalism and Political Intolerance on Campus</a>, Thiel wrote: \u201cReal diversity requires a diversity of ideas, not simply a bunch of like-minded activists who resemble the bar scene from Star Wars.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1c6d969be9950947c4492150ffb929137027f7b9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1c6d969be9950947c4492150ffb929137027f7b9/0_38_5568_3341/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Peter Thiel speaks on the last day of the Republican national convention.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Peter Thiel speaks on the last day of the Republican national convention.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jim Watson/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In his speech, Thiel painted a dark picture of America, referencing the country\u2019s \u201coverpriced healthcare system\u201d, student debt crisis and stagnant wages for American workers. He criticized free trade policies that he said had resulted in \u201cthe heartland [being] devastated\u201d and lambasted the \u201cwasting of trillions of dollars of taxpayer dollars on faraway wars\u201d. </p> <p>He categorized the country\u2019s problems as a series of \u201cbubbles\u201d akin to the housing bubble or the dotcom bubble and criticized the \u201cheedlessness\u201d of the elite in ignoring them. Current \u201cbubbles\u201d threatening the country include the \u201ctrade bubble\u201d, \u201cwar bubble\u201d, \u201cimmigration bubble\u201d and \u201cglobalization bubble\u201d, he said.</p> <p>\u201cIt shouldn\u2019t be surprising to see people vote for Bernie Sanders or Donald Trump, who is the only outsider left,\u201d he said, later adding that he would have liked to see Trump and Sanders face off in the general election \u201cbecause I think both of them viscerally felt the decline\u201d. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/oct/18/donald-trump-peter-thiel-support-facebook\">The hypocrisy of Facebook's silence on Peter Thiel's support for Donald Trump</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Throughout the speech, and during a later question-and-answer session, Thiel glossed over some of Trump\u2019s most prominent and controversial statements. </p> <p>Asked about Trump\u2019s statements proposing the construction of a wall on the US-Mexico border and a ban on all Muslims entering the country, Thiel suggested that Trump supporters do not actually endorse those policies. </p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t support a religious test. I certainly don\u2019t support the specific language that Trump has used in every instance,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I think one thing that should be distinguished here is that the media is always taking Trump literally. It never takes him seriously, but it always takes him literally.\u201d </p> <p>The billionaire went on to define how he believes the average Trump supporter interprets the candidate\u2019s statements. \u201cI think a lot of voters who vote for Trump take Trump seriously but not literally, so when they hear things like the Muslim comment or the wall comment their question is not, \u2018Are you going to build a wall like the Great Wall of China?\u2019 or, you know, \u2018How exactly are you going to enforce these tests?\u2019 What they hear is we\u2019re going to have a saner, more sensible immigration policy.\u201d </p> <p>During his speech at the Republican national convention, which Thiel attended as a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jul/21/peter-thiel-republican-national-convention-proud-to-be-gay\">keynote speaker</a>, Trump was interrupted with chants of \u201cBuild a wall.\u201d </p> <p>Thiel also defended Trump\u2019s failure to release his tax returns, saying that we know enough about the candidate\u2019s business dealings. \u201cWe can debate how many zeros he has in his net worth, but he has a lot,\u201d Thiel said.</p> <p>The investor, who initiated a secret legal campaign against Gawker after the publication outed him as gay, asserted that \u201cwe have a less talented group of people\u201d running for office today because of the media taking transparency in a \u201ctoxic\u201d direction. </p> <p>He also defended his secret funding of the lawsuit, brought by the wrestler Hulk Hogan, that bankrupted the now defunct <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/aug/16/univision-buys-gawker-media-auction-bankruptcy-hulk-hogan\">media website Gawker</a>. Thiel accused a former Gawker editor of being \u201can aspiring child pornographer\u201d and called the entire publication a \u201csingularly sociopathic bully\u201d, and portrayed his backing of the lawsuit as an act of charity.</p> <p>\u201cIf you\u2019re a single-digit millionaire like Hulk Hogan, you have no effective access to our legal system,\u201d he said.</p>",

Mongrel and Mr Malcolm won the first two warm ups in an exciting speed-waddle to the outer hay bales. One, perhaps the same who sensed freedom earlier today, attempted a leap over the boundary to no avail.<br></p> <p>Fashion In The Bush, shoes optional, provided halftime entertainment.</p> <p>In the grand final, the wriggling mass of reptiles were held at bay by their Crocodylus Park handler as thunder rumbled overhead. The starting gun sounded, and they were off. Mostly. One needed a hurry up, which a barefooted, fascinator-wearing punter was happy to give, climbing over the bales to give him a nudge. </p> <p>But it was Tab who brought it home for his sponsor, Belinda Harris, from Melbourne. I asked how the race compared to her home town. \u201cAbsolutely loving it,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is awesome.

Horses for courses. See what I did there?</p> <p>Sam continues: \u201cIn the Cup, the Japanese raider will brain them if it runs anywhere near its peak (its previous run at 3200m, in May, would\u2019ve won any Melbourne Cup, EVER). It\u2019s older than Brent Harvey though, so it might also be better suited to eventing. I\u2019m headed to the pub.\u201d</p> <p>Thanks, Sam.

So it\u2019s only fair that I share my own. The preamble to it as having a chip at the PM for his Cup tip. This will all make sense.</p> <p>Mr Turnbull yesterday did what all politicians must and picked his winner. Or, as it happens, two - Bondi Beach for it is in his electorate and Hartnell because it won the Turnbull Stakes. The more cynical among us may say this is reflective of the PM\u2019s predisposition for having several positions on matters of policy. And that he has <a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/news/2008-09-23/turnbulls-roosters-gaffe-has-labor-crowing/519378\">form</a> as well with <a href=\"https://au.sports.yahoo.com/afl/a/32771390/malcolm-turnbull-makes-cringeworthy-afl-grand-final-blunder/\">sport</a>. </p> <p>Anyway, I don\u2019t want to be nasty. All in good fun, Malc. Hope you are having a nice day. </p> <p>So, to my story. </p> <p>In 2009 I was advising the then-PM Rudd on, among other things, sport. So the process was went through and I landed on Shocking. He went on the radio the day before The Cup and backed that in, which was good of him. </p> <p>The next day? Turnbull, opposition leader at the time, took a Newspoll lead over Rudd for the first time. Ever. Indeed, it was the first Newspoll Labor had trailed in since Rudd became leader in 2006, nearly three years earlier.</p> <p>Rudd wasn\u2019t happy with me. Shocking? His horse? On a Newspoll day? What was I thinking? It wasn\u2019t entirely unreasonable, but I did encourage waiting to see how the race went. </p> <p>As we know, Shocking bolted it in. The next phone call moments after the race was from Rudd to thank me for the tip. The political news that night did include the poll, but began with the PM picking the Cup winner for the second time in three years. </p> <p>When I left his office some months later the brief was returned to me as a framed gift that <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/9kUYHVNPKy/\">you can see here</a>. A pretty nice touch.

Caulfield Cup run was pretty sound but 1kg from the top weights for a G1 maiden that has never been past 2400m is a bit much.</p> <p><strong>10 - Gallante:</strong> second to Jameka first up looks OK but nothing of note behind him, forgive Mooney Valley flop, but he\u2019s not up to this.</p> <p><strong>12 - Jameka:</strong> Old school Cup prep, two very good WFA runs to open her up, flogged second-raters in Naturalism, cracking Turnbull run and then a dominant Caulfield Cup win. Not terribly badly weighted after the penalty, nice draw, lots of ticks. My tip.</p> <p><strong>18 - Assign:</strong> This time last year was getting around in a BM90. Form is OK for third-string stayers, but no.</p> <p><strong>19 - Grey Lion:</strong> Solid at Geelong but his best win is a 3YO SWP. If you like Oceanographer and Qewy, I guess you give him a chance.</p> <p><strong>20 - Oceanographer:</strong> I don\u2019t think he beat much on Saturday. It looked impressive but he won\u2019t get that much galloping room against 23 opponents and will see plenty of rump steak before he gets going. He\u2019s progressive but it\u2019d be a bit embarrassing if something like this could come here and win.</p> <p>Jameka for me. Respect the Japanese, as always, but he hasn\u2019t won for three years. Big Orange is class and well weighted for his record, could be the one to break the curse on the hit-and-run raiders. </p> <p>Bondi Beach has only missed a place once, but they don\u2019t often win if they\u2019ve raced in this before. Hartnell isn\u2019t a two-mile horse, lay all day. Don\u2019t care how good Wicklow Brave is, the Butcher is back for his umpteenth poor Cup ride. Almandin is short for mine but can win.

  "<p>In April 2002, Jean-Marie Le Pen <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/apr/22/thefarright.france\">stunned all of Europe</a> by defeating the socialist candidate, Lionel Jospin, in the first round of the French presidential election, and advancing to the final round between the top two candidates. Terrified by the prospect of a far-right victory, the French left \u2013 including communists, Greens and the Socialist party \u2013 threw their support behind the incumbent president, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/jacques-chirac\">Jacques Chirac</a>, a pillar of the centre-right establishment who had served as mayor of Paris for 18 years before becoming president in 1995. This electoral strategy effectively isolated Le Pen\u2019s Front National (FN), depicting it as a cancerous force in the French body politic.</p> <p>Two weeks later, on 5 May, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/may/06/france.thefarright2\">Chirac won the election</a> with an astronomical 82% of the vote, trouncing Le Pen by the biggest margin in a French presidential election since 1848. Raucous celebrations spilled into the streets of Paris. \u201cWe have gone through a time of serious anxiety for the country \u2013 but tonight France has reaffirmed its attachment to the values of the republic,\u201d <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/1969902.stm\">Chirac declared in his victory speech</a>. Then, speaking to the joyous crowds in the Place de la R\u00e9publique, he lauded them for rejecting \u201cintolerance and demagoguery\u201d.</p> <p>But May 2002 was not, in fact, a moment of triumph. Rather it was the dying gasp of an old order, in which the fate of European nations was controlled by large establishment parties.</p> <p>Jean-Marie Le Pen was an easy target for the left, and for establishment figures such as Chirac. He was a political provocateur who appealed as much to antisemites and homophobes as to voters upset about immigration, drawing his support largely from the most reactionary elements of the old Catholic right. In other words, he was a familiar villain \u2013 and his ideology represented an archaic France, a defeated past. Moreover, he did not seriously aim for power, and never really came close to acquiring it; his role was to be a rabble-rouser and to inject his ideas into the national debate.</p> <p>Europe\u2019s new far right is different. From Denmark to the Netherlands to Germany, a new wave of rightwing parties has emerged over the past decade-and-a-half, and they are casting a much wider net than Jean-Marie Le Pen ever attempted to. And by deftly appealing to fear, nostalgia and resentment of elites, they are rapidly broadening their base.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"3e5b905a162e3f32fa2a1be95646856b6e7cedfa\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3e5b905a162e3f32fa2a1be95646856b6e7cedfa/0_0_3824_2295/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Marine Le Pen addresses the Front National (FN) party\u2019s May day rally in Paris in 2012.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Deftly appealing to fear, nostalgia and resentment of elites \u2026 the Front National May day rally in Paris in 2012.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chamussy/SIPA/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Le Pen\u2019s own daughter is a prime example of the new ambitions of the right: unlike her incendiary father, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/marine-le-pen\">Marine Le Pen</a> is running a disciplined political operation and has already proven that her party can win <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/dec/06/front-national-wins-opening-round-in-frances-regional-elections\">upwards of 40% of the vote</a> in regions from Calais in the north to the C\u00f4te d\u2019Azur in the south. She and her Danish and Dutch counterparts are not \u2013 as some on the left would like to believe \u2013 neo-Nazis or inconsequential extremists with fringe ideas lacking popular appeal.</p> <p>These parties have built a coherent ideology and steadily chipped away at the establishment parties\u2019 hold on power by pursuing a new and devastatingly effective electoral strategy. They have made a very public break with the symbols of the old right\u2019s past, distancing themselves from skinheads, neo-Nazis and homophobes. They have also deftly co-opted the causes, policies and rhetoric of their opponents. They have sought to outflank the left when it comes to defending a strong welfare state and protecting social benefits that they claim are threatened by an influx of freeloading migrants.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2016/nov/25/the-ruthlessly-effective-rebranding-of-europes-new-far-right-podcast\">The ruthlessly effective rebranding of Europe\u2019s new far right \u2013 podcast</a> </p> </aside>  <p>They have effectively claimed the progressive causes of the left \u2013 from gay rights to women\u2019s equality and protecting Jews from antisemitism \u2013 as their own, by depicting Muslim immigrants as the primary threat to all three groups.

Europe\u2019s new far right is poised to transform the continent\u2019s political landscape \u2013 either by winning elections or simply by pulling a besieged political centre so far in its direction that its ideas become the new normal. And when that happens, groups that would never have contemplated voting for a far-right party 10 years ago \u2013 the young, gay people, Jews, feminists \u2013 may join the working-class voters who have already abandoned parties of the left to become the new backbone of the populist right.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>On 6 May 2002, one day after revellers filled the streets of Paris to celebrate Chirac\u2019s historic victory, the flamboyant and iconoclastic leader of the Dutch far right, Pim Fortuyn, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/may/06/3\">was gunned down</a> by a radical animal rights activist as he emerged from a radio interview. His assassin later claimed that he had killed Fortuyn to stop him from using Muslims as \u201cscapegoats\u201d. In national elections nine days later, Fortuyn\u2019s eponymous party \u2013 the Pim Fortuyn List \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/may/16/eu.thefarright\">became the second largest in the Netherlands</a> with 17% of the vote.</p> <p>Fortuyn, a former communist and openly gay man who boasted of sleeping with Muslim immigrants while calling for a ban on Muslim immigration, was an electrifying figure in a country known for its staid politics. His time in the limelight was short but transformative.</p> <p>It was Fortuyn who blazed the trail for the new generation of far-right leaders across Europe. He may not have intended to be a pioneer, but his brand of plain-spoken political incorrectness and his depiction of Islamic culture as a \u201cbackwards\u201d and reactionary threat to the hard-won progressive values of western Europe would provide a potent template for a modernised far right. His ideological inheritors in Dutch politics, as well as the revamped Front National in France, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/may/25/danish-peoples-party-triumphant-in-european-elections\">Danish People\u2019s Party</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/06/afd-leader-frauke-petry-criticised-comparing-migrants-compost-germany\">Germany\u2019s Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland</a> have all emulated Fortuyn in their own ways.</p> <p>Fortuyn proved that the winning argument for the European far right was not a US-style appeal to conservative religious values, but rather to claim it was \u201cdefending secular, progressive culture from the threat of immigration,\u201d argues Merijn Oudenampsen of Tilburg University. The Netherlands was a perfect laboratory for this new strategy because, unlike France, it did not have a strong contingent of religious traditionalists opposed to women\u2019s liberation and gay rights.</p> <p>Before founding his own party in 2002, Fortuyn had tried to join an establishment centre-right party, the People\u2019s Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD), in the late 1990s. The party\u2019s then-leader, Frits Bolkestein, who had been one of the first figures to speak critically about immigration in the early 1990s, remembers Fortuyn as a talented but inflammatory politician. \u201cHe had a thoroughly theatrical personality, and that played in his favour,\u201d said Bolkestein, now in his 80s, from his office overlooking the canals of Amsterdam. \u201cI didn\u2019t want him to be in my parliamentary group, so I cold-shouldered him \u2026 He would have acted as a fragmentation bomb.\u201d</p> <p>Fortuyn took his explosive rhetoric elsewhere and, by creating a new type of far-right politics in progressive garb \u2013 \u201ca form of xenophobia ideally suited to a nation that prides itself on its tolerance,\u201d as <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2002/09/09/beyond-tolerance\">a New Yorker profile</a> once described it \u2013 he redirected the entire national debate in a way that has endured long after his death.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"e498f179bba391b90d276a86cb881e8f9d32ac93\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e498f179bba391b90d276a86cb881e8f9d32ac93/128_291_1872_1123/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pim Fortuyn\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pim Fortuyn was an electrifying figure in the Netherlands, a country known for its staid politics.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Phil Nijhuis/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Two years after Fortuyn was killed, the Netherlands was traumatised by another political assassination. Early one morning in November 2004, the filmmaker <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/nov/07/terrorism.religion\">Theo van Gogh was murdered</a> by a young Dutch-Moroccan, Mohammed Bouyeri, who shot van Gogh eight times, slashed his throat and then pinned a letter to his chest with a knife. The letter was a death threat aimed at the Somali-born Dutch parliamentarian <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ayaan-hirsi-ali\">Ayaan Hirsi Ali</a> \u2013 a vocal critic of Islam who was soon placed under the protection of the Dutch security services.</p> <p>The two assassinations shook the Netherlands to its core and catapulted a little-known and theatrically coiffed politician, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/geert-wilders\">Geert Wilders</a>, to popularity as an ideological successor to Fortuyn. Wilders had also flirted with Bolkestein\u2019s VVD, beginning his political career as a staffer in the party office. In late 2004, he split off and formed his own. With Hirsi Ali in hiding, he quickly became the most prominent anti-immigration voice in the country \u2013 and has remained so ever since.</p> <p>For those who cared to look, the political ground had already begun to shift. Six months before Chirac\u2019s trouncing of Le Pen and Fortuyn\u2019s assassination, Denmark had an election. On its surface the result was not a historical watershed; the centre-right Venstre party ousted the Social Democrats, handing power from one establishment party to the other. What had changed was that the Danish People\u2019s Party, which had campaigned on an overtly anti-immigrant platform, took 12% of the vote \u2013 transforming it into a kingmaker in parliament.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jun/19/danish-peoples-party-dahl-border-controls-election\">Danish People\u2019s party leader demands border crackdown after election success</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Unlike France, which revelled in its triumph over the FN, or the Netherlands, where the remains of Fortuyn\u2019s party failed to become a real parliamentary force, the DPP immediately became a serious player with real influence over policy. And it was not only taking votes from the right; it was also attracting disgruntled social democratic voters who felt that their leaders had abandoned them.</p> <p>The DPP had crafted a social and economic policy that was in many ways more socialist than that of the Social Democrats \u2013 promising better health care, better care for the elderly, and more subsidised housing. As the outgoing Social Democratic prime minister Poul Nyrup Rasmussen told me in 2002, a few months after his defeat: \u201cThey took a part of our rhetoric and tried to sell it as a new package to the people, and with some success, one may say.\u201d Back then, Naser Khader, a Danish member of parliament who immigrated from Syria as a child, argued that \u201cthe best way to weaken the DPP is to give them influence\u201d. He was wrong.</p> <h2>* * * </h2> <p>The headquarters of the Front National sits on a quiet street in the unassuming Paris suburb of Nanterre, near a car repair shop and a Portuguese restaurant. Only when you approach the grey building with its mostly closed blue shutters do the armed guards come into view. In her modest second-floor office, surrounded by books and a cloud of vape smoke, Marine Le Pen explained earlier this year how she transformed a party previously known for calling the Holocaust a \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/06/jean-marie-le-pen-fined-again-dismissing-holocaust-detail\">detail of history</a>\u201d into a genuine contender for the presidency.</p> <p>\u201cVoluntarily or not, he gave ammunition to our adversaries,\u201d Le Pen said of her father. But she insisted that she has now cleaned house. \u201cI fired them all \u2026 all those people who expressed an ideology or held views that I found unacceptable.\u201d</p> <p>Julien Rochedy, a 28-year-old who headed the FN\u2019s youth wing but has since left the party, told me that he believes the changes are real. Whereas the party\u2019s former leader used to pepper his speeches with lines that made Jews\u2019 hair stand on end, today, if someone tells a racist joke within the party, \u201cyou will be attacked straight away,\u201d Rochedy said. \u201cThere is such self-discipline these days. They are so afraid they\u2019ll be accused once again of being antisemitic or racist.\u201d</p> <p>Still, the party\u2019s detractors continue to level the same charges at the FN, which outrages Marine Le Pen. \u201cToday our adversaries no longer have that ammunition, and they repeat on loop\u201d old tropes about fascists and racists. \u201cAt a certain point this argument loses its force,\u201d she continued, \u201cbecause voters see clearly that there\u2019s absolutely nothing in our platform that remotely resembles fascism or racism.\u201d</p> <p>Le Pen has done more than kick out the most blatant racists and antisemites. She has consciously crafted a campaign designed to appeal to voters of the centre and left \u2013 and other constituencies \u2013 who could never have imagined voting for her father\u2019s Front National.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"89bcb82ae9eac10389507825747a4270de85ccdb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/89bcb82ae9eac10389507825747a4270de85ccdb/0_242_4928_2957/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Graffiti on a FN campaign office reading \u2018Racism, xenophobia, Marine and co, clear off!\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Anti-racist graffiti on a FN campaign office \u2026 but Le Pen claims that \u2018this argument loses its force because voters see clearly that there\u2019s nothing in our platform that resembles fascism or racism\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pascal Pavani/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As Le Monde\u2019s Olivier Faye <a href=\"http://www.lemonde.fr/politique/article/2016/04/12/l-attraction-en-hausse-du-front-national-aupres-de-la-communaute-gay_4900269_823448.html\">has written</a>, she is \u201ctrying to erase another image that has stuck to the skin of the FN \u2013 that of homophobia\u201d. And it is working:<strong> </strong>a survey showed that her share of the vote among married gay couples in the 2015 regional elections was over 32% \u2013 up from just 19% in a similar poll from 2012.</p> <p>As Le Pen has filled her inner circle with more and more openly gay advisers and party leaders, she has also made her pitch to Jewish voters more explicit: \u201cFor a lot of French Jews, the FN appears to be the only movement that can defend them from this new antisemitism nourished in the<em> banlieues</em>,\u201d Le Pen told me. \u201cIn a very natural way they have turned toward the FN, because the FN is capable, I think, of protecting them from that.\u201d</p> <p>Among French voters threatened by the country\u2019s new diversity, rejection of a multicultural society increasingly takes the form of longing for a bygone era. And peddling nostalgia is the centrepiece of many new far-right parties across Europe. In France, Marine Le Pen has promised a return to a time when the French had their own currency and monetary policy, when there were fewer mosques and less halal meat, when no one complained about nativity scenes in public buildings, and when French schools promoted a republican ethos of assimilation.</p> <p>\u201cA growing number of French people feel uncomfortable in their own country,\u201d the prominent philosopher, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/09/right-wing-new-reactionaries-stir-up-trouble-among-french-intellectuals\">Alain Finkielkraut</a>, declared in January during <a href=\"http://www.lepoint.fr/chroniques/juppe-finkielkraut-le-grand-debat-du-point-13-01-2016-2009511_2.php\">a debate</a> with the centre-right presidential candidate Alain Jupp\u00e9 \u2013 who has taken a less strident line on Islam and migration than his rival Nicolas Sarkozy. Finkielkraut depicted contemporary France as a country of halal butchers and tea shops filled only with men, pleading that \u201cthe public good isn\u2019t in the clouds, it\u2019s made from tangible things \u2013 the French of Proust and Montaigne \u2026 the Jardin du Luxembourg and the cows of Normandy\u201d.</p> <p>Finkielkraut, a 67-year-old Jewish liberal, is not an admirer of the Front National, but Marine Le Pen\u2019s deliberate appeals to Jews and gay people have given political expression to an argument that he first made more than a decade ago \u2013 that the left, with its indulgence of Islam, poses a greater threat to France than the far right. After Chirac \u201csaved\u201d the republic from Jean-Marie Le Pen in 2002, Finkielkraut watched the celebrations in the streets and warned that the victors were the real danger: \u201cThe future of hate is in their camp and not in the camp of those nostalgic for Vichy,\u201d he wrote, \u201c \u2026 in the camp of the multicultural society and not that of the ethnic nation \u2013 in the camp of respect, not that of rejection.\u201d</p> <p>Fourteen years later, after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/15/why-does-france-keep-getting-attacked\">the terrorist attacks</a> on Charlie Hebdo, the Bataclan and Nice, Finkielkraut is even more certain he was correct. \u201cAnti-racism today frequently serves as a pretext for not seeing the true danger that threatens us,\u201d he told me when we met in his Paris apartment this summer. While he is still no fan of the FN, he believes it has changed and argues that it \u201cshould be resisted, but for what it is today and not what it was in the past, and not in the name of anti-fascism\u201d. The French must, he insisted, \u201cavoid simplistic analogies with the 1930s. We must not mistake what era we live in. Europe doesn\u2019t only have demons; it also has enemies, and it needs to know how to fight those enemies.\u201d</p> <p>He worries that integration has been such a failure that France will have to \u201creconquer\u201d its \u201clost territories\u201d \u2013 by which he means the suburbs surrounding Paris. \u201cIntegrating people is not telling them \u2018You are how you are and we are how we are\u2019 \u2026 Integration means making them an integral part of our civilisation.\u201d And if that doesn\u2019t happen, he warned darkly, \u201cat best we\u2019ll have secession and at worst civil war\u201d. Continued immigration from Muslim countries, he argues, is nothing less than the \u201cplanned demise of Europe\u201d.</p> <p>Across the country, nostalgia for an older, whiter France has become a potent political force. In the southern city of B\u00e9ziers, Mayor Robert M\u00e9nard, a former Trotskyist who cofounded the press freedom group <a href=\"https://rsf.org/en\">Reporters Without Borders</a>, is seeking to place a moratorium on the opening of kebab shops and has renamed a street after one of the French officers who joined a failed coup against De Gaulle in 1961 to prevent <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/02/algeria-insurrection-bombings-independence-france\">Algerian independence</a>. M\u00e9nard comes from a family of <em>pieds-noirs</em>, French settlers in Algeria.

Whereas young Britons overwhelmingly voted to remain in the EU and the elderly voted to leave, in France it is the opposite. According to Julian Rochedy, the former FN youth leader, appeals to nostalgia work better with the young in France \u2013 who dream of an era they never witnessed \u2013 than with the old, who lived through the era Marine Le Pen promises to restore. It is older voters, Rochedy argues, who are the greatest obstacle to Le Pen\u2019s victory. \u201cThey are afraid of leaving the euro,\u201d he says. \u201cThey are afraid of huge changes.\u201d Rochedy is convinced that the FN will never win simply by fetishising the past. \u201cThey just want to go back 30 years,\u201d he said of his erstwhile colleagues. \u201cIt\u2019s a discourse that doesn\u2019t at all take into account the world as it is and what France has become.\u201d</p> <p>Even if Le Pen cannot win over enough older voters for her to become president, there is one ageing constituency that has already moved significantly to the right \u2013 the former members of what used to be the largest communist party in western Europe.</p> <p>As the French Communist party collapsed, its supporters were left rudderless. According to Andrew Hussey, a Liverpool-born academic who teaches in Paris, the technocratic leaders of the Socialist party \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/may/14/france-power-elitism-peter-gumbel\">many of them</a> graduates of the ultra-elite Ecole Nationale d\u2019Administration \u2013 \u201care so disconnected from ordinary people\u201d that even former Marxists won\u2019t consider voting for them. Distrustful of the establishment and searching for a state that protects them, many have turned to the FN. \u201cI think you\u2019ve got a big political question here about who looks after you,\u201d Hussey said. \u201cThis is a very communist way of thinking.\u201d</p> <p>Le Pen knows that she is attracting these people. Many of her supporters \u201cused to be socialists, but they aren\u2019t any more\u201d, she told me. Although she prefers to avoid the phrase welfare state \u2013 \u201cThat\u2019s a socialist concept,\u201d she insisted \u2013 Le Pen has appealed directly to this yearning for a large and nurturing state that fights for the common man and not the rich.</p> <p>\u201cI defend fraternity \u2013 the idea that a developed country should be able to provide the poorest with the minimum needed to live with dignity as a human being. The French state no longer does that,\u201d she told me. \u201cWe\u2019re in a world today in which you either defend the interests of the people or the interests of the banks.\u201d And she has seen results. She points to the northern Pas-de-Calais region. \u201cIt was socialist-communist for 80 years,\u201d she says. \u201cI won 45%.\u201d</p> <h2>* * * </h2> <p>At the same time as Marine Le Pen<strong> was</strong> working to \u201cde-demonise\u201d the FN, the leaders of the Dutch far right successfully seized the mantle of radicalism by positioning itself as the only force that dares to challenge an out-of-touch political establishment, and the only party willing to speak out about what many voters fear: extremist Islam.</p> <p>Geert Wilders and his Party for Freedom (PVV) have surpassed the Dutch Labour party to take up a close second place in polls ahead of the March 2017 election. Last September, Wilders declared that Europe was facing an \u201c<a href=\"http://uk.reuters.com/article/us-europe-migrants-netherlands-idUSKCN0RA0WY20150910\">Islamic invasion</a>\u201d \u2013 the sort of comments that landed him in court this week <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/31/geert-wilders-trial-throws-netherlands-divisions-in-sharp-relief\">on charges of inciting racial hatred</a>, which he dismisses as an attack on freedom of expression.</p> <p>The presence of \u201cmasses of young men in their 20s with beards singing \u2018Allahu Akbar\u2019 across Europe\u201d, Wilders warned at the peak of last year\u2019s refugee crisis, posed a dire threat to \u201cour prosperity, our security, our culture and identity\u201d. Across the country, grassroots groups responded to Wilders\u2019s warning, attempting to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/dec/17/thousands-riot-in-small-dutch-town-over-plan-for-asylum-seeker-centre\">block the resettlement of asylum seekers</a> in their towns. Last October, Klaas Dijkhoff, the deputy minister responsible for refugee resettlement, arrived for a visit to the tiny north-eastern village of Oranje, where the Dutch government had decided to place 700 refugees. Outraged locals blocked the road leading to town, kicked Dijkhoff\u2019s car and tore off its rearview mirrors. A few days later, near Utrecht, an asylum centre was attacked by masked men with smoke bombs and fireworks.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"cb02d25bd71d105799a7fe9384e3d0015ea45140\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cb02d25bd71d105799a7fe9384e3d0015ea45140/0_0_4308_2585/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A 2010 rally in support of Geert Wilders during his trial for inciting racial hatred, with posters reading \u2018Freedom Yes, Islamisation No\u2019 and \u2018Geert is Great\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A 2010 rally in support of Geert Wilders during his trial for inciting racial hatred, with posters reading \u2018Freedom Yes, Islamisation No\u2019 and \u2018Geert is Great\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Peter Dejong/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the decade following the assassinations of Fortuyn and Van Gogh, the integration of Muslim immigrants became the most divisive issue in Dutch politics. Suddenly, Turkish and Moroccan-born Dutch citizens became \u201cMuslims\u201d. And as the public debate over Islam and migration grew even more hostile, even the most basic forms of visible religious observance \u2013 wearing the hijab, buying halal meat, fasting during Ramadan \u2013 became politically loaded.</p> <p>The Dutch Labour MP Ahmed Marcouch, who came to the Netherlands from rural Morocco when he was 10, recounted how controversies have erupted everywhere from supermarkets to classrooms. It is a jolt to the traditionally liberal Netherlands when teenage girls tell their male teachers they can\u2019t shake hands, or that they fast and pray while many other Dutch kids are out drinking and having sex. As Marcouch remarked, it runs against everything that Dutch youth culture promotes.</p> <p>Wilders\u2019s PVV has capitalised on this cultural angst by using simple and deliberately brash slogans about immigration, crime, and refugees \u2013 one of his latest memes is simply \u201cDe-Islamise\u201d \u2013 to win over voters who feel that everything familiar to them is slipping away.</p> <p>By framing its anti-migrant politics as a battle against imperious elites and political correctness, the PVV has been able to capitalise on a panoply of grievances, from anger over asylum seekers to Euroscepticism. Meanwhile, many causes of the radical left \u2013 including anti-racism and anti-colonialism \u2013 have now become establishment thinking in the Netherlands. \u201cIdealism has been bureaucratised,\u201d argues the journalist Bas Heijne, who writes a column in the liberal daily newspaper NRC Handelsblad. \u201cAnd when the establishment enforces universalism, you react against it.\u201d That\u2019s why there is such a strong anti-PC tone to the Dutch right: do not tell us what to say, what to celebrate and who we must live next to.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/31/geert-wilders-trial-throws-netherlands-divisions-in-sharp-relief\">Geert Wilders trial throws Netherlands' divisions in sharp relief</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Just as Marine Le Pen\u2019s FN has become a huge presence on social media in France, the right is in the midst of colonising the Dutch media. Geen Stijl (\u201cNo Style\u201d), a popular Breitbart-style news site featuring abrasive articles and videos, encourages its best and angriest commenters to visit mainstream news sites and go on the attack. \u201cIt is massively important,\u201d says<strong> </strong>Tilburg University\u2019s Merijn Oudenampsen, \u201clike a social movement\u201d. The site began as a blog dedicated to those who felt politically homeless after Fortuyn\u2019s murder, and has since become a ubiquitous presence in Dutch public debate, with an army of \u201creactors\u201d on Twitter. According to Oudenampsen, some politicians have told him that Geen Stijl is the first site they check in the morning.</p> <p>The right\u2019s newfound media clout has also helped shape what the journalist Kustaw Bessems, from the leftwing Volkskrant newspaper, sees as a new, inverted, form of political correctness. In the old days, he says, there were taboos enforced by the left: badmouth immigrants and \u201cyou were immediately called a racist and extreme right and basically pressured to shut up\u201d. Now, it\u2019s the other way around. \u201cAs soon as you say anything other than \u2018immigration is a problem\u2019 or \u2018Islam is the cause of terrorism\u2019 \u2026 the thought police immediately jump on your neck to correct you.\u201d</p> <p>A Dutch government official who focuses on security issues complained that even as the integration of Muslim immigrants and the threat of radical Islam had become the most heated and polarising issues in the Netherlands, almost none of the feverish public debate was informed by knowledge of Islamism or terrorism. While politicians fan the flames of fear, the official said, \u201cthe economists look for the economic roots of the problem, sociologists look for social causes and the anthropologists try to explain jihadi culture \u2013 but none of them have any idea about theology\u201d. Even scholars of radicalisation tend to study today\u2019s extremists through the historical lens of the European radical left \u2013 which does little to explain what leads a small number of young Muslim men such as Van Gogh\u2019s killer, Mohamed Bouyeri, to devote themselves to the cause of jihad. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to be a Marxist,\u201d the security official quipped. \u201cIt\u2019s fucking hard to be a salafi.\u201d</p> <p>As the perception that the state is helpless to prevent the radicalisation of Muslim teenagers deepens and the fear of terrorism increases, so does the share of voters who are newly receptive to the far right\u2019s tirades about \u201cIslamisation\u201d. These days it is not only anti-migration activists pushing back against the bureaucratised consensus. There are also many disappointed progressives \u2013 the people who saw the cultural victories of the 1960s and 1970s as major battles that had long since been won, making sexual freedom, feminism and gay rights an unquestioned part of Dutch society. Suddenly those old victories seem tenuous. \u201cThere is a sense that, \u2018We are welcoming and then they do this,\u2019 says Bas Heijne. \u201cThey have been terribly let down in their good intentions.\u201d And in such an environment, traditionally leftist constituencies such as gay people and Jews feel threatened \u2013 and some have become reflexively suspicious of Muslims.</p> <p>The stereotype that observant Muslims hate gay men and lesbians has become so entrenched in the Netherlands that neither side can fathom evidence to the contrary. When the Moroccan-born Labour MP Ahmed Marcouch <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2009/12/07/parades-end-2\">first joined in Amsterdam\u2019s legendary gay pride parade</a>, he was, as he puts it, the \u201cfirst hetero-active Muslim\u201d to participate. The gay community feared violence from extremists; conservative Muslims were baffled and angry. Both groups concluded, \u201cOh, maybe Marcouch is homosexual too,\u201d he says with a laugh. Neither group could imagine a straight Muslim doing what he did.</p> <p>But public displays of solidarity such as Marcouch\u2019s are rare. Among openly gay couples and religious Jews alike, there is a palpable fear of being targeted by homophobic or antisemitic young Muslim men. Much as in France, this fraught atmosphere has made far-right parties seem a palatable option for groups who would never previously have considered voting for them.</p> <p>In Amsterdam earlier this year, I had several meetings with a staunch Jewish supporter of Wilders\u2019s PVV, who insisted on remaining anonymous. He described his own backing for the far right in terms that echoed Alain Finkielkraut. \u201cIt\u2019s an outdated reflex for Jews to always say the problem is the extreme right,\u201d he told me. \u201cWe have new enemies and we need new ideas.\u201d</p> <p>The experience of his own family during the second world war has convinced him that Europe\u2019s capacity for murderous violence is always lurking beneath the surface. \u201cAnne Frank wasn\u2019t betrayed by the Germans,\u201d he argued. \u201cBut by Dutch people. Regular Dutch.\u201d Jews need to find new allies in a new war, he argues, because they will never be safe. \u201cThe trains for the Jews will always come,\u201d he added, ominously. \u201cI\u2019d rather be wrong than be too calm and end up on the trains.\u201d</p> <p>He is not unsympathetic to the plight of European Muslims, and told me that he even sees parallels with the persecution his own family faced. \u201cIf I were a Muslim in Europe at this moment I\u2019d be very uneasy,\u201d he admitted. \u201cIf Europeans regain their manhood, it could be bad. It\u2019s the history of Europe to treat foreigners terribly. We Jews know that.\u201d</p> <p>For that reason, he argues, Muslims should regard Wilders as a lesser evil. \u201cEvery Muslim should be happy Geert Wilders exists. If someone else channelled these hateful feelings it would be much worse,\u201d he told me menacingly. \u201cWilders is civil. He is a democrat. He is not the new Hitler.\u201d</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>To Frits Bolkestein, who led the Netherlands\u2019 centre-right VVD in the 1990s \u2013 and was briefly Wilders\u2019 boss when he was a young aide in the party office \u2013 the rise of the far right is as much about class as it is about Islam. The Dutch Labour party, he argues, gave up on its working-class base: \u201cThey made a major mistake,\u201d he says of his old rivals, with a tinge of satisfaction. Faced with \u201cthe choice between the foreign-born and the labour classes, they chose the foreign-born \u2026 and they\u2019ve paid for it dearly\u201d. Current polls project that the party will drop from the 36 seats it now holds (out of 150) to just 10.</p> <p>Marcouch concedes that, like the old leftists in France, many former Labour voters now back Wilders. Moreover, he says, they still live in the very neighbourhoods that families such as his own moved into in the 1980s, as many white Dutch families were moving out. \u201cTheir message to the Labour party,\u201d he said, \u201cis: \u2018You ignored us. You let it happen.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>The Danish People\u2019s Party has been seeking out such voters for years, and they have masterfully leveraged anti-immigrant sentiment to siphon away the Social Democrats\u2019 traditional base \u2013 people who fear that the \u201cbread will be buttered more thinly\u201d, as the Danish journalist Lars Trier Mogensen puts it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"485d0c998c114015e268653a91c652c962a01076\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/485d0c998c114015e268653a91c652c962a01076/0_0_6016_3611/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kristian Thulesen Dahl, leader of the Danish People\u2019s Party\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kristian Thulesen Dahl, leader of the Danish People\u2019s Party.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Linda Kastrup/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The DPP has effectively combined anti-immigrant rhetoric with a strong pro-welfare message that stresses quality health benefits and good care for the elderly. S\u00f8ren Espersen, the DPP\u2019s deputy leader, doesn\u2019t think that former Social Democrats will ever go back. \u201cWhen one of those takes the step to vote for us, it is a very, very huge step he is taking,\u201d he says of voters who supported the Social Democrats all their lives. \u201cAnd why should he go back? I mean, to come over this first hurdle of voting for us, then he\u2019s done it.\u201d</p> <p>The Social Democrats first began to lose their dominance in and around the major cities in the 1990s, with many of their votes going to the DPP. One of those places is the small satellite town of Herlev, about 10 miles west of Copenhagen. The 41-year-old Social Democratic mayor, Thomas Gyldal Petersen, has lived there all his life, and he is adamant that controlling immigration numbers is the only way to reverse his party\u2019s political misfortunes.</p> <p>For Gyldal Petersen, the key to successful integration is a demographic balance. As soon as a school or housing estate becomes majority immigrant \u2013 or majority unemployed \u2013 he says, problems start to arise. He blames his own party\u2019s leaders: \u201cMayors in the 80s, they were warning, something is going wrong, you have to change.\u201d But the party leadership \u201cshut their eyes\u201d, he says.</p> <p>Then came <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/muhammad-cartoons\">the Muhammad cartoons</a>. In 2005, the editors at Jyllands-Posten, Denmark\u2019s largest newspaper, invited a group of well-known cartoonists to draw the prophet. The initial response was underwhelming, but within a few months \u2013 through a combination of diplomatic pressure, a dismissive response from the Danish government, and a concerted campaign by local imams \u2013 the cartoons became a full-blown crisis, with boycotts of Danish products and violent protests occurring throughout the Middle East. Danes who had never contemplated voting for the DPP now saw their embassies on fire and death threats against some of their best-known journalists. Suddenly, the DPP\u2019s platform was making sense. They had warned that Muslims were extremists in waiting, and now those warnings seemed to come true. Politicians such as Naser Khader, who once warned that giving the DPP influence would weaken them, found themselves moving steadily to the right of the political spectrum. When Khader founded a new organisation called \u201cDemocratic Muslims\u201d in the wake of the cartoon controversy, he received death threats.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/feb/26/danish-cartoons-muhammad-politiken-apology\">Danish newspaper apologises in Muhammad cartoons row</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Those at the top of the Social Democrats are now taking a tough stance, too. Earlier this year the party leader, Mette Frederiksen, went to Stockholm to meet with fellow Scandinavian social democrats. There she gave a speech that rattled her colleagues. \u201cWe social democrats must accept that there is a clash,\u201d she declared. \u201cIt is a very strong part of our identity that we help when people need help \u2026 but just as strong is our value that we must have a well-functioning welfare state.\u201d Frederiksen continued: \u201cMy position is that a universally funded Scandinavian welfare state with free and equal access to healthcare, education and social subsidies is not compatible with an open immigration policy.\u201d</p> <p>But in its zeal to get tough on migration, Denmark has damaged its international reputation as a bastion of progressivism \u2013 the sort of place that <a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/2016/02/17/politics/bernie-sanders-2016-denmark-democratic-socialism/\">Bernie Sanders liked to mention</a> at campaign rallies. In January, just three months after the refugee crisis peaked, Denmark passed what became known as the \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/26/danish-parliament-approves-plan-to-seize-assets-from-refugees\">jewellery law</a>\u201d, which stipulated that any refugees carrying valuables worth more than 10,000 kroner (\u00a31,200) would have them confiscated to fund the cost of accommodating asylum-seekers. Editorial pages and columnists across the world lined up to condemn the law. According to Kenneth Kristensen Berth, a babyfaced MP for the DPP, it was about deterrence. \u201cThe goal was, of course, that we should try to tell people that they should not seek asylum in Denmark,\u201d he said. The jewellery provision was a minor part. \u201cMore important is the fact that many people will be waiting longer for family reunification, like waiting three years,\u201d he added. And it wasn\u2019t just the DPP and government who supported it \u2013 the Social Democrats voted for it, too.</p> <p>Bent Melchior, Denmark\u2019s 87-year-old former chief rabbi, was outraged. He bristled at the suggestion that refugees are rich because they flee with some money in their pockets. He would know: although Denmark is always hailed for saving its Jews during the second world war, it is often forgotten that Danish Jews paid fishermen huge sums to ferry them across to Sweden. Melchior\u2019s family paid the equivalent of \u201calmost a year\u2019s rent of a six-room flat\u201d just for his own passage. \u201cDenmark is not a poor country, for God\u2019s sake,\u201d Melchior says. \u201cThere\u2019s food for everybody here, and even if we get a few tens of thousands more people, there will still be food for everybody.\u201d</p> <p>The road that led a centre-left party to support such a law has been long and tortuous, but the trajectory has been clear. The Scandinavian welfare system has always been premised on solidarity, with everyone paying their fair share and receiving what they deserve. As the country has become more diverse, some of the trust sustaining it has broken down. There has been abuse of the system by immigrants, and there has been even more tabloid fearmongering depicting immigrants as cheats and leeches sucking the system dry. But the larger issue, as the Oxford economist Paul Collier has argued, is the growing unwillingness of natives to subsidise those seen as the foreign poor.</p> <p>Herlev\u2019s mayor does not oppose asylum, but he insists that the numbers have to be capped. \u201cWe have to help refugees, and we have to take refugees to Denmark in a number that we can help. If the balance tips, the welfare society cannot hold together,\u201d Petersen warns.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"7662fe0c7e25d4f00611391611d0c4f03cfc2d92\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7662fe0c7e25d4f00611391611d0c4f03cfc2d92/0_0_2000_1200/1000.jpg\" alt=\"protest against denmark cartoons in iraq\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">When cartoons of the prophet Muhammad in a Danish newspaper led to protests across the world in 2006, the DPP\u2019s anti-Islamic rhetoric gained more traction.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Wathiq Khuzaie/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But such balance may only help so much. Aydin Soei, a Danish sociologist and the son of immigrants from Iran, believes there is a larger blind spot in the thinking of the Danish government \u2013 one that native Danes who have never been on the receiving end of the state\u2019s integration policy have failed to see. \u201cA lot of refugees were just parked on social welfare instead of [the state] recognising their education and their skills,\u201d Soei told me, citing the case of his own mother, who arrived in Denmark with a physics degree that was regarded as worthless. \u201cIf your motivation is to create a liberal society where the individual can create a good life for him or herself, then you would have solved this problem years ago,\u201d he argues.</p> <p>Instead the state has effectively provided newcomers with an allowance and keys to an apartment, and ignored them \u2013 assuming that its work was done. The problem, Soei claims, is that there is no political incentive to integrate asylum seekers into the job market. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t have consequences for the politicians \u2026 because they don\u2019t have the right to vote.\u201d Either way, it plays into the DPP\u2019s argument. \u201cImmigrants can\u2019t do right,\u201d said Gyldal Petersen. \u201cWhen they\u2019re unemployed they\u2019re a burden to society. When they\u2019re in a job, they just stole the job from a Dane.\u201d</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Whether or not Marine Le Pen wins next year\u2019s French election or Wilders\u2019 PVV becomes the largest party in the Netherlands, the new far right is not going away. The reflex among many establishment parties \u2013 and media institutions \u2013 has been to dismiss them, sideline them or mock them. Others, however, have begun to mimic them in an effort to win their old voters back.</p> <p>Rhetoric might, in the long run, matter more than election results. When I spoke again recently with the Jewish Wilders supporter from Amsterdam, he was convinced that the battle has in some ways already been won \u2013 regardless of the outcome of next year\u2019s elections. \u201cThe PVV has shifted the whole political discussion to the right. The Labour party is saying almost exactly the same thing Wilders said five years ago,\u201d he told me. \u201cYou can have a lot of influence in politics by steering the debate.\u201d</p> <p>If traditional political parties want to win, they must first abandon the old strategy of marginalising populist movements and instead engage them on the merits \u2013 and flaws \u2013 of their policies and counter their messages of fear.</p> <p>Not least among the lessons of Brexit was that, for millions of disaffected voters, immigration is just <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jun/25/brexit-vote-poor-elite\">one more thing nobody asked them about</a>. This is what makes the issue an especially potent weapon: it combines the resentful energies of nativism, economic instability, and hatred of a remote and unaccountable political elite. And the leaders of the new far right have learned to wield it effectively. They know better than to let themselves be dismissed, as Jean-Marie Le Pen was, as antisemites or racists.<strong> </strong></p> <p>In France, the new majority Marine Le Pen hopes to build is strikingly similar to the coalition that brought the Brexit campaign victory.<strong> </strong>In a park near Calais\u2019 castle-like town hall in May, Samuel and Pascal, activists from a group named Retake Calais, railed against the town\u2019s centre-right mayor. They blamed her for the growth of the sprawling, trash-strewn tent city known as the Jungle, which sat three miles east of the town until <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/31/1000-children-left-in-calais-refugee-camp-say-charities\">it was dismantled this month</a>. \u201cThose who govern us are completely against us. The illegals, who aren\u2019t French, can do whatever they want,\u201d they told me. For them, even Marine Le Pen is \u201ctoo soft\u201d.</p> <p>If resettlement programmes take refugees away from Calais to other parts of France, as dozens of buses have in the past week since the destruction of the camp, they would not be any happier. \u201cThey\u2019re sending them to all the little villages in France,\u201d says Samuel. After they start to open businesses and bring family members, \u201cin two years the village will be dead\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/13/birth-of-populism-donald-trump\">Us v Them: the birth of populism | John B Judis | The Long Read</a> </p> </aside>  <p>About a mile down the road, the Calais ferry terminal lies behind layers of tall steel fences and coiled barbed wire.

The IRS views cancelled debt in the same light as taxable income - which would normally mean that after the floundering of Trump\u2019s Atlantic City casino business and the subsequent cancellation of hundreds of millions of dollars in debt, Trump would have to pay taxes on that cancelled debt as income:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The strategy - known among tax practitioners as a \u2018stock-for-debt swap\u2019 - relies on mathematical sleight of hand. Say a company can repay only $60 million of a $100 million bank loan. If the bank forgives the remaining $40 million, the company faces a large tax bill because it will have to report that canceled $40 million debt as taxable income.</p> <p>Clever tax lawyers found a way around this inconvenience. The company would simply swap stock for the $40 million in debt it could not repay. This way, it would look as if the entire $100 million loan had been repaid, and presto: There would be no tax bill due for $40 million in canceled debt.</p> </blockquote> <p>The Trump campaign dismissed the Times\u2019 allegations, which are based on documents uncovered during a search of casino bankruptcy filings from the 1990s.</p> <p>\u201cYour e-mail suggests either a fundamental misunderstanding or an intentional misreading of the law,\u201d Trump campaign press secretary Hope Hicks told the New York Times. \u201cYour thesis is a criticism, not just of Mr. Trump, but of all taxpayers who take the time and spend the money to try to comply with the dizzyingly complex and ambiguous tax laws without paying more tax than they owe.

But a number of polling and election law experts cast doubts on the methodology and suggested the process could be a smokescreen for voter intimidation.</p> <p>The Republican nominee has for months warned supporters of a \u201crigged election\u201d and encouraged them to monitor polling areas in cities such as St Louis, Chicago and Philadelphia. The lawsuits, filed by state democratic parties in Ohio, Pennsylvania, Arizona and Nevada would cover many of the cities Stone said he intended to target.</p> <p>The filings argue that such efforts, along with Trump\u2019s rhetoric, could violate both the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which outlawed discriminatory voting practices in the American south and the Ku Klux Klan Act of 1871, which outlawed intimidation against African American voters.</p> <p>Election law experts said it was unclear whether courts would issue a broad order, as requested in the filings, to simply prevent voter intimidation, but could look in more detail at the temporary restraining order requested against Stone\u2019s exit polling.</p> <p>\u201cIt could be useful in getting the word out about these activities and secondly getting the [Republican state] parties and [Trump] campaign on record saying they will not engage in these activities,\u201d said Rick Hasen, an election law expert at the University of California and whose <a href=\"http://electionlawblog.org/?p=88351\">Election Law blog first reported the lawsuits on Monday</a>.</p> <p>The Republican National Committee has been under a consent decree since the 1981 gubernatorial election in New Jersey when the group sent armed off-duty law enforcement officers to patrol polls in minority neighborhoods. These volunteers wore arm bands that identified them as an unofficial \u201cBallot Security Task Force\u201d and erected posters warning against voting fraud. The RNC dismissed the lawsuit as \u201ccompletely meritless\u201d last week.</p> <p>Stone\u2019s exit pollers, self-titled \u201cvote protectors\u201d, had originally planned to use similar non-official identification badges, until these were removed from the organisation\u2019s website late last week. The organisation is still encouraging its volunteers to live stream video from polling stations.</p> <p>The Guardian contacted Stone and the Trump campaign for a response to the recent lawsuits and is awaiting a response.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58179028e4b08d944ba4cb70\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/dan-roberts\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-31T18:40:57.738Z\">6.40pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Hillary Clinton sought to play down the impact at her first public event of the week.</p> <p>\u201cMost people have decided quite a long time ago what they think about all this,\u201d she told a rally in Ohio. \u201cNow what people are focused upon is choosing the next president and commander-in-chief.\u201d</p> <p>But there was less direct criticism of the FBI than over the weekend and Clinton said they were welcome to look at the emails of her aide Huma Abedin.</p> <p>\u201cI am sure a lot of you may be asking what this email business is about and why in the world the FBI would decide to jump into an election without any evidence and it\u2019s a good a question,\u201d she said to boos from the young crowd at Kent State University in Ohio.</p> <p>\u201cBy all mean they should look at them and I am sure they will reach the same conclusion as when they looked at my emails: there is no case.\u201d</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58178ba5e4b0219a00d3ab3e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-31T18:31:29.225Z\">6.31pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Donald Trump\u2019s companies have deleted thousands of documents and records from court proceedings, often defying court orders, <a href=\"http://www.newsweek.com/2016/11/11/donald-trump-companies-destroyed-emails-documents-515120.html\">according to a Newsweek investigation</a> - despite his anger at Hillary Clinton deleting emails from her private server.</p> <p>Journalist Kurt Eichwald explains the tactics Trump would use to hide documents: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Over the course of decades, Donald Trump\u2019s companies have systematically destroyed or hidden thousands of emails, digital records and paper documents demanded in official proceedings, often in defiance of court orders.

Because of security concerns, little information about this time has previously been made public:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>McMullin joined the CIA as a student trainee while an undergraduate at Brigham Young University. He would alternate semesters between the university and training at CIA headquarters in Langley, Va. During that time, he spent a year in Israel and Jordan learning Arabic. He also worked for a refugee resettlement program run by the United Nations.</p> <p>After graduating in 2001, McMullin joined the CIA\u2019s directorate of operations, which runs clandestine missions abroad. He was in a computer training class at Langley headquarters when the 9/11 attacks occurred. After that, McMullin\u2019s 18-month training to be an undercover operative was sped up, and he soon found himself in a southwest Asian country where the U.S. military was deeply engaged in the new war on terror. The specific country remains classified to protect his contacts there.</p> <p>The CIA station chief who supervised McMullin in his first overseas assignment told me that McMullin stood out among all the new case officers because of his insistence on going outside the safe confines of the embassy to meet and develop human- intelligence assets. As a Mormon, McMullin could not indulge in the vices that often help to build such bonds, so he used his piousness and his experience before college as a missionary in Brazil to his advantage.</p> <p>... McMullin served his later years as an undercover officer in Iraq while the U.S. military was battling a brutal Sunni insurgency and collecting intelligence on what was then called al-Qaeda in Iraq but is now the Islamic State. McMullin worked in Iraq until 2010, when the country achieved a degree of stability and the terrorist threat was temporarily minimized.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58177231e4b08d944ba4caa4\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-31T16:37:02.264Z\">4.37pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">CNN 'completely uncomfortable' with leaked Clinton debate question</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>CNN is \u201ccompletely uncomfortable\u201d with news that acting DNC head Donna Brazile allegedly leaked debate questions to Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign.</p> <p>CNN spokesperson Lauren Pratapas released a statement on the revelations from today\u2019s latest Wikileaks release of emails supposedly from Clinton campaign chief John Podesta, that show Brazile alerted Clinton that a question on the Flint water crisis would be asked during her debate with Bernie Sanders. </p> <p>Pratapas\u2019 statement reads:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>On October 14th, CNN accepted Donna Brazile\u2019s resignation as a CNN contributor.

Recall that Mr. Comey\u2019s authority extends only to supervising the gathering of facts to be presented to Justice Department lawyers for their confidential determination of whether those facts justify a federal prosecution.</p> <p>Nonetheless, in July he announced that \u201cno reasonable prosecutor\u201d would seek to charge her with a crime, although Mrs. Clinton had classified information on a private nonsecure server\u2014at least a misdemeanor under one statute; and although she was \u201cextremely careless\u201d in her handling of classified information such that it was exposed to hacking by hostile foreign nations\u2014a felony under another statute; and apparently had caused the destruction of emails\u2014a felony under two other statutes. He then told Congress repeatedly that the investigation into her handling of emails was closed.</p> <p>Those decisions were not his to make, nor were the reasons he offered for making them at all tenable: that prosecutions for anything but mishandling large amounts of classified information, accompanied by false statements to investigators, were unprecedented; and that criminal prosecutions for gross negligence were constitutionally suspect.</p> </blockquote> <p>Former AG Eric Holder\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/eric-holder-james-comey-is-a-good-man-but-he-made-a-serious-mistake/2016/10/30/08e7208e-9f07-11e6-8832-23a007c77bb4_story.html?utm_term=.bb2886061c76\">Washington Post op-ed</a> today also points out Comey\u2019s previous public statements in July about Clinton\u2019s emails were problematic and against DOJ policy.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>This controversy has its roots in the director\u2019s July decision to hold a news conference announcing his recommendation that the Justice Department bring no charges against Hillary Clinton. Instead of making a private recommendation to the attorney general \u2014 consistent with Justice Department policy \u2014 he chose to publicly share his professional recommendation, as well as his personal opinions, about the case. That was a stunning breach of protocol. It may set a dangerous precedent for future investigations. It was wrong.</p> </blockquote> <p>Over the weekend, the Clinton campaign got nearly 100 former federal prosecutors and Department of Justice officials, including Holder and former Deputy AG Larry Thompson, to sign an open letter questioning Comey\u2019s behavior.<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Perhaps most troubling to us is the precedent set by this departure from the Department\u2019s widely-respected, non-partisan traditions. The admonitions that warn officials against making public statements during election periods have helped to maintain the independence and integrity of both the Department\u2019s important work and public confidence in the hardworking men and women who conduct themselves in a nonpartisan manner.</p> <p>We believe that adherence to longstanding Justice Department guidelines is the best practice when considering public statements on investigative matters. We do not question Director Comey\u2019s motives. However, the fact remains that the Director\u2019s disclosure has invited considerable, uninformed public speculation about the significance of newly-discovered material just days before a national election.

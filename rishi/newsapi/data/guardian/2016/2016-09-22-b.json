  "<p>A careless agent. A cache of hacking tools left on a remote and unsecured computer. A shadowy group of Russian hackers. A fire-sale on the deep web.</p> <p>This is the current focus of a inquiry into a cache of NSA exploits that were dumped on to public websites last month by a group calling itself the Shadow Brokers, four people with direct knowledge of the probe investigation told Reuters.</p> <p>The tools enabled hackers to exploit software flaws in computer and communications systems from vendors such as Cisco Systems and Fortinet.<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/aug/16/shadow-brokers-hack-auction-nsa-malware-equation-group\">Hacking group auctions 'cyber weapons' stolen from NSA</a> </p> </aside>  <p> The public release of the tools happened at the same time as US officials concluded that Russia or its proxies were responsible for hacking political party organizations in the run-up to the November 8 presidential election. </p> <p>Various explanations have been floated by officials in Washington as to how the tools were stolen. Some feared it was the work of a leaker similar to former agency contractor Edward Snowden, while others suspected the Russians might have hacked into NSA headquarters in Fort Meade, Maryland.</p> <p> But officials heading the FBI-led investigation now discount both of those scenarios, the people said in separate interviews.</p> <p> NSA officials have told investigators that an employee or contractor made the mistake about three years ago during an operation that used the tools, the people said. That person acknowledged the error shortly afterward, they said. </p> <p>But the NSA did not inform the companies of the danger when it first discovered the exposure of the tools, the sources said. Since the public release of the tools, the companies involved have issued patches in the systems to protect them.</p> <p> Investigators have not ruled out the possibility that the former NSA person, who has since departed the agency for other reasons, left the tools exposed deliberately. Another possibility, two of the sources said, is that more than one person at the headquarters or a remote location made similar mistakes or compounded each other\u2019s missteps.</p> <p> Representatives of the NSA, the FBI and the office of the Director of National Intelligence all declined to comment.</p> <p> After the discovery, the NSA tuned its sensors to detect use of any of the tools by other parties, especially foreign adversaries with strong cyber espionage operations, such as China and Russia.</p> <p> That could have helped identify rival powers\u2019 hacking targets, potentially leading them to be defended better. It might also have allowed US officials to see deeper into rival hacking operations while enabling the NSA itself to continue using the tools for its own operations.</p> <p> Because the sensors did not detect foreign spies or criminals using the tools on US or allied targets, the NSA did not feel obligated to immediately warn the US manufacturers, an official and one other person familiar with the matter said.</p> <p> In this case, as in more commonplace discoveries of security flaws, US officials weigh what intelligence they could gather by keeping the flaws secret against the risk to US companies and individuals if adversaries find the same flaws.</p> <p> Critics of the Obama administration\u2019s policies for making those decisions have cited the Shadow Brokers dump as evidence that the balance has tipped too far toward intelligence gathering.</p> <p> The investigators have not determined conclusively that the Shadow Brokers group is affiliated with the Russian government, but that is the presumption, said one of the people familiar with the probe and a fifth person.</p> <p> One reason for suspecting government instead of criminal involvement, officials said, is that the hackers revealed the NSA tools rather than immediately selling them.</p> <p> The publication of the code, on the heels of leaks of emails by Democratic party officials and preceding leaks of emails by former US Secretary of State Colin Powell, could be part of a pattern of spreading harmful and occasionally false information to further the Russian agenda, said Jim Lewis, a cybersecurity expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.</p> <p> \u201cThe dumping is a tactic they\u2019ve been developing for the last five years or so,\u201d Lewis said. \u201cThey try it, and if we don\u2019t respond they go a little further next time.\u201d</p> <p><em>Reuters contributed to this report.</em></p>",
  "<p>When Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump square off on television next week it will be the largest audience of their long careers, which both have lived in the glare of limelight. <a href=\"http://thehill.com/homenews/administration/296818-trump-clinton-debate-expected-to-shatter-ratings-records\" title=\"\">More than 100 million Americans are expected to tune in</a> on the evening of 26 September \u2013 an astonishing viewership that would rank the event as among one of the most watched television broadcasts in US history. The rest have been Super Bowls. Monday\u2019s debate, 56 years to the day after the first televised duel between John F Kennedy and Richard Nixon, will almost certainly be a&#xa0;turning point in a turbulent election year in&#xa0;America \u2013 12 months that have thrown into sharp relief the country\u2019s deep polarisation and the breakdown of the Republican party. The course of debates can turn on personal defects, such as <a href=\"https://www.gilderlehrman.org/history-by-era/sixties/essays/great-debate-kennedy-nixon-and-television-1960-race-for-presidency\" title=\"\">Richard Nixon\u2019s five o\u2019clock shadow</a> in 1960. The screen can magnify character flaws and highlight a candidate\u2019s competence. Ronald Reagan\u2019s much-quoted putdown of Jimmy Carter \u2013 <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/There_you_go_again\" title=\"\">\u201cthere you go again\u201d</a> \u2013 underlined the fact he was offering not only change, but opened viewers\u2019 eyes to&#xa0;his vision of America. Bill Clinton, then the insurgent outsider, pulled off the same trick in making then president George HW Bush look <a href=\"http://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2008/01/17/a-damaging-impatience\" title=\"\">out of touch</a> in 1992.</p> <p>In this election the TV debate offers a chance for each candidate a chance to reset the narrative of their campaign. Mr Trump, a businessman-demagogue trading in crude economic populism, has less reason to do so. Last week\u2019s terrorist attacks play into his claims that America is under siege. Democrat Hilary Clinton\u2019s recent bout of pneumonia bolstered his nod-and-wink comments about her failing health. While Mrs Clinton has endured some of the worst weeks of her campaign, her Republican rival has been stealing headlines. <a href=\"http://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2016-election-forecast/\" title=\"\">While Mrs Clinton remains ahead in the polls</a>, the momentum is with her rumour-mongering opponent. On paper Mrs Clinton should be able to swat away her opponent. She has the experience, the public policy competence and the chance to make history as the first female commander-in-chief of the most powerful nation on earth. She is also a better debater than retail politician.</p> <p>The trouble with Mrs Clinton is twofold. One is biography. Thanks to being a public figure for decades, her positions today often contradict her publicly stated beliefs. Is she <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2016/09/21/clinton_campaign_manager_repeatedly_fails_to_answer_questions_about_clintons_syria_policy.html\" title=\"\">for intervention in Syria</a> or not? Is she repudiating <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/nation/politics/trailguide/la-na-trailguide-updates-bill-clinton-case-for-tpp-1474479987-htmlstory.html\" title=\"\">free trade deals</a> she once championed or not? Does she want more government help in <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/11/us/politics/hillary-clinton-health-care-public-option.html?_r=0\" title=\"\">healthcare</a> \u2013 or not? Little wonder, perhaps, that key voter groups such as <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/09/hillary-clinton-millennials-philadelphia/500540/\" title=\"\">millennials fail to warm</a> to Mrs Clinton. The second problem for the former first lady and ex-secretary of state is that she is the continuity candidate in this election. She promises more of the same.</p> <p>Her opponent does not. Mr Trump\u2019s dog-whistle campaign has torn America apart along lines of race, gender and education. This is not just a break with the past, but threatens to splinter the country into warring parts. It would be a mistake to underestimate the real estate magnate. Mr Trump\u2019s skill is his appeal to reptilian instincts. These reflexive inherent tendencies developed in humans to override a brain\u2019s more sophisticated emotional response in times of crisis. This may explain why Mr Trump favours chaos over stability. The billionaire is also an accomplished television performer, bringing out the inner reptile on 14 seasons of his US reality show The Apprentice. Cruel patter as entertainment was his trademark. In the Republican primaries he wiped out opponents used to playing by different rules.</p> <p>What Trumpism projects is pretty clear: building a wall; taking on China; Americanism not globalism. Mrs Clinton seems to have a hundred carefully costed policies but not one eye-catching slogan. She radiates a sensible incrementalism. She campaigns in prose, leaving poetry to her predecessor. This is a mistake. She needs to focus on what is driving discontent in America: an economic system that no longer defuses high levels of inequality with opportunities for all. Mrs Clinton may argue that after years of watching their incomes go nowhere, America\u2019s middle class <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-09-13/u-s-poverty-rate-falls-to-post-recession-low-as-incomes-gain\" title=\"\">finally got a big raise last year</a> \u2013 the first increase since 2007, the year before the Great Recession started. However, the middle classes remain poorer than in 2000. That\u2019s 15 years of going backward. Mrs Clinton needs to find a resonant theme to sum up her policies: a Marshall Plan for the middle classes would not be a bad idea. Monday is her chance to show she is motivated by the common good. Mrs Clinton should seize it.</p>",
  "<p>The horrors of a haunted house usually end once you push open the final set of black, saloon-hinged doors and step back in the fairground. However, the Mexican artist <a href=\"http://www.pedroreyes.net/\">Pedro Reyes</a> hopes his nightmares remain with visitors long after they have left his immersive 2016 Halloween attraction, opening in New York next month.</p> <p>\u201cMonsters have always been a way to speak about our real fears,\u201d says the 44-year-old. \u201cZombies are a fear of poor people; Karl Marx <a href=\"https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch10.htm\">talked about capital being like a vampire that stalks the living</a>; and Mary Shelley\u2019s Dr Frankenstein is trying to create life, which is exactly what genetic engineers are trying to do today.\u201d</p> <p>All these bogeymen and more will populate <a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2026016011/doomocracy-a-haunted-house-with-pedro-reyes-and-cr\">Doomocracy</a>, \u201ca political haunted house\u201d that Reyes is preparing to stage within the vast Brooklyn Army Terminal from 7 October until 6 November in conjunction with the New York non-profit arts organisation <a href=\"http://creativetime.org/\">Creative Time</a>.</p> <p>Doomocracy\u2019s spooky run will coincide with both Halloween and the 2016 presidential election, and is appropriately pitched somewhere between a carnival attraction, an immersive theatre production and any given hour or two within today\u2019s news cycle. Creative Time\u2019s artistic director, <a href=\"http://creativetime.org/about/staff/nato-thompson/\">Nato Thompson</a>, describes the venture as \u201cHieronymus Bosch meets Fox News.

Nevertheless the artist \u2013 who has previously staged a fine-art version of <a href=\"http://camstl.org/about-pedro-reyes-and-sanatorium/\">a psychiatric sanatorium at different galleries around the world</a> and overseen <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/2014/01/25/265794611/artist-transforms-guns-to-make-music-literally\">a programme to repurpose firearms as musical instruments</a> \u2013 is deeply serious in his examination of fear within today\u2019s political landscape.</p> <p>\u201cThese days, politicians are trying to create fear in order to take power,\u201d Reyes says, \u201cso it\u2019s quite an experiment to be dealing with the production of fear and its political uses.\u201d</p> <p>He is also highly respectful of the funhouse trope, partly because it is so familiar to people who might not necessarily be avid gallery goers.</p> <p>\u201cPretty much everyone can picture a horror house,\u201d he says. \u201cIt will, if you forgive the paradox, deal with political issues in a very democratic way. Everyone can engage with the form.\u201d</p> <p>Reyes and Thompson are keen to ensure Doomocracy keeps pace with events and have been writing and rewriting the dramatic scenarios to reflect the changing nature of the electoral race.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been workshopping the scripts today,\u201d says Thompson. \u201cIt\u2019s a fluid process. The ground is moving fast this election, it\u2019s hard to keep up.\u201d</p> <p>Reyes, who visited both commercial haunted houses and guerrilla theatre groups in preparation for the show, also says Doomocracy reflects a general hopelessness within contemporary politics, both in the US and elsewhere.</p> <p>\u201cWhy do people vote against their own interests?\u201d Reyes says. \u201cIs it that we have brainwashed people to make the wrong decisions? There\u2019s a feeling in the US that it\u2019s a downer to have to choose between the [presidential] options. But it\u2019s elsewhere too; it can be said of Mexico and many other places around the world. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum\">Brexit</a> was almost like a democratic, rightwing coup d\u2019\u00e9tat.\u201d</p> <p>Despite this gloomy view, Doomocracy is still able to engage with some of the norms of campaign fundraising. Its <a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2026016011/doomocracy-a-haunted-house-with-pedro-reyes-and-cr\">Kickstarter page</a> looks set to reach its goal of $80,000 by its deadline of 29 September, offering suitably doom-laden swag for its pledgers, including Doomocracy pennants and buttons, and \u201cYes We Can\u2019t\u201d bumper stickers.</p> <p>With all this left-leaning pessimism, Reyes\u2019 haunted house looks unlikely to attract many Trump voters. However, Creative Time\u2019s executive director, Katie Hollander, argues that the work doesn\u2019t favour either side. \u201cIt\u2019s not a commentary on the candidates, more a commentary on the issues,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Indeed, Reyes hopes to take in wider political issues unlikely to be addressed by either party this election year. \u201cIt will deal with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/may/27/-sp-americas-mental-health-care-system-crisis\">mental health</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2014/feb/03/us-war-on-drugs-impact-in-latin-american\">excessive criminalisation of drug use</a>, and the increasing role of the medical industry as a kind of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2011/jun/20/healthcare-drugspolicy\">white-collar drug dealer</a>,\u201d the artist says. \u201cThere\u2019ll be stuff on the food industry too, and equity or the lack of social mobility \u2013 those universal issues, that are experienced in every part of the world.\u201d</p> <p>While this all may sound nihilistic, Reyes hopes Doomocracy could be liberating too. \u201cUsually my art is more about hope, but on this occasion it is a dark project, and offers more of a space for catharsis,\u201d he says. \u201cAfter all, Halloween is a moment to go crazy. That is the role of carnival.\u201d</p> <p>Yet, does he genuinely expect Doomocracy to actually change any visitors\u2019 minds about the issues examined? Won\u2019t most already agree with his position on, say, pharmaceuticals and gun crime?</p> <p>\u201cThere will be people who love it, people who hate it, people who feel empowered, and people who feel offended,\u201d says Reyes. \u201cMaking art is one way to elaborate and engage with reality.\u201d</p> <p>And this autumn, at a time when truth seems if not stranger, then at least as spooky as fiction, one route for meaningful political engagement appears to lie through Doomocracy\u2019s funhouse doors.</p>",

Because all you can rely on is what you walk on to that stage with.</p> <p>I have moderated two presidential debates (in 1988 and 1992), but back then there were three questioners and one moderator keeping time.

I would not only go back and look at exactly what each candidate said on the important issues but also where they later changed their tune even slightly \u2013 because you can\u2019t allow a candidate to wiggle out of discrepancies and flip flops.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/21/green-party-jill-stein-presidential-debates-hofstra-new-york\">Green party may try to \u2018escort\u2019 Jill Stein into the presidential debates</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A good question allows the candidate to reveal more about an issue or a leadership characteristic than the audience previously knew. Just repeating campaign platform positions on issues is a debate that has not served its purpose. It\u2019s all about illuminating information that the American voter didn\u2019t know before the debate started. Ninety percent of the debate no one will remember, but people will remember how the candidate handled the tough questions. </p> <p>Every moderator will hit a moment when he knows the question is not being answered, or that the factual answer being given is wrong. And in every single case, the moderator has to decide \u2013 how hard to I push? Do I move on? Or do I allow the other candidate an opening to correct the factual record? In a perfect world, if I were asking Hillary Clinton a question, I would give Trump an opportunity to call her out. But sometimes the timing doesn\u2019t work that way, and you can\u2019t stay on a question forever. Two follow-ups is about as far as you can go. Every moderator knows there is a danger that you will look up and find that you\u2019ve done 15 minutes on something you wanted to do only five on. After two, you have to leave it there. The audience understands. This person is not answering the question.</p> <p>The most advice for the moderator: don\u2019t over eat and use the bathroom before you get out there. You\u2019ve got 90 minutes without a break. Ninety minutes of sitting there.

I had 300 questions ready!</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The important thing for the moderator to remember is that people go to a baseball game to watch the game, not the umpire. We\u2019re not electing the moderator. We\u2019re electing the president of the United States. You want each person to answer the question, yes, but you have to let the other candidate be the first fact-checker first. If the audience hears a lie, they first want to see if the opponent has picked up on it. If he doesn\u2019t, then I think you can step in. But people wanna hear from the other guy more than they want to hear from you. If the moderator understands there\u2019s been an egregious statement of fact or totally contradicted what they\u2019ve said earlier, he or she should say so. You don\u2019t say: \u201cYou\u2019re absolutely wrong.\u201d You bring up the evidence, and say something like: \u201cYou said the opposite three weeks ago.\u201d It\u2019s your obligation to point that out. But it\u2019s hard. You\u2019re doing this in real-time.</p> <p>What you try to do as a moderator is act as a guiding hand. You give each person a chance to show their best \u2013 and if their worst shows up well, that\u2019s part of the story too.

There are other ways to introduce fact-checking. If Trump says \u201cI\u2019ve always been against the Iraq war\u201d and you as a moderator know that\u2019s not the case, what you can do is say \u201cthere are others that dispute that\u201d or \u201cthis has been thoroughly fact checked and I would encourage others to look that up\u201d.

  "<p>\u201cIf you want to become French, you speak French, you live like the French. We will no longer settle for integration that does not work, we will require assimilation.\u201d These <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/09/20/nicolas-sarkozy-says-immigrants-should-live-like-the-french/\">were the words of</a> former French president Nicolas Sarkozy this week. He went on: \u201cOnce you become French, your ancestors are the Gauls. \u2018I love France, I learned the history of France, I see myself as French,\u2019 is what you must say.\u201d</p> <p>This week, personalities from both sides of the political spectrum expressed their concern over this statement, made by Sarkozy on Monday night during a meeting in Franconville, a north Paris suburb. Curiously, the part that stirred up most controversy was the idea that, once you become French, the Gauls are your ancestors. This declaration is historically incorrect: Gaul is actually a geographical construct conceptualised by the Romans to refer to a territory bringing people of varied origins together. This notion was later used by the Third Republic, after defeat in the Franco-Prussian war of 1870, to rally the French around symbols such as courage and strength.</p> <p>This over-simplification of French roots was removed from the school curriculum in the 1960s in favour of a more inclusive reading of French history after decolonisation, following Max Marchand\u2019s publication of one of the first school textbooks on the history of Algeria.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5148a8e97b9670ab962f9ef2318525e16f57344a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5148a8e97b9670ab962f9ef2318525e16f57344a/0_462_2600_1784/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Martinican writer and philosopher Edouard Glissant: \u2018Speaking French is more important than saying something.\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"686\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Martinican writer and philosopher Edouard Glissant: \u2018Speaking French is more important than saying something.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ulf Andersen/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Sarkozy is only continuing a trend he made popular; after all, he is the president who created the controversial National Identity and Immigration ministry in 2007. Unsurprisingly, the rest of his comments didn\u2019t receive the same criticism. The selective outrage ignores the rehabilitation of the principle of assimilation, setting whiteness as the ideal and erasing people of colour once again. While the majority may think that Sarkozy simply meant that those who move to France must obey the laws of the republic, his comments silence all non-white French people and deny the violence of assimilation. The word \u201cassimilation\u201d itself refers to the second phase of the colonisation process, the first step being \u201cconquest\u201d and the last \u201cpacification\u201d.

A \u201crhizome identity\u201d \u2013 one that is forced to grow underground \u2013 is the only way to think outside the binary and nostalgic narrative of French politicians. Glissant <a href=\"http://www.edouardglissant.fr/rhizome.html\">applied this idea</a> to post-structuralists Gilles Deleuze and F\u00e9lix Guattari: the image of the rhizome (multiple root in one plant) was used to qualify the plural identity as opposed to the single root identity. In contrast to the model of atavistic cultures, the silhouette of the rhizome places identity in the development of composite cultures through a networking of external inputs.</p> <p>Let\u2019s be clear, Sarkozy is not the problem. He is not the only one who promotes these notions of enmity. We must remain united against the constant infantilisation of French people, the ban of the critical mind. The only way children of immigrants can fight is to refuse assimilation, to familiarise ourselves with the idea of creolisation and to stop defining ourselves and our worth as a reaction to bigotry.</p> <ul> <li>This article was amended on 23 September 2016 to remove an incorrect reference to Napoleon.</li> </ul>",

Congress has so far failed to do so; activists blamed Republican leaders for inaction.</p> <p>Clarke noted that Wednesday\u2019s panel discussion was taking part in the Lyndon Johnson room, named after the president who signed voting rights into law. She warned: \u201cWhat I can tell you is this: the world has changed in the absence of section 5 of the Voting Rights Act. Officials at the state and the local level have exploited every opportunity they can to institute or maintain discriminatory voting practices in the absence of section 5. <br></p> <p>\u201cEach day that Congress fails to act, we not only subject African Americans and other minority voters to the recurring indignity of voter discrimination but taxpayers suffer too. North Carolina has spent nearly $5m defending its discriminatory voter suppression law; Texas has spent more than $3.5m defending its discriminatory voter ID law. And the price tag increases each day.<br><br>\u201cVoter discrimination, if left unchecked, will stand as a stain on our democracy. It is bad for taxpayers, it is bad for Americans. It is time for Congress to stop turning a blind eye to the resurgence of voter discrimination in our country.\u201d</p> <p>Recent restrictions passed by 14 states include new photo ID requirements, a reduction in early voting days and the abolition of same-day registration. Voter fraud is often cited as a reason but experts said the problem is \u201cminuscule\u201d.</p> <p>Civil rights stalwart John Lewis, a Democratic Representative from Georgia, was in the room when Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act. But he said during this year\u2019s primaries he came across a couple who had been married for 40 but were told to vote at separate polling stations.<br></p> <p>\u201cIn the past few months and years I\u2019ve traveled across the country and I know that there is a deliberate persistent systematic effort to make it harder and more difficult for the disabled, student, senior, minority, the poor and rural voters to participate in the democratic process.

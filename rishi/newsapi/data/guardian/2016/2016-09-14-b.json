  "<p>The chair of the House homeland security committee said he \u201cmisspoke\u201d Wednesday evening when he intimated during an interview on CNN that the Republican National Committee\u2019s computer network had been hacked.<br></p> <p>\u201cI misspoke by asserting that the RNC was hacked,\u201d Texas Republican Mike McCaul said in a statement. \u201cWhat I had intended to say was that in addition to the DNC hack, Republican political operatives have also been hacked.\u201d</p> <p>In the earlier interview with CNN, McCaul had told host Wolf Blitzer that the RNC had fallen victim to a hacking perpetrated by Russian state actors at the behest of Russian President Vladimir Putin.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s important to note, Wolf, that they have hacked not only hacked into the DNC but also into the RNC,\u201d McCaul told Blitzer at the time. \u201cSo they are not discriminating one party against the others. The Russians have basically hacked into both parties at the national level and that gives us all concern about what their motivations are.</p> <p>\u201cThe FBI director would tell you they\u2019re just trying to undermine the integrity of the process,\u201d McCaul continued, after Blitzer noted that if Russia had hacked the RNC, it was news to him. \u201cThey are not discriminating one party against the other.</p> <p>\u201cThey have hacked into the RNC, so this is, again, they\u2019re not picking sides here, I don\u2019t think,\u201d McCaul said. \u201cThey\u2019re hacking into both political parties. What they intend to do with that information, I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p> <p>Earlier this summer, hackers <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/26/russia-hackers-democratic-national-committee-email-leak\">believed by the US government</a> to be agents of the Russian government successfully infiltrated the data networks of the Democratic National Committee. That hack led to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/23/dnc-emails-wikileaks-hillary-bernie-sanders\">tens of thousands of internal DNC emails</a> being released on the internet days before the Democratic national convention in Philadelphia, infuriating supporters of onetime Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders, who cited emails deriding the candidate as evidence that the party\u2019s establishment had been hostile to Sanders\u2019 candidacy.</p> <p>The resulting turmoil eventually led to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/24/debbie-wasserman-schultz-resigns-dnc-chair-emails-sanders\">resignation of DNC chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz</a> \u2013 as well as speculation that the Russian government was actively involved in the hack in a bid to interfere with the US presidential election.</p> <p>Putin has recently been praised by Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, who has also <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/27/donald-trump-russia-hillary-clinton-emails-dnc-hack\">appeared to incite</a> Russia to hack into and publish his opponent Hillary Clinton\u2019s private emails.</p>",

By the early afternoon on Thursday, only two stops were confirmed \u2013 a brief visit to the city\u2019s water plant and the church, where Trump was expected to speak with local pastors about the community. Before his arrival at the church, Flint resident LaShonda Richmond said she came to \u201csupport our city \u2013 not to support him\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cShame on him,\u201d Richmond, 46, said of the visit. \u201cHe don\u2019t care about anyone but Trump.\u201d </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"869d90ec16cb85476e76eb72bedb84638c5094f4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/869d90ec16cb85476e76eb72bedb84638c5094f4/0_0_4500_3066/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Trump at Flint water plant\" width=\"1000\" height=\"681\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Donald Trump tours the Flint water plant with utilities administrator JoLisa McDay.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mandel Ngan/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Following the speech at the church, Flint native Danielle Green said few in the audience were receptive to his remarks.</p> <p>\u201cIt was a political pitch, completely,\u201d Green, 46, said. </p> <p>Anthony Paciorek, 33, said Trump was pandering to get votes. </p> <p>\u201cPastor reminded him that we\u2019re not here to talk about politics because he started to go into a Hillary-heavy rhetoric, and then \u2026 there was interruptions with some questions I don\u2019t think Donald Trump was prepared to answer, or wanting to, frankly,\u201d said Paciorek, also a Flint resident. </p> <p>\u201cI also saw five, maybe 10 people clap out of a room full of 60,\u201d he added.</p> <p>Ahead of Trump\u2019s visit, protesters convened a brief press conference outside Flint\u2019s water plant, where many expressed dismay at what they described as the nominee\u2019s attempt to use the city\u2019s public health crisis as a \u201ccampaign prop\u201d.</p> <p>Carrie Younger-Nelson, a Flint resident, said the city has been engulfed by the water crisis for two years and Trump \u201cjust sees an opportunity to get in here and get him some media\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cFlint do not want him here, and he needs to keep it rolling,\u201d she said. </p> <p>Younger-Nelson, 65, said she experienced rashes, hair loss and sinus issues after the city switched its water source over two years ago. And still, months after state and federal officials declared it was safe to use filtered tap water, she refuses to rely on anything but bottled water. </p> <p>\u201cEverything you do, you\u2019ve got to use bottled water,\u201d she said. Asked what she\u2019d say to Trump if she ran into him during Thursday\u2019s stop, Younger-Nelson was direct: \u201cI\u2019d tell him to go to hell.\u201d</p> <p>Standing nearby, the state senate minority leader, Jim Ananich, a Flint resident himself, said the purpose of the protest early on Thursday was to send \u201ca strong message that Flint\u2019s not a photo-op\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cLooking at the water plant doesn\u2019t help us get new, clean pipes; it doesn\u2019t help us get clean water,\u201d Ananich said. \u201cIt\u2019s not a policy position to make sure this doesn\u2019t happen again. This was a failed policy and culture created by [Michigan governor Rick Snyder] and emergency managers, bottom line. That\u2019s what happened. It was 100% avoidable.\u201d </p> <p>Jia Ireland, 23, also a Flint resident, said the public needed to know that Flint was still dealing with the effects of the water crisis, now well into its third year. </p> <p>\u201cPeople are still living off of water bottles and living off of filters,\u201d she said. \u201cYes, pipes are being dug up, but it\u2019s a slow progress. And we need to see things happen fast and now.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAlso, I am not a supporter of Trump,\u201d she continued. \u201cI feel like Donald Trump is using this as a PR statement \u2026 so, you\u2019re late. And then, also, it\u2019s ironic that you\u2019re coming to speak to a city that\u2019s predominately African American, working class. There are high pockets of poverty here. And these are demographics of people you\u2019ve been disrespecting your entire election \u2026 now all the sudden you want to come here and talk to a group of people that you\u2019ve belittled this whole time. It just seems disingenuous.\u201d</p> <p>Trump\u2019s stop came as Flint\u2019s mayor, Karen Weaver, was in Washington DC to call attention to a bill before the US Senate that is expected to bring millions of dollars to aid the city\u2019s recovery efforts. </p> <p>The mayor initially said Trump\u2019s request to visit the Flint water plant would be burdensome, adding that the facility\u2019s staff \u201ccannot afford the disruption of a last-minute visit\u201d. But a spokesperson for the city said Trump would receive a tour if he decided to appear.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0f7cb98112387a9ccad192f5cf544c97bd7b1d97\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0f7cb98112387a9ccad192f5cf544c97bd7b1d97/0_87_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Trump at Flint water plant\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Donald Trump at the Flint water plant on Wednesday.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mike Segar/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cIf he shows up, a tour will be provided,\u201d said the spokeswoman, Kristin Moore. \u201cNot open to the public.\u201d Asked if she had an indication of Trump\u2019s itinerary, Moore simply said: \u201cNo.\u201d</p> <p>Trump eventually arrived, and was given a roughly 20-minute tour of the facility by the plant\u2019s supervisor, JoLisa McDay. Trump observed as McDay pointed out basic operations of the facility, saying: \u201cThe water is coming, you open this gate, and the water is coming.\u201d </p> <p>\u201cRight, right,\u201d Trump responded. The water plant is currently not in operation. </p> <p>Flint\u2019s water supply became contaminated with lead in April 2014, when a state-appointed emergency manager running the city made a decision to switch its water source to a highly corrosive river. State environmental officials failed to require Flint to use corrosion controls to treat the water supply, thereby allowing lead to leach off pipes and flow into households across the city. </p> <p>As part of an investigation by Michigan\u2019s attorney general, Bill Schuette, nine state and local officials have been criminally charged for their role in the water crisis. The investigators have said additional individuals are expected to face charges. The crisis has also been blamed for an outbreak of legionnaires\u2019 disease, which included 12 deaths, though health officials have yet to conclusively say the city\u2019s water supply is to blame. </p> <p>Michigan\u2019s governor, Rick Snyder, who has been vehemently criticized by residents for his administration\u2019s delayed response to addressing the water crisis, has refused to endorse a candidate in the presidential race. </p> <p>\u201cGovernor Snyder has stayed out of presidential politics since before the primary election and intends on continuing to do so,\u201d Snyder\u2019s spokesman, Ari Adler, said in an email. \u201cHe is focused on the work that needs to be done in Michigan.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>Perhaps no cartoon frog has been as thoroughly maligned during the 2016 election as <a href=\"http://www.mattfurie.com/\">Matt Furie</a>\u2019s hapless Pepe. The meme-friendly, often crudely drawn amphibian has lately been seen smiling, sporting Trump-like hair and standing menacingly behind the Republican presidential nominee in a photoshopped lineup of The Deplorables, a play on Hillary Clinton\u2019s dismissal of many of the candidate\u2019s supporters belonging in a \u201cbasket of deplorables\u201d.<br></p> <p>The Clinton campaign posted an <a href=\"https://www.hillaryclinton.com/feed/donald-trump-pepe-the-frog-and-white-supremacists-an-explainer/\">under-informed explainer</a> about Pepe, describing him as a \u201csymbol associated with white supremacy\u201d, though they admit he has been \u201cenjoyed by teenagers and pop stars alike\u201d in the past.</p> <p>San Francisco cartoonist and painter Furie created Pepe as part of his laid-back cartoon Boy\u2019s Club, which was collected in print by comics publisher <a href=\"http://www.fantagraphics.com/boysclub/\">Fantagraphics</a> this July. The easygoing strip chronicles the adventures of four roommates \u2013 Pepe, Andy, Brett and the malicious Landwolf \u2013 who spend a lot of time getting high, farting, spouting catchphrases and generally behaving like people who think Pepe memes are funny. Furie says Pepe himself is not into Nazis or Klansmen. \u201cIf anything, he\u2019d be part of the Green party,\u201d he tells the Guardian.</p> <p>Furie, also <a href=\"http://www.mattfurie.com/\">a witty painter</a> with a fine arts background, explains why he likes the crude reworkings of his careful linework, why he loves The Far Side, and why he\u2019s ultimately voting for Hillary Clinton, whether or not she likes his frog drawing.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3840291560cafb5166148244f38c73892d6b7ce2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3840291560cafb5166148244f38c73892d6b7ce2/0_0_774_902/429.png\" alt=\"Matt Furie\u2019s Pepe the Frog from his graphic novel Boy\u2019s Club.\" width=\"429\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Matt Furie\u2019s Pepe the Frog from his graphic novel Boy\u2019s Club.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of the artist</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Congratulations on the book. Is it selling a lot of copies?</strong></p> <p>You know, I don\u2019t know how it\u2019s doing! I hope it\u2019s doing well. Pepe\u2019s kind of hitting peak interest with people in the media right now, so I\u2019m kinda trying to utilize that and twist it into talking about the origins of Pepe, which is in this modest comic book I did. A lot of people are just not familiar with Pepe as he lives as a comic book persona \u2013 kind of a more simple-minded, chill frog. And now he\u2019s taken on the multiple faces of whatever\u2019s going on in the crazy world out there. I just want to bring it back down to earth a little bit at the moment.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"http://mattfurie.tumblr.com/image/150369755602\">Landwolf</a> feels like a much more appropriate avatar for malcontents than Pepe. <br></strong></p> <p>Definitely.<br></p> <p><strong>What was it like seeing The Deplorables picture with the characters replaced with famous heads including Pepe\u2019s?<br></strong></p> <p>I\u2019ve only just seen this stuff recently because everyone\u2019s sending it to me, including, like, media people. Honestly I don\u2019t really follow it very much but you can\u2019t ignore it. It\u2019s all over the place. It\u2019s not the first time I\u2019ve ever seen Pepe as Donald Trump. When I first saw it I thought it was kind of funny. </p> <p>I don\u2019t take it too seriously \u2013 I just try to take it in stride, but the thing that\u2019s come to my attention is ... well, I didn\u2019t know what white nationalists were until, like, yesterday. And the alt-right or whatever? It\u2019s all very new and very strange and definitely not something that I support. I guess Pepe is kind of its own internet thing now. I\u2019m hoping not to get any hate or threats or anything. You have to do a little bit of research to even link it back to me, I think.</p> <p><strong>You don\u2019t sound like you\u2019re a particularly political guy. Do you have any temptation to align yourself one way or another as stuff heats up before the election?<br></strong></p> <p>My interests lie more in philosophical or spiritual books, and politics come and go. But yeah, I\u2019m interested in it. I\u2019m particularly interested in environmental stuff, more like humanitarian stuff. I definitely lean much more liberal \u2013 basically the opposite of what\u2019s happening with Pepe right now.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet element--supporting\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/RogerJStoneJr/status/774684329016299520\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">I am so proud to be one of the Deplorables <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Trump2016?src=hash\">#Trump2016</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/IFD1hfC60w\">pic.twitter.com/IFD1hfC60w</a></p>&mdash; Roger Stone (@RogerJStoneJr) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RogerJStoneJr/status/774684329016299520\">September 10, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p><strong>Can I ask who you\u2019re voting for?<br></strong></p> <p>Well, I was really excited for Bernie, and that fizzled out, so I guess I\u2019m gonna have to take one for the team and go for Hillary even though she\u2019s talking smack, or whoever\u2019s writing for her at the moment is talking smack about Pepe.</p> <p><strong>I\u2019m surprised at how little I\u2019ve seen you or Boy\u2019s Club written about in stories on Pepe.</strong></p> <p>Beyond Boy\u2019s Club, I think it\u2019s even more familiar as a meme for youth culture and teenagers. It\u2019s weird that people are saying he\u2019s been \u201ca longtime white supremacist meme\u201d. If anything he\u2019d be part of the Green party. He\u2019s a frog, why would he support white supremacists? That doesn\u2019t make <em>any</em> sense.</p> <p><strong>He\u2019s not even the right species.</strong><br></p> <p>He lives with a dog, a wolf, a kind of abstract Muppet creature ... he\u2019s all about diversity.<br></p> <p><strong>Is it weird to have to have these arguments?<br></strong></p> <p>It\u2019s just funny. People are taking it <em>really</em> seriously and it\u2019s a damn cartoon frog. It\u2019s weird on some level but it\u2019s more entertaining than anything.</p> <p><strong>A lot of the fun in Boy\u2019s Club comes from the dated pop culture references that are now funny because they remind you of embarrassing trends. How do you dig up stuff with the embarrassing nostalgia vibe?</strong><br></p> <p>I think it\u2019s just growing up in the culture that we live in where it\u2019s very catchphrase-oriented and referential to whatever was popular and kind of formed your imagination over the years. For me it was the Muppets and the Neverending Story and the Terminator and the Predator and all these things that were so cool when you were a kid, at least in terms of more lowbrow art. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c2be842c2605b70af8ac00f8b2c512f97713fbc1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c2be842c2605b70af8ac00f8b2c512f97713fbc1/0_160_960_960/500.jpg\" alt=\"Paintings in progress by Matt Furie\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Paintings in progress by Matt Furie.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of the artist</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>If you look at a guy who grew up in the 60s, he\u2019d be into <a href=\"https://www.pinterest.com/917k/rat-fink-culture/\">Rat Fink culture</a> or car culture; there\u2019s a moment in time where if you\u2019re a musician who came out of the 90s, you were influenced by Led Zeppelin and the Beatles and whoever else. Art just kinda manifests based on when that stuff was most important to you, and you kinda regurgitate it in your own art. it\u2019s just part of the cycle of that kind of thing.</p> <p><strong>What\u2019s it like to be contributing to that now?</strong><br></p> <p>It\u2019s kinda cool. I put out a series of Pepe official T-shirts, and one of them is a button-up collared shirt that has all my favorite Pepes from the internet, which are these more crudely drawn, childlike and funny drawings that it looks like kids are doing on MS Paint. </p> <p>So I collected them all and made a pattern out of them. It\u2019s kind of like a bootleg of the bootleg. It\u2019s a meta-bootleg. I\u2019m using some of it to my advantage! I\u2019ll be walking down the street in a college town and some kids will pass me and be like \u201cOh, cool, Pepe!\u201d It is neat that they have no idea that I made the character but they\u2019re stoked to see an old dude walking down the street with Pepes all over his shirt. That\u2019s satisfying to me.</p> <p><strong>How old are you?<br></strong></p> <p>I\u2019m 37.</p> <p><strong>That\u2019s not that old.<br></strong></p> <p>Yeah but you know, when you\u2019re 20 a 37-year-old dude is <em>old</em>, you know?</p> <p><strong>That\u2019s true. You might as well be dead to them.<br></strong></p> <p>I know, right?</p> <p><strong>Does the quality of those Microsoft Paint-style drawings not bother you?<br></strong></p> <p>I\u2019m actually quite influenced by crude art and children\u2019s art and stuff like that. It just opens up the possibility so much. People think: \u201cIf they can do that, I can do it too!\u201d So just as an artist I\u2019ve always wanted to have a lot of fundamentals under my belt in terms of how to draw a hand and an eyeball and a face and stuff like that; but then I like to just have that knowledge and do more simplified things.

He had a really straightforward, simple way of making these funny comics where you didn\u2019t have to have action sequences or tons of dialogue and stuff. It made it possible for me to be like, \u201cOh! I could do a comic!\u201d</p> <p><strong>What is your hope for Pepe post-election?<br></strong></p> <p>I think Pepe will live on beyond whatever\u2019s going on in the moment politically.

  "<p>Six years after the supreme court opened the floodgates on money in politics with its Citizens United decision, most Americans are well aware how broken our campaign finance system has become. Eighty-four percent of us say there\u2019s too much money in politics, according to a New York Times <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/06/02/us/politics/money-in-politics-poll.html?_r=0\">poll</a>, and two out of three say the wealthy have more influence than everyone else.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/14/corporate-cash-john-doe-files-scott-walker-wisconsin\">Leaked documents reveal secretive influence of corporate cash on politics</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Voters understand that intuitively.

They reveal internal emails that show connections between Wisconsin\u2019s Governor Scott Walker, his aides and wealthy donors \u2013 including Donald Trump. The contents are both depressingly predictable and outrageous.</p> <p>A union-backed recall bid vaulted Walker to national prominence in 2011, after he championed a notorious law stripping public sector unions of their collective bargaining rights. That successful campaign would go on to be a centerpiece of his 2016 presidential campaign, and would probably be again if he runs in 2020.</p> <p>The documents comprise evidence compiled by prosecutors in a \u201cJohn Doe investigation\u201d into the Walker campaign and its network of allies looking into potential campaign finance violations. The focus of the \u201cJohn Doe\u201d inquiry (so named to protect subjects\u2019 anonymity while it was determined whether charges would be pressed) began in 2011, as Walker fought for his governorship in the recall election. In 2015 the Wisconsin <a href=\"https://www.wicourts.gov/sc/opinion/DisplayDocument.pdf?content=pdf&amp;seqNo=144525\">supreme court</a> stopped the investigation, saying the prosecutors had focused on people and groups \u201cwholly innocent of any wrongdoing\u201d.</p> <p>In 2011, the Walker campaign needed money fast and his team got to work. Kate Doner, the campaign\u2019s main fundraiser at the time, laid out her plan in an email that reads like a script from a bad movie. \u201cCorporations,\u201d she wrote. \u201cGo heavy after them to give.\u201d And then: \u201cTake Koch\u2019s money.

Ask him for $1m now.\u201d</p> <p>Apparently Doner knows how to get results because a few months later, Adelson, the billionaire casino magnate, wired in $200,000 for the cause.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--showcase\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/09/wisconsin-promo/\" data-alt=\"wisconsin promo\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/09/wisconsin-promo/\">wisconsin promo</a> </figure>  <p>For a state-level election in Wisconsin, the campaign attracted a surprising number of national tycoons: hedge-fund billionaire Stephen Cohen gave $1m, Home Depot\u2019s Ken Langone chipped in $25,000, while hedge funder Paul Singer ponied up $250,000. \u201cPaul Singer: Grab him,\u201d Doner wrote in another email.</p> <p>The most stomach-churning example in the 1,500 pages is Harold Simmons, the owner of NL Industries \u2013 historically a major manufacturer of lead paint. The company faced millions of dollars in lawsuits over alleged lead poisoning of children.<br></p> <p>Simmons gave $750,000 in a series of payments to the third-party group prosecutors suspected of illegally coordinating with the Walker and Republican state senators\u2019 campaigns. The donations came as Walker and state senators were fighting the recall effort, and around the same time the Republican-controlled state senate took steps to pass legislation to effectively grant the industry legal immunity from lead poisoning claims (a federal court later struck the legislation down). To me, that looks like corporate pay-for-play.</p> <p>Walker knew Simmons\u2019 money was tainted. Campaign adviser Keith Gilkes, in an email to Walker, warned that the billionaire had successfully avoided paying millions in medical treatment for children who suffered from lead poisoning in Milwaukee, among other \u201cred flags\u201d. </p> <p>Politicians and their allies go to great lengths to hide their campaign finance dealings from public view \u2013 in this case they almost succeeded. David Prosser was one of the four conservative judges who approved the July 2015 ruling that ended the John Doe investigation.</p> <p>Some of the very emails Prosser wanted to destroy show how Walker\u2019s allies tried to secure his re-election to the supreme court \u2013 an outcome necessary to maintain its conservative bent and thus defend Walker\u2019s agenda.</p> <p>The influence money can buy has become an animating force in this year\u2019s presidential election, fueling the unlikely candidacies of Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump. Both rejected the need to collect money from larger donors and corporations, Sanders with his $27 contributions and Trump with his personal wealth.</p> <p>\u201cWhen you give, they do whatever the hell you want them to do,\u201d Trump, who is now soliciting contributions, once said of political donations.</p> <p>He surfaces in the John Doe documents for contributing $15,000 to the third-party group suspected of coordinating with Walker\u2019s campaign, following a 45-minute meeting with Walker at Trump\u2019s Fifth Avenue office.</p> <p>Trump may be an opportunistic charlatan, but he\u2019s tapping in to something real in voters. It\u2019s a rage born of disenchantment with today\u2019s democratic process. And these documents suggest that anger is valid.</p> <p>The US supreme court is expected to decide whether to intervene in the John Doe case later this month but it\u2019s unlikely to undo the problem it created. Exposing its injustice is a good first step.</p>",
  "<p>The sun burned over the red rock spires of the Navajo Nation, where thousands of people gathered along a miles-long stretch of road for the tribe\u2019s annual parade on Saturday. Tucked away in the north-easternmost corner of Arizona, the cultural celebration has become something of a ritual for politicians seeking the support of the Navajo people.</p> <p>On one float, perhaps for the last time, Arizona\u2019s native son John McCain drew cheers as he passed. Not far behind, Ann Kirkpatrick, the three-term congresswoman from northern Arizona who is seeking to unseat him in the nation\u2019s marquee Senate race of the year, introduced herself to the crowd in Navajo, then in English. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/25/senate-women-democrats-majority-power\">Women poised to lead Democratic return to power in the Senate</a> </p> </aside>  <p>At this stage, a victory for the Flagstaff congresswoman would be a stunning upset over McCain, who\u2019s survived in the Senate since 1987, when he succeeded Barry Goldwater.

McCain, the 2008 Republican presidential nominee and a party statesman, is by his <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2016/05/trump-latinos-mccain-222810\">own</a> admission facing the \u201crace of my life\u201d with Kirkpatrick earning the distinction of being his toughest challenger yet. </p> <p>\u201cThis is among the most competitive races that we\u2019re looking at this cycle,\u201d said Lauren Passalacqua, spokeswoman for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee (DSCC), which is helping Kirkpatrick organize and fundraise.<br></p> <p>Polling averages show McCain with a <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/senate/az/arizona_senate_mccain_vs_kirkpatrick-5455.html\">13-point lead</a>, though some <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/docs/2016/PPP_Arizona_June_2016.pdf\">surveys have</a> shown the race in a near tie. An NBC/WSJ/Marist poll taken after McCain won a decisive primary victory last month showed the senator with a 19-point lead.</p> <p>Supporters say Kirkpatrick is the ideal Democrat for a demographically changing red state \u2013 and the person best positioned to take on McCain. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"13567e8ef5d895b9c18d64403d2b71a5ca9f7b57\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/13567e8ef5d895b9c18d64403d2b71a5ca9f7b57/0_116_4000_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A child looks at campaign signage during an event for Representative Ann Kirkpatrick in Tuba City, Arizona on 13 August 2016.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A child looks at campaign signage during an event for Representative Ann Kirkpatrick in Tuba City, Arizona on 13 August 2016.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bloomberg/Bloomberg via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWhen I worked with Ann it was clear, she puts people over politics,\u201d said Jessica O\u2019Connell, a former campaign manager for Kirkpatrick and now the executive director of Emily\u2019s List, a group dedicated to electing pro-choice women that has endorsed the congresswoman. \u201cArizona voters aren\u2019t looking for labels \u2013 they\u2019re looking for a leader who will stand up for them and their values, and that\u2019s what Ann will do.\u201d</p> <p>A gun-owning Democrat and pro-choice Roman Catholic, Kirkpatrick blurs strict party and ideological lines. She also readily admits to voting for Arizona\u2019s maverick \u2013 once, in 1998. </p> <p>Kirkpatrick is also battle-tested from running four grueling congressional races in eight years. She currently represents a district larger than the state of Iowa and significantly more diverse, which her campaign says gives her an organizational edge.</p> <p>\u201cThe timeline says a lot about the type of person Ann is,\u201d said Michael Frias, Kirkpatrick\u2019s former chief of staff. \u201cShe made the decision to run before the Trump phenomenon ... To make a boxing analogy, she decided to take on the champ, she is not waiting for the champ to retire.\u201d</p> <h2>\u2022\u2022\u2022<br></h2> <p>Wearing moccasins and a large turquoise broach, Kirkpatrick zigzagged across the parade route, handing out campaign stickers and candy. She stopped often to chat with constituents, embracing those she knew personally. On more than one occasion the truck pulling her float paused for her to catch up.</p> <p>\u201cWe need fresh ideas!\u201d Kirkpatrick said into the microphone. \u201cFood stamps, general assistance, child care, Social Security, Access, Medicaid and Medicare, Indian health services funding, mental health services and tribal sovereignty. That\u2019s what this election is about. Ah\u00e9hee. Thank you.\u201d</p> <p>By contrast, McCain, wearing a Navy hat and a blazer, waved to the crowd from his campaign float, flanked by a security detail. Two Navajo code talkers rode with him. </p> <p>\u201cLook! It\u2019s John McCain,\u201d a woman squealed. He waved to her, and then turned to pose for a group taking his picture with their iPhones.</p> <p>Kirkpatrick readily admits her campaign\u2019s biggest challenge is to raise her public profile in the state. With less than 30 days to go before early voting begins , a new poll found 30.4% of likely Arizona voters did not know enough about Kirkpatrick to have an opinion of her. Only 7.8% of respondents said the same of McCain.</p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s been running for 15 months and she\u2019s just now running ads to introduce herself to voters,\u201d said Jim Waring, a former McCain aide and and a state GOP senator. \u201cWith just 30 days before voting starts, I don\u2019t see how you close that gap.\u201d</p> <p>Her campaign is running statewide ads and ramping up outreach in the metropolitan areas outside her district, mainly Phoenix and Tucson. One new ad tells the story of Kirkpatrick\u2019s cowboy boots, which she bought with the money she earned working as a waitress in college and still wears. The boots are part of her \u201cArizona First\u201d campaign message, meant to draw a contrast with McCain, who she said represents Washington.</p> <p>McCain\u2019s delicate dance with his party\u2019s nominee is Kirkpatrick\u2019s greatest line of attack, and she\u2019s on the offensive. <br></p> <p>\u201cThere was a time when McCain was a maverick and a straight talker,\u201d Kirkpatrick said, counting herself among those who once supported the senator. She said his refusal to denounce Trump, especially after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jul/19/donald-trump-john-mccain-vietnam-prisoner-of-war\">he questioned McCain\u2019s heroism in Vietnam</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/30/donald-trump-muslim-father-khizr-khan-democratic-convention-speech\">insulted a Gold Star family</a>, shows that 30-plus years in Washington has changed the man who built a reputation as someone who challenges party orthodoxy. The senator was captured and tortured as a prisoner of war.</p> <p>\u201cPeople can\u2019t believe he didn\u2019t stand up to Donald Trump when Donald Trump insulted him,\u201d Kirkpatrick said. \u201cPeople tell me, if he won\u2019t stand up for himself, he won\u2019t stand up for us.\u201d</p> <p>Democrats might be able to yoke some vulnerable Republican senators to Trump, but not McCain, says former Arizona senator Jon Kyl, a Republican who served alongside McCain. </p> <p>\u201cHis cake is pretty well baked,\u201d Kyl said of McCain\u2019s reputation in the state. \u201cThe big question \u2013 and the one that could make a difference \u2013 is whether Trump has an impact on who shows up to vote. \u201d</p> <p>Backlash to Trump has mobilized voter registration efforts in the state, especially among Latinos and young people who are more likely to register as Democrats or independents. Meanwhile, Clinton\u2019s campaign has sensed an opportunity to win the state for the first time in two decades. Her campaign recently opened two new field offices and is launching a six-figure ad-buy, while the DNC is <a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2016-election/dnc-expands-footprint-arizona-georgia-utah-n641611\">growing its presence</a> in the state as well.</p> <p>Since winning their primary last month, McCain\u2019s campaign has trained its fire on Kirkpatrick, labeling her \u201ctoo liberal for Arizona\u201d while pitching himself as the state\u2019s best check against a liberal administration. </p> <p>\u201cAlthough she has spent her three unremarkable terms in Congress siding with her party bosses at every opportunity, Arizonans either don\u2019t know her or don\u2019t support her record of serving as a rubber stamp for the liberal establishment,\u201d said Lorna Romero, a spokeswoman for McCain\u2019s campaign, in an email. </p> <p>But liberal isn\u2019t how Kirkpatrick\u2019s constituents view her, says Fred Solop, a political scientist with Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, though he noted that with a fundraising powerhouse and sky-high name recognition, McCain can certainly drive the narrative.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3f93e339e0d3b5271b28f5433fe21a5df431e9c2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3f93e339e0d3b5271b28f5433fe21a5df431e9c2/0_28_2048_1229/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ann Kirkpatrick at a Navajo Nation parade.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ann Kirkpatrick at a Navajo Nation parade.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of Ann Kirkpatrick</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cHer reputation in the district and her actual voting record are fairly moderate,\u201d Solop said. \u201cShe has worked across the aisle and has broken with the Obama camp on multiple occasions.\u201d </p> <p>From the sidelines of the parade route, Wilfred Segodi watched his children dive to catch the pieces of candy Kirkpatrick\u2019s team tossed as they passed.<br></p> <p>Segodi, a Democrat from Many Farms, Arizona, said he hadn\u2019t heard of Kirkpatrick before and planned to vote for McCain in November. </p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s been there the longest,\u201d Segodi said matter-of-factly. \u201cWe know we can count on him.\u201d </p> <p>On the opposite side of the road, Danita Ryan, of Flagstaff, cheered enthusiastically for Kirkpatrick\u2019s float. Ryan said she was especially motivated to vote this year because of Trump, who she finds dangerous and offensive.Despite not knowing much about the Democrat, Ryan said she plans to vote for Kirkpatrick for one simple reason.</p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s not John McCain,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cI think it\u2019s time for some new blood in Congress.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Meet the challenger</strong></h2> <p>Ann Kirkpatrick was born in 1950 in the small town of Whiteriver, part of the White Mountain Apache Indian Reservation in eastern Arizona. </p> <p>Though her family is not of Native American ancestry, her parents both found work in Whiteriver and decided to stay and raise a family there. Her father ran the local general store and her mother taught public school. </p> <p>\u201cI thought I was Apache for a long time,\u201d Kirkpatrick said. Like the other children in her town, Kirkpatrick learned to ride a horse and speak Apache. She later learned Navajo and Mandarin and is conversational in Spanish, French and Greek.</p> <p>Growing up, Kirkpatrick said she never dreamed one day she might become a lawyer or legislator \u2013 and certainly not a US senator. \u201cI wanted to have 12 kids and be a mom,\u201d Kirkpatrick said sheepishly. \u201cI was told that girls don\u2019t go to college.\u201d</p> <p>But Kirkpatrick did go to college, at the University of Arizona in Tucson, and after a brief interlude working as a teacher, she returned for law school. After graduation, Kirkpatrick she became Coconino County\u2019s deputy county attorney, the first woman to hold the position. It\u2019s a distinction that would have resonance if she wins in November.</p> <p>Despite electing four female governors, Arizona has never sent a woman to the Senate \u2013 a fact Kirkpatrick said didn\u2019t cross her mind until after she entered the race. </p> <p>\u201cMy husband and I were on a long drive and I said: \u2018Has there been a woman senator in Arizona?\u2019 And he said: \u2018Well, your question is your answer.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>In 2004, Kirkpatrick said she hadn\u2019t considered politics when a group of friends and community leaders invited her to lunch and encouraged her to run for the state legislature. </p> <p>\u201cI never had thought about running for office,\u201d Kirkpatrick said, but her friends persisted. </p> <p>\u201cThey said: \u2018We know your background, we think you can bridge both cultures, can you run?\u2019\u201d she said, adding with a noticeable hint of pride: \u201cNobody thought I\u2019d win, but I did.\u201d</p> <p>Kirkpatrick seems to like playing the underdog. </p> <p>\u201cAll my life I\u2019ve been told I can\u2019t do things and I\u2019ve overcome all those obstacles,\u201d Kirkpatrick said. </p> <p>In 2008, she won her first congressional race, becoming the US representative for her district. Two years later, she lost in a rough-and-tumble race against Republican challenger, Paul Gosar, the congressman who made national headlines when he boycotted Pope Francis\u2019s address to lawmakers last year. </p> <p>The district was redrawn, and Kirkpatrick ran again in 2012. She won that race and returned to Capitol Hill. Not long after, she and Gosar traded rivalry for camaraderie. Together they teamed up on a handful of bills and earned the <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2013/08/ann-kirkpatrick-paul-gosar-arizona-095651\">distinction</a> \u201coddest couple in Congress\u201d.</p> <p>In May 2015, Kirkpatrick surprised Arizona\u2019s political establishment when she announced she would challenge McCain in what would be his sixth and possibly last election.</p> <p>\u201cAnn loves Arizona \u2013 she is very kind and she\u2019s very warm,\u201d said Frias, her former chief of staff. \u201cBut anybody that doubts Ann\u2019s ability to stand up for herself and go toe to toe with anyone, including a sitting senator, is deeply underestimating her.\u201d</p>",

Within the same timeframe as the donations, the Republican-controlled legislature passed new laws making it much more difficult for victims of lead paint poisoning to sue NL Industries and other former lead paint manufacturers (the laws were later overturned in the federal courts).</p> <p>The John Doe files also provide new insight into the extensive efforts made by allies of Scott Walker to help a conservative member of the Wisconsin supreme court, David Prosser, hang onto his seat in a 2011 re-election. A network of like-minded groups and campaigners channeled $3.5m in undisclosed corporate funds to pay for TV and radio ads backing the judge.</p> <p>The push was seen as vital, the documents disclose, as a means of retaining the rightwing majority of the court and thereby preserving the anti-union measures introduced by Walker. \u201cIf we lose [Justice Prosser], the Walker agenda is toast,\u201d one ally writes in an email sent around to the governor\u2019s chief of staff and several conservative lobbyists.</p> <p>In 2015, Justice Prosser refused to recuse himself from a case in which the state supreme court sat in judgment over the John Doe investigation, despite the fact that the investigation focused on precisely the same network of lobbying groups and donors that had helped him hang onto his seat. The judge joined a majority of four conservative justices who voted to terminate the investigation and destroy all the documents now leaked to the Guardian.</p> <p>Prosser told the Guardian that four years had passed since his re-election before he joined the decision to close the John Doe investigation, over which time any potential conflict of interest had faded.</p> <p>The John Doe investigation was launched in 2012 after a set of recall elections that were forced on Walker and six Republican state senators in the wake of their hyper-partisan anti-union measure, Act 10. The prosecutors alleged that the governor\u2019s campaign committee had operated a coordinated network involving outside lobby groups through which unlimited amounts of corporate money could be channeled without public disclosure. </p> <p>Walker and the other parties who were the subjects of the John Doe investigation have all protested that they were unfairly accused of legal violations. They point out that no charges have been brought in the case, and that a succession of Wisconsin courts, including the state\u2019s highest, have cleared them of wrongdoing.</p> <p>Walker\u2019s campaign told the Guardian that the John Doe investigation was \u201cbaseless\u201d and had been shut down multiple times by the state courts. \u201cThere is absolutely no evidence of any wrongdoing,\u201d a spokesman said.</p> <p>The third-party lobbying groups that were the subject of the investigation said the prosecutors had accused wholly innocent individuals of crimes that did not exist under state law.

That could stand as an elegant catchphrase for the state of democracy in the US today, where elections are lost or won as much according to candidates\u2019 ability to attract corporate cash as by the strength of their leadership or ideas.</p> <p>The phrase is to be found within a batch of 1,500 pages of leaked documents obtained by the Guardian that are being published in their entirety for the first time. The cache consists of a stack of evidence gathered by official prosecutors in Wisconsin who were conducting what was called a \u201cJohn Doe investigation\u201d into suspected campaign finance violations by Walker\u2019s campaign and its network.</p> <p>The John Doe files published today open a door onto how modern US elections operate in the wake of Citizens United, the 2010 US supreme court ruling that unleashed a flood of corporate money into the political process. They speak to the mounting sense of public unease about the cosy relationship between politicians and big business, and to the frustration of millions of Americans who feel disenfranchised by an electoral system that put the needs of corporate donors before ordinary voters.</p> <p>The theme has become a rallying cry in the US presidential election. Bernie Sanders accused politicians \u2013 not least his Democratic rival [Hillary Clinton](http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/mar/6/bernie-sanders-slams-hillary-clintons-wall-street-/) \u2013 of selling themselves to Wall Street and special interests.<br></p> <p>Donald Trump went further, brazenly using himself as an example of a billionaire who has put politicians in his pocket. \u201cWhen you give to them,\u201d [he said](http://www.vox.com/2015/8/6/9114565/donald-trump-debate-money) in a confessional tone during a televised Republican debate in the run-up to the primaries, \u201cthey do whatever the hell you want them to do.\u201d</p> <p>According to the independent monitoring group, the Center for Responsive Politics, [$2bn of corporate cash](http://www.opensecrets.org/overview/blio.php) has been lavished on the presidential race so far. It\u2019s a bewildering figure, but it only tells us so much about how the new American democracy works in practice, because so much of that largesse is shrouded in secrecy.</p> <p>Donors are often undisclosed, campaign finance laws are [notoriously complicated](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2013/05/17/the-impossibly-complex-world-of-campaign-finance-in-1-chart/), and scrutiny by electoral authorities is rare, prosecutions even rarer. When official investigations are launched, they often flounder before reaching a conclusion and virtually never have the chance to reveal their findings to the public. </p> <p>It is into that dark and obscure post-Citizens United world that the John Doe files leaked to the Guardian land. These are the documents that some of the most powerful judges in the country tried to stop the public from ever seeing. </p> <p>In July 2015 the state\u2019s highest court, the supreme court of Wisconsin, terminated the John Doe investigation before any charges were brought. The [conservative majority of the court ruled](https://www.wicourts.gov/sc/opinion/DisplayDocument.pdf?content=pdf&amp;seqNo=144525) that the prosecutors had made a basic misreading of campaign finance law and targeted individuals who were \u201cwholly innocent of any wrongdoing\u201d. </p> <p>In a contentious twist to the ruling, the justices ordered the prosecutors to \u201cpermanently destroy all copies of information and other materials obtained through the investigation\u201d. </p> <p>This latter-day equivalent of a book burning could have condemned the John Doe investigation into permanent oblivion, leaving voters none the wiser. But at least one copy of the evidence gathered by the prosecutors survived the bonfire, and have now been leaked to the Guardian.</p> <p>Snippets of the documents have already seen the light of day, [quoted in legal filings](http://archive.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/walker-wanted-funds-sent-to-wisconsin-club-for-growth-b99336519z1-272364371.html), some of which were mistakenly posted to an official website. But the Guardian\u2019s documents \u2013 consisting of email exchanges between Walker, his advisers, Republican leaders and major donors who included none other than Trump himself, together with court filings held under seal \u2013 amount to a rich chronicle of the electoral health of the United States in the wake of Citizens United.<br></p> <p>They also form the substance of a case currently before the US supreme court, which has been [petitioned](http://www.prwatch.org/files/2015-04-29_cert_petition_redacted.pdf) by the Wisconsin prosecutors in an appeal against the decision to shut down their investigation. The nation\u2019s highest judicial panel is expected to announce within days whether or not it will take the case.</p> <p>At the heart of the John Doe files is Scott Walker, the governor who shot to national prominence \u2013 a hero for conservatives, pariah for liberals \u2013 soon after taking office in February 2011 when he introduced the hyper-partisan [Act 10](http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2011/02/wisconsin_assemblys_sneaky_mov.html). The legislation instantly made Wisconsin the battleground state in the fight between boardroom might and union muscle.</p> <p>The state capital Madison erupted in weeks of protests in which the legislative building was overrun with [thousands of protesters](http://www.nbcnews.com/id/42047717/ns/politics-more_politics/t/tens-thousands-pro-labor-rally-wisconsin/). Democratic lawmakers [fled the state](http://archive.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/116381289.html) and took up residence in neighboring Illinois in a failed attempt to foil Walker\u2019s plans.<br></p> <p>In the fallout of Act 10, progressive groups retaliated by dragging Walker and several other Republicans through a series of bitter recall elections. Six GOP senators were forced to defend their seats in 2011, and Walker himself was put through the [recall furnace](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-wisconsin-recall-idUSBRE82T1FV20120330) in 2012.</p> <p>Those recall elections, and the question of whether Walker flouted campaign finance regulations in order that he and other Republican politicians could stay in office and preserve their anti-union legislation, were the focus of the investigation that generated the files now leaked to the Guardian. It was run by five Wisconsin prosecutors, led by Francis Schmitz, a former federal counter-terrorism expert.</p> <p>It was known as a John Doe investigation because, much like a grand jury, its subjects were kept anonymous while officials weighed whether or not to press charges. In this case, prosecutors alleged that there was evidence to indicate that Walker and his team of advisers and associates had set up a coordinated effort with lobbyists and major donors to swing elections by secretly pouring huge amounts of corporate cash into the races. </p> <p>The money was channeled through a third-party group, the DAs alleged, in order to circumvent state and federal rules that set limits on political contributions and require them to be publicly revealed. </p> <p>The documents show the governor and his fundraising team going after, and receiving cash from, many of the most prominent rightwing donors in the country. In addition to [Adelson](http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3105984-2012-08-14-Exhibits-01-100-PT1.html#document/p74/a317508 \u201cGuardian\u201d), there was business magnate Carl Icahn who was [approached for $100,000](http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3105985-2012-08-14-Exhibits-01-100-PT2.html#document/p4/a317509 \u201cGuardian\u201d) though nothing in the files indicates that he donated; the hedge-fund billionaire Stephen Cohen, who [arranged a wire transfer of $1m](http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3105984-2012-08-14-Exhibits-01-100-PT1.html#document/p98/a317510 \u201cGuardian\u201d); and Home Depot co-founder Ken Langone who [gave $25,000](http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3105985-2012-08-14-Exhibits-01-100-PT2.html#document/p13/a317512 \u201cGuardian\u201d).</p> <p>Paul Singer, hedge-fund manager and chairman of the Manhattan Institute, also crops up in the documents. Three months before Walker\u2019s recall election, Singer attended a forum of business leaders held by the American Enterprise Institute in a luxury resort off the coast of Georgia.</p> <p>Walker was also there, arriving at the resort armed with a to-do list from his chief fundraiser Kate Doner. It bore the pithy command: [\u201cPaul Singer: Grab him\u201d.](http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3105984-2012-08-14-Exhibits-01-100-PT1.html#document/p93/a317513 \u201cGuardian\u201d)</p> <p>The governor presumably did as he was told. Two months later a check from Singer was [banked for $250,000](http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3105985-2012-08-14-Exhibits-01-100-PT2.html#document/p133/a317515 \u201cGuardian\u201d). </p> <p>What particularly caught the attention of the prosecutors was that when the money came in it did not go directly to Walker\u2019s personal campaign committee, Friends of Scott Walker. To do so would have been problematic, as any campaign committee directly linked to a candidate is limited in Wisconsin to accepting contributions of up to $43,000 that have to be fully disclosed. </p> <p>The prosecutors alleged in [court filings](http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3105201-2014-02-21-Schmitz-Memo.html#document/p14/a317779, \u201cGuardian\u201d) published here for the first time that Walker\u2019s campaign found a way around these restrictions by banking the corporate cash through the third-party group, Wisconsin Club for Growth. [WCfG](http://wicfg.com/) describes itself as a \u201cpro-liberty, pro-fiscal restraint\u201d organisation, sharing the same small government and anti-union ideology as Walker. It is a tax-exempt group, or 501 (c) (4), that is supposed to be primarily concerned with \u201csocial welfare\u201d rather than partisan politics and as such is not obliged to reveal its donors.</p> <p>In court submissions, the prosecutors alleged that Walker\u2019s campaign used WCfG as a shadow committee that allowed him to solicit large sums of corporate cash without scrutiny or accountability. \u201cContributions were personally solicited by Governor Scott Walker to WCfG ... in order to circumvent the reporting and contributions provisions of Wisconsin statutes,\u201d an investigator working for the [prosecutors in the John Doe investigation, Robert Stelter, alleged.](http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3105192-2013-08-29-Schmitz-Affidavit.html#document/p77/a317542 \u201cGuardian\u201d)</p> <p>A good example of the way things worked was the donation made by Donald Trump. On 3 April 2012, two months before the governor faced the electorate, Walker flew to New York for a rapid-fire string of fundraising meetings with big money interests.</p> <p>He travelled the length of Fifth Avenue in Manhattan, making stops at the investment bank Morgan Stanley, a hedge fund, a corporate law firm, and the residence of publishing tycoon Steve Forbes. He also [enjoyed a 45-minute audience with Trump](http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3105985-2012-08-14-Exhibits-01-100-PT2.html#document/p9/a317522 \u201cGuardian\u201d) in his Fifth Avenue lair.</p> <p>There is no record of the conversation between the two men. But it appears to have been a warm encounter, as the John Doe files show that Trump [wrote a check for $15,000](http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3105985-2012-08-14-Exhibits-01-100-PT2.html#document/p11/a317523 \u201cGuardian\u201d) on the same day. Who was the beneficiary of Trump\u2019s generosity? Wisconsin Club for Growth.</p> <p>Another example of the pattern is the casual comment Walker dropped into an email to his fundraiser dated 14 June 2011: [\u201cAlso, I got $1m from John Menard today\u201d.](http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3105980-Fundraising-Coordination.html#document/p8 \u201cGuardian\u201d) Eight days later [a check for $1m](http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3105984-2012-08-14-Exhibits-01-100-PT1.html#document/p53/a317694 \u201cGuardian\u201d) is cut on a corporate check of Menard Inc, the billionaire John Menard\u2019s home improvement chain Menards, and made out not to the governor\u2019s campaign committee but to Wisconsin Club for Growth. There the donation remained a secret until the publication of the Guardian\u2019s leaked files.</p> <p>Friends of Scott Walker, Wisconsin Club for Growth and other parties named in the John Doe investigation have all vigorously denied any legal violations. They point out that no charges have been brought against any subject of the inquiries.</p> <p>John Fadness, spokesman for the Scott Walker campaign, told the Guardian: \u201cAs widely reported two years ago, the prosecutor\u2019s attorney stated that Governor Walker was not a target. Several courts shut down the baseless investigation on multiple occasions, and there is absolutely no evidence of any wrongdoing.\u201d </p> <p>In June 2014, the special prosecutor Schmitz [said through a lawyer](http://host.madison.com/wsj/news/local/govt-and-politics/scott-walker-not-a-target-john-doe-special-prosecutor-says/article_9d5579ed-039d-5f22-ac98-947469c3c22d.html) that Walker was not a target of his John Doe investigation. Yet legal documents contained in the John Doe files identify as the anonymous [\u201cMovant No. 1\u201d](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3105199-2014-2-21-Schmitz-Affidavit.html#document/p15 \u201cGuardian\u201d) of the investigation \u201cFriends of Scott Walker, the personal campaign committee of Scott Walker.\u201d </p> <p>David Rivkin, the attorney representing Wisconsin Club for Growth and its director Eric O\u2019Keefe, said in a statement to the Guardian: \u201cAs the Wisconsin Supreme Court explained, the John Doe prosecutors made up crimes \u2018that do not exist\u2019 under Wisconsin law in order to target \u2018citizens who were wholly innocent of any wrongdoing.\u2019 Because the U.S. Supreme Court does not review matters of state law, it should be obvious that the John Doe prosecutors\u2019 appeal is legally frivolous and just another publicity stunt intended to tarnish their targets\u2019 reputations and salvage their own.\u201d</p> <p>Further insight into the position of the subjects of the investigation \u2013 the \u201cmovants\u201d as they are technically known \u2013 is given in court papers including in the Guardian\u2019s [John Doe Files.](http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3105213-WICFG-Motion-Quash.html \u201cGuardian\u201d) They criticise the prosecutors for making fundamental mistakes in their reading of campaign finance law. They said that regulatory restrictions on the size and source of donations only applied to groups that were expressly advocating for or against a named political candidate.</p> <p>WCfG\u2019s director Eric O\u2019Keefe [said in an affidavit](http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3105216-WICFG-Quash-Aff.html \u201cGuardian\u201d) that the club\u2019s involvement had stemmed purely from its commitment to \u201cadvancing liberty and fiscal responsibility\u201d. Its role in the recall elections was \u201cto educate Wisconsin citizens ... The Club paid for advertisements that advanced its pro-liberty, fiscal responsibility, pro-Act 10 beliefs. None of the advertisements expressly urged voters to vote for or against any candidate.\u201d</p> <p>The movants also complained that in issuing over-broad subpoenas for evidence and conducting [pre-dawn raids](http://www.nationalreview.com/article/417155/wisonsins-shame-i-thought-it-was-home-invasion-david-french) on the homes of some individuals, the prosecutors strayed well beyond their legitimate powers and into the realm of governmental abuse.</p> <p>In the course of the John Doe investigation, the prosecutors obtained hundreds of emails and bank records under subpoena. An email sent by Kate Doner, Walker\u2019s fundraiser, in April 2011, summed up the strategy. She said the aim was to raise $9m in six weeks, to pay for political advertising \u2013 she called it \u201cissue advocacy efforts\u201d \u2013 in the senatorial recall races. </p> <p>Walker, she said, wants all the ads [\u201crun thru one group to ensure correct messaging\u201d,](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3105984-2012-08-14-Exhibits-01-100-PT1.html#document/p33 \u201cGuardian\u201d) and that group, the governor declared, should be Wisconsin Club for Growth. \u201cThe Governor is encouraging all to invest in the Wisconsin Club for Growth [which] can accept Corporate and Personal donations without limitations and no donors disclosure.\u201d</p> <p>The email trail shows a pattern of behavior developing: Walker meets up with big corporate donors and encourages them to contribute unlimited sums of money through WCfG in secret, then shortly after the checks start to flow. In June 2011, the emails show, the governor had dinner with the CEO of the largest privately owned trucking company in the US, Schneider National, in the hope of getting him and his peers to donate $250,000. </p> <p>\u201cStress the donations to WiCFG are not disclosed and can accept Corporate donations without limits,\u201d [Walker\u2019s talking points said.](http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3105984-2012-08-14-Exhibits-01-100-PT1.html#document/p42/a317530 \u201cGuardian\u201d)</p> <p>Two checks are recorded in the John Doe files from Schneider, [both made out to WCfG and totalling $65,000](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3105164-Corporate-Checks-Sanitized.html#document/p1 \u201cGuardian\u201d).</p> <p>The Schneider checks, like several others included in the files, were cut on corporate checks in the name of the company itself. It has long been a rule under [Wisconsin state law](https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/statutes/statutes/11/XI/1112), commonly known as the \u201ccorporate ban\u201d, that corporations are not allowed to make direct political donations; they are only allowed to fund third-party groups that have to be fully independent of candidates, or spend money themselves on political TV advertising so long as the expenditure is declared.</p> <p>Some of those checks are published by the Guardian today, redacted to remove bank numbers. The Guardian has also redacted other documents in the files to remove personal information such as cellphone numbers and private home addresses. Personal email addresses have also been redacted unless they have already been put into the public domain, as in the case of Scott Walker\u2019s own [personal email address](http://watchdog.org/244820/scott-fitzgerald-john-doe-conservatives/). </p> <p>The John Doe files reveal that Walker\u2019s own advisers reached the conclusion that the large sums flowing into WCfG\u2019s coffers from corporate donors was critical to the survival of the Republican senators in their recall elections. In a memo sent to Walker shortly after the elections in August 2011, his former top campaign consultant RJ Johnson looked back on the contest and ruminated that \u201cOur efforts were run by Wisconsin Club for Growth ... who coordinated spending through 12 different groups. Most spending by other groups was directly funded by grants from the Club.\u201d</p> <p>He went on to note that WCfG \u201craised 12 million dollars and ran a soup to nuts campaign ... Polling, focus groups and message development was a collaborative effort.\u201d A mass of micro-targeted mail-outs and TV advertising that was bought with the donations had the impact that they [\u201cmoved independent swing voters to the GOP candidate\u201d.](http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3105984-2012-08-14-Exhibits-01-100-PT1.html#document/p56/a317535 \u201cGuardian\u201d)</p> <p>The collaboration set up in 2011 was successful in helping four of the six Republican senators fend off the recall challenge and keep their jobs \u2013 allowing them to hang onto their senate majority by one vote. Act 10 was safeguarded for the moment, and in a gesture of gratitude Walker himself was moved to ask an aide shortly after the vote: [\u201cDid I send out thank you notes to all of our c(4) donors?\u201d](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3105983-2013-09-16-Exhibits-41.html#document/p129 \u201cGuardian\u201d) </p> <p>Supporters of Governor Walker and the outside groups that worked with him, including some prominent media outlets such as the [Wall Street Journal](http://www.wsj.com/articles/hyperventilating-in-wisconsin-over-scott-walkers-fund-raising-1408920214), argue that the prosecutors were mistaken in their view that the coordinated activities amounted to a violation of campaign finance law. They point out that nobody in the governor\u2019s circle has been charged with any alleged violation relating to the recall elections, and argue that WCfG and the other outside groups engaged in advocacy over issues related to the elections, which is not subject to restrictions, as opposed to express advocacy on behalf of one political candidate or another. </p> <p>They also insist, using a complex formula related to the electoral calendar, that Walker only became an official candidate on 9 April 2012. Any actions he and his associates took before then were not subject to restrictions, [they argued](http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3105212-FOSW-Notice-Appear.html#document/p10, \u201cGuardian\u201d). To which the prosecutors replied that Walker\u2019s campaign committee had been frantically fundraising and coordinating long before that date.</p> <p>The John Doe files do contain some evidence that Walker\u2019s senior team attempted to maintain a firewall between candidate and outside interests after that date. On 19 April, the lead adviser to the governor\u2019s recall campaign, Keith Gilkes, replied to a group of businesses wanting to put up billboards supporting Walker\u2019s candidacy: \u201cI cannot have any comment on this \u2013 it is an [independent expenditure](http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3105981-Ad-Coordination.html#document/p40/a317537, \u201cGuardian\u201d) separate from the campaign.\u201d</p> <p>But the files also contain documents that show that RJ Johnson, a prominent political strategist in Wisconsin who worked closely with Walker for many years, and Johnson\u2019s business partner Deborah Jordahl, were simultaneously arranging political ad spending on TV and radio for both Walker\u2019s campaign and the outside lobbying groups. On 23 April 2012 [Johnson emailed Gilkes](http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3105985-2012-08-14-Exhibits-01-100-PT2.html#document/p45/a317539, \u201cGuardian\u201d) about a Walker ad that he was putting out for the recall election; a week later [Johnson and Jordahl were emailing](http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3105985-2012-08-14-Exhibits-01-100-PT2.html#document/p47/a317540, \u201cGuardian\u201d) each other about radio ad spending on behalf of Wisconsin Club for Growth.</p> <p>That lead the special prosecutor, Francis Schmitz, to conclude that \u201ca review of email reflects that RJ Johnson ... [was involved](http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3105192-2013-08-29-Schmitz-Affidavit.html#document/p99/a317541, \u201cGuardian\u201d) in the media buys on behalf of Wisconsin Club for Growth and Friends of Scott Walker.\u201d</p> <p>Neither RJ Johnson nor Deborah Jordahl immediately responded to requests for comment.</p> <p>Until the US supreme court indicates later this month whether or not it will intervene in the John Doe case, the question of the legality of the Walker network and the coordination that it involved will hang in the balance. The Wisconsin supreme court was firm on the issue: in its [July 2015 ruling](https://www.wicourts.gov/sc/opinion/DisplayDocument.pdf?content=pdf&amp;amp;seqNo=144525), the court castigated Schmitz for instigating a \u201cperfect storm of wrongs that was visited upon the innocent Unnamed Movants and those who dared to associate with them.\u201d</p> <p>In colorful language, the state\u2019s highest court praised Walker, WCfG and other movants in the investigation (it didn\u2019t name them, but [their identities](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3105199-2014-2-21-Schmitz-Affidavit.html#document/p15/a317721, \u201cGuardian\u201d) are self-evident from the John Doe files as \u201cbrave individuals\u201d. It said they had \u201cplayed a crucial role in presenting this court with an opportunity to re-endorse its commitment to upholding the fundamental right of each and every citizen to engage in lawful political activity and to do so free from the fear of the tyrannical retribution of arbitrary or capricious governmental prosecution.\u201d</p> <p>For good measure, the court added: \u201cLet one point be clear: our conclusion today ends this unconstitutional John Doe investigation.\u201d</p> <p>That point is certainly clear, unless the US supreme court, which has the final say in any matter of constitutional law, decides otherwise. The nation\u2019s highest court has been asked to take the prosecutors\u2019 petition by an alliance of campaign-finance monitoring groups, the Center for Media and Democracy, the Brennan Center and Common Cause.</p> <p>In their petition, the prosecutors ask the US supreme court justices to consider whether Wisconsin\u2019s top judicial panel was truly objective in reaching its decision to shut them down. \u201cIs the state as a litigant in an adversary proceeding entitled to a hearing before a panel of impartial justices, free of bias?\u201d, the prosecutors ask. </p> <p>Protecting Walker\u2019s agenda</p> <p>The John Doe files obtained by the Guardian give clues as to why the prosecutors have raised doubts about impartiality in the state courts. They suggest that two of the conservative judges on Wisconsin\u2019s top court who voted to halt the John Doe investigation may have themselves been intimately connected to the same campaigning network of rightwing politicians, lobbyists and major donors that the prosecutors were investigating.</p> <p>Take David Prosser. He was one of the four conservative judges who approved the [July 2015 ruling](https://www.wicourts.gov/sc/opinion/DisplayDocument.pdf?content=pdf&amp;amp;seqNo=144525) that terminated the John Doe investigation, sacked Schmitz from his position as special prosecutor and ordered the destruction of all the documents that had been collected (later that order was softened a little to a demand that the prosecutors hand in all the documents to the court which would keep them secret under seal). </p> <p>At precisely the same time as the six Republican senators were embroiled in their recall election, Prosser was in his own electoral fight for survival. He was up for re-election in April 2011 and facing a tough challenge from JoAnne Kloppenburg, then Wisconsin\u2019s assistant attorney general. The Prosser election and the recall election were intertwined in that Kloppenburg was attempting to turn her battle against Prosser into a [referendum on Governor Walker\u2019s](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/05/us/politics/05wisconsin.html) anti-union legislation, Act 10.</p> <p>Among the leaked John Doe files that the Wisconsin supreme court ordered to be suppressed are documents that underline how anxious Walker\u2019s circle were about the threat, as they saw it, to the court\u2019s conservative majority. In an email dated 14 December 2010, WCfG\u2019s director Eric O\u2019Keefe says he\u2019s been [in touch with Diane Hendricks](http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3105984-2012-08-14-Exhibits-01-100-PT1.html#document/p14/a317543, \u201cGuardian\u201d), the owner of a roofing company who Forbes describes as America\u2019s richest self-made woman with a personal fortune of $5bn. Hendricks is a well-known funder of rightwing causes and individuals, among them Scott Walker himself who she was to go on to support with [$500,000](http://archive.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/in-film-walker-talks-of-divide-and-conquer-strategy-with-unions-8o57h6f-151049555.html) in 2012 for his own recall election.</p> <p>Hendricks has also popped up as part of the Donald Trump presidential campaign. Trump recently added [her to his inner team](http://www.forbes.com/sites/clareoconnor/2016/08/11/trump-adds-richest-self-made-woman-diane-hendricks-to-economic-advisory-team/#29c3bf15392c) of economic advisers, having come under fire for only appointing men.</p> <p>[\u201cI have traded emails with diane hendricks,\u201d](http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3105984-2012-08-14-Exhibits-01-100-PT1.html#document/p14/a317543, \u201cGuardian\u201d) O\u2019Keefe says in the email. \u201cShe is concerned about the state s. Ct.\u201d </p> <p>Hendricks was right to be concerned about the state supreme court. Were Prosser to lose the vote, the consequences for Walker and his entire rightwing union-bashing agenda would have been devastating. The four-to-three, conservative-to-liberal, balance of the state\u2019s top court would have been reversed, allowing progressive groups to overturn the reforms through legal challenges.</p> <p>The correspondence reveals how Walker\u2019s network of associates vowed to go to work to keep Prosser in his job, and thus preserve (or \u201cmaintain\u201d) the court\u2019s conservative upper hand. \u201cIt would be good for [Hendricks] to [talk with us or have her see our plan,\u201d](http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3105984-2012-08-14-Exhibits-01-100-PT1.html#document/p14/a317544, \u201cGuardian\u201d) writes RJ Johnson, the then \u201cgeneral consultant\u201d to Governor Walker\u2019s campaign committee.

Thus far I have [raised 450k](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3105984-2012-08-14-Exhibits-01-100-PT1.html#document/p14/a317544, \u201cGuardian\u201d) and am looking to raise an additional 409k.\u201d</p> <p>Johnson name-checks other [sources of big money donations](http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3105984-2012-08-14-Exhibits-01-100-PT1.html#document/p14/a317544, \u201cGuardian\u201d) that he intends to tap. Leo Leonard of the conservative legal group the Federalist Society was looking for an extra $200,000, he says, and there were hopes for a further $1m from the US Chamber of Commerce. </p> <p>He wasn\u2019t bragging. As election day approached, money from rightwing lobby groups and corporations began to pour into Wisconsin, unseen by the public, as the message got out that Prosser\u2019s salvation was a necessary step to safeguarding Walker\u2019s radical rightwing reforms and Act 10.</p> <p>An email from March 2011, just two months after Walker took office as governor and a month before Prosser was tested at the polls, makes the point. It\u2019s from Matt Seaholm, state director of Americans For Prosperity (AFP), the Tea Party-affiliated group founded and funded by the billionaire rightwing Koch brothers. </p> <p>By now the anxiety surrounding the fate of the Wisconsin supreme court judge, David Prosser, is growing more intense. \u201cThis could stop everything that Walker is trying to accomplish and [the unions] know it. Goes without saying, that would be a bad thing,\u201d [Seaholm says](http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3105950-Strategy-Coordination.html#document/p7/a317545, \u201cGuardian\u201d), writing to Tim Phillips, AFP\u2019s national president. </p> <p>By 20 March, two weeks before the election, worry is distilling into panic. Brian Fraley of the Wisconsin-based conservative think-tank the MacIver Institute, shoots an impassioned plea for help to what he calls his \u201cgroup\u201d of like-minded lobbying groups and individuals, forwarded to Walker\u2019s chief of staff and other top advisers in Madison.</p> <p>[\u201cDavid Prosser is in trouble,\u201d](http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3105957-Prosser.html#document/p6/a317546, \u201cGuardian\u201d) Fraley begins. \u201cAnd if we lose him, the Walker agenda is toast, as could be the Senate GOP majority and any successes creating a new redistricted map. That\u2019s not hyperbole.\u201d </p> <p>By the end of the bitter campaign, some $3.5m was spent by outside lobby groups channeling undisclosed corporate money to support Prosser\u2019s re-election \u2013 more than eight times the $400,000 the judge was allowed to spend himself. That included $1.5m from WCfG and its offshoot Citizens for a Strong America, and $2m from Wisconsin Manufacturers &amp; Commerce (WMC), all of it in unaccountable \u201cdark money\u201d.</p> <p>It worked. [Prosser was re-elected](http://archive.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/122364728.html), with a squeaky-tight margin of just 7,000 votes and after a fraught recount. The following month, Walker boasted to the Republican kingmaker, Karl Rove, \u201cClub for Growth\u2013Wisconsin was the [key to retaining Justice Prosser](http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3105957-Prosser.html#document/p18/a317547, \u201cGuardian\u201d). </p> <p>Act 10 was safe.</p> <p>Both of the two outside groups that channeled the recall election money (WCfG and WMC) are named as \u201cmovants\u201d of the John Doe criminal investigation into alleged campaign finance violations that was shut down under the court ruling that Prosser, having won re-election in no small part with their help, joined. Yet when it was suggested to Prosser and a second conservative judge on the court, Justice Michael Gableman, that they should recuse themselves from deliberations in the case, they both [refused](http://archive.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/david-prosser-says-he-doesnt-need-to-step-aside-in-walker-probe-b99547465z1-319731971.html).</p> <p>In their [petition](http://www.prwatch.org/files/2015-04-29_cert_petition_redacted.pdf) to the US supreme court, the prosecutors challenge that refusal, arguing that \u201cthe special prosecutor did not receive a fair and impartial hearing\u201d. The petitioners go on to discuss Prosser in detail, but the passage is so heavily redacted that their argument is obscured. [They do say](http://www.prwatch.org/files/2015-04-29_cert_petition_redacted.pdf) at one point, quoting constitutional law, that \u201cNo jurist \u2018can be a judge in his own case or be permitted to try cases where he has an interest in the outcome\u2019.\u201d </p> <p>Prosser declined to step aside citing a rule change that had been suggested and partially written by WMC itself. The change removed the obligation of supreme court judges in Wisconsin to recuse themselves in cases involving groups that had helped them secure their own elections.</p> <p>Kurt Bauer, WMC\u2019s president and CEO, declined to comment on the John Doe proceedings. But he stressed that the organization\u2019s \u201cgrassroots lobbying activities are conducted carefully within both the letter and the spirit of the state law. WMC strongly disputes any allegations of wrongdoing and will vigorously defend itself against such allegations.\u201d</p> <p>Bauer added that WMC was an independent group that was not controlled by any candidate or candidate\u2019s campaign. \u201cWMC will not allow itself to be silenced from commenting about public officials and public policy. WMC has long been a proponent of the First Amendment and has a history of fighting to protect its ability to publicly express its views. WMC maintains that commitment to protecting its right to express a point of view on public policy, public officials and candidates for office as well as protecting the confidentiality of its donors.\u201d</p> <p>In a telephone interview with the Guardian, Prosser, who retired from the state supreme court in July, said that in his view sufficient time had passed between his re-election in 2011 and the judgment in the John Doe case in 2015 for any potential conflict of interest to fade. \u201cIf this had been a year after the contributions I think I would have had to withdraw, but it was four years. There was no expectation on the part of recipient or givers that the contributions were designed to effect litigation, and so the contributions raised no questions whatsoever.\u201d</p> <p>Prosser said that at the time of his re-election he was facing hostile TV ads that falsely tried to link him to Walker\u2019s contentious anti-union legislation Act 10, while he himself was unable directly to solicit large amounts of campaign contributions under new strict fundraising limits imposed by an earlier Democratic-controlled legislature. \u201cI certainly expected Wisconsin Manufacturers &amp; Commerce sooner or later to put some money into my campaign. Of course I was going to hope that somebody would come in and defend me because I was unable to defend myself.\u201d</p> <p>But the judge stressed that the only spending involved came from \u201cthird parties in which no one on my campaign knew they were coming, didn\u2019t ask for them, and frankly if they hadn\u2019t come I would have been blown out of the water by false advertising\u201d.</p> <p>Last year Prosser issued a [12-page justification](http://media.jrn.com/documents/prosserrecusal.pdf) of his refusal to recuse himself from the John Doe case. In it, he made reference to an email from an \u201cUnnamed Petitioner\u201d that discussed raising money for a campaign \u201cto maintain the Court\u201d. The judge said the comment was \u201clittle more than evidence of the fact that some targets of the investigation ... engaged in expenditures that, under all the circumstances, were very valuable to my campaign.\u201d </p> <p>Just two weeks before writing that sentence, Judge Prosser had approved the court ruling that ordered the destruction of the John Doe files, among which was to be found the very same email to which he referred. The Guardian now publishes that [full email](http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3105984-2012-08-14-Exhibits-01-100-PT1.html#document/p14, \u201cGuardian\u201d) for the first time, and as a result the identity of the anonymous \u201cUnnamed Petitioner\u201d who vowed to \u201cmaintain the Court\u201d can be revealed: RJ Johnson, \u201cgeneral consultant\u201d to the governor of Wisconsin, Scott Walker.</p> <p>Why it matters</p> <p>So why should we care about today\u2019s fiendishly complicated ways of funding elections? After all, isn\u2019t it a cornerstone of American democracy that everybody should be able to express themselves, under the first amendment right of free speech, after which the American people gets to have the final say at the ballot box?</p> <p>One area of possible concern raised by the John Doe files chimes with the anger and disgruntlement of voters that Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders have so powerfully articulated in the presidential race. If money channels are set up in secret to allow corporations and the super-wealthy to inject vast amounts of undisclosed cash into political races, the level playing field can be distorted to the benefit of corporate-friendly candidates and to the disadvantage of those representing ordinary voters.</p> <p>By the end of Scott Walker\u2019s recall election, some [$81m overall](http://www.wisdc.org/pr072512.php) was spent on the battle \u2013 equivalent to $23 for every registered voter in the state. The governor and other Republican groups and committees invested $58.7m, while his Democratic rival and supporters were only able to muster less than half that amount, $21.9m. </p> <p>\u201cThe sheer increased volume of corporate money that has been brought into elections in recent years may go more on one side than the other,\u201d explained Richard Briffault, a professor specialising in campaign finance law at Columbia law school. \u201cCorporations tend to lean more Republican.\u201d</p> <p>Briffault added that the proliferation in the modern era of outside \u201csocial welfare\u201d 501 (c) (4) organisations \u2013 the tax-exempt status enjoyed by Wisconsin Club for Growth \u2013 also raised the possibility that political donations would go hidden. As tax-exempt groups that are supposed not to be primarily political in their orientation, they do not have to disclose their donors.</p> <p>\u201cThat can be a very good device for hiding the participation of wealthy individuals,\u201d Briffault said.</p> <p>The other great anxiety addressed by campaign finance regulations is the potential for corruption. The US supreme court has said in rulings going back decades that the first amendment right to free speech is tempered by the need to protect against cash-for-favors. The court has repeatedly stated that elected officials must avoid not only the reality of corruption in their dealings with donors, but also any appearance of corruption, because even a suggestion that dollars might have been exchanged for political favors has the ability to undermine public faith in democracy.</p> <p>The justices use the legalistic phrase: quid pro quo. Literally that means \u201cthis for that\u201d; colloquially, it\u2019s the idea that if you scratch my back, I\u2019ll scratch yours.</p> <p>Paradoxically, one of the most robust statements made by the US supreme court justices about the dangers of real or apparent quid pro quo was made in [Citizens United](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;amp;rct=j&amp;amp;q=&amp;amp;esrc=s&amp;amp;source=web&amp;amp;cd=1&amp;amp;ved=0ahUKEwjBgsCF8enOAhUBLhQKHYnsBJAQFggeMAA&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.supremecourt.gov%2Fopinions%2F09pdf%2F08-205.pdf&amp;amp;usg=AFQjCNF2hn4fN946L-Ma8WV0AHhWPW0oKQ&amp;amp;sig2=-JV0qIhMiqsYCaGDRth_wg&amp;amp;cad=rja), their highly contentious 2010 ruling. [Citizens United](https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/pdf/08-205P.ZO) extended to for-profit corporations and labor unions the same first amendments rights to engage in elections that had hitherto been enjoyed by individuals. </p> <p>Corporations were essentially treated for the first time as though they were people. Together with the related ruling in [Speechnow.org](http://www.fec.gov/law/litigation/speechnow.shtml), the supreme court paved the way for the creation of Super Pacs that can make unlimited spending on political advertising to help their preferred candidates into office.</p> <p>What is less well known about Citizens United is that in it, Justice Anthony Kennedy, who wrote the opinion, addressed head-on the fear that unlimited corporate cash would lead to an explosion in real or perceived corruption in the political system. He stated forcefully that there was no danger of corruption if one important condition was met: that corporations kept their distance from the candidates they were supporting and remained fully independent of the candidates\u2019 campaigns.</p> <p>\u201cBy definition,\u201d Kennedy wrote, \u201can independent expenditure is political speech presented to the electorate that is not coordinated with a candidate.\u201d Such separation was necessary, he added, to avoid the risk that unlimited secret donations are given \u201cas a quid pro quo for improper commitments from the candidate\u201d.</p> <p>The problem is that the US supreme court has never defined in detail what precisely it means by \u201ccoordination\u201d between a candidate\u2019s campaign and outside groups, preferring to leave the fine print to lower courts and state legislatures. Most of the legal emphasis on coordination is on actual spending on political TV and radio ads, while the other end of the money chain \u2013 fundraising by candidates from big corporate donors channeled through third-party \u201cdark money\u201d groups that do not have to disclose their sources of income \u2013 is largely unregulated. The lack of firm rules has left players in the election game relatively free to act as they wish \u2013 one reason why prosecutions are so rarely brought, or if they are, ever completed. </p> <p>The outcome of this legal fuzziness is clearly evident in Wisconsin, where the John Doe investigation has been halted before it could even reach a decision on whether or not a full criminal inquiry was merited. That remains the legal standing of the case at present, pending the US supreme court\u2019s decision.</p> <p>But a moral question continues to hang in the air. If, as Kennedy put it, even the appearance of quid quo pro must be avoided to uphold trust in democracy, does the light shone on the modern American way of staging elections by the John Doe files leaked to the Guardian give cause for public concern?</p> <p>The lead paint mystery</p> <p>The strange case of lead paint might help answer that question. Lead, as the [terrible events](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jun/28/lead-drinking-water-level-nrdc-report-flint-crisis) of Flint, Michigan, have shown, is a potent poison that can seriously impair the intellectual ability of young children. The Flint health crisis was caused by contaminated water, but another peril to public health is the presence of the toxin in household paint before 1978, when it was banned in the US.</p> <p>The John Doe files reveal that the billionaire owner of NL Industries, one of America\u2019s leading producers of lead used in paint until the ban, secretly donated $750,000 to Wisconsin Club for Growth at a time when Walker and his fellow Republican senators were fighting their recall elections. Also in the same time-frame, the Republican-controlled senate passed, and Walker signed into law, legal changes that attempted to grant effective immunity to lead manufacturers from any compensation claims for lead paint poisoning.</p> <p>Since the laws were passed, the federal courts have stepped in and [overturned](http://archive.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/appeals-court-reinstates-wisconsin-lead-paint-suit-b99317605z1-268494482.html) [key elements](http://archive.jsonline.com/blogs/news/304161421.html) of them, leaving NL Industries \u2013 or National Lead Company as it was once known \u2013 still facing many legal challenges. But the point remains: had the new provisions been allowed to stand, they had the potential to save the company and others like it millions of dollars in damages.</p> <p>Lawyers working on the lawsuits argue that at stake were the rights of hundreds of children from poor urban areas whose lives were devastated by lead poisoning inhaled from paint when they were growing up. \u201cThese children were perfectly innocent. They entered life with all the gifts and health that God gave them and were devastated by this neurotoxin,\u201d said Peter Earle, the principal attorney on 171 cases that are currently ongoing against NL Industries and other former manufacturers of lead paint.</p> <p>The owner of NL Industries, Harold Simmons, made the [undisclosed payments to WCfG](http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3105164-Corporate-Checks-Sanitized.html#document/p5, \u201cGuardian\u201d) in three tranches between April 2011 and January 2012, precisely when the GOP senators and then Walker were facing a fight-to-the-death at the ballot box. </p> <p>Simmons, who died a year after Walker won his recall election, was a prominent funder of rightwing causes who, along with Donald Trump, was [reprimanded](http://articles.latimes.com/1993-03-18/news/mn-12355_1_contribution-limits) by the Federal Election Commission in the 1990s for exceeding legal limits of political campaign contributions. He [bankrolled with $3m](https://www.opensecrets.org/527s/527cmtedetail_contribs.php?ein=201041228&amp;cycle=2004) the notorious Swift Boat smear campaign against John Kerry in the 2004 presidential election that erroneously questioned the current secretary of state\u2019s Vietnam war record.</p> <p>Republicans in the Wisconsin legislature made an initial attempt to change the law on the liability of lead paint producers shortly after Walker became governor. As the name implied, Act 2 was one of his opening gambits that he rammed through the legislature in less than a month after he came to office in January 2011. </p> <p>One of Act 2\u2019s key provisions was to tighten tort law to make it much more difficult for lead victims to sue. Under its terms, anyone injured by lead paint who wanted to issue a new lawsuit had to prove that the company they were taking on was responsible for making the specific paint that was on their walls at the time they inhaled the toxin \u2013 a practically impossible task given the number of different manufacturers and the layer-upon-layer of paint on the walls of old houses. </p> <p>The measure in effect granted immunity to NL Industries and other lead producers from any new claims for compensation. </p> <p>Less than three months after the law was enacted, Simmons arranged for the [first and largest check](http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3105164-Corporate-Checks-Sanitized.html#document/p5, \u201cGuardian\u201d) \u2013 of $500,000 \u2013 to be paid directly from Contran Corporation, his business empire, to Wisconsin Club for Growth. It landed at the time that the six senators were in their recall battles.</p> <p>Later that year, Walker\u2019s interest in soliciting more money from Simmons for use in his own personal recall election is made plain in an email among the John Doe files dated 14 November 2011. It was written by Keith Gilkes, Walker\u2019s then senior campaign adviser. </p> <p>The email was sent just one day before opponents of the governor formally triggered the recall procedure, putting Walker\u2019s job on the line. Gilkes rehearsed the names of several wealthy donors to hit up for donations, singling out Simmons and [\u201cSheldon Aldenhouse\u201d](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3105984-2012-08-14-Exhibits-01-100-PT1.html#document/p61/a317549, \u201cGuardian\u201d), presumably a garbling of the name of Sheldon Adelson, the Las Vegas casino magnate who later [donated $200,000](http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3105984-2012-08-14-Exhibits-01-100-PT1.html#document/p74/a317508, \u201cGuardian\u201d) to bolster Walker\u2019s recall chances.</p> <p>The Gilkes memo sets out for Walker some of the \u201cred flags\u201d associated with Simmons and other potential corporate donors \u201cso you are aware of what you might need to defend in terms of contributions from donors when these are disclosed\u201d. He [warns Walker](http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3105984-2012-08-14-Exhibits-01-100-PT1.html#document/p72/a317550, \u201cGuardian\u201d) that Simmons had a controversial track record for reportedly dumping toxic waste in Texas. Gilkes pointed to [an article](http://www.dmagazine.com/publications/d-magazine/2010/february/harold-simmons-is-dallas-most-evil-genius/) by Dallas Magazine in which the billionaire was dubbed \u201cDallas\u2019 most evil genius\u201d. The memo also notes that Simmons avoided having to pay millions of dollars in damages to pay for medical treatment for child victims of lead poisoning in Wisconsin\u2019s largest city Milwaukee after an appeals court cleared NL Industries of causing a public nuisance and dismissed a lawsuit brought by the city for [$52.6m](http://archive.jsonline.com/news/milwaukee/35084654.html).</p> <p>The leaked John Doe files do not record what conclusion Walker and his chief adviser reached about Simmons when they discussed him as a potential donor. What the documents do reveal is that only a month later, a [second corporate check](http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3105164-Corporate-Checks-Sanitized.html#document/p6, \u201cGuardian\u201d) from Contran Corporation for $100,000 was sent to WCfG.</p> <p>The third and final [check from Simmons](http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3105164-Corporate-Checks-Sanitized.html#document/p6, \u201cGuardian\u201d) for $150,000, also made out to WCfG, was cut the following month from his own personal account.</p> <p>At this point, the Wisconsin legislature and Governor Walker made a renewed pitch to change the law to the benefit of NL Industries and other historic manufacturers of lead paint. They had already passed Act 2, but that only covered new claims, leaving the company still facing a mountain of lawsuits that were already ongoing.</p> <p>So the legislators had another go. In the same month as the third check landed, senate Republicans introduced a bill that would make the effective immunity for former lead paint manufacturers retroactive, thereby scuppering all existing lawsuits. </p> <p>That attempt failed to pass the Wisconsin legislature. But even then the Republican group did not give up. In 2013, after all the recall elections had been fought and won, partly with the benefit of Harold Simmons\u2019 support, the legislators tried one more time to pass a bill making the immunity retroactive.</p> <p>They did so with a great deal of encouragement from NL Industries. Earle, the lawyer acting for victims, has discovered under freedom of information laws that the firm employed a professional lobbyists for [330 hours](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3036372-GAB-Lobbying-Summary-Table.html), at a cost of $172,500, to persuade the Wisconsin legislature to pass the retroactive immunity bill.</p> <p>Another [Foia document](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3036374-EP-Memo.html#document/p5/a316185) shows that NL Industries\u2019 lobbyist directly suggested to the Republican leader in the state senate the language that should be added to existing law to make the effective immunity retroactive. The lobbyist encouraged the Republicans to write four words into an amendment that would apply the new immunity protections to all negligence lawsuits \u201cwhenever filed or accrued\u201d. </p> <p>Two months later GOP senators slipped into a [budget bill](http://www.twincities.com/2013/06/06/wisconsin-civil-litigation-provision-angers-attorney-pursuing-lead-paint-claims/) an amendment that contained the same four words proposed by NL Industries: \u201cwhenever filed or accrued\u201d. The amendment was introduced after midnight just before the bill was finalized. It can be found by anyone who looks hard enough on [page 548 of a 603-page bill](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3036359-Exhibit-8-2013-WI-Act-20-Biennial-Budget.html#document/p548/a316191) that Scott Walker duly signed into law. </p> <p>NL Industries used the amendment to press for dismissal of the negligence lawsuits it was facing. But the move failed. A federal appeals court stepped in and ruled that such a retroactive granting of corporate immunity was a violation of the US constitution.</p> <p>It is perhaps worth asking what it would have meant for the victims had the amendment stood. Victims like Yasmine Clark, one of the plaintiffs. She suffered such severe poisoning from lead inhaled from residential paint in her home in Milwaukee that she was hospitalized twice, when she was two years old and again when she was five. </p> <p>When she was at rock bottom, Clark was found to have a lead level in her blood of [48 micrograms per deciliter](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3036375-Mushak-Report-3-13-10-Copy-1.html#document/p6/a316189) and had to undergo chelation therapy to remove the toxins. To give a sense of what that meant, doctors in Flint, Michigan, sounded the alarm after children were found to have levels above 5 micrograms per deciliter from polluted water supplies \u2013 about one-tenth of Clark\u2019s concentration.</p> <p>Clark\u2019s negligence suit, and 170 other cases like hers, are still ongoing against NL Industries and other former manufacturers of lead pigment paint. \u201cThey haven\u2019t been able to shut me down,\u201d Earle said.</p> <p>\u201cYasmine is a victim of egregiously vindictive behavior by these corporations,\u201d the lawyer said. \u201cThe idea of freedom in the US is that no matter how poor you are you have the opportunity to surmount those disadvantages, and these lead companies took that opportunity away from her.\u201d</p> <p>As for Scott Walker, Earle said: \u201cThe governor has chosen to ignore the children and instead fought tooth and nail for the corporations that did this. I don\u2019t have words to describe that conduct.\u201d</p> <p>Scott Walker\u2019s campaign did not respond to Guardian questions relating to its relationship with NL Industries. NL Industries itself, and Contran Corporation, did not respond to numerous invitations to comment.</p> <p>As researchers pore over the Guardian\u2019s leaked John Doe files, seeking light amid the darkness of today\u2019s political process, they may ponder the lead paint mystery. There is no evidence that Wisconsin Republicans led by Scott Walker attempted to change the law as a favor in return for Simmons\u2019 $750,000 donation that had helped some of them win their own elections and stay in office. No charges have ever been brought.</p> <p>But is there even the slightest appearance of quid pro quo? And if potentially there is, should that be a matter that the American people care about? Give the last words to Donald Trump, the presidential nominee of Scott Walker\u2019s Grand Old Party: \u201cWhen you give to them, they do whatever the hell you want them to do.\u201d</p> <p>The Guardian US interactive team is Aliza Aufrichtig, Kenan Davis, Jan Diehm, Rich Harris and Nadja Popovich.<br></p> <p>Additional research by Lauren Leatherby, Nicole Puglise and Mazin Sidahmed.</p> </noscript> </figure>",

As a result <a href=\"https://www.donaldjtrump.com/positions/economic-vision\">Trump\u2019s \u201ceconomic vision\u201d</a> includes goals like:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><em>Cancel the Paris Climate Agreement (limit global warming to 2 degrees Celsius) and stop all payments of U.S. tax dollars to U.N. global warming programs.</em></p> </blockquote> <p>And in <a href=\"http://sciencedebate.org/20answers\">the 2016 Science Debate</a>, although he did pay <a href=\"http://sciencedebate.org/20answers#7\">brief, vague lip service to renewable energy</a>, Trump entirely <a href=\"http://sciencedebate.org/20answers#3\">dodged the question about climate science</a>, devoting a single dismissive sentence to one of the most important issues we face today:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><em>There is still much that needs to be investigated in the field of \u201cclimate change.\u201d </em></p> </blockquote> <p>Hillary Clinton\u2019s detailed answers provided a stark contrast to Trump\u2019s brief and vague responses.<br></p> <h2>Republican AGs take Big Oil donations, attack the Clean Power Plan<br></h2> <p>Meanwhile, <a href=\"http://www.exposedbycmd.org/RAGA-Clean-Power-Plan\">investigative journalists at the Center for Media and Democracy (CMD) uncovered</a> a blatant example of the fossil fuel industry buying influence to undermine government efforts to tackle climate change:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><em>Fossil fuel giants Murray Energy and Southern Company paid for meetings with Republican attorneys general to discuss their opposition to the Clean Power Plan less than two weeks before the same GOP officials petitioned federal courts to block the Obama administration\u2019s signature climate proposal, according to private emails</em></p> </blockquote> <p>Coincidentally, <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2016/09/trump-campaign-taps-gop-energy-lobbyist-as-adviser-228059\">Trump\u2019s newest adviser is a former lobbyist for Southern Company</a>.<br></p> <p>These fossil fuel companies were offered the opportunity to meet with GOP attorneys general in exchange for financial donations to the Republican Attorneys General Association (RAGA) to help fund their re-election campaigns. The documents revealed that the attorneys then discussed \u201cthe future of the fight to stop the Clean Power Plan.\u201d</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><em>According to materials reviewed by CMD, since 2015 RAGA has received at least $100,000 from ExxonMobil, $350,000 from Koch Industries, $85,000 from Southern Company, $378,250 from the American Coalition for Clean Coal Electricity (ACCCE), and $250,000 from Murray Energy.

It\u2019s no coincidence that GOP attorneys general have mounted an aggressive fight alongside the fossil fuel industry to block the Clean Power Plan \u2013 that appears to be exactly what the industry paid for. Together, these documents reveal a sustained pattern of collusion between the fossil fuel industry and the Republican attorneys general on climate change obstructionism.</em></p> </blockquote> <p>The situation is not dissimilar to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/07/donald-trump-donation-pam-bondi-florida-attorney-general\">Trump\u2019s donation to Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi</a>, who soon thereafter decided against pursuing an investigation into <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/02/donald-trump-university-lawsuit-new-york-attorney-general-fraud\">Trump University\u2019s allegedly fraudulent activities</a>.

Bondi is also among the Republican attorneys general taking the Clean Power Plan to court.<br></p> <h2>Big Oil calls the shots for the GOP in all branches<br></h2> <p>And of course just a few months ago, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2016/jun/13/the-grand-oil-party-house-republicans-denounce-a-carbon-tax\">Republicans in the House of Representatives passed a Resolution</a> condemning a carbon tax for no apparent reason, except for possible pressure from fossil fuel industry campaign donors.</p> <p>Big Oil thus appears to be calling the shots for Republican Party leaders at their highest levels in all three branches of US government \u2013 the executive (presidential nominee), judicial (attorneys general), and legislative (members of Congress). And the attorneys general are trying to stop the efforts of the current executive branch (Obama Administration) to cut carbon pollution and tackle climate change.</p> <p>This may be a contributing factor to the historically low approval of Congress today, <a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/poll/192440/republicans-continue-rate-gop-led-congress-poorly.aspx\">even among Republican voters</a>. Just <a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/poll/2167/energy.aspx\">21% of Americans think</a> the US should emphasize more fossil fuel production, as opposed to 73% who favor a focus on renewable energy. <a href=\"https://thinkprogress.org/poll-voters-want-pretty-much-the-opposite-of-what-congress-is-doing-5bc936a668c6#.cuv1wvazc\">82% of Americans favor government limits on carbon pollution</a>. Yet the positions of Republican Party leaders in all branches of government are the polar opposite.</p> <p>The only reason they haven\u2019t paid the electoral price is that Republican voters don\u2019t yet view climate change as a priority, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2016/sep/06/conservative-media-bias-is-inflating-american-climate-denial-and-polarization\">due in large part to conservative media bias</a>. However, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/sep/08/climate-change-louisiana-floods-increased-risk\">as climate change impacts become increasingly undeniable</a>, sooner or later the GOP will be held accountable for selling out the wellbeing of the American people to Big Oil.<br></p>",
  "<p>He wore pinstripes and a wide 1970s tie. She wore a $53 department store dress picked out by her mother. There was no engagement ring, no gift registry, no official photographer or party planner. The guest list \u2013 immediate family and close friends only \u2013 topped out at 14 people, which was about what their mock Tudor starter home could comfortably hold.</p> <p>About 200 people gathered at a friend\u2019s house that afternoon to toast the newlyweds with smoked meats, champagne and a tiered wedding cake. Some people headed to an off-campus dive bar for dancing, and the festivities continued until a 4am call from the local drunk tank. The bride\u2019s brother had been pulled over on a DUI while driving her yellow Fiat, according to the groom\u2019s memoir.</p> <p>And so began the most consequential marriage in US political history.</p> <p>The union solemnized between Hillary Rodham and Bill Clinton in the living room of their first home as a married couple in Fayetteville, Arkansas, on 11 October 1975, created a force that has dominated Democratic party and US presidential politics for more than a quarter of a century and propelled two middle-class Americans into the highest circles of global and corporate leadership. </p> <p>The couple spent just over a year in the mock Tudor house that Bill bought to get Hillary to marry him \u2013 long enough for her to paint the kitchen cupboards a retina-burning orange and for him to botch a repair job on the fireplace. </p> <p>But even in that first year of married life \u2013 the last before either was elected to office \u2013 Bill and Hillary were trying to figure out how to accommodate two highly ambitious personalities within one marriage, according to their friends from those days.</p> <p>\u201cHe always knew he wanted to come back here and he made no bones about it. He wanted to come back here and help his state \u2013 and God knows it needed helping,\u201d said Ann Henry who, with her husband Morriss, hosted the Clintons\u2019 wedding reception at her house. \u201cHe had told all of us here about her. He told us: \u201cShe is so smart. She could do anything. She could be a US senator. She could be a governor. She could be anything she wanted to be. He recognised her and her abilities.\u201d<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Six months after their wedding, Bill decided to run for state attorney general, plotting election strategy around a table that was used more for board games than dinner parties, according to friends. Even then, they called it the war room.<br></p> <p>By the end of 1976, after Bill Clinton\u2019s election, they were on their way to Little Rock, a journey that would take the Clintons to their first stint in the White House.</p> <p>For their baby boomer generation, they were the ultimate power couple. For Arkansans in the early 1970s, when women still needed a husband\u2019s consent to get a car loan or credit card, they stood for a new way of negotiating work and marriage, one where wives matched their husbands for career and political ambitions. Hillary Rodham did not even take her husband\u2019s name until 1982, when her husband who lost his bid for re-election as governor was trying to get back into power \u2013 that is when she began to go by Hillary Rodham Clinton.</p> <p>Bill Clinton, in his speaking slot at the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jul/27/bill-clinton-speech-hillary-democratic-convention\">Democratic national convention</a> in July, spun the story of his marriage as classic fairytale romance. \u201cI met a girl,\u201d he began, recounting his awe-struck state upon meeting Hillary Clinton in the Yale law library in 1971, and how he finally won her heart, asking three times for her hand in marriage before he got a yes.</p> <p>The story as told by Bill Clinton, was said to be an attempt to \u201chumanise\u201d his wife, left out the messy real-life bits, as fairytales do, in his case the epic cheating and lying, the lacerating public humiliation that risked his presidency and smolders still in the background of Hillary\u2019s presidential ambitions, fanned by the comments of internet trolls. </p> <p>Clinton\u2019s testimonial and his repeated assertions that she was \u201cthe best darn change-maker I have ever seen\u201d did little to address the other questions about their extraordinary partnership, and really the ones that matter most: how did a formidable couple manage their respective ambitions?</p> <p>It is easy to ask, as many do, whether Hillary Clinton would ever have had a shot at being the first female president if she wasn\u2019t married to Bill Clinton, whether she exploited her position as first lady to jump on to a relatively safe New York Senate seat, and whether she once again used her husband\u2019s connections to major donors and Democratic party grandees to fix the race against Bernie Sanders in her second run for the White House. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"89542544cfeaf275988eb83a62becf90d831768d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/89542544cfeaf275988eb83a62becf90d831768d/0_0_1979_1940/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Billary1 2\" width=\"1000\" height=\"980\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>That\u2019s the default sexist question.</p> <p>But maybe the real question is whether Bill Clinton, who had already lost one election by the time of his marriage, would have succeeded in becoming America\u2019s youngest governor and one of the country\u2019s most popular presidents without Hillary Clinton by his side? Maybe Bill Clinton held her back \u2013 and Hillary Clinton would have got there any way, or even sooner.</p> <p>Those who befriended the young couple as they embarked on married life in the college town of Fayetteville, Arkansas, in the 1970s asked early versions of those same questions about balancing ambition within a marriage.</p> <p>The friendships they made during that first year of married life were lasting. Morriss and Ann Henry, who hosted that wedding reception, were lawyers and had held public office, like the Clintons. They were in Philadelphia when Clinton formally accepted the nomination. So was Margaret Whillock, who was Hillary Clinton\u2019s first guide to southern living. Diane Blair, a close confidante from those days, died of cancer in 2000, but she kept extensive notes of their conversations, which are housed in the University of Arkansas.</p> <p>A look-back through time is always faulty. People project present-day realities \u2013 in this case Hillary Clinton as the Democratic nominee \u2013 on their memories. But when the friends first met in the 1970s, Bill and Hillary Clinton both seemed headed for prominent positions in public life. According to their friends, it was an open question who would get there first, and at what personal cost.</p> <p>\u2022\u2022\u2022</p> <p>It was a perfect fall day in the Ozarks \u2013 warm sun, cloudless blue sky, with a hint of coolness in the air, and the Razorbacks were playing a home game. Craig and Margaret Whillock\u2019s house was just down the street from the law school where Bill and Hillary Clinton taught. </p> <p>Craig Whillock, a former state representative and aide to a local member of Congress, had been one of Bill Clinton\u2019s earliest mentors when he came back home to Arkansas.</p> <p>When Bill Clinton announced he wanted to run for Congress, against a longtime Republican incumbent, Whillock ran up to get his contacts book, and drove the newcomer all over the district making introductions, according to his widow, Margaret.</p> <p>The Whillocks often opened up their home to large football parties, and on one glorious afternoon in 1974, Margaret Whillock looked up to see Hillary Clinton at the back door. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Hillary\u2019s pay records show a starting salary of $16,450 \u2013 slightly more than her husband who was on $16,182</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cThere was something about her that was so compelling,\u201d Whillock said. \u201cI saw her out of the kitchen door, framed in the door watching the crowd, and she had on a white dress and I thought: \u2018She is going to be important to me\u2019.\u201d </p> <p>The Whillocks were already playing surrogate parents to both Clintons. Bill Clinton regularly used to drop in for dinner with the family, on his way home from a teaching job at the law school. When Hillary Clinton decided to pay a visit and eventually take a job at the law school herself, Bill Clinton asked Margaret Whillock to show her around. </p> <p>He was desperate for Hillary Clinton to like Arkansas, to like it enough to stay, Margaret Whillock said.</p> <p>\u201cBill Clinton was so excited she was coming to Fayetteville. He was thrilled out of his mind. He wanted her to like it here. He wanted her to meet people. I think he realized what a jewel he had in her.\u201d</p> <p>Whillock was working full-time as a school teacher and she had six children at home. That did not deter Bill. \u201cHe said: \u2018You have to have her over. You have to have her over,\u201d she said. </p> <p>So on Clinton\u2019s second day of work at the law school, Whillock invited her for lunch and the women became friends.</p> <p>Even then Hillary Clinton was a high-flyer \u2013 certainly in Arkansas where she was among the first women teaching in the law faculty, and a leader in expanding legal services to the poor \u2013 at a time when judges barred women from taking on rape cases on the grounds that they could not cope with the unpleasantness.<br></p> <p>She was an ambitious, east coast liberal in a hurry in a small, southern town that operated at a slower, gentler pace, especially where gender roles were concerned. Women \u2013 if they did work outside the home \u2013 were mainly confined to feminine professions like teaching and nursing. </p> <p>\u201cShe was different because she was interested in things,\u201d Whillock said. \u201cShe did things differently. She wasn\u2019t into going shopping too much and that kind of thing.\u201d<br></p> <p> Clinton was one of just 27 women in her graduating class at Yale law school. In Arkansas, there was an even bigger gender imbalance. She was among the first female professors at the law school, winning the job over 39 male and two other female applicants.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>And she earned more than her husband from the very beginning of their marriage. Both were employed to teach at the University of Arkansas law school. Hillary\u2019s pay records for the 1974-1975 academic year show a starting salary of $16,450 \u2013 slightly more than her husband, who was on $16,182 in his second year at the law school, and she would continue to outpace him on pay for her short time there.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c8f6a84510fa4c889f91c1a1583bc09de0da15fe\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c8f6a84510fa4c889f91c1a1583bc09de0da15fe/0_0_786_538/500.png\" alt=\"Hillary Clinton pay\" width=\"500\" height=\"342\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hillary Clinton\u2019s starting salary was $16,450.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Yale</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>She also had a broader portfolio of responsibilities, teaching criminal procedure and establishing a legal aid clinic, and she came with glowing recommendations from her professors and supervisors at her previous jobs.</p> <p>By the end of that year, after Bill Clinton won his election as attorney general, the couple were on their way to Little Rock. Their lives as private citizens were over. </p> <p>Hillary Clinton would face much closer scrutiny over her conduct as a wife: her decision to keep her last name, to hold down a demanding job, and to take on big policy projects, such as her successful overhaul of Arkansas\u2019s public schools, which had been ranked worst in the country.</p> <p>She saw even then the possibilities of using her position as the first lady of Arkansas to make change \u2013 if not always the perils, according to Henry, whose husband Morriss had served as a state senator. </p> <p>\u201cShe was talking about Eleanor Roosevelt. That was her role model and mentor kind of thing,\u201d Henry recalled. \u201cI was saying sometimes you have to be careful and you can only do so much and then there is a backlash.\u201d</p> <p>Clinton disagreed, citing Roosevelt\u2019s activism as first lady. \u201cI said by the time Eleanor Roosevelt was so involved in politics, that marriage was all over and I am married with three children,\u201d Henry said.</p> <p>She was not clear whether Clinton really saw her point.</p> <p>\u2022\u2022\u2022</p> <p>Diane Blair was a prodigious taker of notes \u2013 on yellow legal pads, note paper with silly cartoons, and in typed records of hour-long phone conversations with Hillary Clinton when the then first lady was having some down time at Camp David. </p> <p>Blair\u2019s reflections on her close friend take up 16 boxes of her papers at the University of Arkansas \u2013 pages scrawled with references to Chelsea Clinton\u2019s ballet lessons, the flannel nightgown Hillary Clinton wore in the living quarters, and other intimate details of her friend\u2019s life in the White House.</p> <p>But the essence boils down to this, Blair writes at one point, paraphrasing her friend: Bill Clinton was the duck. Hillary Clinton was the decoy. As the wife, Hillary Clinton was constantly under attack for exhibiting traits that might be admired in a man. </p> <p>Her intelligence and tenacity \u2013 which would have been an asset in a man \u2013 made people uncomfortable, according to pollsters. She needed to project a softer side. </p> <p>And Clinton told Blair, the White House operatives went along with that because it directed the criticism away from Bill Clinton.<br></p> <p>Clinton was also getting tired of the criticism of her appearance. \u201cI gave up my name, got contact lenses.

It was a huge personal lapse. And she is not taking responsibility for it.\u201d</p> <p>Blair goes on to record Clinton\u2019s efforts to rationalise her husband\u2019s behaviour \u2013 because of the pressure he was under as president, his early upbringing, and to dismiss its importance. </p> <p>Ultimately, Clinton forgave her husband. \u201cShe\u2019s in it for long haul,\u201d Blair wrote. \u201cBecause she\u2019s stubborn; partly her upbringing; partly her pride \u2013 but, mostly because she knows who she is and what her values and priorities are and she\u2019s straight with those \u2013 she really is OK.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022\u2022\u2022</p> <p>Nine months later, in July 1999, Blair flew to DC for a visit, arriving at the White House to find Bill Clinton practicing his putting, and Hillary Clinton lounging by the pool. </p> <p>That evening Blair found the couple in the solarium, with Bill Clinton helping Hillary Clinton with a speech \u2013 trying to make it punchier. </p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s clear how much she values his advice and editorial skills,\u201d Blair wrote. When Clinton came back from the event, she thanked her husband for his help.</p> <p>Hillary Clinton\u2019s second act had begun. She spent her final months as first lady launching her run for the Senate seat in New York. From here on, it would be Hillary Clinton\u2019s ambitions taking center stage, and Bill Clinton offering back-up support.</p> <p>And, the old Arkansas friends said, Bill Clinton was entirely fine with that. The admiration he had for Hillary Clinton all those years before was still alive, they insisted.</p> <p>\u201cThe way he talks about her and the way she talks about him,\u201d said Margaret Whillock, visited the family in Chappaqua when Clinton was in the Senate. \u201cOne time he said Hillary got this great new dress for the Met opening or something like that. He knew those things. He was glad. He was proud of her.\u201d</p> <p>She went on: \u201cYou could just tell.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>In Prague\u2019s magnificent ninth-century castle, once the seat of power to Holy Roman emperors, Milo\u0161 Zeman has a mundane preoccupation sharply at odds with the grandeur of his surroundings.</p> <p>\u201cDo you smoke?\u201d asks the Czech Republic\u2019s president, lighting the first of several cigarettes during an interview with the Guardian at his sumptuous official residence overlooking the city.</p> <p>\u201cUnfortunately the smokers are a discriminated minority and we are persecuted in all hotels, all restaurants, everywhere,\u201d he continues indignantly, defending a habit he once dismissed as harmless if not started before the age of 27. \u201cIt is like in the case of the [American] prohibition. Whiskey as a consequence was more expensive and very low quality. And now smoking is also nearly prohibited.\u201d</p> <p>The contradiction of modern scientific orthodoxy seems a far cry from the moral authority exuded by one of his predecessors, the late V\u00e1clav Havel, a former anti-communist dissident who was the Czech Republic\u2019s first president following the 1992 breakup of Czechoslovakia.</p> <p>Yet it is typical of the unabashed advocacy of traditional mores and popular pastimes that Zeman has made his trademark since becoming his country\u2019s first directly elected head of state in 2013.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/10/observer-view-on-eu-bratislava-summit-britain-no-voice\">The Observer view on Britain\u2019s lack of voice in Europe | Observer editorial</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Last year, the president \u2013 whose drinking exploits, including occasionally appearing to be inebriated in public, have become legendary \u2013 stirred controversy by wishing \u201cdeath to abstainers and vegetarians\u201d during a meeting with winemakers.</p> <p>His spokesman insisted he was referring to Adolf Hitler, a renowned teetotaller who did not eat meat.

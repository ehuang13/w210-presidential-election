  "<p>When I first called Jill Harth back in the spring, she didn\u2019t want to talk. Neither did a number of the other women I called who had crossed paths with<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\"> Donald Trump</a>. But few of them had documented their encounters as thoroughly as Harth, whose 1997 lawsuit alleging attempted rape against Trump is a matter of public record.</p> <p>Harth had kept quiet for almost 20 years. But a few months after my call, her lawyer got in touch. The impetus, as Harth put it in an emotional hour-long interview at the Guardian\u2019s New York office in July, was Trump\u2019s repeated insistence that any woman alleging misbehavior on his part was lying. </p> <p>Trump is still calling Harth and many others liars, even as the number of women accusing him of sexual misconduct has risen into the double digits. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/us-membership/defy.html\" data-alt=\"membership embed\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/us-membership/defy.html\">membership embed</a> </figure>  <p>Long before crass tapes of Trump boasting about sexual groping entered the picture \u2013 and Harth\u2019s story suddenly became front-page news \u2013 the Guardian was the rare publication that took Harth\u2019s story seriously. We were the first to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/20/donald-trump-sexual-assault-allegations-jill-harth-interview\">publish her account</a> last July, even as other outlets dismissed stories like it as too frivolous or implausible. We also published the accounts of fat-shamed beauty queen <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/27/alicia-machado-miss-universe-weight-shame-trump-speaks-out-clinton\">Alicia Machado</a> and legally bullied <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/04/sheena-monnin-donald-trump-miss-usa-lawsuit\">Sheena Monnin</a>, well before Trump\u2019s mistreatment of women became the defining story of the presidential election.</p> <p>Harth, who charged Trump with sexually assaulting her in one of his children\u2019s bedrooms at his Mar-a-Lago estate in 1993, didn\u2019t come to the Guardian by chance. She came to me because she knew the Guardian was committed to telling her story; and she sensed I had the time, flexibility and resources I needed to tell it.</p> <p>She was right. When Trump clinched the nomination last spring, my editors asked me to dig deeply into Trump\u2019s long history of misogyny, and gave me the support I needed to do so.</p> <p>But the Guardian\u2019s commitment to this kind of in-depth reporting is time consuming and expensive. That\u2019s why I\u2019m writing to ask for your support by <a href=\"https://contribute.theguardian.com/?INTCMP=co_us_editorial_copy_USlgravesTrump\">making a contribution</a> or <a href=\"https://membership.theguardian.com/supporter?INTCMP=gdnwb_copts_editorial_mem_USlgravesTrump_inarticle\">becoming a member</a>.</p> <p>The business model for investigative journalism is broken. As comedian John Oliver explained recently in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bq2_wSsDwkQ\">this brilliant segment</a>, nobody in journalism has figured out a sustainable formula for making money on the internet. Online ads generate a tiny fraction of the revenue that print ads once did \u2013 and news publications like the Guardian are competing with tech giants Google and Facebook for digital advertising revenue. </p> <p>From Bill Cosby to Roger Ailes to Donald Trump, this election year may go down as the moment our country finally started taking sexual assault seriously. These stories found an audience because of the brave women who told them, but also because of the journalists and the editors who listened first. We did that at the Guardian, and now we hope you\u2019ll listen back.</p> <p>Please<strong> </strong>support independent journalism at the Guardian by <a href=\"https://contribute.theguardian.com/?INTCMP=co_us_editorial_footer_USlgravesTrump\">making a contribution</a> or <a href=\"https://membership.theguardian.com/supporter?INTCMP=gdnwb_copts_editorial_mem_USlgravesTrump_footer\">becoming a member</a> today.</p>",

While Sorenson is right about the large turnout, he is wrong to imply that this disaster is merely a byproduct of poor planning or a surprisingly overzealous electorate.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/video/2016/oct/18/barack-obama-tells-americans-to-fire-up-and-vote-early-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/58xz4\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2816050\"            data-video-name=\"Barack Obama tells Americans to fire up and vote early \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"Youtube/Hillary Clinton\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-58057881e4b005f21833a7d7\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/10/18/161018earlyvote_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/10/18/161018earlyvote.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/10/18/161018earlyvote_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/video/2016/oct/18/barack-obama-tells-americans-to-fire-up-and-vote-early-video\">Barack Obama tells Americans to fire up and vote early</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>In 2011, Georgia <a href=\"https://www.brennancenter.org/blog/early-voting-under-attack-georgia \">reduced early voting</a> from 45 days prior to the election to only 21.

His deputy, Mark Toner, added later that Kerry had not even met with the Ecuador delegation during the talks. \u201cThere just was no meeting,\u201d he said. \u201cThey didn\u2019t discuss any of this stuff.\u201d</p> <p>The confirmation that Ecuador had shut down the internet at least put to rest <a href=\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/10/17/conspiracy-theorists-pamela-anderson-poisoned-julian-assange-with-a-vegan-sandwich.html\">one bizarre rumour</a>, which surfaced after the Baywatch actress Pamela Anderson visited Assange in the embassy on Saturday, telling reporters she had brought him a vegan sandwich from Pret a Manger. </p> <p>Three WikiLeaks tweets after her visit, labelled \u201c<a href=\"https://twitter.com/wikileaks/status/787777344740163584\">pre-commitments</a>\u201d and containing strings of code, led to a brief, feverish conspiracy theory that Assange could be dead \u2013 with some even pointing to the sandwich as a possible culprit \u2013 before the site explained its connection had been \u201cintentionally severed by a state party\u201d.</p> <p>Neither WikiLeaks nor Ecuador\u2019s foreign ministry responded to requests for comment on Wednesday, and it is unclear whether Assange will have been able to restore his internet access independently. The journalist John Pilger, a close ally and frequent visitor of Assange in the embassy, told the Guardian that Assange \u201cwill have a contingency\u201d, and stressed that WikiLeaks was bigger than its founder. </p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t imagine that the restrictions will stop the leaks or deter WikiLeaks and Assange,\u201d he said. \u201cThe significance of the action by Ecuador, which is clearly under pressure, is to show how frightened the US establishment is of further revelations reaching the public about its preferred presidential candidate.\u201d</p> <p>WikiLeaks said it had \u201cactivated the appropriate contingency plans\u201d, and has <a href=\"https://twitter.com/wikileaks\">continued to tweet links</a> to its stream of damaging email leaks, most recently from the personal email account of the chairman of Clinton\u2019s election campaign, John Podesta. They included transcripts from speeches made to Goldman Sachs bankers in which she <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/16/wikileaks-hillary-clinton-wall-street-goldman-sachs-speeches\">avoided any direct criticism of Wall Street</a>, raising questions of an overly cosy relationship with the banking establishment. </p> <p>But for a man who cannot move beyond a handful of rooms in what is, in essence, a modest apartment, even the temporary loss of his connection with the outside world will be a significant blow and troubling development. Ecuador\u2019s move to silence him points starkly to frustrations at some of Assange\u2019s activities while on diplomatic premises.</p> <p>Periodic rumours have emerged of strains between Assange and his Ecuadorean hosts in the more than four years he has lived in the embassy. Confidential embassy documents <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/jamesball/mr-white-and-mr-blue?utm_term=.drzw9qy5p#.co8Y50zd2\">leaked to Buzzfeed News</a> last year revealed Assange had a late-night scuffle with a security guard in the embassy who said he had found the Australian tampering with security equipment in its secure room (Assange said the guard had accosted him).<br></p> <p>The documents also showed that embassy staff painstakingly monitor Assange\u2019s movements \u2013 referring to him as \u201cMr Guest\u201d \u2013 and contained references both to the stressful situation in which he lives and his \u201cevident anger\u201d and \u201cfeelings of superiority\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/oct/14/wiileaks-from-liberal-beacon-to-a-prop-for-trump-what-has-happened\">From liberal beacon to a prop for Trump: what has happened to WikiLeaks?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Asked about occasional strains to the relationship, Pilger said: \u201cWhen I met Ecuador\u2019s foreign minister and other officials not long ago, they spoke highly of Assange and Ecuador\u2019s commitment to protect him. I have always regarded this small country\u2019s decision to give him asylum and refuge as a rare example of principle and courage.\u201d</p> <p>For the foreseeable future, US election or not, Assange is unlikely to be going anywhere.

They had no doubts whatsoever. They weren\u2019t following the ins and outs. They thought that a&#xa0;government ought to be working for its people. They couldn\u2019t imagine why anybody would think otherwise.\u201d</p> <p>Larry Sanders came to Britain in the late 60s \u2013 his opinion varies as to whether it was 68 or 69 \u2013 following a woman who would become his wife.

Over here, he did a masters in social work at Oxford, and eventually \u2013 when the relaxing impartiality wore off \u2013 joined the Labour party, which initially refused him on the grounds that he was a Trotskyist (which he never was, although he says it wasn\u2019t a wild accusation: \u201cThere was quite a strong, numerically very small, but strong Trotskyist movement. There was WSL [Workers\u2019 Socialist League] \u2013 people used to call them the weasels \u2013 and I think a predecessor ... you\u2019re too young and I\u2019m too old to remember this stuff, but there were plenty of them about\u201d).</p> <p>While he was teaching social work in London and living in Oxford, in the 70s, his county council decided to close down all the nurseries (they were \u201cchildminding on the rates\u201d the Tory candidate said), and this was Sanders\u2019 first real entry into British politics, occupying \u2013 which functionally meant working in \u2013 one of the nurseries until the bailiffs came. \u201cAnd that\u2019s the hardest work I\u2019ve ever done in my life. Those children are so fierce. There was one little boy whose goal in life was to kick me in the balls. No matter how I&#xa0;manoeuvred, that kid was so flexible.\u201d</p> <p>He is \u2013 I say this without exaggeration \u2013 the first politician I have ever heard acknowledge that childcare is not just sentimentally but literally harder than all other jobs. The campaign was a success \u2013 they saved 80% of the provision \u2013 but it left him with no illusions about leftwing politics. \u201cAfterwards, we had a disastrous time, when the mothers of the children and the politicos who had moved into the campaign had a knockdown drag out.\u201d Talking to him is a bit like watching Marlon Brando: I get the gist, but subtitles would help. \u201cThe campaign split,\u201d he explains.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1dab9f7a17d340e503f5fedd91258211a3c33d37\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1dab9f7a17d340e503f5fedd91258211a3c33d37/0_0_2052_1532/1000.jpg\" alt=\"With Bernie.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"747\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">With Bernie.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Larry Sanders/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Life intervened: tragically, his wife died when his daughter was 10 and his son, 14.

To tell the truth, I didn\u2019t get that bothered by Blair. Even in the 80s, members didn\u2019t really think the leadership thought what they thought. But Blair was certainly destructive, the way Bill Clinton was destructive.\u201d It was through the social justice, rather than climate change, that he came to the Green party, although environmentalism certainly grips him now.

Courts is an unpopular candidate anyway, an unabashed Brexiter in a&#xa0;staunchly remain area. The Lib Dems clearly have high hopes (Nick Clegg was everywhere you looked, on the train, on the high street, in a charity shop, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2010/dec/09/russell-brand-cast-rentaghost\" title=\"\">like Timothy Claypole</a>).</p> <p>It\u2019s still unclear whether this will deliver any votes to Sanders, but that\u2019s not really the point: \u201cIt\u2019s not an expectation of winning or getting a particular percentage. It\u2019s just an opportunity to say what\u2019s happening.\u201d He certainly doesn\u2019t see himself as bringing an unpopular message to hostile Conservative territory. \u201cThere are some underlying things that are the same everywhere. I talked in one stretch of an hour to a dozen young people, and all I&#xa0;have to say is \u2018housing\u2019. All 12 of them were living with their parents \u2013 they were either in education or working. That\u2019s not only where they were now \u2013 they didn\u2019t see any prospect of being able to move out. How do you defend a politics in which the majority of your young people can\u2019t look forward to a&#xa0;decent place to live? This is absolutely basic.\u201d What does he say to old people? \u201cOld people, I can strike up a conversation immediately about pavements. The county council has had 40% taken out of its budget.

To me, the most likely scenario is this could be the CIA\u2019s attempt to back President Obama into a corner by putting public pressure on him to approve such an escalation in cyberwarfare.<br></p> <p>So far, Obama has (commendably) <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/08/almost-everyone-gets-russia-wrong-apart-from-obama\">been virtually the only official or politician</a> in DC not to succumb to scaremongering and dramatic cold war 2.0 rhetoric when it comes to Russia.

But assuming the CIA plans are real, why on earth do all these national security geniuses think this is a good idea? Countless politicians have spent the last four months saying how \u201cunprecedented\u201d and \u201cdangerous\u201d Russia\u2019s actions are, so now the magic solution is to do it back to them?<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jul/25/russia-blame-dnc-email-hack-premature\">The rush to blame Russia for the DNC email hack is premature | Trevor Timm</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Who thinks that once the US leaks some documents back on Putin that he\u2019ll suddenly be like \u2018oh, you got me, I guess we\u2019ll stop!\u2019 The more likely scenario is that this half-baked idea will escalate the cyber tensions rather than act as a deterrent.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Remember, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/08/world/europe/vladimir-putin-panama-papers-american-plot.html\">Putin reportedly thinks</a> that the Panama Papers leak was the work of the US government (even though there\u2019s no evidence to suggest it was) and some think the current leaks involving US politicians are his revenge. This potential CIA operation will, in his mind, only confirm his suspicions.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Putin is also much less susceptible to public pressure than US politicians are (given his alleged heavy-handed dealings with his opponents) and has increasingly attempted to implement draconian internet surveillance laws which he\u2019ll surely use to his advantage if the US does go through with this plan.<br></p> <p>Why does the reaction to alleged Russian actions have to turn into a contest in who\u2019s the bigger tough guy?

While approximately 400 people are expected to rally in the morning on the Las Vegas strip, the trucks will be handing out free tacos in order to support the protest. The union has been using Twitter and other social media platforms as it promotes its #WallOfTacos and #TacosOnEveryCorner event, hoping to make some noise before the debate. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/issielapowsky/status/788468224341839872\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">At Culinary Union meeting of former and current Trump workers: &quot;bad bosses make bad presidents&quot; <a href=\"https://t.co/QMqVHm7Eft\">pic.twitter.com/QMqVHm7Eft</a></p>&mdash; issie lapowsky (@issielapowsky) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/issielapowsky/status/788468224341839872\">October 18, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>They will be joined by representatives from Plan Action, Latino Victory Project, iAmerica, Center for Community Change Action, For Our Future, and 50 immigrant advocacy activists from Los Angeles.

Last December, the majority of workers in Las Vegas voted and officially agreed to unionize, but Trump hotel management has not recognized the vote and has refused to meet or discuss labour issues. Union groups across the country have lent their overwhelming support, including through <a href=\"http://www.insidesources.com/dc-unions-picket-trump-hotel/\">a protest outside Trump International hotel in Washington DC</a> on 13 October. </p> <p>On Tuesday, the Culinary Workers Union \u2013 which has endorsed Hillary Clinton \u2013 held a press conference where many members who have worked at Trump hotels expressed their frustrations and described what it\u2019s like to be an employee for Trump without the possibility of ever bargaining over their contracts. This is supported by a video published last month in which workers expressed their anger toward Trump hotel and casino establishments. \u201cWe get paid three dollars an hour less and bad benefits,\u201d said Jeff Wise, a worker at Trump Hotel Las Vegas, \u201cso the employees got together, voted democratically to have a union.

The Culinary Union has spent the last year registering more than 8,000 people to vote and helped more than 2,200 of its members to become American citizens this year. </p> <p>After the wall rally, hundreds of immigrants and volunteers will attend a debate viewing party at the Culinary Union and on Thursday they will host a forum with Trump hotel workers to elaborate what it\u2019s like to work for the Republican nominee. </p>",

It\u2019s a love song set in a world on the brink of nuclear war. With the blackest of humor, the lyrics conflate paranoia, nihilism and lust, a troika ideally suited to the Trump gestalt. It helps that Adam features one of Ritter\u2019s best-formed folk-rock melodies, with a beauty reminiscent of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/jun/29/paul-simon-retire-graceland-art-garfunkel\">Paul Simon</a>\u2019s most fluid tunes.</p> <p>James\u2019s piece has less lyrical specificity but nearly as much sonic allure.

Band leader Ben Gibbard seized on an anecdote from the first presidential debate in which the Donald claimed he started his business empire with a million dollar loan from his father. It\u2019s a spoof on both privilege and elastic truth, sung with maximum sarcasm and wariness. </p> <p>The American singer-songwriter Bhi Bhiman zeroed in on Trump\u2019s apparent one-way bromance with Vladimir Putin. Using the James Bond-inspired title With Love, From Russia, the song imagines a deal between the two politicians which has Putin taking the Baltic countries while giving Trump in return fantasy properties from Monopoly. An accompanying video surveys a painting of Trump and Putin lost in a deep kiss, as the music lurches through a flatulent synth-pop beat.</p> <p>El Vy \u2013 a project between the National\u2019s Matt Berninger and Ramona Falls\u2019 Brent Knopf \u2013 takes an equally cartoonish approach. The visuals for Are These My Jets center on a video game character named Richard Walrus, who flies a tiny plane that blows things to hell while a weeping Abraham Lincoln looks on. The lyrics aren\u2019t as coherent, but at least they beat the clunk of Before You Vote, a last-ditch entreaty to Trump supporters by Thao Nguyen (of Thao &amp; the Get Down Stay Down). \u201cHe doesn\u2019t care about you,\u201d she yelps. \u201cHe just wants his terrible reality show back on NBC.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biMXbtMp-GQ\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/biMXbtMp-GQ?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Far more insightful humor can be found in Aimee Mann\u2019s contribution. Her sprightly folk-pop song Can\u2019t You Tell aims to get inside Trump\u2019s head, treating his candidacy as a joke he started that got out of control. \u201cIsn\u2019t anybody going to stop me?\u201d she has Trump poignantly ask. \u201cI don\u2019t want this job/I can\u2019t do this job/My God/ can\u2019t you tell?/I\u2019m unwell.\u201d </p> <p>Mann\u2019s song may have the best lines, and the catchiest melody, but a special award for speed should go to Franz Ferdinand for Demagogue. Just two weeks after the Access Hollywood revelation, the band managed to jam in an allusion to Trump\u2019s famous \u201cp\u201d-word outburst. The music has a Bowie-in-Berlin sturm und drang, while the video boasts artwork from Shepard Fairey. Not since Neil Young dashed off Ohio mere weeks after the Kent State shootings has a band reacted this quickly to a public event. Of course, Demagogue hasn\u2019t anywhere near the potency of Ohio. In fact, none of the snarky pieces in the project so far have the enraged genius of a song like, say, Elvis Costello\u2019s take-down of Margaret Thatcher, Tramp the Dirt Down. But in an election cycle that seems hellishly endless, these quick pricks and swipes are providing some sweet relief.</p>",

The third and final presidential debate at the University of Las Vegas comes as both campaigns are beset by controversy.

  "<p>In Monday night\u2019s game 3 of the AL Championship Series, Cleveland Indians pitcher Trevor Bauer had to make an early exit after his injured pinkie refused to stop gushing blood. In Massachusetts, the gory sight conjured up surprisingly positive memories: it was hard not to think back to Curt Schilling\u2019s starts in game 6 of the 2004 ALCS and game 2 of the World Series. Pitching on a surgically repaired ankle with blood dripping through thick socks, the Red Sox ace stayed in the game, mowing down the offenses of the New York Yankees and then the St Louis Cardinals on the way towards the team\u2019s first championship in 86 years.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/11/david-ortiz-big-papi-retires-boston-red-sox\">The Red Sox say goodbye to Big Papi, and Boston will never be the same</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Schilling, in essence, was sacrificing his body, risking his entire career, to deliver New England a World Series title many thought they would never live to see. It was such a vivid drama that it could have been the climax of a particularly cringe-worthy Kevin Costner movie, so much so that there remain baseball fans who still believe it was faked. To see Bauer in action was, for Massachusetts residents, to be reminded of the old Curt Schilling, the Schilling who made such a memorable sacrifice to such long-suffering fans.</p> <p>It was easily the most defining moment in Schilling\u2019s remarkable playing career. So, yesterday, with his 2004 heroics <a href=\"http://www.sportsnet.ca/baseball/mlb/francona-making-right-moves-cleveland-keeps-rolling/\">returning to public consciousness</a>, Schilling decided it was the perfect time to make his announcement. \u201cI\u2019ve made my decision,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/18/curt-schilling-elizabeth-warren-massachusetts-state-senate\">he said</a> to Boston radio station WRKO, confirming talk that he would run for Senate in 2018, presumably against sitting senator Elizabeth Warren. He did give himself an out, however: \u201cI haven\u2019t talked to Shonda, my wife. And ultimately it\u2019s going to come down to how we feel about our marriage and our kids.\u201d</p> <p>There was a time when the notion of Senator Curt Schilling (R-MA) <a href=\"http://deadspin.com/curt-schilling-for-what-feels-like-the-hundredth-time-1787928947?utm_campaign=socialflow_deadspin_twitter&amp;utm_source=deadspin_twitter&amp;utm_medium=socialflow\">seemed like it was possible</a>. In 2009, while still basking in the glow of his Red Sox heroics, his name was bandied about as the Republican candidate in the 2010 special election to replace the late Ted Kennedy. He demurred, saying it wasn\u2019t his time, and the Republicans nominated moderate Scott Brown, who eventually beat out Democratic candidate Martha Coakley on 19 January 2010.</p> <p>Instead of politics, Schilling was deep into video game developing. In 2011 he moved the company he founded, 38 Studios, from Massachusetts to Rhode Island after securing $75m of taxpayer money. 38 Studios <a href=\"http://www.bostonmagazine.com/2012/07/38-studios-end-game/\">went bust in 2012</a>, a debacle that resulted in a lawsuit filed by Rhode Island, since settled and a fraud investigation by the Rhode Island state police.</p> <p>Following the failure of 38 Studios, Schilling focused on broadcasting. It went better than his time in gaming, only in that he didn\u2019t make an enemy out of an entire US state this time around. During a stint with ESPN, when Schilling wasn\u2019t <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://deadspin.com/espn-suspends-keith-law-from-twitter-for-defending-evol-1661836868\">arguing with co-workers</a> about evolution, he was using his down time to share increasingly controversial political views and offensive cartoons, most notoriously one comparing <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2015/aug/26/curt-schilling-espn-twitter-mlb\">Muslims and Nazis</a>. This led to a lengthy suspension, during which he was forced to defend his own <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.sportingnews.com/mlb/news/curt-schilling-nazi-world-war-ii-collection-muslim-tweet-espn-suspension/y25n11fae8l11tygm6h64tv7\">Nazi memorabilia collection</a>. His return didn\u2019t last too long. In April of this year, one final meme, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/apr/20/espn-fires-curt-schilling-transgender-facebook-comments\">this one highly transphobic,</a> ended his tenure at ESPN permanently.</p> <p>This <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2016/apr/21/curt-schilling-espn-firing-baseball-transphobia\">overdue termination</a>, and his subsequent embrace of his new role of truth-telling conservative martyr, victim of the PC police, hastened his full plunge into politics. The transition hasn\u2019t gone smoothly, even as the political bar for acceptable discourse has plummeted to unfathomable new depths. Most recently, Schilling was defending Donald Trump\u2019s habit of flirting with pre-teens in a way that was creepy even by Trump surrogate standards.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEHCK9Q-6jI\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/xEHCK9Q-6jI?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>If Schilling makes good on his decision to run for the US Senate, he will till have a significant group of core supporters. The problem is that things like calling for <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/early-lead/wp/2016/09/19/curt-schillings-solution-for-terrorism-executions-without-trial/\">\u201ca version of the Berlin Wall\u201d</a> on the Mexican border, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://mediamatters.org/blog/2015/08/25/espn-analyst-curt-schillings-worst-facebook-pos/205146\">equating Islam straight up with terrorism</a> aren\u2019t going to play very well in heavily liberal-leaning Massachusetts, no matter how many great memories voters have of him striking out Alex Rodriguez.</p> <p>At this point in his life, Schilling is a failed broadcaster and a businessman who, through either incompetence or deceit, has already screwed over one state in New England. He has gained no specific political experience since he declined to run in 2009 \u2013 unless you count his time spent as an unpaid racist meme curator. He\u2019s Trump without without the smarmy charisma that allows Trump to skate away from scandal far more intact than he has any right to be. Instead, Schilling is something more basic. Schilling\u2019s <a href=\"https://theringer.com/curt-schilling-political-aspirations-9f32bc426c4b#.grozglwry\">that one uncle on Facebook</a>, just with three World Series rings and access to multiple media outlets.</p> <p>Scott Brown managed to pull off his special election victory back in 2009 for two reasons. First, Brown, a Republican, was able to position himself as a moderate who appealed to a broad range of voters, an avenue thoroughly closed off to Schilling at this point. Secondly, he was running against a candidate in Martha Coakley who drew lukewarm water levels of enthusiasm, even among registered Democrats. It also didn\u2019t help that she inexplicably called Schilling a \u201cYankees fan\u201d during her 2009 campaign (this may end up being Schilling\u2019s biggest positive contribution to Massachusetts GOP history.)</p> <p>Warren, who defeated Brown in the 2012, makes a formidable opponent for any GOP candidate to face \u2013 partly because her supporters are so passionate. Warren was popular enough (a <a href=\"https://morningconsult.com/senate-approval-bernie-rubio-cruz/\">61% popularity rating</a>, according to one recent poll) that there was recent talk that Clinton was considering her as her vice-president. This was opposed by many liberals, not because she would be unsuited for the job, but because they considered her too important <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2016/06/13/vp_does_not_make_sense_for_elizabeth_warren_130860.html\">to remove from the Senate</a>. In short, Schilling v Warren could end up being an absolute bloodbath. A <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://boston.cbslocal.com/2016/09/30/elizabeth-warren-curt-schilling-senate-poll-2018-president/\">recent poll</a> showed Warren holding a 19-point lead over Schilling in a hypothetical election.</p> <p>It\u2019s tempting to say that there\u2019s absolutely no way that Schilling would actually become the GOP nominee, it would be tantamount to party suicide. But after this presidential election, it is foolish to assume that this is the case. In a sane and just world, this wouldn\u2019t end up being anything other than a one-time local hero burning through the last of his goodwill on yet another hopeless scheme. But that might not be the type of world we currently inhabit.</p>",
  "<p>On the outskirts of Charlotte, it\u2019s the last day of early voting for the congressional race in North Carolina\u2019s 12th district at the Mountain Island library, and there are no lines for the polling stations.</p> \n<p>Instead, volunteers outnumbered the voters. It was early voting time, but not for a race nearly as high-profile as the presidential election. Only <a href=\"http://apps.meckboe.org/Pages/Election/EarlyVoting/2016JunePri.htm\">266</a> people turned out in June to the polls to pick the district\u2019s next member of Congress. After the election, once all the votes were tallied, only 7% of more than 500,000 registered voters cast ballots.</p> \n<p>\u201cTurnout was very, very low,\u201d said Carol Johnson, a poll worker and an employee for the city of Charlotte. \u201cMaybe people didn\u2019t know. Maybe they weren\u2019t interested.\u201d</p> \n<p>Or maybe people have grown disenfranchised after living in what has long been considered the most gerrymandered district in the United States. Twenty-five years ago, North Carolina lawmakers drew the 12th district, creating the second majority-minority district in a state with a dark history of denying black residents their voting rights.</p> \n<p>That line-drawing is what is known as gerrymandering, or manipulating the boundaries of electoral districts to favor a particular result.</p> \n<p>The district\u2019s borders were long and narrow \u2013 so stretched out that it took a two-hour drive from Charlotte, passing through Winston-Salem and Greensboro, before ending in Durham. Naturally, it became known as the I-85 district because, as state representative Mickey Michaux, a Democrat from Durham, once put it: \u201cIf you drove down the interstate with both car doors open, you\u2019d kill most of the people in the district.\u201d </p> \n<p>What gerrymandering can kill is the impact of a person\u2019s vote. North Carolina is a prime example of why Barack Obama and former US attorney general Eric Holder recently <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2016/10/obama-holder-redistricting-gerrymandering-229868\">announced plans</a> to launch a long-term redistricting reform effort. And after Donald Trump escalated his warnings that this year\u2019s presidential election is rigged, <a href=\"https://t.co/5Qc0l9wnei\">several</a> <a href=\"http://billmoyers.com/story/real-way-2016-election-rigged/\">commentators</a> and even the Daily Show\u2019s <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/08/09/trevor-noah-trump-is-right-the-2016-election-is-rigged-in-favor-of-republicans.html\">Trevor Noah</a> argued that gerrymandering along with <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/18/donald-trump-volunteer-election-observers-voter-intimidation\">voter suppression laws</a> are the real rigging.</p> \n<p>The state\u2019s past two presidential races were determined by a margin of two percentage points, yet the simple act of map-drawing distorted electoral outcomes on the ballot. Two years ago, more than half the state\u2019s voters cast Democratic ballots, yet Republicans secured the vast majority of congressional seats. For proof of gerrymandering\u2019s chilling effects, look no further than the way that the 12th \u2013 which over the years has been described as a serpentine, political pornography and nothing \u201cnatural on this planet\u201d \u2013 has undercut the power of a single vote.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/10/nc-gerrymandering-map/\" data-alt=\"Party control of line-drawing\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/10/nc-gerrymandering-map/\">Party control of line-drawing</a> \n <figcaption>\n  Party control of line-drawing\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Opponents of gerrymandering fear the voices of voters may be washed out in the upcoming presidential election, even as statewide restrictions that have been intensively litigated pose potentially more direct obstacles to voting.</p> \n<p>This coming term, the US supreme court will review the long-running battle over line-drawing. </p> \n<h2>\u2018An uncomfortable resemblance to political apartheid\u2019</h2> \n<p>The most gerrymandered district emerged after years of battles against discriminatory voting practices. In the decades after the landmark Voting Rights Act of 1965 outlawed voting restrictions such as literacy tests, voting rights lawyers continued to challenge discriminatory election practices still on the books in southern states \u2013 forcing changes to ensure their compliance with the Voting Rights Act.<br></p> \n<p>Over the course of several decades, North Carolina\u2019s population grew enough to gain a 12th congressional seat following the 1990 census. The 12th, the state\u2019s second majority-minority district, was intended to boost minority representation.</p> \n<p>Mel Watt, a black Charlotte-based lawyer and political operative, seized on the opportunity. He had helped Harvey Gantt get elected as Charlotte\u2019s first black mayor in the early 80s. </p> \n<p>\u201cI got on the phone to call Harvey,\u201d hoping to persuade him to run, Watt recalls. \u201cHe said, \u2018I\u2019m not going to run.\u2019 He instead talked me into running.\u201d</p> \n<p>Watt won in 1992, and then more than 10 times after that in the majority black district. But during his tenure, the US supreme court took issue with the district\u2019s consideration of race in its line-drawing numerous times.</p> \n<p>In 1993, then Justice Sandra Day O\u2019Connor said districts such as the 12th \u2013 which was drawn by the Democratic-led house \u2013 bore \u201can uncomfortable resemblance to political apartheid\u201d that reinforced the \u201cvery patterns of racial bloc voting that majority-minority districting is sometimes said to counteract.\u201d</p> \n<p>North Carolina soon found itself in a bind: it needed to ensure black votes actually mattered, all while drawing districts without explicitly having race in mind. The supreme court\u2019s Shaw v Reno ruling sparked lawsuits that challenged the constitutionality of majority-minority districts in Georgia, Texas, Florida and Louisiana. The 12th district\u2019s map had to be redrawn repeatedly, a total of four times, through 2010.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom element--supporting\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"a0abf86a-cf7d-402f-a24a-7e2898260047\" data-atom-type=\"explainer\"> \n  <div>\n   <figure class=\"element element-explainer element-atom\" data-display-type=\"flat\"> \n    <h1>How will the election be decided? </h1> \n    <div>\n     <p>The president is chosen through the electoral college, in which each state is assigned a \n      <gu-note title=\"Vicky Frost 22/9/2016 at 12:21\" data-note-edited-by=\"Vicky Frost\" data-note-edited-date=\"2016-09-22T11:21:30.549Z\" data-click-action=\"collapse\" data-note-id=\"80ca109a-7c23-445f-d54c-9ce6f6ccc7e6\" class=\"note note--start note--end\">\n       \u200bcertain \n      </gu-note>\u200bnumber of \n      <gu-note class=\"note note--start note--end\" data-note-edited-by=\"Vicky Frost\" data-note-edited-date=\"2016-09-22T11:18:42.316Z\" data-click-action=\"collapse\" data-note-id=\"b36c395a-1920-42b2-b57b-faa721b9d586\" title=\"Vicky Frost 22/9/2016 at 12:18\">\n       \u200bvotes called \n      </gu-note>\u200belectoral votes&nbsp;(EVs)\n      <gu-note class=\"note note--start note--end\" data-note-edited-by=\"Vicky Frost\" data-note-edited-date=\"2016-09-22T11:13:04.426Z\" data-click-action=\"collapse\" data-note-id=\"a3e31fdb-e028-4a34-e986-31a419d7747e\" title=\"Vicky Frost 22/9/2016 at 12:13\">\n       \u200b.

As the districts changed, North Carolina lawmakers also passed new restrictions that prohibited voters from registering on election day and required IDs to cast ballots. The US supreme court struck down a key provision of the Voting Rights Act, further gutting election laws in the Tar Heel State.</p> \n<p>With new GOP-drawn borders, Republicans in 2012 won nine of the state\u2019s 13 congressional seats even though Democrats cast more votes statewide. Two years later, Republicans picked up an additional seat despite the fact more Democrats were registered to vote.</p> \n<p>The Rev William Barber, the preacher behind the left-leaning Moral Monday movement, criticized the GOP-backed plan for containing \u201capartheid voting districts \u201d that were designed to disenfranchise African-American voters. \u201cApartheid is not the way for our representatives to be elected,\u201d said civil rights lawyer Adam Stein earlier this year at an NAACP press conference. \u201cNorth Carolina citizens have been put into districts because of their race rather than where they live.\u201d</p> \n<p>There had long been calls to remove politics from the redistricting process. Last year three state lawmakers \u2013 a Democrat and two Republicans \u2013 dropped separate bills that were ultimately unsuccessful. State representative Jeff Jackson, a Democrat and the author of one of those measures, says he nearly copied word-for-word an old Republican bill from its days as the minority party \u2013 but to no avail.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s like monkeys throwing darts,\u201d Jackson says of the current process. \u201cVirtually any system of redistricting would be far superior than what North Carolina has now.\u201d</p> \n<p>If passed, Jackson\u2019s proposal would have established an impartial nine-person commission tasked with drawing maps starting in 2030. But Daniel Rufty, chairman of North Carolina\u2019s Republican party in the 12th district, considers independent redistricting to be a \u201cna\u00efve\u201d idea. Whatever changes, whenever the changes happen, he says a new method of map drawing would still require appointees to oversee the process. Who will be appointing those individuals? Partisan officials.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe 12th district doesn\u2019t make sense,\u201d Rufty says. \u201cIt was drawn for partisan reasons that, like it or not, are constitutional. I don\u2019t exactly like it like that. But it is what it is.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/10/nc-party-redistrict/\" data-alt=\"All the shapes of the 12th district\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/10/nc-party-redistrict/\">All the shapes of the 12th district</a> \n <figcaption>\n  All the shapes of the 12th district\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>For now, the 12th district is no longer gerrymandered. A federal court tossed out the map in February as it pointed to evidence that \u201crace was the only nonnegotiable criterion\u201d used in drawing the district borders, and the legislature has since redrawn the district.</p> \n<p>But while the 12th is more compact, black people no longer account for the majority of registered voters like they once did.</p> \n<p>Several residents appealed to challenge the court ruling. Now the issue \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/09/north-carolina-congressional-primary-voting-districts-alma-adams\">which threw some congressional primaries into chaos this past June</a> \u2013 has landed on the US supreme court\u2019s fall docket. Lawyers challenging the lower court\u2019s decision argue the judges made their decision based on political affiliation rather than just race.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt remains undisputed that there is a very high correlation between African American voters and voters who regularly vote a straight Democratic ticket and support national Democratic candidates,\u201d the lawyer says.</p> \n<p>If the US supreme court overturns the rulings, it\u2019s likely that lawmakers would need to redraw the 12th\u2019s maps yet again. No matter the ruling, though, the effects of a quarter-century of gerrymandering in the 12th won\u2019t be undone overnight. Michael Dickerson, director of the Mecklenburg County board of elections, said that only 37,400 people of 520,000 registered voters cast ballots in the state\u2019s last election \u2013 the postponed June congressional primary.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e9c92738309e34feb2e9d1a2ffec74dc53d88ae9\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e9c92738309e34feb2e9d1a2ffec74dc53d88ae9/0_0_1000_600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Congresswoman Alma Adams canvasses a Charlotte neighborhood on the final day of early voting before the 12th district primary.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Congresswoman Alma Adams canvasses a Charlotte neighborhood on the final day of early voting before the 12th district primary.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Max Blau</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Congresswoman Alma Adams, who represents the 12th, won a heated primary with six other candidates. But if the incumbent Democrat gets re-elected next month \u2013 which is likely since Democrats outnumber Republicans there by a two-to-one margin \u2013 she will have done so with just 2% of total registered voters. She concedes winning that way, though beneficial to her, is a \u201cdisservice\u201d to the wider district.</p> \n<p>Without broader redistricting reform, she says, the lasting effects of gerrymandering could continue to dissuade constituents from casting ballots.</p> \n<p>\u201cPeople get discouraged,\u201d Adams said. \u201cThey don\u2019t bother to vote.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>The Global Warming Policy Foundation (GWPF) is an anti-climate policy advocacy group in the UK that often releases <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2014/mar/10/global-warming-optimism-unjustified-high-sensitivity\">misleading scientific \u201creports.\u201d</a> The group also hosts annual lectures, and this year, they booked a room at the Royal Society. Many members of the Royal Society expressed concern that the GWPF would exploit the organization\u2019s credibility, and <a href=\"http://www.desmog.uk/2016/10/05/exclusive-royal-society-under-internal-pressure-cancel-venue-booking-global-warming-policy-foundation\">asked that the event be cancelled</a>. <br></p> <p>The Royal Society\u2019s governing council met and <a href=\"http://www.desmog.uk/2016/10/12/world-s-oldest-scientific-academy-royal-society-allow-climate-denying-gwpf-lecture-go-ahead-despite-internal\">decided to allow the event to proceed</a>, for fear that cancellation would give it \u201can unwarranted higher profile.\u201d As a spokesperson for the Royal Society told DeSmog UK:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><em>The evidence shows us that the earth is warming and that recent warming is largely caused by human activities. Once that is accepted, there is scope for debate on the policy responses and that is the area that the GWPF claims to be interested in. </em></p> <p><em>If the GWPF uses this opportunity to misrepresent the scientific evidence it would undermine the legitimacy of its views on policy responses to climate change.</em></p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.thegwpf.com/matt-ridley-global-warming-versus-global-greening/\">The lecture</a> was delivered by writer <a href=\"http://www.skepticalscience.com/Matt_Ridley_blog.htm\">Matt Ridley</a>, and predictably, as is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2015/jan/21/matt-ridley-wants-to-gamble-earths-future-because-wont-learn-from-past\">the norm for Ridley</a>, the first three-quarters of his talk indeed misrepresented the scientific evidence. While Ridley doesn\u2019t deny the most basic aspects of human-caused global warming, he is a self-prescribed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2015/may/13/lukewarmers-the-third-stage-of-climate-denial\">\u201clukewarmer;\u201d a group that falls into the category of Stage 3 climate denial</a>.</p> <p>Ridley\u2019s lecture is a 5,600-word <a href=\"http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Gish_Gallop\">Gish Gallop</a> that would require a novel to fully debunk. However, he condensed his main arguments into four key points that are easily refuted:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><em>Why do I think the risk from global warming is being exaggerated? For four principal reasons.</em></p> <p><em>1. All environmental predictions of doom always are;<br> 2. the models have been consistently wrong for more than 30 years;<br> 3. the best evidence indicates that climate sensitivity is relatively low;<br> 4. the climate science establishment has a vested interest in alarm.</em></p> </blockquote> <h2><strong>We\u2019ve solved previous environmental problems, so let\u2019s not solve global warming?</strong></h2> <p>Ridley\u2019s first argument against the dangers of global warming is incredibly ironic. He claims that we have nothing to worry about because previous \u201cenvironmental predictions of gloom\u201d were wrong. But the reason his cited predictions of danger didn\u2019t come to fruition, in most cases, is because we took action to stop them.</p> <p>For example, Ridley lists acid rain and cancer-causing pesticides among his purported \u201cexaggerated\u201d environmental concerns. Many pesticides that were widely used in the 20<sup>th</sup> century are indeed carcinogenic, and their agricultural use was banned under the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stockholm_Convention_on_Persistent_Organic_Pollutants\">Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants</a>. Acid rain caused by sulfur pollution was also a widespread problem until it was similarly addressed, for example through <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1985_Helsinki_Protocol_on_the_Reduction_of_Sulphur_Emissions\">the Helsinki Protocol</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid_rain#Emissions_trading\">a cap and trade system in the US</a> whose <a href=\"https://www.hks.harvard.edu/m-rcbg/heep/papers/SO2-Brief_digital_final.pdf\">economic benefits have outweighed its costs by a factor of roughly 100</a>.</p> <p>Proposed solutions to global warming involve <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2015/dec/14/the-paris-agreement-signals-that-deniers-have-lost-the-climate-wars\">international agreements</a> and cap and trade or other <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2014/jun/13/how-revenue-neutral-carbon-tax-creates-jobs-grows-economy\">pollution pricing systems</a> \u2013 the same mechanisms that successfully solved these previous environmental threats. Yet Ridley remarkably uses those threats as examples in his argument <em>against </em>taking similar steps to address the threats posed by climate change. It defies logic.</p> <h2><strong>Climate models have been remarkably accurate</strong></h2> <p>I\u2019ve written <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Climatology-Versus-Pseudoscience-Exposing-Predictions-ebook/dp/B00TIXVLZS/ref=mt_kindle?_encoding=UTF8&amp;me=\">a book focused on the accuracy of climate model predictions</a>, and in December I\u2019ll be <a href=\"https://agu.confex.com/agu/fm16/meetingapp.cgi/Session/15993\">presenting a talk on the subject at the annual American Geophysical Union conference</a>. In fact, the most recent research shows that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2016/jul/05/new-research-climate-may-be-more-sensitive-and-situation-more-dire\">climate models are even more accurate than previously thought</a>. So, were I not familiar with Ridley\u2019s long history of misrepresenting climate science, I would have been surprised that climate model accuracy is one of the main premises of his argument against climate concern.</p> <p>To make his case, Ridley relies on material from a few scientists like <a href=\"http://www.skepticalscience.com/John_Christy_blog.htm\">John Christy</a>, presented not in peer-reviewed journals, but instead for example <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2016/jan/18/ted-cruz-fact-check-which-temperature-data-are-the-best\">in Congressional hearings</a>. Recently, as John Abraham wrote, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2016/oct/14/climate-scientists-published-a-paper-debunking-ted-cruz\">climate scientists published a paper explaining the errors in those presentations</a>. Models have also accurately predicted other key climate changes, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2016/jul/27/climate-models-are-accurately-predicting-ocean-and-global-warming\">for example in ocean heat content</a>. There is simply no factual basis to Ridley\u2019s argument against climate model accuracy.</p> <h2><strong>Ridley\u2019s climate sensitivity cherry picking</strong></h2> <p>Joanna Haigh, Royal Society fellow and council member, <a href=\"http://www.desmog.uk/2016/10/18/scientists-reject-gwpf-climate-denial-lecture-delivered-royal-society-world-s-oldest-scientific-academy\">told DeSmog UK</a> of Ridley\u2019s of third key argument:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><em>Ridley claims not to dispute the science, he then disputes climate sensitivity estimates with selective citations.</em></p> </blockquote> <p>This is a nice way of saying that Ridley cherry picks the evidence he prefers and ignores the rest. <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2015/07/22/opinions/cook-techniques-climate-change-denial/\">Cherry picking is one of the five telltale techniques of science denial</a>. Being a self-described \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2015/may/13/lukewarmers-the-third-stage-of-climate-denial\">lukewarmer</a>\u201d like Ridley generally means believing that the climate is relatively insensitive to the increased greenhouse effect, and that climate change is therefore of little concern. In his talk, Ridley claimed:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><em>recent attempts to measure the sensitivity of the climate system to carbon dioxide using real data nearly all find that it is much lower than the models assume.</em></p> </blockquote> <p>This claim is nonsense. There have been a few papers suggesting a relatively low climate sensitivity, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2016/jan/12/nasa-study-fixes-error-in-low-contrarian-climate-sensitivity-estimates\">several subsequent studies have found those papers to be flawed</a>. There have also been other studies \u201cusing real data\u201d \u2013 for example, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2015/apr/30/overlooked-evidence-global-warming-may-proceed-faster-than-expected\">measurements of cloud and humidity changes</a> \u2013 suggesting that the Earth\u2019s climate sensitivity to the increased greenhouse effect is relatively high. It\u2019s also important to note that were Ridley right about low climate sensitivity, <a href=\"https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn23565-a-second-chance-to-save-the-climate/\">it would only buy us perhaps a decade or two</a> before the worst climate change consequences hit.</p> <p>In short, Ridley cherry picks the few papers that support his preferred position, neglects to mention that subsequent research has identified flaws in those studies, and ignores the vast body of research contradicting his beliefs.</p> <h2><strong>Conspiracy theories</strong></h2> <p>Ridley\u2019s fourth key argument, and a theme throughout his talk, exemplifies another telltale sign of science denial \u2013 conspiratorial thinking. He accuses climate scientists of having \u201cvested interests,\u201d of delaying publication of their results (<a href=\"http://sites.bu.edu/cliveg/mynenis-response-to-lord-ridleys-gwpf-talk/\">refuted by the accused scientists here</a>), of deleting and \u201cmysteriously\u2026adjusting\u201d inconvenient data, and so on. The easiest way to reject inconvenient data and expert conclusions is to declare that they\u2019re somehow biased. It\u2019s not unlike <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/12/donald-trump-climate-change-science-sierra-club\">fellow climate contrarian</a> Donald Trump\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/17/man-who-cried-rigged-problem-with-trump-election-claims\">claims that the presidential election is rigged against him</a>. Whether it be an election or an argument, if the other side cheated and conspired, then you didn\u2019t really lose.</p> <p>But there is no conspiracy. Ridley and GWPF want to risk humanity\u2019s future on their belief that climate change isn\u2019t dangerous. The problem is that their belief is premised on misleading, cherry picked, faulty, and conspiratorial arguments. As the Royal Society noted, by misrepresenting the scientific evidence, GWPF undermined the legitimacy of its policy views. </p> <p>We should be have a climate debate about the best policies to solve the problem. Groups that deny the problem by misrepresenting science only serve to distract from that much-needed debate, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2015/oct/05/the-republican-party-stands-alone-in-climate-denial\">outside of Donald Trump\u2019s Republican Party, they\u2019re no longer being listened to</a>.<br></p>",

I had a job for a long time at a country club. I would say through that I\u2019ve been subject to employment discrimination as a female who\u2019s trans.</p> <p>There are also the insinuations that we\u2019re lazy, use drugs, we\u2019re all thieves. In Hazelnut Grove, where I\u2019m lucky enough to live, we\u2019re an intentional community. If you steal from someone, you\u2019re run the hell out. Here there\u2019s the idea that if you put into the community, the community reciprocates. I feel like that type of culture is being squeezed out during the gentrification process [of Portland]. Property values are taking precedence over community.</p> <h2>Andrew Constantino, 41: \u2018I have to watch the train wreck\u2019</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"dd407800bd70c16ff416b30f0a770bc6c99ba5b6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dd407800bd70c16ff416b30f0a770bc6c99ba5b6/0_200_1700_2350/723.jpg\" alt=\"Andrew Constantino\" width=\"723\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Andrew Constantino in Seattle.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Annabel Clark</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I\u2019m voting for Hillary. On her own merits, she\u2019s committed to social issues and doing good. I would never even consider voting for Trump. But I have to watch the train wreck; I cannot stop myself.</p> <p>Some people think anyone getting government assistance automatically votes liberal, but that\u2019s absolutely not true. You hear all these Trump lovers here. I try telling them, \u201cDo you realize he\u2019s the type of person who doesn\u2019t care about anything that\u2019s ever happened to you?\u201d But it\u2019s like being with your family at Thanksgiving; you try avoiding those conversations because they go nowhere.</p> <p>I\u2019ve lived in Seattle for almost 20 years. It\u2019s become more and more expensive to survive. When my girlfriend and I lost our jobs very close together, we burned through our savings.</p> <p>We\u2019re both working full time again, but it\u2019s just that there are no good options. I refuse to pay some exorbitant amount of rent to live in absolute poverty. I\u2019d rather do this until there\u2019s a reasonable option.</p> <h2>Roxy Garske, 58: \u2018I don\u2019t trust Hillary after the emails\u2019</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"6610f8b8663f4cf3b680fd188a81a22a1e03b1b9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6610f8b8663f4cf3b680fd188a81a22a1e03b1b9/0_211_1700_2339/727.jpg\" alt=\"Roxy Garske\" width=\"727\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Roxy Garske in Seattle.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Annabel Clark</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I\u2019m voting for Gary Johnson because he\u2019s not one of the other two. I don\u2019t like Hillary because I don\u2019t believe what she says; I don\u2019t trust her after the emails. I think she\u2019s too rightwing. She\u2019s more interested in the needs of the rich and powerful.</p> <p>If I could only vote between her and Trump, I\u2019d choose her. The thought of him winning scares me, especially for women. I\u2019ve got two daughters and two granddaughters. If he\u2019s voted in, he\u2019ll turn back the clock. He\u2019s already stirring up trouble by getting people worried about immigrants.</p> <p>None of the candidates are addressing homelessness. It\u2019s an invisible society. Lots of people here don\u2019t know they can vote. But when we had a voter drive, around 30 people registered and were excited to find they could vote.</p> <p>I have peripheral neuropathy and spinal stenosis. This is the second time I\u2019ve been homeless. About five years ago, my husband said, \u201cI\u2019m going to get stuck taking care of you.\u201d He said he wanted a divorce, which is fine. I was homeless while I waited for the settlement but then I got a house. I had to go into hospital and while I was very unwell; I lost my house. It went into foreclosure in July. I stayed with friends but they\u2019ve got some other people staying there now, but I\u2019m going back when they\u2019re gone. I\u2019m just here for a month.</p> <h2>Marvin Ross, 56: \u2018A woman will be better off running the country\u2019</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"1c7a1aed49103eaede4c759cf6f81e9f857e1214\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1c7a1aed49103eaede4c759cf6f81e9f857e1214/0_270_1700_2280/746.jpg\" alt=\"Marvin Ross\" width=\"746\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Marvin Ross in Portland.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Annabel Clark</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Donald Trump is not important to me.

Why would he want to step down?</p> <p>I think a woman will be better off running the country than a man anyway. Look at how long men have run this country and how they\u2019ve messed it up. I haven\u2019t always voted but when I have, it\u2019s been Democrat.</p> <p>Right now, I\u2019m living in a big tent. I\u2019ve got a real bed. My clothes on hangers. All my CDs. I\u2019m here for the long term. I\u2019m building my own tiny house; I\u2019m just waiting for more wood. I\u2019ve never built a house before; I\u2019m learning from watching others. I\u2019ve got a criminal background for drug possession that keeps me from renting. But I\u2019ve never tried to rent. I\u2019ve lived with girlfriends and family members.

I can\u2019t really do news. What\u2019s happening in front of me right now, today, is what matters. But it\u2019s still important to me to cast my vote because if I don\u2019t vote, I\u2019ve got no right to bitch.</p> <p>I want to vote for Bernie Sanders, so I\u2019m going to write his name in. If I had to choose between Trump and Clinton, I\u2019d choose Trump because I\u2019m not sure about a woman having that much control yet. I respect Trump because he\u2019s built everything from nothing. But I don\u2019t think he\u2019s the right guy for the job. It\u2019s all kind of confusing in my head.</p> <p>I moved my husband and myself here in July. He has Parkinson\u2019s and this is where he gets treated. We came from Alaska where we could get housing but we were in drugs real bad. We were doing marijuana and meth. We can\u2019t afford rent here but if we return, I know he\u2019ll go right back to it. He\u2019s angry at me for keeping us homeless. But we\u2019re doing good. We\u2019ve been sober since July. I still drink once in a while. We got a room on Monday and I got six beers.</p> <h2>Cierra Discher, 30: \u2018I\u2019m voting for Trump\u2019</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"a63dc90f3e9dc3849a3e25b1f29985a4b17452e5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a63dc90f3e9dc3849a3e25b1f29985a4b17452e5/0_186_1700_2364/719.jpg\" alt=\"Cierra Discher\" width=\"719\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cierra Discher in Seattle.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Annabel Clark</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I\u2019m voting for Trump.

I mean if somebody else was president, would I still be sitting here? Probably. But I hear it\u2019s better to vote for the wrong person than not at all. And I\u2019m registered.</p> <p>Last night was my first night on the streets. I slept behind a building. This will be my first night at Tent City 3 \u2013 they\u2019ve just given me a tent. I was staying at my boyfriend\u2019s but I found out he was Mexican drug mafia. I left while he was at work and went to a hotel for two days.</p> <p>I used meth yesterday so I\u2019m pretty emotional. I\u2019m about to go into treatment. I\u2019ve waited two months for that and hopefully it will get me on my feet.</p> <p>My ballot will go to my mom\u2019s house.

I don\u2019t know too much about Hillary Clinton.</p> <p>I became homeless three years ago.

I tried to join the International Socialist Organization when they started a chapter there. But it was pretty bougie. They\u2019d complain about the problems, then go to a coffee shop to buy a $7 latte, walking past a homeless person on the way out.</p> <p>I love Portland. The people are awesome. But there\u2019s not enough housing for the population. And the housing policies are causing a lot of houselessness. Like no-cause evictions [in which a landlord can terminate a contract for no reason with 30 days\u2019 notice] and the applications fee you have to pay every time you apply to rent somewhere.

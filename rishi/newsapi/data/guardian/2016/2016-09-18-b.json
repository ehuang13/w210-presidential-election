  "<p>If there was a high point in the reputation and significance of fact checkers, wonks and poll crunchers it came during the 2012 US presidential campaign. It was the election where former president Bill Clinton held court at the 2012 Democratic National Convention in Miami for just under an hour. </p> <p>Such was the avalanche of statistics that night that fact check site Politifact called it \u201c<a href=\"http://www.factcheck.org/2012/09/our-clinton-nightmare/\">Our Clinton Nightmare</a>\u201d, bemoaning the \u201ceffort required to run down his many statistics and factual claims, producing little for us to write about\u201d.<br></p> <p>The numbers just rolled off Clinton\u2019s tongue \u2013 4.5 million private sector jobs, 500,000 manufacturing jobs, 250,000 more people working in the auto industry, 3 million young people between 19 and 25 insured for the first time, health care costs rising at under 4%. \u201cLook,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/05/us/politics/transcript-of-bill-clintons-speech-to-the-democratic-national-convention.html?_r=0\">he said to the faithful</a>, \u201chere\u2019s what really happened.

Here\u2019s what really happened.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2016/jul/21/housing-affordability-inequality-and-our-flatlining-household-incomes\">Housing affordability, inequality, and our flatlining household incomes | Greg Jericho</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It was the first Twitter presidential election, and thus the first campaign to feature the instant fact-check. It was the election in which Barack Obama cited fact checkers in the <a href=\"http://debates.org/index.php?page=october-22-2012-the-third-obama-romney-presidential-debate\">third presidential debate</a> to counter Mitt Romney\u2019s assertion that Obama had gone on an \u201capology tour\u201d.</p> <p>It was also the election in which the poll aggregators such as Nate Silver had put down their glasses by the time of that third debate, and called the race for Obama. It was the election where insiders such as the Wall Street Journal\u2019s Peggy Noonan came to grief, believing their finger on the pulse was <a href=\"http://blogs.wsj.com/peggynoonan/2012/11/05/monday-morning/\">more accurate than the polls</a>.</p> <p>It was a total victory for the wonks, the fact checkers, the poll crunchers.</p> <p>Four years later we have Donald Trump winning the Republican Party nomination with a record number of fact-checked lies, the British voting to leave the EU despite all advice to the contrary, the local ABC\u2019s own fact-checking unit being axed and Nate Silver\u2019s <a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/hey-at-least-the-cavs-might-not-get-swept/\">538 statistical site</a> even getting the result of the NBA final series wrong.</p> <p>What the hell? With this seeming failure has come no small amount of glee from progressives. While poll analysts and fact checkers are not the same, they do work on the same side of the street, and are the cause of much angst among progressives, which would seem odd given progressives as a rule generally perform better on fact checks.</p> <p>After the recent Australian federal election, Fairfax\u2019s Matthew Knott reviewed the media\u2019s coverage, <a href=\"http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/federal-election-2016-opinion/election-2016-the-uncomfortable-truth-is-the-media-got-it-wrong-how-did-we-do-it-20160705-gpzatm\">in which he admitted</a>, \u201cThose political reporters not too hubristic to engage in self doubt are asking: did we get it wrong? Did we, as a collective, miss the story?\u201d</p> <p>The story that was seemingly missed was not a policy or a hidden funding cut, but the margin of victory by the LNP. But really, who gives a damn? If you think the prime role of your job as a journalist covering an election is to predict the results, then there is a lot more wrong than just whether or not your prediction was faulty.</p> <p>But the devotion to polling and prediction is also a concern for progressives because inherently polls \u2013 and thus their analysis \u2013 reinforce the status quo. As US political scientist Benjamin Ginsberg has noted, the growth of public polling has been \u201cmost damaging to the political fortunes of the groups that represented the interest and aspirations of the working classes\u201d.</p> <p>Without polling, politicians can only gauge voters\u2019 moods on certain issues either through meetings with constituents, letters or through observing political actions such as protests, strikes or rallies. Polls can give equal weight to the attitudes of the uninterested and the politically active.</p> <p>For the progressive wonks the worry is not so much about advocating policies or programs that are detrimental to society, but whether the need for data and evidence means your arguments are being ignored by those who matter (itself an issue for debate) and that secondly you are pushing the debate towards the centre \u2013 and also being part of the movement that then pushes that centre ever more to the right.</p> <p>Among the most common strawman arguments is that the Brexit vote and Trump\u2019s ascendancy prove that relying on fact-checking and wonks is doomed to failure. And there may be truth in that, but I\u2019ve yet to hear anyone suggest that facts should be the only weapon used in a debate. No election \u2013 not even the fact-checking triumph of 2012 \u2013 has ever been won on the basis of who told the fewest lies. Similarly no policy debate has ever been won just because a group of experts did a review and someone tweeted a graph.</p> <p>If you are arguing that there needs to be action on climate change, yes you\u2019re going to need more than a graph to do it. But you\u2019re also going to struggle without one. A concept as divorced from most people\u2019s lives as is climate change needs at the very least to be fought with data \u2013 especially when the opposing side is doing its best to suggest their data shows there is no need to worry. Among the most influential examples was the ultra-wonky documentary An Inconvenient Truth. Did the film win the debate? Did its numerous graphs on climate change lead to global action that saw a price on carbon? Well no, but that\u2019s not to say nothing was gained \u2013 more perhaps that progressives have a tendency to discredit their victories. Australia did implement a price on carbon.</p> <p>Now perhaps the reason the ALP subsequently lost the 2013 election was because there was too much of an emphasis on data and economic neoliberalism and not enough talk of values. Or perhaps the main reason we no longer have a price on carbon is because the ALP lost the election after three years fanning a dumpster-fire of internal division.</p> <p>Who can say. But the wonk critics do also have a point. Despite what the authors of books such as Freakonomics might attest, economics neither explains everything in life nor persuades. Fact-checking is particularly useless at countering prejudice. A graph on the improvement of GDP from immigration is unlikely to switch the votes of people from Trump or One Nation hostile to the very idea of foreigners.</p> <p>While there may be some objective centrists, I would argue in Australia the progressive wonks \u2013 and I put myself in this camp \u2013 write as much with passion for a cause as they do with passion for facts. When I write an article to dismiss the claims regarding the numbers of welfare recipients, I don\u2019t do it from some neutral point of view. I do it because people are lying in order to hurt the most disadvantaged in society. I\u2019m not going to ignore the lie\u2014and using facts to counter it is not I would argue some anodyne approach.</p> <p>The adherence to data can easily lead the wonks to prefer the safety of the status quo. This was something I was conscious of when arguing against the Abbott plan for extending paid parental leave to full replacement-wage level for 26 weeks. I argued that such a plan <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2014/mar/10/abbotts-paid-parental-leave-will-do-little-to-bring-women-to-the-workforce\">would do little to increase women\u2019s workforce participation</a> (the aim of the policy), and that the money would be better spent on child care. I could see the moral argument that paid parental leave should be paid regardless of the parents\u2019 income, but I could also see the moral argument that governments should aim to improve the standard of living for women with children. For me the better policy response was in broader childcare policy rather than an expanded PPL. </p> <p>But the risk \u2013 as soon as you suggest factors such as the size of a budget deficit should be considered \u2013 is that such an approach will always see you favouring a more centrist position. Consider for example the common argument about government spending and the size of the budget. During the last election campaign Anthony Albanese argued that \u201cspending is higher as a proportion of GDP today than it was under the global financial crisis\u201d. The ABC\u2019s fact-checking unit <a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-05-31/fact-check-is-government-spending-today-higher-than-gfc/7459392\">found that statement to be incorrect</a> because in one year during the GFC government spending was marginally higher.</p> <p>This set off quite a debate \u2013 especially online involving economist Stephen Koukoulas, who argued the ABC fact checkers had taken far too narrow a view of what constituted the GFC period. And yet to what end was the fight? Do progressives really care that the ALP spent less than an LNP government? Doesn\u2019t that merely reinforce the conservative position that smaller government is better?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/08/close-call-how-the-pollsters-got-the-election-result-right\">Close call: how the pollsters got the election result right | Peter Lewis</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Progressives love to blame themselves. Rare is an election defeat by the ALP that does not result in great internal angst, gnashing of teeth and writing of books charting what went right and what needs to be done. Such self-reflection certainly is preferable to the view that it is always the other side or the media which that is at fault \u2013 or even worse, that voters are to blame. But the anti-wonk fight is a futile one. Progressives should not give up on the facts, if only because doing so cedes the space to the conservative forces.<br></p> <p>The wonks themselves need, however, to watch whether their work is merely perpetuating a status quo due to a fear of the bold, or a disinclination to countenance an upset, or because the lines within which they fight have been laid out by the conservative side. </p> <p>But mostly they need to be wary that their adherence to the data can see them lose sight of the greater truth: that despite what some might have thought in 2012, facts \u2013 whether they be on GDP, climate temperatures or any other data \u2013 are not the only truth in life, or politics.</p> <p><strong>This is an edited extract of an essay that appears in the <a href=\"https://www.mup.com.au/items/190003\">spring issue of Meanjin</a>, out 15 September.

Despite Le Pen\u2019s sidelining of her father and party co-founder, Jean-Marie Le Pen, and her long quest to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/apr/10/le-pen-feud-family-drama-in-battle-for-the-soul-of-front-national-and-france\">\u201cdetoxify\u201d</a> her party of the racist, jack-booted, antisemitic imagery of the past, a majority of French voters still question whether the party is capable of governing France. </p> <p>Outside Le Pen\u2019s heartlands there is a widespread fear of the party, which many continue to associate with the old tags of demagoguery, xenophobia or racism. The party still faces a barrage of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/dec/11/le-pen-french-tactical-voting-to-fight-rise-of-far-right\">tactical voting </a>by the right and left to stop it winning final-round votes \u2013 described by one Lille party worker as \u201cthe onslaught of an armada\u201d. This clubbing together of right and left parties against the FN prevented it from winning any constituencies in last year\u2019s regional elections despite taking a historic 6.8m votes. </p> <p>Smiling, Le Pen chatted to journalists backstage at her party conference, saying she was confident she could expand her electorate far enough to win. Her aim in this pre-campaign period is to present herself as credible, to move away from divisive positions and to re-position herself as a kind of calm, unifying authority. She said she would run a \u201cjoyous\u201d campaign. Her aides said she felt her chances were better than ever. \u201cWith the designation of Trump in the US, and Brexit, analysts should be a bit more modest, there\u2019s a global awakening,\u201d Le Pen said. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/06/demagogues-and-cheats-un-human-rights-chief-condemns-trump-and-wilders\">'Demagogues and cheats': UN rights chief condemns Trump and Wilders</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Above all, if Le Pen makes it through to the second round, she wants to avoid the fate that befell her father when he shocked France by reaching the final round in 2002.More than a million angry demonstrators took to the streets in protest against Le Pen senior who was subsequently squarely beaten when 82% of voters from all parties opted for Jacques Chirac, in order to keep the FN at bay.</p> <p>This time, if Marine Le Pen makes the second round, she is likely to seriously narrow the gap.

This serves to legitimise FN ideas, party members argue. </p> <p>While Sarkozy has controversially called for the locking up of anyone suspected of radicalisation even if they have committed no crime, Le Pen has sat back and argued for protecting the rule of law, aiming to show she is less divisive than him. </p> <p>David Rachline, the young FN mayor of Fr\u00e9jus who will serve as Le Pen\u2019s campaign director, said her ideas were now \u201cmajority-held views in France\u201d.</p> <p>Gilbert Collard, one of Le Pen\u2019s MPs, said: \u201cWho in France can say that everything\u2019s going well, that the economy\u2019s good, that there\u2019s security, that terrorism has been controlled, the nation preserved?

Analysts said the rise in prices was unlikely to have much influence on the Fed, because it was mostly the result of the biggest jump in health costs for 32 years and a modest increase in housing rents, while food and consumer goods prices remained flat.</p> <p>A decision to freeze rates would bring the Fed into line with the Bank of England and the European Central Bank, which both kept interest rates at historic lows at their September meetings.</p> <p>As the focus turns to the Fed and the Bank of Japan, which could add further stimulus to its already broad package of measures to cut the cost of credit, Claudio Borio, the head of the BIS\u2019s monetary and economic department, said at the launch of the quarterly bulletin: \u201cIt is becoming increasingly evident that central banks have been overburdened for far too long\u201d.</p> <p>The bulletin outlined how markets had responded since the UK\u2019s vote in June to leave the EU, which prompted the Bank of England to cut rates <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/04/bank-of-england-cuts-uk-interest-rates\">for the first time in more than seven years</a> to 0.25%. \u201cThrough a combination of near zero, or even negative, policy rates, large-scale asset purchases and forward guidance, central banks have been seeking to ease financial conditions in order to boost the economy and, above all, to bring inflation up closer to their numerical objectives,\u201d Borio said.</p> <p>\u201cDevelopments in the period under review have highlighted once more just how dependent on central banks markets have become,\u201d he said.

It is under pressure to do so from savers who have spent the last eight years locked into zero interest accounts, and from regulators concerned that low interest rates are driving investors to speculate on the world\u2019s stock markets. </p> <p>The Republican presidential candidate, Donald Trump, has complained that low interests rates are denying savers a return on their pension funds and fostering a speculative stock market bubble. </p> <p>Marc Ostwald, a strategist at ADM Investor Services International, said the timing of the presidential vote could override other concerns. \u201cA September hike cannot be ruled out completely, above all given the fact that a November meeting hike looks to be off the table, given its proximity to the election,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The prospect of an interest rate rise in the US has receded after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/01/imf-urges-g20-to-champion-globalisation-at-china-summit\">the International Monetary Fund signalled</a> that it would be revising down <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/19/imf-cuts-uk-growth-forecasts-following-brexit-vote\">its July prediction of 3.1% growth for this year</a> when it publishes its World Economic Outlook next month. </p> <p>Employment figures also showed that the US suffered a lull in job creation last month.

  "<p>This interview was meant to happen months ago, but was cancelled at the last minute, rescheduled and then cancelled again, and this carried on all summer. When at last we meet, Malia Bouattia&#xa0;apologises with consummate elegance, blaming pressures on a diary over which she has \u201cno control at all\u201d. I have a strong suspicion that this is not true. She offers it without a trace of unease, and I&#xa0;can\u2019t decide whether the grace of what I\u2019m sure is a&#xa0;deceit is really quite impressive, or offputting. In fact I can\u2019t recall ever feeling so&#xa0;many powerful but contradictory emotions about someone I&#xa0;have only just met.</p> <p>Bouattia\u2019s manner can be almost glassily cool, but I think that\u2019s to hide how nervous she is, and the vulnerability is very touching. But the next minute she can become formidably impressive, and fill me with admiration, and seconds later become maddening. By the end I\u2019m so angry, I\u2019m ranting at her like a lunatic. \u201cFor the record,\u201d I yell, \u201cthis has never happened before! I am not in the habit of shouting in interviews!\u201d I am dying of embarrassment when I leave, and at a loss to explain why this&#xa0;happened.</p> <p>Bouattia, 28, has had to deal with so much anger by now that you might think she would be immune to it, but I don\u2019t think she is. Before <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/apr/22/malia-bouattia-election-nus-president-deeply-divisive-jewish-student-groups\" title=\"\">she became president of the National Union of Students (NUS) in April</a> she served two years as the union\u2019s black students\u2019 officer, during which she rejected a motion condemning Isis. She was promptly branded a terrorist sympathiser by the press, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/apr/24/new-nus-president-not-antisemitic-isis-sympathiser\" title=\"\">who chose not to report that her only objection to the motion was its poor wording</a>, which she wanted to correct. The deluge of death threats necessitated police protection, but still were nothing compared with the uproar her presidential election provoked. That Bouattia is the first black woman and first Muslim to be elected NUS president was lost in Fleet&#xa0;Street\u2019s frenzy to dig up old comments she had made that \u201cproved\u201d she was antisemitic.</p> <p>She had described the University of Birmingham as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/apr/21/nus-president-malia-bouattia-must-redress-concerns-over-antisemitism-say-jewish-students\" title=\"\">\u201csomething of a Zionist outpost\u201d and on another occasion referred to \u201cmainstream Zionist-led media outlets\u201d.</a> More than 300 Jewish leaders complained. \u201cThis was a few years ago and I was talking about quite a particular context where there were a lot of activists that were very vocally supportive of the state of Israel and its actions. I was part of the Palestine society that, for most of the years that I was involved in it, was just trying to exist as a society let alone actually build solidarity, so it was because of that opposition, the constant tension and having disruptions for events that were taking place \u2026 you know, holding solidarity demonstrations and having opposing ones with Israeli flags flying, speakers being heckled. I wasn\u2019t being critical of the number of Jewish students or the size of the Jewish society at Birmingham. It was very much in relation to the opposition to any kind of Palestine solidarity efforts that were taking place.\u201d</p> <p>She clarifies that she simply meant that Birmingham\u2019s student union had the biggest and most vociferously Zionist Jewish society, and that she was referring to media outlets that promote a heavily pro-Israeli line, not evoking the old conspiracy theory about Jewish control of the media.</p> <p>Bouattia thinks the real reason for all the animosity is not antisemitism, but the radicalism of her leftwing politics. Though not a Labour member, she is a big fan of Jeremy Corbyn, and believes it was her promise of a bolder political agenda that won her the election. \u201cWe need action, and we need it now, and we need it differently to what we\u2019ve had before. We can\u2019t come to the table trying to compromise any more. That hasn\u2019t worked.\u201d</p> <p>But Bouattia\u2019s political ambitions go way beyond campaigning against education cuts or fee hikes. \u201cWe want a sense of international solidarity. We don\u2019t sit in a bubble. We have international students, migrant communities, and we can\u2019t sit by and be silent when spaces for education are for us to be critical of the systems, and of this country\u2019s role in escalating international crises, and escalating oppression of other groups. Liberation campaigns relate their work back to global movements for justice and solidarity, and we\u2019re much stronger when we\u2019re united.\u201d</p> <p>Personally, I find this both quite touching and perfectly appropriate from a student politician. But judging from an average turnout in student union elections of just 18%, the majority of undergraduates don\u2019t. I was a bit of a student political hack, and within that small world Bouattia is perfectly recognisable. To the overwhelming majority of seven million NUS members, however, her views and values, even the language she uses, are incomprehensible. If they don\u2019t share her commitment to fighting global injustice, but care about how to pay their rent instead, shouldn\u2019t their union leader confine herself to representing their interests?</p> <p>But the NUS is fighting on all fronts, Bouattia says, and it campaigns just as hard on education issues as, say, Palestinian rights. I wonder how much time she has ever spent in the company of apolitical students who came to university for the football, beer and toga parties, and are bewildered and alienated by NUS motions calling for the abolition of all prisons. Why does she think, I ask, that student voter turnout is so low?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3a6bb8a594b1bdfa90531c9bd2ee9de3621b0af9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3a6bb8a594b1bdfa90531c9bd2ee9de3621b0af9/0_23_4248_2549/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Malia Bouattia, speaking at an NHS demonstration.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Malia Bouattia, speaking at an NHS demonstration.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Johnny Armstead/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know whether it\u2019s necessarily low if we compare it with voter turnout more generally.\u201d After I run through the average turnout for general, mayoral and devolved parliaments, she takes a new tack.</p> <p>\u201cOK, I think that when we think about the context in which we\u2019re in, where there\u2019s active demonisation of being politically active, you\u2019ve got the Prevent agenda [the government counter-terrorism programme to combat radicalisation], which is, like, actually hunting down students that choose to be politicised, particularly those who are racialised. We\u2019re at a time where things like the Prevent agenda quite explicitly target black and Muslim activists. I\u2019m seeing the realities of that, which is a turn away from taking political action. There is a total fear that they\u2019re going to be deported, and this is what they go home to. Their&#xa0;parents will tell them, \u2018You\u2019re going to end up in Guant\u00e1namo. You could end up deported to a homeland you\u2019re linked to, but have never even visited. You could end up having all your doors shut. You could end up being thrown out of university.\u2019 These are very real questions that people have to think about.\u201d</p> <p>Whether or not this is true, it still fails to explain why more than 80% of NUS members don\u2019t even turn out to vote. But I am struck by the scale of influence Bouattia accords to&#xa0;Prevent. Even if it frightened every single Muslim student away from politics, that would still only account for about 5% of NUS&#xa0;members.</p> <p>\u201cOh, but you see the Prevent agenda is not just simply targeting Muslims \u2013 as though an incredibly racist policy could even distinguish between the Muslims and non-Muslims. One black man with a beard and another, they all become Muslims, so, by extension, any racialised person becomes a target. And actually the agenda is targeting far more than that. It\u2019s a wider-reaching attack on politicised people and groups, anti-austerity activists, anti\u2011fracking activists, there\u2019s a whole host of people that this extends to now.\u201d Does she think Prevent\u2019s intention was always to target&#xa0;all forms of activism, and to use radicalisation as a convenient excuse to conceal grander ambitions?</p> <p>\u201cYes, I do believe that. I do believe that is has incredibly racist intentions, and intentions to crack down on people\u2019s civil liberties. I do believe&#xa0;that.\u201d</p> <p>If she could abolish Prevent today, what would she do to combat radicalisation? \u201cI would propose looking at the state of our foreign policy. And we\u2019ve cut every space of constructive engagement, like youth centres. Cost of living\u2019s increased, employment prospects are low, access to university is becoming ever harder. Even if people have accessed higher education, they\u2019ve accumulated vast amounts of debt. And have they had a positive experience, being forced to engage with content that doesn\u2019t relate to them, and perhaps is psychologically destructive? When we look at the incredibly Eurocentric curriculum, where people don\u2019t see themselves in what they\u2019re studying, and can\u2019t relate to it, and feel that their European counterparts hit the ground running, they can\u2019t see themselves advancing in the subjects.\u201d</p> <p>Bouattia says she has no ambitions for a political career, and sees her future in academia instead, which may be for the best, as I\u2019m not sure how her anti-radicalisation strategy would go down on the doorstep. But if her politics would strike most British voters as extreme, they make more sense from the perspective of her own life experience.</p> <p>Until the age of seven, she had a blissfully happy childhood in Algeria, but in the civil war academics became targets for abduction and murder, and the family fled to Birmingham. Taken in by Christian ministries, they found themselves in an alien world of brussels sprouts and a language Bouattia could not speak. She was fluent within two months, but remained desperately homesick, and consoled herself by drawing the Algerian map all over everything at school.</p> <p>After studying a degree in culture studies she read an MA in postcolonial theory at the University of Birmingham, before becoming the NUS black students\u2019 officer and then president. \u201cBut I think the sense of displacement is still with me. When Daily Mail articles are written, and quite racist, Islamophobic trolls come after you over social media, you\u2019re very much reminded that people don\u2019t feel you belong here. My parents took us out to access a better space of education, to be better equipped to go back to Algeria and give back.\u201d Her election was widely celebrated in Algeria, and she goes on: \u201cThat made me more at ease with all that I do here, and how it feeds into the bigger picture, because at times when you\u2019re so intricately involved in something locally, you start to wonder how does this fit into the bigger picture? How does this fit into the wider struggle?\u201d</p> <p>I ask if she worries that the antisemitism row has diminished her power as president. \u201cNot necessarily. Not so far,\u201d is a surprising answer, but she says that she thinks the controversy raised the profile of the NUS, and provided new platforms for her \u201cto put out our vision of the future\u201d.</p> <p>Does she think she has ever said anything antisemitic? \u201cI don\u2019t. I don\u2019t, and if my words were misinterpreted, then in future I\u2019ll take the time to make sure I break them down and explain them.\u201d Are there any comments she has made in the past that she would not now say?\u201d She shakes her head. \u201cIt\u2019s not about not saying it again, it\u2019s about just breaking them down to explain what I meant.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"244e604b1cdb07808f41aa137e918fe268f270f5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/244e604b1cdb07808f41aa137e918fe268f270f5/0_300_6144_3686/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Students at Cardiff university prote against a planned lecture by Germaine Greer in 2015.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Students at Cardiff university prote against a planned lecture by Germaine Greer in 2015.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gareth Phillips/Gareth Phillips for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Some Jewish critics still maintain that she is antisemitic. Others argue that anti-Zionism is antisemitic. Bouattia maintains that they have misunderstood and misinterpreted her, and are wrong. I think this would be a perfectly defensible position for her to take if only she applied the same principle when student unions invoke the NUS\u2019s no-platform policy. I want to talk to her about Germaine Greer, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/nov/18/transgender-activists-protest-germaine-greer-lecture-cardiff-university\" title=\"\">who Cardiff University students\u2019 union demanded be no platformed last year</a>, owing to her views on transsexuals. This is when the argument begins.</p> <p>Most graduates of my age, I say, are appalled by a campus culture that no-platforms a speaker for holding opinions some students might find offensive. If someone cannot bear to be exposed to challenging views at university, what are they doing there? \u201cIt\u2019s a case of seeing those ideas as spreading forms of hatred.\u201d Does she think that Greer spreads hatred? \u201cI support the union\u2019s right to no-platform her. To hold transphobic views spreads hate.\u201d</p> <p>But Greer has repeatedly stated that she does not hate transsexuals, is not critical of their choices, and couldn\u2019t care less if anyone wants to reassign their gender. She simply does not share the belief that a man who decides to live as a woman was female all along, or that surgical procedures can wholly reassign gender.</p> <p>Now a woman sitting at what is known as the liberation desk in the office, who works on campaigns for LGBT, black, female and disabled students, gets involved. What Greer thinks she means is not the point, she says; the trans community consider her a \u201cfascist\u201d, the NUS respects their view, ergo Greer is a fascist.</p> <p>But Bouattia doesn\u2019t accept that just because some Jewish people consider her antisemitic, that means she is. Why, then, does she not accord this principle to anyone else? \u201cThis is the NUS policy,\u201d she repeats. It\u2019s like talking to a speaking clock. I suggest that when a policy ends up branding Greer a fascist, it\u2019s time for an urgent policy review. Universities exist as places where people engage with ideas, and learn; they are not meant to be sealed panic rooms, are they? \u201cThis is the NUS policy.\u201d</p> <p>While I get more and more worked up, Bouattia just smiles placidly. I ask her to call her parents the next day and ask them if they, as senior academics, agree that Greer is too dangerous to be allowed to talk to students. When I email Bouattia later in the week, she doesn\u2019t respond, and the press officer tells me she is out of the country and uncontactable.</p> <p>I get the impression that Bouattia is more fragile than the persona she presents. But perhaps, if one\u2019s own academic parents have been targets for&#xa0;assassination, the concept of safety on campus holds something different to mine.</p>",

According to court records, officials have been unable to find Caldara to serve him with a summons.<br></p> <p>Caldara and spokespeople for Trump\u2019s campaign did not respond to several requests for comment.</p> <p>The accusations of wrongdoing against Caldara are only the latest in an eclectic series of claims leveled at law enforcement figures who have publicly endorsed Trump\u2019s campaign for the White House.</p> <p>Amid a spike in crime in some US cities, Trump on Friday received the endorsement of the national Fraternal Order of Police union, whose president, Chuck Canterbury, said: \u201cOur members believe he will make America safe again\u201d.</p> <p>But dark spots on the records of some of Trump\u2019s most prominent police backers challenge the credibility of his claim to be the \u201claw and order candidate\u201d. In July, a coalition of dozens of police chiefs and prosecutors <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/13/donald-trump-crime-policy-law-enforcement-officials-letter\">pleaded with the Republican nominee</a> to abandon his draconian ideas and embrace contemporary policing theory and criminal justice reform.</p> <p>Here, the Guardian reviews some of the allegations made against a half-dozen lawmen who have lent their support to Trump\u2019s presidential campaign:<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <h2><strong>David Clarke</strong></h2> <p>Sheriff David Clarke of Milwaukee County, Wisconsin, has been Trump\u2019s most visible ally among serving police. Although a registered Democrat, Clarke, 60, accused Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign of \u201cembracing criminality\u201d after <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/26/black-lives-matter-mothers-democratic-convention-hillary-clinton\">mothers of African Americans killed by police </a>appeared onstage at the Democratic National Convention.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"b677ac8b318f1bda22623336109f4b6c0148153e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b677ac8b318f1bda22623336109f4b6c0148153e/961_460_1539_1539/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Clarke.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Clarke.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: The Washington Post/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But Clarke has been accused of violating rules and regulations himself since being elected in 2002. After one of his deputies broke a woman\u2019s neck by crashing his vehicle into her car, Clarke was alleged to have <a href=\"http://fox6now.com/2014/07/13/false-accusation-leads-to-lawsuit-for-county-sheriff/\">overseen an attempted cover-up</a> that involved framing the woman for drunk driving.</p> <p> </p> <p>The victim, Tanya Weyker, sued Clarke, several deputies and county authorities in state and federal court in 2014 for compensation and civil rights violations. She said Clarke and his officers continued pursuing charges against her for months even after they knew video evidence showed the officer was at fault. </p> <p>\u201cClarke was personally involved in the conspiracy to continue with the baseless prosecution of [Weyker],\u201d the federal lawsuit said, \u201cor, at the very least, was deliberately and recklessly indifferent to his subordinates\u2019 unconstitutional actions and related misconduct.\u201d Clarke and the officers denied the allegations. </p> <p>An attorney for Weyker, Drew DeVinney, said Weyker settled her state lawsuit for the state-capped maximum $250,000 in compensation, and then settled the federal lawsuit for more than $95,000 for civil rights violations and attorneys\u2019 fees.</p> <p>Clarke has also come under criticism from within his own ranks. In 2010, deputy Richard Graber, a senior official in the Milwaukee deputies\u2019 union, alleged that Clarke aggressively confronted him, called him a \u201csick fuck\u201d and threatened to \u201ccome after him\u201d for questioning an order that deputies must work mandatory overtime after the high-profile death of a local child.</p> <p>\u201cClarke\u2019s profanity-ridden rant included yelling, pointing, and calling Graber \u2018waste,\u2019 an \u2018organizational terrorist,\u2019 a \u2018fucker,\u2019 and a \u2018cancer to the agency\u2019,\u201d according to an appeals court filing. Clarke denied most of Graber\u2019s account of their confrontation. A federal appeals court said Clarke\u2019s behavior amounted to an \u201cadverse employment action\u201d but rejected an allegation from Graber that the mistreatment was because of his union activity.</p> <p>Inspector Edward Bailey, a spokesman for Clarke, declined to comment. \u201cThis county office does not involve itself in the current presidential race in any capacity,\u201d he said in an email.</p> <h2><strong>Joe Arpaio</strong></h2> <p>Sheriff Joe Arpaio of Maricopa County, Arizona, has over the past two decades become notorious as <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2014/03/sheriff-joe-arpaio-the-most-lawless-lawman-in-america/359613/\">\u201cthe most unrepentantly lawless lawman in America\u201d</a>: repeatedly condemned by the courts, denounced by civil liberties advocates and forced to pay out tens of millions of taxpayer dollars in compensation.</p> <p>Arpaio currently faces possible criminal charges for contempt of court for ignoring a judge\u2019s order in 2011 that his aggressive immigration patrols must stop racially profiling suspects. Earlier this year, Arpaio was <a href=\"http://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/phoenix/2016/05/13/arpaio-contempt-federal-court-ruling/77833232/\">held in civil contempt on three counts</a> by a federal judge. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"3e173b7cd1dbdcb72ecb86e405faa9cf7eed639a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3e173b7cd1dbdcb72ecb86e405faa9cf7eed639a/1366_58_1480_1849/800.jpg\" alt=\"Arpaio.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Arpaio.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ross D Franklin/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Less well known than Arpaio\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.12news.com/news/local/arizona/inmates-endure-extreme-heat-in-tent-city/250951997\">\u201cTent City\u201d</a> detention center, however, is his record of using his department to go after personal and political enemies.

The failed charges also prompted the state supreme court to disbar the county attorney, an Arpaio ally, who was found to have brought malicious prosecutions against political foes.</p> <p>Last year it emerged that Arpaio had even <a href=\"http://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/phoenix/2015/04/23/joe-arpaio-apologizes-contempt-hearing-day-three-abrk/26240715/\">hired a private investigator to look into the wife</a> of the federal judge who ruled in 2013 that Arpaio was engaged in illegal racial profiling.

Two of them went on to commit serious crimes before recapture. </p> <p>In April 2006, Ralph \u201cBucky\u201d Phillips escaped from Alden prison. He killed a state trooper and wounded two others before being caught after five months on the run. In March 2009, Rasheed Milton was released from the same facility by mistake. Milton was recaptured after raping a woman. Then, in March 2012, Awet Gebreyesus was mistakenly released from Alden after being indicted for the attempted murder of his partner. Gebreyesus was caught before harming anyone.</p> <p> Howard has also been <a href=\"http://wnymedia.net/2013/10/howard-widens-pay-play-net-8-years/\">accused of cronyism</a> after it emerged that companies that gave Howard\u2019s election campaign tens of thousands of dollars in contributions received hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of county contracts for purchases such as <a href=\"http://wnymedia.net/2005/09/sheriff-howard-bought-like-new-car/\">new police cars</a>, software and furniture.</p> <p>Howard\u2019s spokesman did not respond to a request for comment.</p> <h2><strong>Paul Babeu</strong></h2> <p>Sheriff Paul Babeu of Pinal County, Arizona, enthusiastically supports Trump\u2019s anti-immigration stance and campaign pledge to build a wall along the US border with Mexico. Babeu is also running as a Republican for a seat in the US House of Representatives and has made border security a key plank of his campaign.</p> <p>Babeu promises voters on his website that he will tackle the \u201chundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants pouring across our southern borders\u201d, warning that at present, \u201cpossible terrorists with military training, deliberate plans and lots of money can cross the border\u201d.</p> <p>In 2012, Jose Orozco, a Mexican man and ex-boyfriend of Babeu who worked for the sheriff\u2019s election campaign, alleged that he was threatened with deportation by an aide to Babeu when he refused to sign an agreement not to publicly disclose the relationship.

This week, a spokesman for Babeu sent the Guardian a letter purportedly from Geyer that said he and Babeu had no sexual relationship at all. Asked twice whether Babeu himself denied that the relationship took place, the spokesman did not respond.</p> <p>State authorities <a href=\"http://media.phoenixnewtimes.com/7687064.0.PDF\">pursued DeSisto</a> for operating illegally without a state license. Over the years, the school <a href=\"http://www.bridges4kids.org/articles/2004/3-04/Globe2-23-04.html\">became notorious</a> for its severe punishment system, and was investigated repeatedly for allegations of abuse and mistreatment of students. It has since closed. </p> <p>The Babeu spokesman, Barrett Marson, said in an email: \u201cPaul was in charge of the business operations at the school. He never had any control over student discipline or instruction. He was in charge of ensuring there was food and bathroom supplies and things like that. But Paul was never investigated nor had any knowledge of any alleged abuse at the school while he was employed there.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Wayne Ivey</strong></h2> <p>Sheriff Wayne Ivey of Brevard County, Florida, is playing an energetic part in Trump\u2019s campaign.

But Jones, who is also running for Congress as a Republican, has dialed down his enthusiasm after the Republican nominee\u2019s recent string of inflammatory remarks.</p> <p>\u201cHe has not personally or publicly endorsed any candidate, but has said he will cast his ballot for Trump given the only alternative is Hillary Clinton,\u201d Dave Gilliard, a spokesman for Jones, said in an email.</p> <p>Jones was accused of sexually harassing a junior female deputy starting when he was a sergeant about 12 years ago, which he denies. The deputy, Tosca Olives, said in a sworn deposition that Jones frequently harassed her on visits to the department\u2019s law library, to which she was assigned.

Once, when she told him he must stop touching her breasts, she alleged, Jones replied: \u201cStop being so tempting.\u201d Olives said she feared retaliation for taking action against Jones, and that when she eventually told him she was going to make a complaint about him, he advised her not to and suggested she would ruin both their careers. </p> <p>Olives\u2019s testimony was submitted as evidence in a lawsuit brought by four other female deputies, who alleged retaliation and discrimination by the sheriff\u2019s department \u2013 much of it in a county jail, when it was run by Jones. Jurors ruled in favor of the female deputies and awarded them $3.6m. </p> <p>In an emailed statement, Jones said the allegations against him were \u201cwithout merit, corroboration or evidence\u201d and that he denied them \u201cin the strongest possible terms.\u201d </p> <p>\u201cI have never been the subject of any internal complaint of misconduct of any kind during my 27-year career with the sheriff\u2019s department, and have consistently opened up my personnel records for review,\u201d said Jones.</p>",

After two successful presidential campaigns, the first lady is being called upon to perform one last trick: elect his successor.<br></p> <p>On Friday, the ever-popular first lady stepped on to the campaign trail to rally support for a predecessor and one-time rival, Hillary Clinton, whose victory in November is crucial to preserving the president\u2019s legacy. Students and supporters had waited hours to hear the first lady speak. </p> <p>\u201cThe presidency doesn\u2019t change who you are, it reveals who you are,\u201d Obama told the crowd of mostly young people at George Mason University. \u201cThe same thing is true of a presidential campaign. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/26/michelle-obama-democratic-national-convention-speech\">\u2018She found her voice\u2019: Michelle Obama\u2019s DNC speech hailed as her boldest yet</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cSo if a candidate is erratic and threatening, if a candidate traffics in prejudice, fears, and lies on the trail, if a candidate has no clear plans to implement their goals, if they disrespect their fellow citizens \u2013 including folks who\u2019ve made extraordinary sacrifices for our country \u2013 let me tell you: that is who they are. That is the kind of president they will be.\u201d</p> <p>Obama is known for being averse to politics, and she has managed to remain supremely popular, especially among young people, in large part thanks to her ability to stay above the fray. But the 2016 presidential race is deeply personal. </p> <p>Donald Trump, the Republican nominee, for years promoted the false \u201cbirther\u201d movement that questioned Barack Obama\u2019s origins \u2013 to the extent that he claimed to have sent <a href=\"http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2011/04/07/trump-sends-investigators-to-hawaii-to-look-into-obama/\">investigators </a>to Hawaii to search for his birth certificate in 2011. On Friday, Trump conceded that the president was born in the United States.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s careful cultivation of the lie, and his refusal to denounce it even as recently as Thursday, has crippled the Republican\u2019s standing with black voters, who widely view the birther campaign as an attempt to delegitimize the first black president. Public opinion polls show that he draws a historically low support from black voters, with some surveys showing <a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2016-election/donald-trump-gets-0-support-black-voters-ohio-pennsylvania-nbc-n609026\">0%</a> among black voters. </p> <p>In her speech at the Democratic national convention, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/26/michelle-obama-convention-speech-female-president\">an aspirational and devastating riposte</a> to Trump\u2019s vision for America, Michelle Obama remembered her daughters\u2019 first day of school, and the lurching feeling when she realized that they would grow up in the White House. </p> <p>\u201cI realized that our time in the White House would form the foundation for who they would become, and how well we managed this experience could truly make or break them,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cThat is what Barack and I think about every day as we try to guide and protect our girls through the challenges of this unusual life in the spotlight \u2013 how we urge them to ignore those who question their father\u2019s citizenship or faith. </p> <p>\u201cHow we insist that the hateful language they hear from public figures on TV does not represent the true spirit of this country. How we explain that when someone is cruel, or acts like a bully, you don\u2019t stoop to their level \u2013 no, our motto is, when they go low, we go high.\u201d</p> <p>Obama\u2019s swan song speech was quickly elevated to the pantheon of historic political addresses. Some delegates in the audience wept freely as the first lady spoke.</p> <p>On the campaign trail, Clinton voiced appreciation for her powerful and most popular ally.<br></p> <p>\u201cAs Michelle Obama said in her fabulous speech at the Democratic convention, when we go to the polls this November, the real choice isn\u2019t between Democrat or Republican,\u201d Clinton said in Greensboro, North Carolina, on Thursday. \u201cIt\u2019s about who will have the power to shape our children for the next four years of their lives.\u201d</p> <p>Though they share a goal on the campaign trail, Obama and Clinton could not have had more opposite ambitions in their roles as first lady.</p> <p>\u201cMichelle Obama can\u2019t wait to leave the White House and Hillary Clinton can\u2019t wait to get back in,\u201d said Kate Andersen Brower, journalist and <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/First-Women-Americas-Modern-Ladies/dp/0062439650\">author of First Women</a>.</p> <p>Unlike Clinton, who broke with many of the traditions and norms expected of a presidential spouse, including the unprecedented step of setting up an office in the West Wing, Obama has remained firmly in the East Wing.

I certainly do,\u201d Bush said, referring to her mother-in-law, the wife of George HW Bush. </p> <p>Obama said she would continue to the work she started in the White House: \u201cI can\u2019t imagine that I\u2019ll leave here and really kick my feet up and say, \u2018Oh, well, good luck with that.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>After Obama\u2019s rousing DNC speech, speculation \u2013 most wishful \u2013 mounted that it might launch a national political career, as such a speech did for her husband in 2004.</p> <p>But Obama has swatted away any speculation that she might seek office one day and earlier this year, the president lowered the chances of a double act to zero. </p> <p>\u201cThere are three things that are certain in life,\u201d the president said during a town hall in Louisiana. \u201cDeath, taxes and Michelle is not running for president.\u201d</p> <p>And yet some still hold out hope.<br></p> <p>\u201cFour more years!\u201d the college crowd chanted on Friday when Obama said her family\u2019s time in the White House had nearly come to an end. \u201cNo!\u201d Obama said, waving her hand and laughing. \u201cNo,\u201d she tried again, more emphatically.</p> <p>After the event, Rachelle Campbell didn\u2019t hesitate for a moment. </p> <p>\u201cOh, I would <em>love</em> for her to run for president one day,\u201d she said excitedly. \u201cMichelle for president!\u201d</p> <p>As she closed out her speech to the students, Obama spun one of Clinton\u2019s slogans, \u201cI\u2019m with her\u201d, into her own. \u201cI urge you \u2013 I beg of you \u2013 to ignore the chatter and the noise and ask yourselves, which candidate really has the experience, the maturity, and the demeanor to handle the job I just described to you?\u201d she asked the crowd.</p> <p>\u201cI need your help to do that as well. Are you with me?\u201d</p>",
  "<p>It\u2019s been a pretty static summer on the circulation and readership front. Quality papers \u2013 in print and online \u2013 doing well in the referendum aftermath, with the tabloids staging a modest August recovery. But there\u2019s one fascinating result being celebrated by traditional US news hawks. For the first time in modern digital history (as recorded by comScore over July), the <em>New York Times</em> and the <em>Washington Post </em>both beat starry startups BuzzFeed and the <em>Huffington Post</em>. The <em>Times</em> and <em>Post </em>were up 41% and 54% year-on-year \u2013 while the opposition dropped back.</p> <p>As Ken Doctor at the Nieman Journalism Lab notes, it\u2019s not just a question of readers wanting their news from sturdier, familiar sources in the eye of a presidential election storm. There\u2019s the question of if and when shooting stars begin to wane. \u201cHas the <em>Huffington Post</em>, which shed 12m unique visitors in just a year \u2013 and a time of incredible political ferment \u2013 peaked? After all, it was born at another digital time, 2005 \u2026 a business/editorial model of aggregation ahead of its time.\u201d</p> <p>Now, minus founder Arianna, the HuffPo \u201cmust look of how to redefine its very identity\u201d.</p> <p>BuzzFeed, meanwhile, \u201chas confused many by announcing it is to split into news and entertainment parts\u201d, Doctor adds. \u201cThat move has still not been well explained in intent or impact on its journalism. What the data does show is that BuzzFeed, too, lost 10m unique visitors over the last year.\u201d</p> <p>No one quite knows what this means on the bottom line, but momentum is vital to keep startup investors happy, so any glitch comes with costs attached. it\u2019s rough for all the rivals.</p> <p>\u25a0 Legacy victory No 2, duly celebrated by Poynter Institute researchers. We\u2019ve discovered that digital tablets haven\u2019t obliterated dear old printed books: and that print resilience remains strong. The average American reads 12 books a year. The percentage of Americans reading at least one book is 73%, pretty proximate to 2012\u2019s 74%. Some 65% of US readers prefer reading printed pages \u2013 the same as in 2012. Ebooks have spurted upwards, with 28% reading at least one digital page-turner a year; but 38% still read only in print \u2013 and 28% mix and match. In short, any transition is glacial by modern digital standards; and may even be reaching a plateau.</p>"

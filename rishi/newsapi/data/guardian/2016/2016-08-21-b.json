  "<p>Donald Trump\u2019s campaign doubled its spending in July, even though the Republican nominee still only employed about 80 people, aired no television ads and maintained ties with his fired campaign manager and the writer who plagiarized part of his wife\u2019s convention speech.</p> <p>His campaign lags far behind that of his Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton, whose team spent about twice as much as his did last month. Clinton also raised more funds, taking in $52m for her campaign and Democrats, according to July filings with the Federal Election Commission, while Trump raised $37m for his campaign and Republicans.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/19/paul-manafort-resigns-donald-trump-campaign\">Paul Manafort resigns as chairman of Donald Trump campaign</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Trump\u2019s largest expenses in July were from a new push for online fundraising, as he moved away from donating to his own campaign and more actively solicited money from voters. Trump has <a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2016-election/forgiving-campaign-loans-trump-fulfills-his-pledge-self-fund-primary-n613536\">given about $52m</a> to his own campaign, but is no longer self-funding the bulk of the effort through loans or donations.</p> <p>The campaign paid a Texas-based web design and marketing firm, Giles-Parscale, $8.4m in July, about twice as much as it made over the last year. The firm\u2019s president, Brad Parscale, is digital director for Trump\u2019s campaign, and has worked for Trump\u2019s real estate business since 2011. </p> <p>Trump\u2019s campaign also paid $20,000 to the consulting firm of Corey Lewandowski, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/20/donald-trump-campaign-manager-corey-lewandowski-out\">campaign manager he fired in June</a>, two weeks after Lewandowski left the campaign and became a paid pundit on CNN. The sum was roughly equal to how much Trump\u2019s campaign paid him as manager.</p> <p>The campaign also paid $356.01 to Meredith McIver, an employee of the Trump Organization who <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/19/melania-trump-plagiarism-scandal-michelle-obama\">took the blame for plagiarizing Michelle Obama\u2019s 2008 convention speech</a> for use in Melania Trump\u2019s 2016 speech. McIver is listed as a co-writer for several of Donald Trump\u2019s books, and because of her work as an \u201cin-house\u201d writer for Trump\u2019s private business, the campaign risked violating campaign laws if it had not separately paid her.</p> <p>Though the financial documents show little sign that Trump has opened offices around swing states, Trump did show some signs of scaling up for the general election. He paid $100,000 to Cambridge Analytics, a data analysis firm that formerly worked for Senator Ted Cruz and has ties to Robert Mercer, a hedge fund billionaire who supports Trump. He also paid his Alabama state director, Chess Bedsole, $64,000, three times his last payment, in December, even though Alabama has voted Republican for decades.</p> <p>The campaign paid about $2m for private jets and $500,000 to pay for expenses on Trump\u2019s personal plane. Last month, Trump paid more than $773,000 to companies he owns; since the beginning of the race, his campaign has paid more than $7.5m to Trump companies or those owned by family members. In all, his campaign spent $18.5m in July, including $1.8m on hats and merchandise.</p> <p>Clinton, in contrast, reported 703 staffers, $2m on travel and signs of new offices. In July, her campaign spent a total of $38m, filings show, mostly on advertising. Last week, Trump spent $4.8m on his first general election ads, which aired in four swing states.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s personal finances remain mostly opaque, since the candidate has refused to release his tax returns \u2013 breaking 40 years of precedent by presidential nominees \u2013 and because his business is structured in a labyrinth of holdings, third parties and debt. A New York Times investigation into Trump\u2019s finances found <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/21/us/politics/donald-trump-debt.html\">he had at least $650m in debt</a>, far more than he disclosed on earlier FEC forms. Trump has said he will not release his returns while they are under an IRS audit, though no law prohibits that release.</p> <p>Clinton has released several years of tax returns, including from 2015, when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/12/hillary-clinton-tim-kaine-tax-returns\">she and her husband made nearly $11m</a>. But she has been haunted by the web of donors, including foreign governments, that give to the family\u2019s sprawling Clinton Foundation. The philanthropic organization has said it will no longer accept foreign donations if Clinton is elected president, but her campaign manager, Robby Mook, refused to say that it would stop taking those donations during the campaign.</p> <p>Political action committees allied with Democrats were boosted by several billionaires, filings also show. George Soros gave $1.5m to a Planned Parenthood Super Pac and $500,000 to the Senate Majority Pac, and Tom Steyer gave $7m to his own Super Pac, called NextGen Climate Action Committee. Michael Bloomberg gave $5m to his own group, called Independence USA, and though the former New York mayor has endorsed Clinton, his Pac is also working to help Pennsylvania\u2019s Republican senator, Pat Toomey, because of his support for gun control measures.</p> <p>Conservative billionaires have largely shied from donating to Trump\u2019s campaign, and filings showed that Paul Singer and Charles and David Koch are concentrating on groups to support Senate and House candidates. Mercer, on the other hand, has given $2m to a pro-Trump Super Pac, and also funds Breitbart News, whose boss, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/17/donald-trump-stephen-bannon-breitbart-news-kellyanne-conway\">Stephen Bannon, took control of Trump\u2019s presidential campaign</a> last week.</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/first-read/clinton-surges-past-270-electoral-votes-nbc-news-battleground-map-n630851\">NBC News recently projected</a> that Hillary Clinton has surpassed the 270 electoral college votes she needs to be elected president. Based on polls, which have been surprisingly accurate this year,<a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2016/08/donald-trump-shrinking-election-map-227076\"> Politico reports</a> that if you include states where Clinton leads by 5%, she has 302 electoral college votes. There may be no swing states in 2016. Indeed, <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2016/08/pollsters-trump-approaching-zero-hour-227000#ixzz4HXYzUoTL\">no one with her lead</a> at this stage of the campaign has lost the popular vote in 16 elections, since modern polling began.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/13/trump-clinton-election-chances-moderate-policies-economy\">Thomas Frank wrote in the Guardian</a> that with Clinton certain to win, she will ignore populist movements and govern to the right. <a href=\"http://blackagendareport.com/hillary_big_nasty_tent\">Glen Ford of Black Agenda Report</a> writes that Clinton is stuffing the entire US ruling class into her campaign: neocons and neoliberals, Wall Street and big business, military and intelligence \u2013 they are all there, with progressives, blacks and Latinos pushed to the side.</p> <p>Though two establishment big business parties are the tradition in the United States, history shows people\u2019s voices have still impacted the direction of the country. The formula has been: mass movement + independent electoral party = transformational change.</p> <p>By forcing their issues onto the political agenda, people have broken up banking and energy monopolies, won the right to form unions and an eight-hour work day, ended child labor and won the vote for women. The entire New Deal came from the Progressive and Socialist parties. All of these changes occurred without a third party winning the presidency. They won their issues by showing enough political support to impact the outcome of an election, which the two parties call \u201cspoiling\u201d. This forced one of the two parties to adopt the issue of the era, or become the Whigs and disappear.</p> <p>There is one example of a third party winning a presidential election. The first political party, the Democrats, was a party of slave plantation owners. The second long-lasting political grouping was the Whig party, northern industrialists who profited from slavery. By the mid-1800s slavery was more valuable than manufacturing, banking and railroads combined. There had been an abolition movement since before the founding of the nation, but it was stalled, even going backward. Abolitionists decided to force their issue onto the agenda by running for office. They lost repeatedly, but over nearly two decades they weakened the Whigs and divided the Democrats. Abraham Lincoln, a former Whig, won a four-way race in 1860 for the Republicans with less than 40% of the vote.</p> <p>The abolitionist spoilers were hated because they were blamed for the Mexican war by giving the greater-evil Democrats the presidency. But, we should be eternally grateful to those who voted in those losing elections to end slavery. They were democracy heroes, using the tools available to force an end to slavery.</p> <p>We face a similar issue today when the issue is corporate power, especially the power of Wall Street and transnational corporations controlling government. Two parties take hundreds of millions from big business and do their bidding.</p> <p>Independent challengers have no chance in these manipulated presidential elections. The hubris of two parties allows them to create a corporation, call it a commission and<a href=\"https://www.popularresistance.org/inclusive-four-person-debates-needed-in-presidential-race/\"> keep challengers out of the debates</a>. They use fear to manipulate voters. For example, they push the<a href=\"http://www.truthdig.com/report/item/dont_fall_for_it_the_nader_myth_and_your_2016_vote_20160802\"> Nader myth</a> \u2013 despite Gore losing 308,000 Democratic votes and 191,000 liberal votes in Florida to Bush, and Nader only winning about 30,000 of each. They trump up Trump fear despite the reality that he cannot win.</p> <p>Establishment parties nominated two very unpopular candidates. Since we know who will win, why throw away your vote on either? Use your vote to challenge corporate power.</p> <p>Only the Greens, <a href=\"http://www.jill2016.com/\">Jill Stein and Ajamu Baraka</a>, are challenging corporate power. The movement, already planning \u201c#NoHoneymoon for Hillary\u201d protests, has been growing rapidly since 2011, getting stronger and winning battles. Every vote for Stein makes the movement stronger by forcing Clinton to look over her left shoulder, worried that the Greens will have enough votes to impact her re-election.</p> <p>To end corporate power, we must vote against it. Just as the US needed democracy heroes to end slavery, we need democracy heroes to end plutocracy.</p>",
  "<p>In a crowded field, a new troll has established himself as the undisputed master of the art. To most people he\u2019s repugnant, but to his peers he\u2019s a formidable exemplar of a set of skills that have come to flourish in the era of online bile, useful only to those whose primary aim is destructive and reductive. He knows exactly the kind of incendiary comment that will bait his prey. And when the inevitable reaction comes, he basks in the reflected glory of his acolytes piling on, and turning a conversation into a battlefield. In so doing, he kills off any hope of a reasoned discussion, ensuring that name-calling, provocation and blatant hate take its place. This might not be good for the standards of public discourse, but it\u2019s good for his ego \u2013 and it distracts from his ignorance.</p> <p>Expert though he is, the new king differs from his predecessors in important ways. Usually trolls operate below the line; this one stands at a podium. Usually their ambitions are petty, but this one wants to be president of the United States. Usually trolls are anonymous, but everyone knows this one\u2019s name. It\u2019s Donald Trump.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"09c5bcb253fb096c93879ab1dc37cb86c4224f21\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/09c5bcb253fb096c93879ab1dc37cb86c4224f21/0_174_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump speaks during a 2016 campaign event.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Some political leaders take Trump on, but trolling experts say that\u2019s \u2018a mistake, because it allows him to set the tone of the debate, and the debate is in the mud\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michelle Mcloughlin/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>According to those with expertise in trolling (academics and online community managers who spend their days stamping out his sort of behavior), the model of Trump\u2019s polemical strategy doesn\u2019t hark back to Kennedy and Reagan, but to prolific trolls like <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/charliewarzel/twitter-just-permanently-suspended-conservative-writer-milo\">@nero</a> and <a href=\"http://gawker.com/5950981/unmasking-reddits-violentacrez-the-biggest-troll-on-the-web\">Violentacrez</a>. If they are right, the presidential campaign is going to increasingly sound like an out-of-control thread on Reddit<strong>.</strong> But their diagnosis isn\u2019t one of despair. Just as trolls are persistent, their opponents in public discourse have worked out effective ways of taking them on. And, experts say, the lessons of online comment culture could well apply to Hillary Clinton\u2019s strategy for taking on the Donald.</p> <h2>\u2022\u2022\u2022</h2> <p>Though a troll is commonly associated with mythical Norwegian creatures, online \u201ctrolling\u201d actually derives its etymology from a fishing term, which describes a method of drawing multiple lines behind a boat at once. \u201cWhat trolling used to mean was a behavior online where someone would leave a lot of lures to snare people, to entice them to get angry,\u201d says Derek Powazek, a veteran online community manager and the author of <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Design-Community-Derek-Powazek/dp/0735710759\">Design for Community: The Art of Connecting Real People in Virtual Places</a>. Trolling can often manifest as relatively innocuous sarcasm and pranks, but it frequently veers into outright harassment and illegal personal threats. Powazek says that ultimately trolling is a game whose reward is laughter. And Donald Trump is<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX9reO3QnUA\"> laughing</a>. \u201cI think it\u2019s perfect,\u201d says Powazek. \u201cHe is the king of taking troll behavior, born of Twitter, into the formerly genteel world of politics.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>By playing the troll, Trump has masterfully dominated the news cycle and placed himself within reach of the Oval Office</p> <footer> <cite></cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>According to Chuck Dueck, a senior vice-president at <a href=\"http://icuc.social/\">icuc.social</a>, a company that manages the online presence for hundreds of companies and organizations, trolls fall into four different categories: those who deliberately practice harassment, those who enjoy being outrageous and causing havoc, those who love to argue, and those too stupid to know they are trolls. Dueck believes Trump is most like the second and third. \u201cHe has a long career of making outrageous statements designed to get attention,\u201d Dueck says. \u201cHe now has the biggest stage to do it from.

In response to the wave of accusations of anti-semitism, Trump didn\u2019t apologize or attempt to put the event behind him.

Think back to the Republication primaries. Can you remember a single policy proposal debated by the candidates? Probably not.

Like all skilled trolls, Trump has proven masterful at inspiring his followers to do the bulk of his dirty work. According to West, the best trolls enter a conversation, make a comment or two, set off a fight, and step back as other trolls emerge to sling punches. Trolls aren\u2019t warriors, they\u2019re instigators. They know how to imply something<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6QEqoYgQxw\"> racist</a>,<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXwrHzpUERU\"> hateful</a> or<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctiO5L_24W0\"> misogynistic</a>, blowing rhetorical dog whistles that bring out more blatantly offensive supporters while allowing themselves deniability. \u201cThere\u2019s an art to this,\u201d West says. \u201cIt\u2019s like a flaming bag of dog shit on someone\u2019s doorstep.\u201d Even if you know who likely put it there, it\u2019s not as if you can dust it for prints.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"878a159aa48f9e45ef9d0421ff371ae458c25f5c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/878a159aa48f9e45ef9d0421ff371ae458c25f5c/0_88_4729_2836/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Donald Trump\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Like all skilled trolls, Trump has proven masterful at inspiring his followers to do the bulk of his dirty work.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Win McNamee/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Joseph Reagle, an assistant professor of communication studies at Northeastern University and author of <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Reading-Comments-Likers-Haters-Manipulators/dp/026202893X\">Reading the Comments: Likers, Haters and Manipulators at the Bottom of the Web</a>, uses the term \u201ctrollplex\u201d to define the arena of combat where these proxy battles are waged. \u201cIn a trollplex someone like Trump can deflect attention from him onto more explicitly hateful people, by tweeting and retweeting, keeping their hands clean.\u201d And so you get Trump consistently retweeting<a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-hillary-clinton_us_5777e61fe4b09b4c43c0afb4\"> memes</a>,<a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/01/22/politics/donald-trump-retweet-white-genocide/\"> jokes</a> and<a href=\"http://fortune.com/donald-trump-white-supremacist-genocide/\"> statements</a> from far-rightwing organizations and even neo-Nazis, then claiming ignorance when called out on it.

This means that Clinton and her supporters should never resort to trolling behavior themselves, no matter what Trump says. Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz fell for this, reacting to Trump\u2019s name calling with sneers that only emboldened Trump. \u201cI worry about Elizabeth Warren,\u201d says Powazek, referring to the Democratic Massachusetts senator that Trump has insultingly called \u201cPochahontas\u201d, and who consistently fights with him<a href=\"https://twitter.com/elizabethforma/status/754327065810210816?ref_src=twsrc%25255Etfw\"> on Twitter</a>. \u201cShe\u2019s out there fighting fire with fire, but tactically it\u2019s a mistake, because it allows him to set the tone of the debate, and the debate is in the mud.

Bog him down in specifics, and hold his feet to the fire on statements he makes on complicated issues like defense and fiscal policy, where his trolling tactics are of no use. Bill Eddy says this is the most effective way for dealing with high-conflict personalities. \u201cRespond with information as assertively as the other side is responding aggressively. Aggressive tries to destroy the other party, but assertive stands up for yourself. It\u2019s not personal.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Defuse the anger</strong></p> <p>Trolls live to stoke rage. That is all they can do. Friendliness is their kryptonite. Clinton should muster every diplomatic skill she picked up at the state department and keep every public interaction friendly, no matter how much she despises Trump. \u201cYou have to ignore the living hell out of it,\u201d says West.</p> <p>This is obviously easier said than done, especially for the media, which may take issue with Trump\u2019s message and tactics, but is nonetheless compelled to cover the presidential nominee.</p> <h2>\u2022\u2022\u2022</h2> <p>Donald Trump\u2019s candidacy may be unprecedented, but he is unlikely to be the last candidate to employ a troll\u2019s tactics in the pursuit of power. If there is one thing the experts in online communities agree on, it\u2019s that trolling is a persistent problem with no simple solution. Like crime, terrorism or pandemic diseases, once introduced into a community, trolls will always return. \u201cPolitics doesn\u2019t have the antibodies we\u2019ve developed online to deal with trolls,\u201d says Powazek. Perhaps a resounding Trump defeat in November can inoculate us against a bigger surge of troll candidates in the future, but many worry it will be too late.<br></p> <p>\u201cThe time frame is a little short for the kind of learning we all need,\u201d says Gail Ann Williams, who worked for many years fighting trolls at the website the Well. \u201cThe stakes are so high.

Earlier this year, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/billy-bragg\">Billy Bragg</a> and American singer-songwriter Joe Henry took a 2,700-mile train ride across the US, from Chicago to Los Angeles, along the way recording songs that reflect the railroad\u2019s impact on the nation\u2019s social and cultural life. Woody Guthrie\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxHQk9-zZWw\">Hobo\u2019s Lullaby</a>, for example, was captured at an Amtrak station in Alpine, Texas, the folk ballad Railroad Bill at St Louis Gateway station, while the pair crooned Hank Williams\u2019s Lonesome Whistle in their sleeping berth near Whistle Junction, Missouri. By the end of their 65-hour trek they had an album.</p> <p>Last Wednesday, <a href=\"http://shinealight-joehenry.billybragg.co.uk/\"><em>Shine a Light</em></a> was given its debut at St Pancras Old Church, a much-restored medieval pile nestled alongside London\u2019s Eurostar terminus. Its icons and plaster saints provided an incongruous setting for a muscular chronicle of North America\u2019s railway age, but its intimacy proved perfect for the semi-acoustic charms of Bragg and Henry. They make a contrasting pair; Bragg the blue-collar Anglo troubadour, Henry a dapper American writer and producer whose home studio has hosted clients from Aaron Neville to Rodney Crowell. Their voices prove a complementary blend, Bragg\u2019s lowering Essex moan cut through by Henry\u2019s higher, acerbic tones, while both men know how to make a guitar drive and ring.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>'I\u2019m the only Englishman to do a non-ironic yodel since Morrissey,' quips Bragg</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>This proves useful for a set steeped in old-time Americana; Leadbelly\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cu7gafphe9M\">Midnight Special</a>, the Carter Family\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CG-jyZXVhRs\">Railroading on the Great Divide</a>, folk ballads such as In the Pines, John Henry and Rock Island Line \u2013 the last made famous in the UK by skiffle king Lonnie Donegan, but here returned to an earlier call-and-response form. As ever, Bragg is as much raconteur as singer, elucidating the history of the songs \u2013 and the railroads that transformed a nation \u2013 with verve.</p> <p>The highlights come from gentler, less predictable sources, such as Jean Ritchie\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6nARSpM-0s\">The L&amp;N Don\u2019t Stop Here Anymore</a>, a 1966 lament for her Kentucky coalmining home town. John Hartford\u2019s Gentle on My Mind, a hobo\u2019s rueful reflection on lost love and a hit for <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2A7iuQF_tAc\">Glen Campbell</a> in 1967, is given a tender treatment that proves an unanticipated tearjerker.</p> <p>Jimmie Rodgers\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbzc77Tz6PA\">Waiting for a Train</a> is a more obvious choice and a reminder that Rodgers, \u201cthe singing brakeman\u201d, was very much a product of the railroad as well as country music\u2019s first megastar. Bragg\u2019s successful adoption of Rodgers\u2019s famous yodel \u2013 \u201cI\u2019m the only Englishman to do a non-ironic yodel since Morrissey,\u201d he quips \u2013 brings a rapturous audience response.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DG4wRpemEM\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/-DG4wRpemEM?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Watch Billy Bragg and Joe Henry performing Midnight Special.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Among the railroad songs the duo sprinkle a handful of their own numbers. There\u2019s an anguished After the War from Henry, full of cryptic, Dylanesque imagery (\u201cTime slips out of the leaning fence\u201d), while Bragg\u2019s version of Beethoven\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lL0Tmq_qJXg\">Ode to Joy</a>, reimagined as a utopian socialist anthem, allows him to digress about his 2007 encounter with Queen Elizabeth (\u201cI thought, that\u2019ll wind up the Trots\u201d).</p> <p>The pair will be touring <em>Shine a Light</em> extensively \u2013 there\u2019s a mammoth US jaunt this autumn that coincides with the US presidential election. Hence the presence of Why We Build the Wall from <a href=\"http://anaismitchell.com/\">Ana\u00efs Mitchell</a>\u2019s masterful <em>Hadestown</em> with its prescient lyrics \u2013 \u201cWe build the wall to keep us free\u201d \u2013 which Bragg turns into a fierce rebuke to Donald Trump (\u201che who cannot be named because it makes steam come from Joe\u2019s ears\u201d).<br></p> <p>The repartee gathers pace as the evening progresses, leading to a rousing finale of Midnight Special, the old warhorse of a song that gives <em>Shine a Light</em> its title, the crucial line coming from the way the headlight of the Southern Pacific express would sweep across Sugar Land prison. If it shone into your cell, so prison lore had it, you got parole. Shine on, Billy and Joe.</p>",
  "<p>In the sweltering heat of a summer day, I walked along the visitor trails of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2013/sep/17/top-10-national-parks-california\">Yosemite national park</a>. I had just made the five-hour drive from my childhood home in Los Angeles to glimpse a vision of the future. There in the valley surrounded by high towers of stone, I watched as thousands of tourists from all over the world marvelled at the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2015/jun/25/google-street-view-el-capitan-yosemite-california\">sheer granite walls of El Capitan</a>, Washington Column and Half Dome. Like ancient cathedrals of divine architecture, these magnificent features stand as monuments to the notion that the natural heritage of our nation must be preserved for all time.</p> <p>Throughout my life I have enjoyed spending time in the outdoors. Despite having grown up in the urban heart of LA, I frequently ventured into the wild places of California, from the slopes of the San Gabriel mountains to the summit of Mount Whitney. Though I was blessed, thanks to sacrifices of my parents, with a lifetime learning and playing in nature, on this occasion, as with many visits to the valley, I noticed that I was among the very few people of colour there. And though I felt no less welcome to enjoy the splendour of this magnificent place, I wondered how it might be possible to encourage tourism to Yosemite \u2013 and other national parks \u2013 that reflects the diverse population of the US as a whole.</p> <p>There are many reasons why African Americans and other ethnic minorities don\u2019t make more use of the great outdoors. Racial oppression of the past gouged deep wounds which persist today, in the form of the limited disposable income and leisure time necessary to holiday in remote places. Add to that few personal mentors or family traditions of days away from the city to enjoy camping, hiking and fishing, and the result is a generation of citizens disenfranchised of a rich cultural legacy.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"441ea9683021135ba9c5d735bb2538c1805dcfc9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/441ea9683021135ba9c5d735bb2538c1805dcfc9/139_353_4649_2789/1000.jpg\" alt=\"James Edward Mills with Yosemite national park ranger Shelton Johnson.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">James Edward Mills with Yosemite national park ranger Shelton Johnson.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>We are seldom told of the <a href=\"http://www.buffalosoldiers-amwest.org/history.htm\">Buffalo Soldiers</a>, black members of the US Cavalry, who patrolled Yosemite and Sequoia national parks at the turn of the last century and became the world\u2019s first park rangers.

As the project director of the <a href=\"https://naturebridge.org/NESC\">National Environmental Science Center</a>, Moose has dedicated much of his life to inspiring young people to spend time in the outdoors. A long-time staff member at <a href=\"https://naturebridge.org/\">Nature Bridge</a>, an environmental education institute based in San Francisco, he has worked to help kids appreciate and revel in the wonders of nature. But as young black people predominantly live in urban areas, Moose says he is constantly challenged to create opportunities, such as nature walks and natural history lessons, that are culturally and socially relevant to the emerging ethnic groups.</p> <p>\u201cWhen the national parks were first conceived, the grand lodges were a way to sell the idea to the American people. But they were places for the elite to stay, people of power who would back the parks with their money,\u201d Moose said. \u201cThe grand lodges of the 21st century need to be schools. The constituent group we\u2019re building now are the users, people whose experiences in nature as kids sparks their sense of exploration and discovery and that belongs to them.\u201d</p> <p>He puts it simply: \u201cThey will own it. And if they own it, they will fight to protect it.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f6e481e8ac37aecbbffc06117716a06b307aea10\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f6e481e8ac37aecbbffc06117716a06b307aea10/0_268_5472_3283/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jonathan \u201cMoose\u201d Mutlow, project director of the National Environmental Science Center\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jonathan \u201cMoose\u201d Mutlow, project director of the National Environmental Science Center</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Moose is currently overseeing the construction of the National Environmental Science Center building, a remarkable education facility for young people.

  "<p>The western financial crisis of 2007-8 was the worst since 1931, yet its immediate repercussions were surprisingly modest. The crisis challenged the foundation stones of the long-dominant neoliberal ideology but it seemed to emerge largely unscathed. The banks were bailed out; hardly any bankers on either side of the Atlantic were prosecuted for their crimes; and the price of their behaviour was duly paid by the taxpayer. Subsequent economic policy, especially in the Anglo-Saxon world, has relied overwhelmingly on monetary policy, especially quantitative easing. It has failed. The western economy has stagnated and is now approaching its lost decade, with no end in sight.</p> <p>After almost nine years, we are finally beginning to reap the political whirlwind of the financial crisis. But how did neoliberalism manage to survive virtually unscathed for so long? Although it failed the test of the real world, bequeathing the worst economic disaster for seven decades, politically and intellectually it remained the only show in town. Parties of the right, centre and left had all bought into its philosophy, New Labour a classic in point. They knew no other way of thinking or doing: it had become the common sense. It was, as Antonio Gramsci put it, hegemonic. But that hegemony cannot and will not survive the test of the real world.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/21/political-third-parties-spoilers-abolitionists-movement\">Third parties aren't 'spoilers'. They're at the cutting edge of democracy | Kevin Zeese</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The first inkling of the wider political consequences was evident in the turn in public opinion against the banks, bankers and business leaders. For decades, they could do no wrong: they were feted as the role models of our age, the default troubleshooters of choice in education, health and seemingly everything else. Now, though, their star was in steep descent, along with that of the political class. The effect of the financial crisis was to undermine faith and trust in the competence of the governing elites. It marked the beginnings of a wider political crisis.</p> <p>But the causes of this political crisis, glaringly evident on both sides of the Atlantic, are much deeper than simply the financial crisis and the virtually stillborn recovery of the last decade. They go to the heart of the neoliberal project that dates from the late 70s and the political rise of Reagan and Thatcher, and embraced at its core the idea of a global free market in goods, services and capital. The depression-era system of bank regulation was dismantled, in the US in the 1990s and in Britain in 1986, thereby creating the conditions for the 2008 crisis. Equality was scorned, the idea of trickle-down economics lauded, government condemned as a fetter on the market and duly downsized, immigration encouraged, regulation cut to a minimum, taxes reduced and a blind eye turned to corporate evasion.</p> <p>It should be noted that, by historical standards, the neoliberal era has not had a particularly good track record. The most dynamic period of postwar western growth was that between the end of the war and the early 70s, the era of welfare capitalism and Keynesianism, when the growth rate was double that of the neoliberal period from 1980 to the present.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9743d47492b73cc81f1f51d2d57e7f43c6dc0dc3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9743d47492b73cc81f1f51d2d57e7f43c6dc0dc3/0_38_3546_2126/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher, pictured in 1984, ushered in the era of neoliberalism.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher, pictured in 1984, ushered in the era of neoliberalism.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bettmann Archive</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But by far the most disastrous feature of the neoliberal period has been the huge growth in inequality. Until very recently, this had been virtually ignored. With extraordinary speed, however, it has emerged as one of, if not the most important political issue on both sides of the Atlantic, most dramatically in the US. It is, bar none, the issue that is driving the political discontent that is now engulfing the west. Given the statistical evidence, it is puzzling, shocking even, that it has been disregarded for so long; the explanation can only lie in the sheer extent of the hegemony of neoliberalism and its values.</p> <p>But now reality has upset the doctrinal apple cart. In the period 1948-1972, every section of the American population experienced very similar and sizable increases in their standard of living; between 1972-2013, the bottom 10% experienced falling real income while the top 10% did far better than everyone else. In the US, the median real income for full-time male workers is now lower than it was four decades ago: the income of the bottom 90% of the population has <a href=\"https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/globalization-new-discontents-by-joseph-e--stiglitz-2016-08\">stagnated for over 30 years</a>.</p> <p>A not so dissimilar picture is true of the UK. And the problem has grown more serious since the financial crisis. On average, between <a href=\"http://\">65-70% of households in 25 high-income economies</a> experienced stagnant or falling real incomes between 2005 and 2014.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Large sections of the population in both the US and the UK are now in revolt against their lot</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The reasons are not difficult to explain. The hyper-globalisation era has been systematically stacked in favour of capital against labour: international trading agreements, drawn up in great secrecy, with business on the inside and the unions and citizens excluded, the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-32498715\">Trans-Pacific Partnership</a> (TPP) and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jul/03/what-is-ttip-controversial-trade-deal-explained\">Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership</a> (TTIP) being but the latest examples; the politico-legal attack on the unions; <a href=\"http://\">the encouragement of large-scale immigration in both the US and Europe</a> that helped to undermine the bargaining power of the domestic workforce; and the failure to retrain displaced workers in any meaningful way.</p> <p>As <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/thomas-piketty\">Thomas Piketty</a> has shown, in the absence of countervailing pressures, capitalism naturally gravitates towards increasing inequality. In the period between 1945 and the late 70s, Cold War competition was arguably the biggest such constraint. Since the collapse of the Soviet Union, there have been none. As the popular backlash grows increasingly irresistible, however, such a winner-takes-all regime becomes politically unsustainable.</p> <p>Large sections of the population in both the US and the UK are now in revolt against their lot, as graphically illustrated by the support for Trump and Sanders in the US and the Brexit vote in the UK. This popular revolt is often described, in a somewhat denigratory and dismissive fashion, as populism. Or, as Francis Fukuyama writes in a recent excellent <a href=\"https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2016-06-13/american-political-decay-or-renewal\">essay in <em>Foreign Affairs</em></a>: \u201c\u2018Populism\u2019 is the label that political elites attach to policies supported by ordinary citizens that they don\u2019t like.\u201d Populism is a movement against the status quo. It represents the beginnings of something new, though it is generally much clearer about what it is against than what it is for. It can be progressive or reactionary, but more usually both.</p> <p>Brexit is a classic example of such populism. It has overturned a fundamental cornerstone of UK policy since the early 1970s. Though ostensibly about Europe, it was in fact about much more: a cri de coeur from those who feel they have lost out and been left behind, whose living standards have stagnated or worse since the 1980s, who feel dislocated by large-scale immigration over which they have no control and who face an increasingly insecure and casualised labour market. Their revolt has paralysed the governing elite, already claimed one prime minister, and left the latest one fumbling around in the dark looking for divine inspiration.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1b944b4b7daee014e9b8b352621988f74c6980c1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1b944b4b7daee014e9b8b352621988f74c6980c1/0_149_5184_3110/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Brexit was the marker of a working-class revolt\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Brexit was the marker of a working-class revolt.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark Thomas/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The wave of populism marks the return of class as a central agency in politics, both in the UK and the US. This is particularly remarkable in the US. For many decades, the idea of the \u201cworking class\u201d was marginal to American political discourse. Most Americans described themselves as middle class, a reflection of the aspirational pulse at the heart of American society. According to a Gallup poll, in 2000 only 33% of Americans called themselves working class; by 2015 the figure was 48%, almost half the population.</p> <p>Brexit, too, was primarily a working-class revolt. Hitherto, on both sides of the Atlantic, the agency of class has been in retreat in the face of the emergence of a new range of identities and issues from gender and race to sexual orientation and the environment. The return of class, because of its sheer reach, has the potential, like no other issue, to redefine the political landscape.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The working class belongs to no one: its orientation, far from predetermined, is a function of politics</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The re-emergence of class should not be confused with the labour movement. They are not synonymous: this is obvious in the US and increasingly the case in the UK. Indeed, over the last half-century, there has been a growing separation between the two in Britain. The re-emergence of the working class as a political voice in Britain, most notably in the Brexit vote, can best be described as an inchoate expression of resentment and protest, with only a very weak sense of belonging to the labour movement.</p> <p>Indeed, Ukip has been as important \u2013 in the form of immigration and Europe \u2013 in shaping its current attitudes as the Labour party. In the United States, both Trump and Sanders have given expression to the working-class revolt, the latter almost as much as the former. The working class belongs to no one: its orientation, far from predetermined, as the left liked to think, is a function of politics.</p> <p>The neoliberal era is being undermined from two directions. First, if its record of economic growth has never been particularly strong, it is now dismal. Europe is barely larger than it was on the eve of the financial crisis in 2007; the United States has done better but even its growth has been anaemic. Economists such as Larry Summers believe that the prospect for the future is most likely one of <a href=\"http://larrysummers.com/category/secular-stagnation/\">secular stagnation</a>.</p> <p>Worse, because the recovery has been so weak and fragile, there is a widespread belief that another financial crisis may well beckon. In other words, the neoliberal era has delivered the west back into the kind of crisis-ridden world that we last experienced in the 1930s. With this background, it is hardly surprising that a majority in the west now believe their children will be worse off than they were. Second, those who have lost out in the neoliberal era are no longer prepared to acquiesce in their fate \u2013 they are increasingly in open revolt. We are witnessing the end of the neoliberal era. It is not dead, but it is in its early death throes, just as the social-democratic era was during the 1970s.</p> <p>A sure sign of the declining influence of neoliberalism is the rising chorus of intellectual voices raised against it. From the mid-70s through the 80s, the economic debate was increasingly dominated by monetarists and free marketeers. But since the western financial crisis, the centre of gravity of the intellectual debate has shifted profoundly. This is most obvious in the United States, with economists such as Joseph Stiglitz, Paul Krugman, Dani Rodrik and Jeffrey Sachs becoming increasingly influential. Thomas Piketty\u2019s <em>Capital in the Twenty-First Century</em> has been a massive seller. His work and that of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/oct/15/nobel-prize-for-economics-runners-riders\">Tony Atkinson and Angus Deaton</a> have pushed the question of the inequality to the top of the political agenda. In the UK, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/hajoonchang\">Ha-Joon Chang</a>, for long isolated within the economics profession, has gained a following far greater than those who think economics is a branch of mathematics.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d8de8c75d289f1f1c95c1e82e49c98672aff35e7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d8de8c75d289f1f1c95c1e82e49c98672aff35e7/0_4_4267_2561/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Virtually no one foresaw the triumph of Jeremy Corbyn\u2019, pictured at a rally in north London last week.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Virtually no one foresaw the triumph of Jeremy Corbyn\u2019, pictured at rally in north London last week.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Daniel Leal-Olivas/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Meanwhile, some of those who were previously strong advocates of a neoliberal approach, such as Larry Summers and the <em>Financial Times</em>\u2019s Martin Wolf, have become extremely critical. The wind is in the sails of the critics of neoliberalism; the neoliberals and monetarists are in retreat. In the UK, the media and political worlds are well behind the curve. Few recognise that we are at the end of an era. Old attitudes and assumptions still predominate, whether on the BBC\u2019s <em>Today</em> programme, in the rightwing press or the parliamentary Labour party.</p> <p>Following Ed Miliband\u2019s resignation as Labour leader, virtually no one foresaw the triumph of Jeremy Corbyn in the subsequent leadership election. The assumption had been more of the same, a Blairite or a halfway house like Miliband, certainly not anyone like Corbyn. But the zeitgeist had changed. The membership, especially the young who had joined the party on an unprecedented scale, wanted a complete break with New Labour. One of the reasons why the left has failed to emerge as the leader of the new mood of working-class disillusionment is that most social democratic parties became, in varying degrees, disciples of neoliberalism and uber-globalisation. The most extreme forms of this phenomenon were New Labour and the Democrats, who in the late 90s and 00s became its advance guard, personified by Tony Blair and Bill Clinton, triangulation and the third way.</p> <p>But as David Marquand observed in a review for the <em>New Statesman</em>, what is the point of a social democratic party if it doesn\u2019t represent the less fortunate, the underprivileged and the losers? New Labour deserted those who needed them, who historically they were supposed to represent. Is it surprising that large sections have now deserted the party who deserted them? Blair, in his reincarnation as a money-obsessed consultant to a shady bunch of presidents and dictators, is a fitting testament to the demise of New Labour.</p> <p>The rival contenders \u2013 Burnham, Cooper and Kendall \u2013 represented continuity. They were swept away by Corbyn, who won nearly 60% of the votes. New Labour was over, as dead as Monty Python\u2019s parrot. Few grasped the meaning of what had happened. A <em>Guardian</em> leader welcomed the surge in membership and then, lo and behold, urged support for Yvette Cooper, the very antithesis of the reason for the enthusiasm. The PLP refused to accept the result and ever since has tried with might and main to remove Corbyn.</p> <p>Just as the Labour party took far too long to come to terms with the rise of Thatcherism and the birth of a new era at the end of the 70s, now it could not grasp that the Thatcherite paradigm, which they eventually came to embrace in the form of New Labour, had finally run its course. Labour, like everyone else, is obliged to think anew. The membership in their antipathy to New Labour turned to someone who had never accepted the latter, who was the polar opposite in almost every respect of Blair, and embodying an authenticity and decency which Blair patently did not.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Labour may be in intensive care, but the condition of the Conservatives is not a great deal better</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Corbyn is not a product of the new times, he is a throwback to the late 70s and early 80s. That is both his strength and also his weakness. He is uncontaminated by the New Labour legacy because he has never accepted it. But nor, it would seem, does he understand the nature of the new era. The danger is that he is possessed of feet of clay in what is a highly fluid and unpredictable political environment, devoid of any certainties of almost any kind, in which Labour finds itself dangerously divided and weakened.</p> <p>Labour may be in intensive care, but the condition of the Conservatives is not a great deal better. David Cameron was guilty of a huge and irresponsible miscalculation over Brexit. He was forced to resign in the most ignominious of circumstances. The party is hopelessly divided. It has no idea in which direction to move after Brexit. The Brexiters painted an optimistic picture of turning away from the declining European market and embracing the expanding markets of the world, albeit barely mentioning by name which countries it had in mind. It looks as if the new prime minister may have an anachronistic hostility towards China and a willingness to undo the good work of George Osborne. If the government turns its back on China, by far the fastest growing market in the world, where are they going to turn?</p> <p>Brexit has left the country fragmented and deeply divided, with the very real prospect that Scotland might choose independence. Meanwhile, the Conservatives seem to have little understanding that the neoliberal era is in its death throes.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a3a66e9b7acb68ce994770540486f274728d20d3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a3a66e9b7acb68ce994770540486f274728d20d3/0_140_4658_2796/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Put America first\u2019: Donald Trump in Cleveland last month.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Put America first\u2019: Donald Trump in Cleveland last month.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Joe Raedle/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Dramatic as events have been in the UK, they cannot compare with those in the United States. Almost from nowhere, Donald Trump rose to capture the Republican nomination and confound virtually all the pundits and not least his own party. His message was straightforwardly anti-globalisation. He believes that the interests of the working class have been sacrificed in favour of the big corporations that have been encouraged to invest around the world and thereby deprive American workers of their jobs. Further, he argues that large-scale immigration has weakened the bargaining power of American workers and served to lower their wages.</p> <p>He proposes that US corporations should be required to invest their cash reserves in the US. He believes that the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) has had the effect of exporting American jobs to Mexico. On similar grounds, he is opposed to the TPP and the TTIP. And he also accuses China of stealing American jobs, threatening to impose a 45% tariff on Chinese imports.</p> <p>To globalisation Trump counterposes economic nationalism: \u201cPut America first\u201d. His appeal, above all, is to the white working class who, until Trump\u2019s (and Bernie Sander\u2019s) arrival on the political scene, had been ignored and largely unrepresented since the 1980s. Given that their wages have been falling for most of the last 40 years, it is extraordinary how their interests have been neglected by the political class. Increasingly, they have voted Republican, but the Republicans have long been captured by the super-rich and Wall Street, whose interests, as hyper-globalisers, have run directly counter to those of the white working class. With the arrival of Trump they finally found a representative: they won Trump the Republican nomination.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Trump believes that America\u2019s pursuit of great power status has squandered the nation\u2019s resources</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The economic nationalist argument has also been vigorously pursued by Bernie Sanders, who ran Hillary Clinton extremely close for the Democratic nomination and would probably have won but for more than 700 so-called super-delegates, who were effectively chosen by the Democratic machine and overwhelmingly supported Clinton. As in the case of the Republicans, the Democrats have long supported a neoliberal, pro-globalisation strategy, notwithstanding the concerns of its trade union base. Both the Republicans and the Democrats now find themselves deeply polarised between the pro- and anti-globalisers, an entirely new development not witnessed since the shift towards neoliberalism under Reagan almost 40 years ago.</p> <p>Another plank of Trump\u2019s nationalist appeal \u2013 \u201cMake America great again\u201d \u2013 is his position on foreign policy. He believes that America\u2019s pursuit of great power status has squandered the nation\u2019s resources. He argues that the country\u2019s alliance system is unfair, with America bearing most of the cost and its allies contributing far too little. He points to Japan and South Korea, and Nato\u2019s European members as prime examples.He seeks to rebalance these relationships and, failing that, to exit from them.</p> <p>As a country in decline, he argues that America can no longer afford to carry this kind of financial burden. Rather than putting the world to rights, he believes the money should be invested at home, pointing to the dilapidated state of America\u2019s infrastructure. <a href=\"https://www.donaldjtrump.com/press-releases/donald-j.-trump-foreign-policy-speech\">Trump\u2019s position</a> represents a major critique of America as the world\u2019s hegemon. His arguments mark a radical break with the neoliberal, hyper-globalisation ideology that has reigned since the early 1980s and with the foreign policy orthodoxy of most of the postwar period. These arguments must be taken seriously. They should not be lightly dismissed just because of their authorship. But Trump is no man of the left. He is a populist of the right. He has launched a racist and xenophobic attack on Muslims and on Mexicans. Trump\u2019s appeal is to a white working class that feels it has been cheated by the big corporations, undermined by Hispanic immigration, and often resentful towards African-Americans who for long too many have viewed as their inferior.</p> <p>A Trump America would mark a descent into authoritarianism characterised by abuse, scapegoating, discrimination, racism, arbitrariness and violence; America would become a deeply polarised and divided society. His threat to impose <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-navarro-trump-trade-china-tariffs-20160721-snap-story.html\">45% tariffs on China</a>, if implemented, would certainly provoke retaliation by the Chinese and herald the beginnings of a new era of protectionism.</p> <p>Trump may well lose the presidential election just as Sanders failed in his bid for the Democrat nomination. But this does not mean that the forces opposed to hyper-globalisation \u2013 unrestricted immigration, TPP and TTIP, the free movement of capital and much else \u2013 will have lost the argument and are set to decline. In little more than 12 months, Trump and Sanders have transformed the nature and terms of the argument. Far from being on the wane, the arguments of the critics of hyper-globalisation are steadily gaining ground. Roughly two-thirds of Americans agree that \u201cwe should not think so much in international terms but concentrate more on our own national problems\u201d. And, above all else, what will continue to drive opposition to the hyper-globalisers is inequality.</p>",
  "<p>In the run-up to the referendum on 23 June, the European Union was divided between optimists and pessimists. The pessimists \u2013 the majority \u2013 saw Brexit as a huge threat. A British vote to leave would strengthen \u201ccentrifugal forces\u201d and could even be the beginning of the end of the EU. The optimists \u2013 the minority \u2013 saw it as an opportunity. The shock of Brexit could galvanise the EU to move ahead with further integration, especially in areas that the UK had blocked. But both optimists and pessimists agreed that, if the UK did actually vote to leave, the EU would need to respond.</p> <p>Two months on from the referendum, however, little has happened beyond declarations of commitment to the future of the European project. The reason for this odd period of apparent inactivity is not just the lull caused by the summer break or even the shock of the British vote to leave the EU. It is also that, although everybody in Europe seems to agree that something must be done to respond to the Brexit vote, no one can seem to agree on what.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>German politicians are aware that expectations have increased, but so have fears of German power</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>While Europeans have watched the chaos that has been British politics over the last two months and waited for the new government to decide what it wanted, there have been plenty of exhortations to see Brexit as a wake-up call. But what Europeans are supposed to do if and when they wake up is less clear. Many among Europe\u2019s great and good have urged a new focus on the \u201cessentials\u201d, what is being called the \u201cEurope of necessity\u201d. The EU must deliver for citizens,but how?</p> <p>Far from lurching towards the superstate that British Eurosceptics always feared, the reality is that the EU is paralysed by the multiple intersecting fault lines that already existed within it \u2013 between creditor and debtor countries, between old and new member states and between left and right. This matters for the UK because its negotiation about a new relationship with the EU will be linked to the parallel deals between Europeans on the other areas that matter most to them, in particular economic policy and refugee policy.</p> <p>At the centre of all this, geographically and politically, is Germany. The Brexit vote has thrust Berlin into an even more pivotal position \u2013 the future of the EU will now revolve even more tightly around Germany. German politicians are aware that expectations have increased, but so have fears of German power. German politicians talk about \u201cleading from the centre\u201d, in other words, to drive policy but to do so by seeking to find a European consensus.</p> <p>What this means in practice is a kind of hub-and-spoke Europe in which diplomacy, bilaterally and in groups, centres on Berlin. It began, disastrously, when the German foreign minister, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/25/eu-emergency-talks-brexit-berlin\" title=\"\">invited the foreign ministers of the six founding member states of the EU</a> to Berlin the weekend after the referendum. The meeting was meant to be a show of European unity but inevitably alienated other member states.</p> <p>Since then, Angela Merkel and Steinmeier have met other European leaders to prepare for the post-Brexit summit that will take place in Bratislava on 16 September. Tomorrow, the Italian prime minister, Matteo Renzi, will host Merkel and the French president, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, on Ventotene, an island off Naples where, in 1941, two interned anti-fascist activists wrote a famous manifesto calling for a federation of European states.</p> <p>However, despite all this diplomatic activity centred on Berlin, there is unlikely to be much progress by the time of the summit on the two biggest challenges for the EU: the eurozone and the refugee crisis. In both cases, the differences, roughly, between north and south in the eurozone and east and west on the refugee crisis, remain as wide as ever. If any initiatives are announced in Bratislava, they are likely to be in other less divisive areas such as better co-operation on counter-terrorism and perhaps some small steps in integrating European security and defence policy.</p> <p>The problem is that this is unlikely to do much to stop the rise of Euroscepticism, which most recognise is not an exclusively British phenomenon, even if it is more extreme here. \u201cWe must acknowledge that support and passion for our common project has faded over the last decade in parts of our societies,\u201d wrote Steinmeier and the French foreign minister, Jean-Marc Ayrault, in a <a href=\"http://www.voltairenet.org/article192564.html\" title=\"\">joint paper</a> published shortly after the referendum.</p> <p>What some see as a necessary response to Euroscepticism, others see as a capitulation to it. For Guy Verhofstadt, former Belgian prime minister and president of the Liberal group in the European parliament, the lesson of David Cameron\u2019s failure to persuade the British population to remain in the EU was that \u201cone cannot defeat nationalism by pandering to nationalists\u201d. The solution is \u201cmore Europe\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/19/frauke-petry-acceptable-face-of-germany-new-right-interview\">Frauke Petry: the acceptable face of Germany\u2019s new right?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Others see calls to transfer more sovereignty to Brussels as part of the problem rather than the solution. \u201cNeither a simple call for more Europe nor a phase of mere reflection can be an adequate answer,\u201d Ayrault and Steinmeier wrote in their paper. Some, including the Dutch and Polish government, are more interested in devolving power back to the member states.</p> <p>It is also almost universally recognised that ways must be found to better legitimate European integration. But this is another mere aspiration. While some want a tighter EU centred on the eurozone, with its own parliament, others want a looser EU based on the idea of \u201cvariable geometry\u201d in which national parliaments would play a greater role.</p> <p>For the first time in the history of European integration, Germany is putting the brakes on. The shift is exemplified by the transformation in the attitude of the finance minister, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, since his tough treatment of Greece last summer, the most popular politician in Germany. Sch\u00e4uble is generally seen as the most \u201cpro-European\u201d member of Merkel\u2019s cabinet. But even before the referendum, he said in an interview with <em>Der</em> <em>Spiegel</em> that the EU couldn\u2019t simply react to a British vote to leave the EU with a call for more integration.</p> <p>German officials increasingly justify positions such as this on the basis of the need for a European consensus \u2013 it must occupy a middle ground between different member states. But this is typically disingenuous. In reality, there is national politics behind Germany\u2019s opposition to further integration. Euroscepticism is rising in Germany too, not just among voters who are drifting to the Eurosceptic <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/19/frauke-petry-acceptable-face-of-germany-new-right-interview\" title=\"\">Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland</a> party but also in bastions of the establishment such as the Bundesbank and the <em>Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung</em>.</p> <p>The reality is that while an overwhelming majority of Germans remain committed to the EU, many no longer see further integration as being in the national interest. When France and Italy talk about more \u201crisk sharing\u201d in the eurozone, Germans see this as a stealth attempt to the \u201ctransfer union\u201d \u2013 in other words, an EU in which the fiscally responsible subsidise the fiscally irresponsible \u2013 that they have always feared. With a presidential election in France and a general election in Germany in 2017, positions are likely to harden over the next 12 months.</p> <p>This may all seem like the kind of arcane drama from which Britain voted on 23 June to liberate itself. But whether Britons like it or not, it will inform the way the EU negotiates with the UK. Behind the European commission\u2019s negotiating position will be member states concerned about Euroscepticism at home. It is the fear of empowering the Front National in France and the AfD in Germany, rather than a desire to \u201cpunish\u201d Britain, which is behind the reluctance to give the UK the \u201cbest of both worlds\u201d that it wants. There may also be implicit trade-offs between member states linking the negotiation with the UK and negotiations in other areas.</p> <p>Chancellor Merkel seems, for now, to have prevailed with her patient approach to Brexit; as the reality set in that there was nothing anyone could do to make the UK invoke article 50, the calls for the UK to \u201cgo quickly\u201d largely stopped. Informal negotiations even seem to be taking place despite the initial Brussels mantra of \u201cno negotiation before notification\u201d.</p> <p>But two months on from the referendum, the answer to the big question \u2013 will the UK be able to negotiate access to the single market, particularly for services, while restricting immigration from the EU? \u2013 remains unclear. Last week, Germany\u2019s European affairs minister indicated Britain could be given a \u201cspecial status\u201d. To British ears, that might sound like the best of both worlds \u2013 perhaps the access to the single market that comes with EEA membership together with the ability to restrict immigration that comes with a looser trade agreement. Whether that turns out to be wishful thinking will depend on the domestic political pressures on Europe\u2019s leaders and the negotiation between them about the future of the EU \u201cat 27\u201d.</p> <p><em>Hans Kundnani is senior transatlantic fellow at the </em><a href=\"http://www.gmfus.org/\" title=\"\"><em>German Marshall Fund of the United States</em></a><em>, based in Berlin.</em></p>"

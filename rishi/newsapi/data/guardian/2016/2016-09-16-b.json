  "<p>Donald Trump on Friday attempted to resolve an issue that is thought to have caused him significant damage with minority voters by admitting that Barack Obama was born in the US after years of promoting false claims that the US president was born in Kenya. <br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2016/sep/16/donald-trump-barack-obama-birther-movement-election-live\">Trump finally admits Obama was born in the US \u2013 campaign live</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But the Republican presidential candidate continued to falsely claim that his Democratic rival Hillary Clinton was behind the conspiracy theory. </p> <p>Speaking in the presidential ballroom of his new luxury hotel in Washington, Trump boasted about his new establishment, trotted out over a half-dozen generals to fawn over him and then almost casually remarked that he now thinks the president was born in the US, before walking swiftly away in what bore more resemblance to a dog and pony show than a campaign event.</p> <p>Trump finally said the words \u201cPresident Barack Obama was born in the United States, period\u201d after <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2016/05/05/fact-check-hillary-clinton-donald-trump-birther-movement-obama/83968036/\">falsely blaming</a> Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2008 campaign for starting the rumor, an accusation that <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2016/05/06/donald-trumps-ridiculous-claim-that-hillary-clinton-started-the-birther-movement/?tid=a_inl\">the Washington Post\u2019s fact-checker called</a> \u201cridiculous\u201d.</p> <p>Although Trump\u2019s campaign released a statement on the topic last night, the Republican nominee had never publicly acknowledged that Obama was born in the US.</p> <p>Trump had long fanned the flames of this conspiracy theory, known as \u201cbirtherism\u201d. He spent much of spring 2011 <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/03/us/politics/donald-trump-birther-obama.html?_r=0\">garnering media attention</a> by constantly claiming without any evidence that Obama might have born overseas. The allegations that Obama, who was born in Honolulu on 4 August 1961, was born in Kenya have long been considered a racist dogwhistle.</p> <p>Although his campaign said in the statement sent late night: \u201cIn 2011, Mr Trump was finally able to bring this ugly incident to its conclusion by successfully compelling President Obama to release his birth certificate,\u201d Trump has repeatedly questioned the circumstances of Obama\u2019s birth since then. </p> <p>As recently as 2014, Trump<a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/andrewkaczynski/trump-questioned-obama-birth-certificate-in-2014-despite-cam?utm_term=.csvXxGMzl#.yiQ0nqz5E\"> suggested</a> that Obama\u2019s birth certificate was faked, and in 2013 <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/411247268763676673?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">he even suggested</a> that the late state health official who certified the birth certificate had been murdered. In an interview published on Thursday in the Washington Post, Trump hedged on the question, saying: \u201cI\u2019ll answer that question at the right time. I just don\u2019t want to answer it yet.\u201d</p> <p>His answer on Friday was limited to only a few seconds at the end of 40-minute event, which was inaccurately billed as a press conference and then as Trump finally addressing the topic of Obama\u2019s birthplace. </p> <p>Instead, it was as CNN anchor Jake Tapper called it, a \u201crick roll\u201d, analogizing it to the internet practice of sending a email promising one thing and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ\">replacing it with a link</a> to the 1987 Rick Astley music video for Never Going to Give You Up.</p> <p>Trump started the event by praising his new hotel, stating: \u201cI think when this hotel opens \u2013 one of the best hotels anywhere in the world \u2026 I really think this will be the best hotel in Washington.\u201d He was followed by a parade of former generals and Medal of Honor recipients who repeatedly lauded Trump in glowing terms, all aired live on cable television. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/sep/16/donald-trump-barack-obama-birther-theory-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/53bhd\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2724745\"            data-video-name=\"A short history of Donald Trump's 'birther' conspiracy \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"ABC/The View, NBC/Today show, PBS Newshour, Donald Trump/YouTube, MSNBC\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57dc5c11e4b0df02df202fd1\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/09/16/160916birther_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/09/16/160916birther.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/09/16/160916birther_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/sep/16/donald-trump-barack-obama-birther-theory-video\">Donald Trump\u2019s birther comments: a short history</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Only then did Trump address the matter at hand. \u201cNow, not to mention her in the same breath, but Hillary Clinton and her campaign of 2008 started the birther controversy,\u201d he said. \u201cI finished it. I finished it. You know what I mean, President Barack Obama was born in the United States, period. Now we all want to get back to making America strong and great again. Thank you.\u201d </p> <p>Trump concluded his remarks as reporters, separated from the podium by six rows of Trump supporters attending as spectators, attempted to ask questions.</p> <p>The spectacle happened as rival Clinton spoke only a few blocks away at the Black Women\u2019s Agenda symposium, held at a downtown hotel. </p> <p>Clinton said that \u201cthere is no erasing\u201d Trump\u2019s role in spreading the \u201cbirther\u201d gospel. \u201cFor five years he has led the birther movement to delegitimize our first black president,\u201d she said. \u201cHis campaign was founded on this outrageous lie.</p> <p>\u201cHe is feeding into the worst impulses, the bigotry and bias, that lurks in our country. Barack Obama was born in America, plain and simple, and Donald Trump owes him and the American people an apology.\u201d</p> <p>Pausing frequently for rounds of enthusiastic clapping, Clinton thanked the group for boosting her candidacy in the primary season and said a strong turnout by African American women could tip the election in her favor.</p> <p>\u201cIn many ways, this profound choice is up to the women in this room,\u201d she said. </p> <p>\u201cAfrican American women turned out to vote more than any other group of Americans in 2012. This year, once again, you have your hands on the wheel of history and you can write the next chapter of the American story.\u201d</p> <p>Her campaign manager, Robby Mook, said in a statement: \u201cTrump\u2019s actions today were disgraceful. After five years of pushing a racist conspiracy theory into the mainstream, it was appalling to watch Trump appoint himself the judge of whether the President of the United States is American.</p> <p>\u201cThis sickening display shows more than ever why Donald Trump is totally unfit be president.\u201d</p> <p>When asked about Trump\u2019s views on his birthplace earlier in the day, Obama told reporters: \u201cI\u2019m shocked that a question like that has come up at a time when we have so many other things to do.\u201d</p> <p>He added: \u201cWell, I\u2019m not that shocked actually. It\u2019s fairly typical. We got other things to attend to. I was pretty confident about where I was born. I think most people were as well. My hope would be the presidential election reflects more serious issues than that.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>All real Donald Trump press releases sound like they were composed of lines cut from satirical Donald Trump press releases.

You might as well have a Socratic debate with a fart.</p> <p>A decade or so ago, I remember reading a statistic about how pretty much everyone under a certain cut-off age instinctively rang doorbells with their thumb \u2013 raised on games consoles and mobile phones and whatnot \u2013 while pretty much everyone over the age still used an index finger.

But with the greatest of respect to these viewpoints, I can\u2019t help feeling that a good portion of our best hope for countering Trumpvision lies in the hands of that younger (to me) generation, who reflexively seem to understand what in the name of insanity is happening now far better than their elders, and increasingly seem more likely to find a way of countering it.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/dQw4w9WgXcQ?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ\">Rick Astley: Never Gonna Give You Up</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Youth isn\u2019t always wasted on the young, and even the most self-regarding old hands must concede that Trump has almost all of them looking flatfooted.

  "<p>To boost Donald Trump\u2019s prospects of becoming president, the National Rifle Association is poised to pour more than $15m into ads in several battleground states to defeat Hillary Clinton, the most vocal pro-gun-control presidential candidate in years, according to an NRA board member.</p> <p>The NRA has already plowed almost $6.5m into TV spots in several key states bashing Clinton and one NRA board member told the Guardian that the pro-gun goliath will spend \u201cmultiples\u201d of that figure by election day on the presidential contest.</p> <p>Next week, the NRA is slated to launch another seven-figure round of TV ads in Nevada, North Carolina, Ohio and Pennsylvania. Last month, the NRA made a $3m ad buy in these states that branded Clinton as a \u201chypocrite\u201d for accepting secret service protection, while calling for more gun control, which the ad charged \u201cwould leave you defenseless\u201d. An earlier NRA ad buy attacked Clinton on Benghazi.</p> <p>In 2012, the NRA spent $15m in the hope of making Barack Obama a one-term president, and this year\u2019s spending to defeat Clinton is expected to surpass that sum, according to the board member and another NRA source. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/06/gun-control-activists-dc-rally-nra-congress\">Gun control activists at DC rally pledge to vote NRA supporters out of Congress</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The five million-member NRA\u2019s embrace of Trump, who once backed more gun control measures, has been spurred in part by its intense fear of a Clinton presidency. </p> <p> Democrats running for president have traditionally shown \u201ctrepidation\u201d about calling for more gun control, notes Matt Schlapp, the chairman of the American Conservative Union. But this year, Schlapp told the Guardian, \u201cthe NRA and gun enthusiasts are faced with the specter of a Democrat running for the White House embracing additional gun control\u201d.</p> <p>The NRA disdains Clinton\u2019s advocacy of moderate gun control measures \u2013including expanding background checks on gun purchases and reinstating a ban on assault weapons to curb mass shootings \u2013 but is fearful that she would nominate supreme court justices who do not concur with the NRA\u2019s staunch opposition to new gun controls.</p> <p>\u201cThis race is probably more about the supreme court than anything else from the NRA\u2019s perspective,\u201d said the NRA board member. </p> <p>The supreme court stakes are high: the vacancy created by the death of conservative Antonin Scalia is likely to remain open until the next president takes office. And the NRA is especially concerned that a more liberal court might overturn an earlier supreme court decision, known as Heller, which established an individual\u2019s right to keep a handgun in the house for self-defense.</p> <p>Significantly, the NRA\u2019s endorsement of Trump in May at its annual convention came earlier than usual: Mitt Romney and John McCain had to wait until October in 2012 and 2008 to get the NRA\u2019s blessing.</p> <p>The NRA\u2019s commitment to Trump was underscored when Chris Cox, the NRA\u2019s top lobbyist gave a primetime speech at the GOP convention this summer, a first for the increasingly GOP-oriented pro-gun lobbying behemoth. A senior GOP operative noted that historically the NRA \u201ctries to stay assiduously non-partisan. The dynamics of speaking at a convention are a little dicey.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/15/donald-trump-nra-guns-terrorism-watch-lists\">Trump to meet with NRA over barring guns for those on terrorism watch lists</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The NRA\u2019s big campaign blitz has been partly fueled by an aggressive fundraising operation which in recent years has targeted mega-donors. In 2014, for instance, the NRA received $4.9m from Freedom Partners Chamber of Commerce, the financial hub of the conservative advocacy network backed by the billionaire Koch brothers. The NRA is hoping to pull in another seven-figure grant this year, say two NRA sources, although nothing has come in yet and the Koch network itself is not focusing on the presidential race and Trump has been sharply criticized by Charles Koch.</p> <p>The NRA\u2019s entree to the Koch world stems in part from bonds that the gun group\u2019s top officials have forged. One donor who goes to the twice-a-year policy and fundraising retreats hosted by the Koch network, told the Guardian that the NRA\u2019s top executive, Wayne LaPierre, has attended them on a couple of occasions, affording him a chance to pitch and schmooze with big network donors such as investor Foster Friess.</p> <p>Another key big-money link involves the hedge fund tycoon Robert Mercer, who has given a pro-Trump Super Pac at least $2m, and is also a lifetime NRA member and a Koch network donor. This year Cambridge Analytica, a voter data firm in which Mercer is a key investor, has worked with the Herald Group, a DC-based consulting firm, to implement the NRA\u2019s \u201cTrigger the Vote\u201d drive to register new voters and get them to the polls. i360, a big voter data firm that is closely tied to the Koch donor network, has also been involved in the Trigger the Vote campaign. </p> <p>The pro-Trump blitz comes despite the real estate mogul\u2019s earlier backing for a ban on assault weapons and longer waiting periods for background checks with gun purchases, ideas that the NRA has rejected. But Trump\u2019s high-decibel anti-gun-control rhetoric this year seems to have ingratiated him with the NRA brass, and coupled with the strong pro-gun records of Trump\u2019s two sons, proved instrumental in winning the NRA\u2019s backing.</p> <p>Trump and the NRA parted ways briefly earlier this year, when Trump responded to the Orlando massacre by suggesting that if the nightclub where it took place had allowed its guests to bring in arms, then the killings could have been averted. The NRA quickly shot back to distance itself from Trump: speaking to an ABC news show, the group\u2019s top lobbyist, Cox, said that Trump\u2019s calls for arming people in clubs \u201cdefies common sense. It also defies the law.\u201d</p>",

One of the oddest and most enduring Vatican novels was written directly as revenge on the church. Rejected as a candidate for the priesthood, the English author Frederick Rolfe wrote, under the pseudonym \u201cBaron Corvo\u201d, a novel, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/jun/02/100-best-novels-hadrian-seventh-frederick-rolfe\"><em>Hadrian the Seventh </em></a>(1904), in which a failed priest is later made pope by a repentant Vatican. In 1967, it was adapted by Peter Luke into a successful play, with Alec McCowen as the surprise leader of the faithful.</p> <p>Whereas Marlowe and Rolfe were personally motivated to take on the pope, most writers in the genre are attracted by the external drama. Head of the only church that is also a nation state, the pope fascinates because of a doubly unusual lifestyle. He is denied sex, one of the most powerful human desires. Harris\u2019s <em>Conclave</em> and West\u2019s <em>The Clowns of God</em> (1980) both turn, as did <em>Holy Father</em>, a play I wrote for BBC Radio 4 last year, on ways in which the ecclesiastical rules of sexuality might be tested without sin. However, those priests who become cardinals are tantalised by the prospect of another Darwinian driving motivation \u2013 power \u2013 at a level perhaps only matched by the American presidency.</p> <p>As a result, ecclesiastical politics clearly have a resonance beyond religion. Vatican fictions tend to have the same main plotline: a contest between reforming and orthodox candidates. This reflects the narrative of most actual papal elections \u2013 these stories tend to be a serious exploration of what is supposed to be a famously apocryphal question: is the pope a Catholic? \u2013 but such testing for heresy is also common in political parties, such as, at the moment, Labour in the UK and the Republicans in the US.</p> <p>It feels logical that Harris should have turned to the papacy after having written thrillers about a Blairite prime minister in <em>The Ghost</em> and the politics of ancient Rome in his Cicero trilogy. The incense-filled rooms of a conclave (the name by which the heavily sequestered papal election assembly is known) have an obvious parallel with the smoke-filled rooms of the traditional political procedural. And, as in presidential and prime ministerial fictions, a key decision for papal narratives is whether the made-up characters should be seen in succession to real-life figures.</p> <p>In an author\u2019s note to <em>Conclave</em>, Harris insists that the man whose death kicks off his plot \u201cis not the current pope\u201d. This disclaimer is probably necessary because the late pontiff is revealed to have made some eccentric decisions but, as Harris\u2019s \u201clate Holy Father\u201d shares most of the biography of Pope Francis and has also made identical speeches, it is in practice impossible not to impose his face on the character. Even more baldly, Piers Paul Read\u2019s thriller <em>The Death of a Pope</em> (2009) superimposes the crisis of a fictional priest on a documentary account of the death of John Paul II and the election of Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger as Benedict XVI.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"07326109007b6daebbc3e63a7ec84c86802834f2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/07326109007b6daebbc3e63a7ec84c86802834f2/2112_111_3504_2103/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Robert Harris\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Robert Harris\u2019s forthcoming book, <em>Conclave,</em> focuses on the election of a new pope.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Eamonn McCabe/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Contrastingly, Morris West, the Australian novelist who is commonly considered the pope of the Vatican thriller, created an elaborate alternative progression. Pope Kiril I in <em>The Shoes of the Fisherman</em> is succeeded by Gregory XVII in <em>The Clowns of God</em>, who gives way to Leo XIV in <em>Lazarus</em> (1990).</p> <p>West\u2019s novels have an astonishing record of prophecy. <em>The Shoes of the Fisherman</em> was published on the day that John XXIII died, and imagined an eastern European anti-Soviet cardinal ending the long line of Italian popes, which duly happened in 1978, when Cardinal Wotyla of Krak\u00f3w became John Paul II. The unlikely plot of <em>The Clowns of God</em> (1981), in which a pope resigns because he can no longer face the burdens of office, was validated in February 2013 by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/feb/11/pope-benedict-xvi-resigns-age\">the retirement of Benedict XVI</a>. In West\u2019s final conclave novel, <em>Eminence</em> (1998), the leading candidate to become pope, a Latin American radical called Cardinal Luca Rossini, now reads as a spooky preview of the Argentinian Jorge Mario Bergoglio becoming Pope Francis.</p> <p>Whether or not Bergoglio knew it, fiction had got to his papal name before he did: a cardinal takes it at the end of the conclave imagined in <em>The Vicar of Christ</em> (1979) by the American writer, Walter F Murphy. Most novelists, though, extend one of the existing nominal lists, with some more popular than others.</p> <p>The year before West annointed a Gregory XVII, another one had appeared in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/anthonyburgess\">Anthony Burgess</a>\u2019s <em>Earthly Powers</em> (1980). The book\u2019s gay, atheist narrator, Kenneth Toomey, is the brother in law of Carlo Campanati, an Italian cleric who rose to become Gregory XVII, and has become a candidate for sainthood after a miracle that Toomey witnessed.</p> <p>In Burgess\u2019s alternative version of the 20th century, Cardinal Campanati takes the post-1958 papacy occupied in reality by John XXIII. There has in fact been no 24th John \u2013 as the former Cardinal Roncalli of Venice was identified as the most reforming pope of modern times, direct identification by a successor would have risked a schism in the Vatican \u2013 although two have appeared in very contrasting works of fantasy fiction.</p> <p>In Kingsley Amis\u2019s <em>The Alteration</em> (1976), the Reformation has not happened and England remains a Roman Catholic country, obedient to the religious rule from Rome of a Yorkshire-born pontiff, who seems to be a caricature of Harold Wilson, British prime minister at the time Amis was writing. The John XXIV of the <a href=\"http://leftbehind.com/\">Left Behind</a> series \u2013 16 books by the Christian evangelists Tim LaHaye and Jerry B Jenkins \u2013 was also contentiously presented. Having become too close to Protestantism, he is taken by God and replaced by the more orthodox Peter II, a designation that no real occupant of the post has ever been arrogant enough to adopt.</p> <p>In <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/grahamgreene\">Graham Greene</a>\u2019s late short story, \u201cThe Last Word\u201d, published in 1988, the line of Johns reaches XXIX, although also stops there, with the last pontiff having become a prisoner of an anti-Christian government. As Greene\u2019s new world order in some way resembles the global caliphate envisaged by Islamic State, a notable political novelist had once again spotted a future trend. West, Dan Brown, Read and now Harris all have plot lines that turn on a perceived Islamist terrorist threat to the office of the papacy.</p> <p>One reason that the role has attracted so many thriller writers is that it is attended by many persistent conspiracy theories. The so-called \u201cSiri thesis\u201d alleges that Cardinal Giuseppe Siri of Genoa was elected pope in 1958, but that, as a conservative, his accession was blocked by liberals who replaced him with John XXIII.</p> <p>Hardcore conspiracists, known as sedevacantists (roughly translating as empty throners) have refused to recognise any of the last six popes, whom they regard as invalid. The fact that Siri himself always denied the claims was explained away, as these things often are, by his being in fear of his life. A more benign version of the thesis \u2013 that Siri might have changed his own mind \u2013 can be glimpsed, in comedic form, behind <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/apr/19/nanni-moretti-pope-film-habemus-papam\"><em>Habemus Papam</em></a><em> </em>(<em>We Have a Pope </em>in the UK), the 2011 film by Nanni Moretti, in which a pontiff goes on the run post-election to avoid taking up office.</p> <p>Better known matters of Vatican contention are the allegation that John Paul I, who died suddenly after only 33 days in office in 1978, was murdered; repeated scandals involving the Vatican Bank, which has been accused of corruption including money laundering; and the belief that a secret document in a Vatican safe (known as \u201cThe Third Secret of F\u00e1tima\u201d), supposedly revealed by a vision of the Virgin Mary to Portuguese children in 1917, contains an apocalyptic secret such as the date of the end of the world.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"113055e281f8c7195f004d65785ef2231f811cd6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/113055e281f8c7195f004d65785ef2231f811cd6/0_0_2696_1617/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Angels Demons.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Willing to kill \u2026 Armin Mueller-Stahl and Ewan McGregor in the 2009 film of Dan Brown\u2019s <em>Angels &amp; Demons</em>.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Everett/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Although John Paul II released the text of the \u201cthird secret\u201d \u2013 which turned out to be a sub-Nostradamus allegory that can be made to represent either the destruction or triumph of Catholicism \u2013 true disbelievers continue to insist that the Vatican publication was a fake in place of a true prophecy considered too terrifying to publicise.</p> <p>Shadows from these various controversies can be spotted in most pontifical fiction. The F\u00e1tima-related belief that Catholicism is withholding terrible information underlies Brown\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/may/15/angels-and-demons\"><em>Angels and Demons</em></a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/the-da-vinci-code\"><em>The Da Vinci Code</em></a>, both of which have popes willing to kill to hide the true story of Christianity. Suspicions about the death of John Paul I mean that deaths and elections of fictional pontiffs are almost always suspicious. Even Burgess, though not operating in the mystery genre, contrives a sudden death during the conclave described in <em>Earthly Powers</em>. These presentations of the devious ease with which the Vatican dissembles also clearly serve as a metaphor for the Catholic church\u2019s unwillingness to address the scandals of priestly paedophilia.</p> <p>Despite papal fiction being such a crowded church, Harris, in <em>Conclave</em>, contrives a twist involving the number of cardinal-electors that seems to me completely new, showing that the genre still has possibilities. Some people claim that the Third Secret of F\u00e1tima warns that the current pope is the last but, if so, the line should continue in fiction.</p> <p><em>\u2022 <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/conclave.html?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\">Conclave</a></em> is published on 22 September; <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/the-young-pope\">The Young Pope</a></em> starts on Sky Atlantic on 27 October; <em><a href=\"https://www.barbican.org.uk/theatre/event-detail.asp?id=19605\">Doctor Faustus</a></em> is at the Barbican, London EC2, until 1 October.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 21 September 2016.

The false allegations that Obama was born in Kenya were widely considered to be a racist dogwhistle.</p> <p>Obama was born in Honolulu on 4 August 1961.</p> <p>In a 2014 interview, Trump\u2019s oldest son Donald Jr, <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/andrewkaczynski/trump-jr-in-2014-praised-his-dads-moral-conviction-on-obama?utm_term=.ohLMe1Dxy#.tc8qA2orM\">praised</a> the New York real estate developer\u2019s birtherism as a sign of his father\u2019s integrity. \u201cDon\u2019t we want politicians to have strong opinions about things that aren\u2019t swayed by public opinion,\u201d asked the younger Trump.</p> <p>Earlier in the day, Clinton was quick to cite Trump\u2019s initial refusal to back away from birtherism as evidence that the Republican nominee was fanning the flames of racial division.</p> <p>Addressing the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute at its annual gala in Washington on Thursday evening, Clinton condemned Trump for continuing to push conspiracy theories surrounding Obama\u2019s birthplace.</p> <p>\u201cHe still wouldn\u2019t say Hawaii.

When will he stop this ugliness, this bigotry?\u201d</p> <p>In her remarks before the gathering of prominent Hispanic leaders, Clinton reiterated her support for comprehensive immigration reform while decrying Trump\u2019s rhetoric against immigrants and Muslims alike.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s no innuendo or dog whistles any more,\u201d Clinton said of the Republican nominee. \u201cIt\u2019s all right out there in the open now.\u201d</p> <p>Earlier in the day Trump reiterated his economic vision, pledging to voters that he would \u201clower your taxes beyond any number you thought possible\u201d at a rally in New Hampshire.<br></p> <p>The promise came just hours after Trump unveiled <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/15/donald-trump-jobs-vision-25-million-economic-policy\">the latest iteration</a> of his fiscal policy at the New York Economic Club in a speech where he said he outlined the ambitious goal of creating 25 million jobs over the next 10 years. The Republican nominee promised to drastically slash taxes with savings coming from reducing federal bureaucrats whom his campaign has derided with phrases like \u201cthe FDA Food Police\u201d. Trump pledged that the result would increase economic growth from 2% to 3.5% and \u201cturn America into a magnet for new jobs\u201d.</p> <p>Clinton\u2019s remarks came after her four-day absence due to pneumonia. Before the Washington event, she first <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/15/hillary-clinton-returns-campaign-pneumonia\">returned to the campaign trail</a> with a rally in Greensboro, North Carolina. Taking stage to James Brown\u2019s I Feel Good, the former secretary of state said she took sick days to \u201creflect\u201d. </p> <p>Clinton told the crowd: \u201cBeing on the trail does not encourage reflection. It\u2019s important to sit with your thoughts every now and again and this helped me to reflect on what this campaign is all about.\u201d </p> <p>Clinton, who has been reluctant to take questions from reporters on the campaign trail, later held a brief press conference after her speech where she dodged repeated questions about when she told running mate Tim Kaine about her diagnosis. </p> <p>The subject of health was relevant for both candidates as an interview of Trump with television personality Dr Mehmet Oz <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/15/donald-trump-dr-oz-medical-report\">aired on Thursday.</a> There, Trump brandished a doctor\u2019s letter and insisted that, although he could lose a few pounds, he was in peak health. In December, Trump\u2019s doctor, Harold Bornstein previously published a letter that said Trump would be \u201cthe healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency\u201d. The Republican nominee is a septuagenarian fond of fast food who doesn\u2019t exercise. </p> <p>The Republican nominee also continued his hostility towards reporters. Trump bragged at his New Hampshire speech that his travelling press pool wasn\u2019t able to attend, which he called \u201creally good news\u201d and proclaimed to a cheering crowd: \u201cI love it.\u201d</p> <p>Earlier in the day, he called for the New York Times to fire their respected national political correspondent <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jmartnyt?lang=en\">Jonathan Martin</a> while also railing against CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper, a debate moderator, because Cooper was \u201cvery biased\u201d and worked for \u201cthe Clinton News Network\u201d.</p> <p>Donald Jr joined in on the act when he told a Philadelphia radio station that \u201cthe media has been [Hillary Clinton\u2019s] number one surrogate in this\u201d. The Trump son added \u201cwithout the media, this wouldn\u2019t even be a contest, but the media has built her up. They\u2019ve let her slide on every indiscrepancy [sic], on every lie, on every DNC game trying to get Bernie Sanders out of this thing. If Republicans were doing that, they\u2019d be warming up the gas chamber right now.\u201d</p> <p>The Clinton campaign quickly bashed Donald Jr\u2019s comments as \u201cinsensitive, divisive, and reckless\u201d. In a statement, the campaign added \u201cthe bottom line is this \u2013 offensive references to the Holocaust are never acceptable, especially from a presidential campaign\u201d.</p>",

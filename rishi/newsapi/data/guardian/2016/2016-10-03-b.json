  "<p>A federal appeals court has issued a stinging ruling dismissing as \u201cnightmare speculation\u201d Indiana governor Mike Pence\u2019s attempt to deter <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/03/refugees-drc-congo-us-syria\">Syrian refugees</a> from settling in the state because of terrorism fears.</p> <p>The decision by the seventh circuit on Monday was the latest legal setback to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/mar/01/indiana-syrian-refugees-resettlement-blocked\">efforts launched by Donald Trump\u2019s running mate</a> in the wake of last November\u2019s Paris terrorist attacks to stop Syrian refugees from coming to Indiana by denying them aid.</p> <p>Like many other states, Indiana receives money from the federal Office of Refugee Resettlement and contracts with humanitarian groups to provide local welfare services to refugees. Under federal law, such help must be provided \u201cwithout regard to race, religion, nationality, sex, or political opinion\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/nov/19/connecticut-welcomes-syrian-refugee-family-indiana-governor-says-no\">Connecticut welcomes Syrian refugee family after Indiana governor says no</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Republican vice-presidential candidate, though, specifically attempted to exclude refugees originating from Syria on the basis that they might be terrorists. He ordered the state not to reimburse groups for the costs of providing aid to Syrians. According to the court, 174 Syrian refugees came to Indiana in the past fiscal year.</p> <p>While this hardline stance may have chimed with the views of Trump, whose immigration policies have included proposing a temporary ban on Muslims entering the US, it was rejected by the three-judge appeals court panel in a six-page ruling that echoed a lower court\u2019s decision earlier this year.</p> <p>\u201cThe governor of Indiana believes, though without evidence, that some of these persons were sent to Syria by ISIS to engage in terrorism and now wish to infiltrate the United States in order to commit terrorist acts here. No evidence of this belief has been presented, however; it is nightmare speculation,\u201d Judge Richard Posner wrote in the <a href=\"http://media.ca7.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/rssExec.pl?Submit=Display&amp;Path=Y2016/D10-03/C:16-1509:J:Posner:aut:T:fnOp:N:1838881:S:0\">opinion</a>.</p> <p>\u201c[Pence] provides no evidence that Syrian terrorists are posing as refugees or that Syrian refugees have ever committed acts of terrorism in the United States. Indeed, as far as can be determined from public sources, no Syrian refugees have been arrested or prosecuted for terrorist acts or attempts in the United States. And if Syrian refugees do pose a terrorist threat, implementation of the governor\u2019s policy would simply increase the risk of terrorism in whatever states Syrian refugees were shunted to.\u201d</p> <p>The opinion adds that Pence\u2019s claim that he is not discriminating based on nationality but purely acting based on safety concerns is \u201cthe equivalent of his saying (not that he does say) that he wants to forbid black people to settle in Indiana not because they\u2019re black but because he\u2019s afraid of them, and since race is therefore not his motive he isn\u2019t discriminating. But that of course would be racial discrimination, just as his targeting Syrian refugees is discrimination on the basis of nationality.\u201d</p> <p>The outcome was expected after Indiana\u2019s plan was received less than warmly in court during oral arguments last month. Courthouse News reported that Judge Frank Easterbrook <a href=\"http://www.courthousenews.com/2016/09/14/indiana-ban-on-syrian-refugees-draws-mockery-from-7th-circuit.htm\">said</a>: \u201cWhen a state makes an argument that\u2019s saying we\u2019re differentiating according to whether somebody is from Syria, but that has nothing to do with national origin, all it produces is a broad smile.\u201d Posner asked: \u201cAre Syrians the only Muslims that Indiana fears?\u201d</p> <p>Ken Falk, legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Indiana, said in a statement: \u201cThe Court of Appeals\u2019 decision underscores what we have said throughout this litigation \u2026 Governor Pence may not constitutionally or legally discriminate against a particular nationality of refugees that are extensively vetted by the federal government.\u201d The ACLU represented Exodus Refugee Immigration, a not-for-profit agency that brought the lawsuit.</p> <p>With immigration and battling Isis key issues in the forthcoming presidential election, leading Republican politicians have accused the federal government of failing to adequately screen refugees and several states have tried to exert more control over who is resettled inside their borders, though immigration is a federal matter.</p> <p>Last Friday, Texas became the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/30/texas-withdraws-federal-refugee-resettlement-program-syrians\">latest state</a> to opt out of the federal refugee resettlement programme, following New Jersey and Kansas earlier this year.</p> <p>But the move will not stop the arrival of refugees from Syria or anywhere else in the Lone Star state. The federal government and aid agencies will instead work to formulate an arrangement that circumvents the state\u2019s administration of the process.</p> <p>The Obama administration has pledged to increase the number of refugees arriving in the US from Syria and other nations. The president <a href=\"http://www.voanews.com/a/us-narrowly-misses-refugee-limit-for-2016/3533782.html\">announced last month</a> that the US would accept 110,000 in fiscal year 2017 \u2013 up from 85,000 in 2016, of which more than 12,500 were Syrian.</p> <p>Pence faces off against Tim Kaine, his Democratic opponent, in the vice-presidential debate in Virginia on Tuesday.</p>",

  "<p>The point being missed in the reporting of the results of the Hungarian referendum is that the 43.9% turnout, which made the referendum result invalid under the Hungarian constitution\u2019s 50% minimum vote rule, was not a sign of voter apathy, as may have been in the case of the EU membership referendum in Britain. In Hungary, the overwhelming majority of the political parties opposed to the ruling Fidesz and the even more rightwing Jobbik positively campaigned for people to abstain as an act of protest or spoil their ballots (something enough people appear to have done to bring the valid votes actually down below 40% of the country\u2019s total electorate).&#xa0;</p> <p>So despite the vast government propaganda effort, which besides its vicious overtones is estimated to have cost far more per head than not just its counterpart in Britain\u2019s EU referendum campaign but also the media spending projected in the US presidential election; and contrary to Orban\u2019s claim of victory, the result is quite a triumph for the opposition.

We have fretted about a candidate\u2019s bacterial infection.</p> <p>Let\u2019s be honest. We have not debated war and peace, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/21/death-of-neoliberalism-crisis-in-western-politics\">capitalism and socialism</a>, or even <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/surveillance\">surveillance and privacy</a>. More than anything else, we have simply obsessed about the psychopathic freak show that is the Trump campaign.</p> <p>Let the historians of the future know that the great Trump-Clinton contest of 2016 was much like the famous Seinfeld pitch to NBC: it\u2019s a show about nothing.</p> <p>In that sense, we have to recognize something profound about this point in time. The blame is not entirely on the candidates or the campaigns, or even on our own shallow nature.</p> <p>For this is an election at a time of relative peace and prosperity. Yes, it\u2019s true: peace and prosperity. And our failure to admit the obvious is hurting our ability to sustain an adult conversation about our politics.</p> <p>If you haven\u2019t already pressed the publish button on your comments below, or tweeted your outrage to the world, it\u2019s time to consider the facts.</p> <p>Yes, of course there are unacceptable levels of gun violence and isolated acts of homegrown terrorism. And the squeeze on the middle class \u2013 as well as the gap between rich and poor \u2013 is a profound challenge to us all.</p> <p>But back in the Seinfeld era, our cities saw far higher murder rates. There were the large-scale terrorist attacks of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/1995/apr/20/usa.iankatz\">Oklahoma City</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/jul/27/olympic-park-bombings-atlanta-1996-richard-jewell\">Atlanta Olympics</a>, the first attack on the World Trade Center and the embassy bombings in Kenya and Tanzania.</p> <p>The first internet bubble created millionaires and billionaires overnight, while the manufacturing decline that began in the early 1980s continued to hollow out the rust belt.</p> <p>So we rolled into an election at the end of the 1990s that bears a remarkable similarity to this one: a contest between two candidates who thrilled nobody in particular.</p> <p>A wonkish Democrat who wasn\u2019t particularly good at retail politics, seeking a third term after a popular and charismatic president. A simplistic Republican gun-slinger who promised a return to the Reagan era of even greater wealth and military superiority. Reporters (including this one) considered which of the two they would rather share a beer with. Meanwhile younger voters thought both candidates were hopelessly irrelevant to their lives and tiresomely similar in their politics.</p> <p>Of course the political differences between George W Bush and Al Gore were obvious and catastrophically so. As we now know, within a year of taking office, President Bush had decided to invade Iraq \u2013 a decision almost unthinkable for a President Gore. With a Gore White House, the US would have led the world on climate change more than a decade before President Obama struck the Paris agreement.</p> <p>But back in 2000, at another time of relative peace and prosperity, it didn\u2019t seem to matter whether voters cast a few ballots for Ralph Nader or even got confused and chose Pat Buchanan. And so the infinitely wise supreme court decided the course of the planet on the basis of 537 votes in Florida.</p> <p>The Trump-Clinton election isn\u2019t like 2004: a contest about national security, playing out in the bloodbath of the Iraqi civil war, while Osama bin Laden was still at large. It\u2019s nothing like 2008: an election that unfolded as the economy plunged into freefall in the middle of the worst financial crisis since the Wall Street Crash of 1929.</p> <p>It may have some echoes of 2012, when a wealthy businessman who liked the idea of self-deportation went up against a mainstream Democrat on issues of gender equality. But that was a presidential re-election effort, and both the president and the economy were very far from where they are today.</p> <p>Today unemployment stands at 4.9%. That\u2019s lower than it was during George W Bush\u2019s election in 1988, Clinton\u2019s re-election in 1996, and Bush\u2019s re-election in 2004. Four years ago, as Obama ran for the second time, it was 7.8%.</p> <p>The only recent election with a lower rate: Bush v Gore in 2000, when unemployment was 3.9%.</p> <p>Household incomes surged 5.2% last year, the largest gain since records began in 1967. If incomes continue to grow this year, they will have made up all the lost ground since the Great Recession of eight years ago and will be close to the all-time high reached in \u2013 when else? \u2013 1999. Gas prices are lower than they were in the last two elections, and the president\u2019s job approval ratings are above 50%.</p> <p>And while there are still thousands of US troops deployed across the world, not least in Afghanistan, combat deaths are a fraction of what they were in the last three presidential cycles.</p> <p>None of which is to say that this election should remain substance-free. After all, it certainly is not consequence-free. Donald Trump\u2019s election would throw the world\u2019s economy and its security framework into disarray.</p> <p>There are many factors to blame for this Seinfeld election: the capitulation of responsible Republicans to an extremist fringe; the small-bore politics of campaign strategists in a divided nation; and of course the brain of the GOP nominee himself.</p> <p>But you should also blame our stubborn inability to recognize the relative peace and prosperity that exists today. Until we turn the page on our mindset of recession and war, we are condemning ourselves to an election that is entirely Trumped up.</p>",

Therefore, it is important to consider the combined effect of the full package of our policy measures when assessing the impact of our monetary policy action on banks. </p> <p>Low rates put pressure on banks\u2019 profitability, particularly on banks which are very reliant on net interest income. Analysts forecast that negative interest rates will significantly reduce banks\u2019 profitability over the next five years, with the return on equity in some cases falling from 6.5% to 2%. </p> <p>Obviously, our monetary policy package consists of other measures as well and ECB staff estimates show that the <strong>overall</strong> impact on bank profitability of recent monetary policy actions is net positive, compared with a scenario with no monetary policy action<sup>[<a href=\"https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/key/date/2016/html/sp161003.en.html#footnote.2\">2</a>]</sup>. But we cannot ignore such analyses. And yet, one also has to ask if a bank that cannot weather headwinds over a few years still has a sufficiently robust business model to stay in the market.</p> </blockquote> <p>Mersh added:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Interest rates have to stay low until the economic recovery in the euro area has gained sufficient momentum to lift the inflation rate to a level in line with our definition of price stability. This is, however, taking longer than we had hoped, mainly because the necessary political changes to make economies more competitive and flexible are lagging behind. The sooner these reforms are implemented, the stronger and more sustainable the recovery will be. </p> <p>Although the notion of a \u201czero lower bound\u201d no longer stands, there is a limit to how low interest rates can go \u2013 the point at which the costs of lower rates incurred by the banking sector outweigh the benefits. Many consider that we have reached the \u201ceffective lower bound\u201d or that it might be not that far from the current deposit facility rate of -0.4%. </p> <p>This level I would still deem to be \u201cmildly negative\u201d \u2013 but I would shy away from moving into \u201cwildly negative\u201d territory. Cutting interest rates even more would come with increasing risks as reactions to such cuts might not always be linear. </p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-10-03T16:38:32.534Z\">at 5.38pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57f27461e4b0643b5d8439d6\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-03T15:12:36.204Z\">4.12pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The continuing fall in the pound is not necessarily a major reason for concern, according to Jonathan Loynes at Capital Economics:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>While the latest dip in sterling has partly reflected concerns over the prospect of a \u201chard Brexit\u201d, the currency\u2019s depreciation should continue to cushion the economic impact of the vote to leave the EU.</p> <p>Sterling\u2019s latest drop appears to have been at least partly prompted by speculation that the UK government is willing to accept a hard form of Brexit, in which the country would forego full access to the EU single market, in order to secure full control over its borders. Along with confirmation that the Government will trigger Article 50 by next March, this may have increased concerns over the ultimate economic impact of the vote to leave the EU.</p> <p>But there are a number of reasons not to be concerned about the currency\u2019s depreciation. For a start, it is far from clear that further indications of a move towards a hard Brexit should necessarily be strongly negative for the economy or the pound. They may, after all, reflect increased confidence that the UK can negotiate favourable trading arrangements with the EU without the conditions that a \u201csoft Brexit\u201d might imply.</p> <p>Second, the key driver of sterling\u2019s depreciation (against the US dollar at least) has continued to be relative changes in expectations for UK and US interest rates. As such, there are few signs of a general \u201cBrexit premium\u201d being attached to the currency which might prompt a more disorderly depreciation.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>And finally, regardless of its causes, the drop in sterling has already had a substantial effect in cushioning the economic impact of the Brexit vote. Monday\u2019s Markit/CIPS manufacturing PMI survey revealed a further rise in the export orders sub-index to a level consistent with a rapid acceleration in the growth of actual exports in the coming months.</p> <p>Admittedly, the economy may currently be in a \u201csweet spot\u201d in which the beneficial effects of the pound\u2019s drop have been felt before the adverse effects on real incomes of the consequent rise in inflation. But provided that the pound\u2019s fall remains relatively orderly \u2013 our forecast is that it will fall from around $1.28 now to $1.20 next year \u2013 we expect the inflationary effects to be fairly limited and short-lived, allowing the policymakers to continue to support growth.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57f266bde4b0ff53b531bbb3\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/helenasmith\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-03T14:40:16.310Z\">3.40pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Greek pensioner protests overshadow budget unveiling</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Back to Greece where pictures of police firing tear gas at pensioners peacefully demonstrating against further cuts has caused deep embarrassment to the government \u2013 just as it tables next year\u2019s budget in parliament. Helena Smith reports from Athens </p> <blockquote> <p>The sight of protesting pensioners having pepper spray fired at them by police overzealously protecting the road on which his office stands, could not have come on a worse day for prime minister Alexis Tsipras. The leader, like all leftists in the ruling Syriza party, is painfully aware that it is pensioners who to date have paid the heaviest price for the austerity meted out in return for bailout funds. As I was told by many attending today\u2019s (otherwise low-key) rally, the latest cut was the twelfth they have been forced to endure since the beginning of the debt crisis in late 2009. To make matters worse, Tsipras\u2019 poll ratings are fading fast. In the most scathing survey to be published since he first assumed power in January 2015 \u2013 and in the newspaper of Avgi, the mouthpiece of his ruling Syriza party no less - the leader was found by the Public Issue polling company to be trailing Kyriakos Mitsotakis, chief of main opposition New Democracy, by 19 points in terms of suitability in the role of prime minister (42 percent against 23 percent). A whopping 36 percent of Greeks said they would prefer to see New Democracy in power compared to 14 percent for Syriza and its junior right wing partner, Anel. </p> <p>Which explains why Tsipras, who was otherwise focusing on what he hoped would be an optimistic draft budget forecasting growth and debt decline, personally called the pubic order minister in fury that the tear gas was used at all. In an unprecedented statement the ministry announced: \u201cAfter today\u2019s incident the order was given to forbid any use of tear gas at demonstrations of workers and pensioners.\u201d </p> <p>That notwithstanding, the episode duly eclipsed any talk of the draft budget - which foresees growth of 2.7 per cent n 2017, debt dropping from 180 to 174.8 per cent of GDP and unemployment falling from 23 to 22.4 percent next year \u2013 being tabled and debated in parliament. Greek media have not been slow to pick up on the fact that it also projects an extra \u20ac1.8bn worth of revenues in taxes \u2013 prompting many to say that yet more punitive belt-tightening measures are on the way. </p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fad7952f9f110336c6737afe6ab1ad11cbd6f9b7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fad7952f9f110336c6737afe6ab1ad11cbd6f9b7/0_0_4826_3205/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Protestors clash with police in Athens\" width=\"1000\" height=\"664\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Protestors clash with police in Athens</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: ZUMA W/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57f269d8e4b0328d7eb88c9b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-03T14:25:39.387Z\">3.25pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Royal Bank of Scotland will pay Connecticut $120m to resolve a mortgage bond probe, </strong>according to Reuters.</p> <p>Meanwhile, as investors await news about whether the $14bn fine on Deutsche Bank demanded by the US Department of Justice will be reduced, the bank\u2019s US shares have now dropped by around 2.5%.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57f2682ce4b0ff53b531bbbc\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-03T14:17:42.344Z\">3.17pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The ISM report could also signal a reasonable non-farm payrolls number on Friday, says James Knightley at ING Bank:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Looking to Friday\u2019s payrolls figure, the ISM employment component has offered encouragement to us regarding our above consensus 210,000 prediction for job creation.

With populism gaining traction in many countries, the risk of political shocks adversely affecting the outlook for private investment has increased. At the same time, the capacity of central banks to engender stronger growth appears to be diminishing...</p> <p>With eurozone growth looking likely to have peaked in early 2016 and no significant changes to Fitch\u2019s UK and Japanese growth forecasts - despite significant monetary policy moves - the outlook for the advanced countries is best described as a low-growth, muddle-through path. Advanced country growth over 2016 to 2018 will be hardly any better than the lacklustre 1.5% annual average growth rate seen over 2011 to 2015. Moreover, downside risks to advanced country growth have increased.</p> <p>\u201cThe rise in populism seen in many advanced countries could be a precursor to increased trade-protectionism and growing fragmentary tensions in the eurozone, both of which would increase uncertainty and damage prospects for private sector investment,\u201d added [Fitch chief economist Brian] Coulton.</p> </blockquote> <p>On the US in particular it says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Fitch has revised down its forecast for US growth in 2016 to 1.4% in today\u2019s Global Economic Outlook from 1.8% in the July [report].</p> <p>\u201cThis year is likely to see the lowest annual growth rate for US GDP since 2009 as oil sector adjustments, weak external demand and the earlier appreciation of the dollar take their toll on industrial demand,\u201d said [Coulton].</p> </blockquote> <p>Fitch also believes central banks may be running out of ammunition:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Meanwhile, the capacity of central banks to counter adverse growth shocks may be falling. The implications of low and negative interest rates for bank profitability, the increasing complexity of central bank easing announcements, reductions in interest income for savers and market distortions are complicating the transmission of unconventional monetary easing to the economy. Furthermore, the historically unprecedented nature of negative nominal interest rates may be limiting the benefits of central bank easing announcements on inflation expectations.</p> <p>Rising political pressures and concerns about the effectiveness of monetary easing have contributed to growing support among policy makers for fiscal stimulus as a means of restoring growth. A wider shift to fiscal easing is increasingly apparent in the numbers and while its effectiveness may be hindered in some countries by high and rising public debt levels, a co-ordinated fiscal reflation is likely to have growth benefits, at least in the short term.</p> <p> The Fed is likely to be the only major central bank tightening monetary policy in the near term as it lays the groundwork for a December rate rise. With unit labour costs and core inflation measures suggesting underlying inflation close to the Fed\u2019s target and the labour market holding up, the conditions look to be in place for a continuation of gradual normalisation in the Federal Funds Rate. The ECB is expected to extend its quantitative easing programme beyond its current scheduled end-date of March 2017, and will likely need to adjust the limits on bond purchases. The new monetary policy approach adopted by the Bank of Japan (BOJ) opens the door for further cuts in the policy rate, taking it deeper into negative territory. This will allow the BOJ to steepen the yield curve while it varies its asset purchases to hold 10-year JGB yields flat at around 0%. We now forecast the BOJ policy rate will fall to -0.5% by end-2017. </p> <p>In the UK, the Bank of England\u2019s (BoE) aggressive easing package in early August has had a positive impact on sentiment. With recent UK data slightly better than expected, the BoE is unlikely to follow through on forward guidance to cut rates again before year-end.</p> </blockquote> <p>In emerging markets, Fitch sees signs of improvement:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Most importantly, China\u2019s efforts to stabilise growth in the face of a sharp slowdown in exports and private-sector investment look to have gained traction. Russia\u2019s economy looks to be stabilising after massive import compression, real wage adjustment and fiscal tightening saw domestic demand plummet in 2015. In Brazil, the impeachment of President Rousseff and installation of a new leadership team have renewed focus on fiscal reforms, which should support confidence and help the economy stabilise by year-end. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57f23db1e4b05962fdf4a67d\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-03T11:39:15.161Z\">12.39pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Summary: Factories fly, but pound slides</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Time for a catch-up, as City traders scoff down a quick sandwich before facing another volley of economic data from across the Atlantic.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/oct/03/pound-falls-hard-brexit-deutsche-bank-manufacturing-data-business-live?page=with:block-57f21706e4b0ab00630875ae#block-57f21706e4b0ab00630875ae\">Activity in Britain\u2019s factory sector has grown at its fastest pace since June 2014, bolstering hopes that the EU referendum won\u2019t trigger a recession</a>.</strong></p> <p>Exports, new orders and staffing levels all increased in September, as the weak pound helps firms sell overseas.</p> <p>Economists broadly agree that UK manufacturing appears to be in decent health right now, and helped the economy grow in the last quarter.</p> <p>Capital Economics, for example, say:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The Markit/CIPS manufacturing PMI for September showed that both the domestic and export-facing parts of the manufacturing sector are weathering the Brexit vote well.

  "<p>At the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/picture/2016/jul/08/eyewitness-pamplona-spain\">Pamplona bull run</a>, once they unsnick the latch on the corral, no matter how smartly dressed you are, or how athletic, you are always going to look like a frightened person running away from bulls.</p> <p>So it is in Pamplona, so it was in Madrid on Saturday for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/01/pedro-sanchez-resigns-as-leader-of-spains-socialist-party\">deposed socialist leader Pedro S\u00e1nchez</a>. He picked his moment carefully to take on the raging bulls of his party oligarchy. But they still managed to trample him, and mercilessly.</p> <p>S\u00e1nchez\u2019s mistake was to challenge the tradition of \u201cturnism\u201d \u2013 whereby the socialists and conservatives simply alternate in power, enriching their friends while 20% of Spaniards lack jobs.</p> <p>After two indecisive elections, S\u00e1nchez continued to block a rightwing government and to hold out the possibility of the socialist PSOE governing, with the support of the radical left party Podemos. For this, he was summarily ejected in a chaotic coup led by the party\u2019s powerful regional government bosses.</p> <p>S\u00e1nchez\u2019s fate is one more signal of the crisis facing European social democracy. It was shaped for three decades around the certainties of neoliberalism. Now the free-market model has failed, social democracy seems stripped of the intellectual resource to renew itself.</p> <p>And that, in turn, is the product of a deeper incoherence. Parliamentary socialism was born across Europe in the 1890s from multiple sources \u2013 moderate Marxism, trade unions, co-ops, splits from liberalism.</p> <p>In 1945, social democracy had to be reinvented across continental Europe, this time as both an overt and covert bulwark against Soviet influence. And, in the 1970s, as the remaining dictatorships collapsed in Spain, Portugal and Greece, there was once again a moment of reinvention.</p> <p>Throughout the century, it is remarkable how little emerged by way of a cross-border intellectual culture of the centre-left. If you wanted to choose a globally influential thinker for the centre-left after the second world war, you would have to go for the Hungarian-American historian <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Polanyi\">Karl Polanyi</a>. Polanyi argued that capitalism consists of a \u201cdouble movement\u201d \u2013 the push for free markets and the pushback against them, to regulate them in the interests of society.</p> <p>The beauty of Polanyi\u2019s big idea was that it allowed the centre-left in the 1980s to find a justification for its work that could survive the demise of the working class. Instead of \u201cprotecting the working class\u201d, the aim of social democracy became understood as \u201cregulating capitalism for its own good\u201d.</p> <p>The root cause of all social democracy\u2019s problems since 2008 is that it is no longer clear how this can be done. There was a rightwing version of neoliberalism, red in tooth and claw; and a progressive version \u2013 with its financial inclusion agenda, gay marriage, and meritocratic ethos in education, healthcare and social policy.</p> <p>But the central tenets of the economic system were set in stone in the Lisbon treaty, mandating austerity and forbidding the protection of key industries against the global market.</p> <p>Now the economic mainsprings of neoliberalism are broken, social democracy\u2019s task is to speed the invention of something else. But as Pedro S\u00e1nchez\u2019s fate suggests, it is ill-equipped for doing that. Most socialist elites and bureaucracies in Europe \u2013 including Britain, as the backlash against Jeremy Corbyn shows \u2013 are attuned to running a capitalism that does not work, and seem incapable of imagining any other future.</p> <p>The radical left \u2013 in the form of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/podemos\">Podemos in Spain</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/syriza\">Syriza in Greece</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/bernie-sanders\">Bernie Sanders in the US</a> and Corbyn in Britain \u2013 stands foursquare for the replacement of neoliberalism. But with what?</p> <p>At its best, the new left radicalism is municipal, inclusive, audaciously anti-racist and promotes horizontal democracy. At its worst, it becomes an expression of revolt only; a list of demands; a celebration of resistance techniques; a rehearsal of leftwing tropes from yesteryear. In the one country where the radical left took power, Greece, it was forced into submission by north European social democrats.</p> <p>But now there is a series of alarm calls. The near victory of the far right in the Austrian presidential election in May prompted an inner-party coup, putting left-leaning centrist Christian Kern into the chancellorship.</p> <p>Kern, though a lifelong technocrat, is surrounded by thinkers from the left. <a href=\"https://www.socialeurope.eu/2016/09/europe-must-become-fair-again/\">Last month, he issued an open call</a> for Europe to break with austerity, to double its proposed fiscal stimulus and \u2013 in a thinly veiled attack on Angela Merkel \u2013 to stop gaming the crisis for national advantage.</p> <p>French socialism, meanwhile, is staring at moral collapse. It is impossible for any of its candidates in next year\u2019s election to beat the far-right Marine Le Pen, and its supporters go into that crunch battle knowing they will have to vote for a conservative to stop her. And in Italy, premier <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/06/matteo-renzi-italy-referendum-banks-brexit\">Matteo Renzi has staked the centre-left\u2019s future on a constitutional referendum</a> he looks likely to lose.</p> <p>All this explains why Corbyn\u2019s victory has raised an alarm flag inside European social democracy. It shows you can move a traditional socialist party to the left. The defeat of S\u00e1nchez, exactly one week later, is meant to show that you cannot.</p> <p>The Spanish socialist elite is reconciled now to four years of conservative government as the price for keeping the new, vibrant and radical left away from power. But Spain is about to teach the whole of Europe\u2019s centre-left a lesson: if you cling to neoliberalism, you die. If Podemos, the radical left party, can open itself up to those among the socialists disgusted at S\u00e1nchez\u2019s overthrow, the path is open for its emergence as a Syriza-style hegemonic left party.</p> <p>The question, then, is the one posed by Austrian chancellor Christian Kern. Is Europe\u2019s social democracy going to impose austerity for ever or, even if only for the selfish purposes of survival, actually begin to fight it?</p>",

The prosecutors began an investigation the same year into whether the governor\u2019s campaign coordinated with conservative groups on advertising during the recall without reporting the groups\u2019 contributions.</p> <p>Those groups challenged the investigation and in 2015 it was halted by conservative-leaning justices who control the Wisconsin supreme court, who ruled that the groups and the campaign coordinated on ads that did not expressly call for a candidate\u2019s election or defeat. The state court said such coordination amounted to free speech and was not subject to disclosure requirements.</p> <p>The controversy attracted renewed attention recently when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2016/sep/14/john-doe-files-scott-walker-corporate-cash-american-politics\">the Guardian</a> reported that a leading manufacturer of lead that was once used in paint was among a host of corporate leaders who donated to Wisconsin Club for Growth, a conservative group that helped Walker and Republican legislators fight the recall challenges.</p> <p>Wisconsin Club for Growth received $750,000 in 2011 and 2012 from Harold Simmons, the billionaire owner of NL Industries.

  "<p>Azerbaijan\u2019s oil riches have turned its capital, Baku, into a gaudy showcase city. Three skyscrapers shaped like flames dominate the skyline, lighting up with flickering Azerbaijani flags at night. The waterfront promenade on the Caspian Sea offers a \u201cmini Venice\u201d complete with canals and ersatz gondolas. Ultra-luxury malls feature boutiques including Valentino, Givenchy and Alexander McQueen.</p> <p>But as global oil prices have dropped, Baku\u2019s facade has started to crumble. Showy parks are being left untended and the floodlights illuminating Baku\u2019s historic centre are noticeably dimmed. A striking number of ambitious construction projects lie dormant, half-finished. </p> <p>Farid Guliyev, a political analyst sitting in Baku\u2019s first Starbucks, says: \u201cWalk around the city.

Election officials announced that turnout had been 70%, and an overwhelming majority approved extending the presidential term limit from five to seven years and making it easier for the state to seize private property.</p> <p>The plebiscite is the latest in a series of aggressive political responses to the economic crisis that threatens to undermine a government which has long staked its authority on being able to provide material benefits, if not civil rights, to its population.</p> <p>Before the vote the government stepped up its harassment of independent journalists and dissidents to the point that Azerbaijan\u2019s civil society was described as \u201cparalysed\u201d and facing \u201cthe worst situation\u201d since the country\u2019s independence in 1991, the UN human rights rapporteur <a href=\"http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=20554\">Michel Forst said during a recent visit</a>. </p> <p>Reports of increasing repression are not surprising in Azerbaijan, long one of the former Soviet Union\u2019s most authoritarian states.

Now, I see there\u2019s no point in punishing me, they don\u2019t want to arrest a high-profile man and have additional troubles. It\u2019s changing.\u201d <br></p> <p>But Goyushov and others agree that the political changes feel cosmetic, merely a tactical shift aimed at securing concessions from the west. </p> <p>They say that whatever political retreat the Azerbaijani state has made is the result of the economic crisis. For the last 15 years, soaring oil prices and substantial Caspian Sea<strong> </strong>deposits had bankrolled a massive government spending spree, a windfall that helped Azerbaijan pull itself out of the catastrophe it suffered in the 1990s after the fall of the Soviet Union. </p> <p>The government thoroughly rearmed the military, held high-profile international events such as the Eurovision song contest and the first European Games, and invested in architectural prestige projects, <a href=\"http://www.rferl.org/a/azerbaijan-baku-heydar-aliyev-center-fire/24651102.html\">such as the $250m Zaha Hadid</a> building in the shape of the signature of the former president, Aliyev\u2019s father. </p> <p>But the recent oil price collapse has inflicted serious damage. Over the last year and a half the currency, the manat, has lost half its value. Baku is reportedly <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-01-28/imf-starts-talks-with-azerbaijan-on-possible-financial-aid\">angling for loans and bailouts from the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund</a>. <br></p> <p>According to Khadija Ismayilova, an investigative reporter and the best-known of the political prisoners released this spring, the Azerbaijani government \u201cneeds money \u2026 and western institutions that can give it will probably do it conditionally\u201d \u2013 by demanding transparency and the rights of private groups to monitor them. </p> <p>\u201cThis is why the government is now trying to give more space to NGOs, but it\u2019s all an imitation. They release people but they don\u2019t let the NGOs operate,\u201d she said. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1008d5c70890e7207a37239d67d3556d18c3ac9e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1008d5c70890e7207a37239d67d3556d18c3ac9e/0_196_3400_2040/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Khadija Ismayilova, who was released on probation in May.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Khadija Ismayilova, who was released on probation in May.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pacific Press v/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Ismayilova, who had produced explosive investigative reports exposing high-level corruption in the Azerbaijani government, <a href=\"https://freedomhouse.org/article/azerbaijan-quash-conviction-journalist-khadija-ismayilova\">was arrested in 2014 on charges of \u201cinciting suicide\u201d</a>, embezzlement, tax evasion, and other charges widely seen as political.

The mathematics professor, a member of the Talysh minority (a Persian-speaking group that lives along Azerbaijan\u2019s border with Iran), is an advocate for Talysh rights and the editor of a Talysh-language newspaper.

Western policymakers have long seen Azerbaijan primarily in geopolitical terms, as a pro-western outpost wedged between Russia and Iran, and providing oil and natural gas. \u201cIn the short term, it\u2019s not important [to the west] that Azerbaijan be democratic,\u201d Goyushev says. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/31/freed-journalist-khadija-ismayilova-azerbaijan-interview\">Freed journalist Khadija Ismayilova: 'They didn't succeed in silencing me'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Now, Baku seems to be trying to push the limits of what it can get away with, and the pendulum may be swinging the other way.

  "<p>When the justices of the US supreme court take their seats on Tuesday morning for the first set of oral arguments of their 2016-2017 session, many court-watchers will have their eyes more on the makeup of the court than the cases themselves. Since Justice Antonin Scalia\u2019s death in February, the nine-seat court has had only eight members, while Senate Republicans have refused to consider Barack Obama\u2019s pick, Judge Merrick Garland.</p> <p>Having only eight members of the court means that, theoretically, any and every case could result in a tie between the court\u2019s four remaining conservative members and the liberals, even in those cases expected to resolve disparities in lower courts\u2019 rulings. </p> <p>Renee Cramer, a professor of law, politics and society at Drake University, cautioned that the effects of the eight-member court on the law \u2013 at least at the beginning of this term \u2013 are likely to be minimal. \u201cThe political implications are probably greater than the judicial implications,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cThe four-four split wasn\u2019t changing decisions incredibly\u201d in the wake of Scalia\u2019s death, she explained. \u201cBut it was maybe changing the way that those decisions were communicated.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2016/jun/24/us-supreme-court-split-decision-barack-obama-immigration\">Split happens: deadlocks rarely occur in the supreme court.

During the penalty phase of his trial, Buck\u2019s defense attorney \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.dallasnews.com/news/crime/2016/08/13/texas-lawyer-never-won-capital-murder-case-calls-quits-defending-worst-clients\">called</a> one of the worst defense lawyers in capital cases in the country \u2013 brought to the stand an expert witness intended to demonstrate to the jury that Buck was not a continuing threat to the community, a key standard for imposing the death penalty. Instead, the defense introduced the testimony of Dr Walter Quijano, who wrote that, statistically speaking, Buck was more likely to commit crimes in the future because he is black. </p> <p>He was sentenced to death, and appealed on the grounds that his counsel had been ineffective, though not because his lawyer introduced Quijano\u2019s testimony.</p> <p>The state of Texas later admitted before the supreme court that Quijano\u2019s testimony was prejudicial. But the state objected to the challenge of Buck\u2019s death sentence because his own lawyer introduced the evidence, and because prosecutors do not believe that the circumstances of Buck\u2019s sentencing rise to the level of extraordinary circumstances.</p> <p>The court may decide the case on either question.</p> <h2>Pe\u00f1a-Rodriguez v Colorado</h2> <p>Miguel Angel Pe\u00f1a-Rodriguez was convicted on three misdemeanor counts of sexually harassing two teenage girls. But after the trial ended, it emerged that one of the jurors \u2013 a former police officer \u2013 had made several racist comments about Mexicans during deliberations. Among other things, he told his fellow jurors that Mexican men were more inclined to commit sexual offenses against women than white Americans.</p> <p>Pe\u00f1a-Rodriguez challenged his conviction, arguing that he has a right to an impartial jury under the sixth amendment. But he\u2019s been stymied by laws that prohibit jurors from talking about what happens during deliberations. </p> <p>The court is expected to hear arguments on 11 October that Pe\u00f1a-Rodriguez\u2019s right to a jury free of racial prejudice ought to trump laws that prohibit jurors from testifying about their own lack of impartiality.</p> <h2>Manuel v City of Joliet</h2> <p>Elijah Manuel attempted to sue the city of Joliet, Illinois, in federal court after he was arrested for possession of ecstasy based on evidence falsified by the police and was held for nearly two months. He claimed the city had violated his constitutional right against illegal search and seizure under the fourth amendment.</p> <p>The federal judge who heard his case dismissed it: in the federal courts in the district that covers the state of Illinois, lawsuits against the authorities for false arrest or false imprisonment have to be heard in state courts, where plaintiffs have more difficulty winning. (In most other federal districts, these suits can be heard in federal court first.)</p> <p>Manuel appealed, and the appeals court judges ruled again that he should have filed in state court and added that he should have filed within two years of his arrest, instead of within two years of his release \u2013 a standard which would make it even more difficult to sue.</p> <p>If the supreme court sides with Manuel, it would become easier for everyone in Illinois \u2013 including in the city of Chicago, which faces a variety of allegations of police misconduct \u2013 to sue for relief in federal court.</p> <h2>Samsung v Apple</h2> <p>In what may be the final chapter of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/aug/28/apple-samsung-patent-infringement-payout\">expensive</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/mar/31/apple-sues-samsung-for-2bn\">long-running</a> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/aug/06/apple-samsung-drop-patent-lawsuits-outside-usa\">international</a> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/aug/22/apple-samsung-patent-dispute\">patent war</a> between the two smartphone behemoths, Samsung is asking the supreme court to decide the appropriate amount of damages for an alleged violation of Apple\u2019s design patents.

In the penalty phase, based on an 1886 law, Apple was awarded $1.2bn \u2013 the entirety of Samsung\u2019s profits on the allegedly infringing phones \u2013 though the award was reduced to $584m on appeal.<br></p> <p>Samsung argues the majority of a smartphone\u2019s value is in its utility, not in its design (in this case, its bevelled corners and black back side), and thus awarding all its profits on the sales of the phones to Apple based on a design infringement on only three components is a misreading of the law. The court is being asked to decided whether the violation of a design patent on a complex product should trigger an award for the entire value of the product.</p> <h2>Bank of America v City of Miami and Wells Fargo v City of Miami</h2> <p>The city of Miami attempted to sue Bank of America, Wells Fargo and Citigroup (which did not pursue the supreme court appeal) for violations of the Fair Housing Act. </p> <p>The city claims the lenders drove a wave of foreclosures that cost the city, by engaging in predatory lending to minority borrowers and offering worse refinancing rates to minorities. </p> <p>The banks successfully argued in federal district trial court that the city could not sue because it was not immediately harmed by the banks\u2019 actions, but the city won on appeal. The supreme court will hear arguments on 8 November (Election Day) to decide whether a city can serve as a valid plaintiff in a discriminatory lending case. </p> <h2>Lynch v Morales-Santana</h2> <p>On 9 November \u2013 immediately after the presidential election \u2013 the court will hear arguments about whether the laws that govern citizenship discriminate based on the gender of the parent.</p> <p>At issue is the citizenship of Luis Morales-Santana, who was born in the Dominican Republic to a father born in the US and a mother who was a non-US citizen. Under the laws at the time of his birth (prior to 1986), children born to unmarried parents outside the US would get citizenship if their mothers had lived in the US for a year. But they would not get citizenship via fathers born in the US unless the father had lived there for 10years, including and five years after the age of 14. (After 1986, the standard became five years for fathers, two after the age of 14.) Morales-Santana\u2019s father was 20 days shy of the limit when he moved to the Dominican Republica, and the government is attempting to deport Morales-Santana.</p> <p>The court has been asked to decide whether the citizenship laws are a violation of the fifth amendment\u2019s equal protection clauses because they differ based on gender. It\u2019s also being asked to decide whether the appeals court had the right to grant Morales-Santana citizenship at all. </p>",

  "<p>On the day I finished reading this book, two newspaper articles caught my attention. A former head of the armed forces warned that the UK could not withstand a Russian attack; on the US presidential campaign trail, more evidence emerged of Vladimir Putin\u2019s support for Donald Trump.</p> <p>Of the many accounts written about the Russian president, Mikhail Zygar\u2019s insider\u2019s guide to his court is one of the most compelling. Zygar, a prominent journalist, has clearly earned the confidence of many. He tiptoes carefully; a number of journalists and their sources who have tried to disclose details of the cash that Putin and his henchmen have squirrelled away have ended up dead or in jail.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/28/where-was-vladimir-putin-when-jeremy-corbyn-needed-him\">Where was Putin when Corbyn needed him? | Stewart Lee</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The book charts not just the machinations of the various players \u2013 indeed some of the detail may be perplexing to non-Kremlinologists. It also acutely traces the evolution of Putin\u2019s mind. The former KGB operative in East Germany did, even as he clamped down on the domestic media, initially try to woo the west. After Iraq and particularly the colour revolutions in Georgia and Ukraine, Putin felt betrayed.</p> <p>The \u201cfat decade\u201d, as the 2000s were known, was the period when Russians (or at least some of them) maxed out on conspicuous consumption. \u201cRussia was clumsily learning how to be a rich country,\u201d the author writes. It was not just the oligarchs; the civil service quadrupled in number, a ready cash cow. \u201cThere was scarcely any politics, no public life, just solid hedonism.\u201d The most common form of bribery was a family holiday abroad, worth a few thousand, in return for rubber-stamping a contract worth millions. The state officials grew wiser and developed a taste for proper luxury. \u201cWhy take hand-outs from billionaires if you can become a billionaire yourself?\u201d That is when the power nexus shifted. What mattered was access to the top, and increasingly that meant one man only.</p> <p>In foreign policy, Putin took a binary approach to friend and foe. George W Bush (at first) was the tough guy who knew how to buy elections; Gerhard Schr\u00f6der was the dependable friend who sought \u2013 and received \u2013 a big job in Russian business. The favourite, naturally, was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/silvio-berlusconi\" title=\"\">Silvio Berlusconi</a>. The two families were extremely close. \u201cPutin found it so much easier to deal with European cynics,\u201d Zygar notes.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Putin never let Medvedev forget his betrayal. When he sought re-election, Putin sent out the order to destroy him</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>As for the present pack, he loathes <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/barackobama\" title=\"\">Barack Obama</a> (and the feeling is mutual); he sees <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/angela-merkel\" title=\"\">Angela Merkel</a> as the ringleader for a tougher European response to Russia. Hence the constant support Russia gives to Trump and France\u2019s far-right <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/marine-le-pen\" title=\"\">Marine Le Pen</a>, and the delight registered over <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum\" title=\"\">Brexit</a>. Russia will use every possible means to shake the status quo and undermine Europe. One of the many amusing anecdotes was how Putin would bring his huge black Labrador to meetings with Merkel; she is frightened stiff of dogs.</p> <p>Few of the cardinals around the president emerge with credit. The most pitiable role is ascribed to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/dmitry-medvedev\" title=\"\">Dmitry Medvedev</a>, the man on whom the west briefly pinned some hopes. Plucked from nowhere by Putin (just as Putin was by Boris Yeltsin), his job was to keep the presidential seat warm. Putin needed to step down after two terms, but assumed that as prime minister he&#xa0;would continue to run the show.</p> <p>For a year or two his protege struck out; he not only brought in his own people, he tried (a little) to introduce some constitutional order into the criminal state and he sought a rapprochement of sorts with the west. Obama\u2019s team privately mocked Medvedev and his obsession with western gadgets. They and the Europeans were pleasantly surprised when the Russians did not object to the bombing of Libya. Putin, however, was furious and would never let Medvedev forget his betrayal. When the president briefly contemplated running for re-election, Putin sent out the order to destroy him. Parliament, security services, media and the business community did the rest.</p> <p>By 2012, firmly ensconced in his third term as president, Putin controlled everything and everyone. Within a couple of years of his new tenure, he had seen off the liberal protest movement, annexed Crimea and occupied eastern Ukraine. He had won back some global authority with his clever scheming in Syria.</p> <p>Such was the power he wielded that during his strange (and still unexplained) two long absences from the Kremlin, nobody knew what to do. Western sanctions hit his circle hard, but nobody dared argue with him, \u201cbecause they knew that he was the source and guarantor of their wealth. Putin\u2019s good favour was what gave them legitimacy\u201d. He had by this point become obsessed with victimhood \u2013 Russia\u2019s diplomatic and spiritual comfort blanket.</p> <p>Yet, while emphasising the court\u2019s dependency on Putin, Zygar\u2019s conclusion is more nuanced. Putin became what he is because those around him saw it as the simplest path for their own enrichment and job security. \u201cIn trying to divine the intentions of their leader, his associates effectively materialised their own wishes.\u201d In other words, Putin is more of a phenomenon than a leader.</p> <p>The perennial neurosis about slavophilia versus westernism is therefore a false choice. Russia, the author suggests, seeks solace and confidence in definition against others. \u201cEach of us invented our own Putin.

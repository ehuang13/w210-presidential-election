  "<p>All humanoids suffer illness, but very few of us get sick only two months before we\u2019re due to go toe-to-toe with Donald Trump to decide who will become the most powerful person in the world. The news that Hillary Clinton is suffering from pneumonia points up a truth that distinguishes politicians from the rest of us: for them, illness is not a phenomenon that has to be treated only medically, but is also something that must be managed by teams of PR goons working round the clock so that their boss doesn\u2019t seem too feeble to hold the proverbial reins of power.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/12/hillary-pneumonia-more-important-things-donald-trump\">Eight things that are more important than Hillary's pneumonia</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Trump, 70, has already questioned his 68-year-old rival\u2019s physical and mental capabilities to become president. And she has retorted, with perhaps even greater justice, indicting his temperament for the job.</p> <p>Clinton went on the late-night comedy show Jimmy Kimmel Live! in August to rubbish rumours about her health. \u201cBack in October [2015], National Enquirer said I would be dead in six months,\u201d she said. \u201cSo with every breath I take, it feels like a new lease on life.\u201d</p> <p>No wonder, given the wild speculation and huge risks to political capital involved, politicians have gone to incredible lengths to ensure any illnesses they might suffer remain private. Here are some examples.</p> <h2>Ronald Reagan (1911-2004)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4922e28b7533690cbe293d77b08e437c9453a8d2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4922e28b7533690cbe293d77b08e437c9453a8d2/0_205_3071_1843/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ronald Reagan in 1984.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ronald Reagan in 1984.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The two-term American president, who served from 1981 to 1989, was diagnosed with Alzheimer\u2019s in 1994.

In reality, he suffered various problems controlled by doses of steroids and other drugs. Among those problems was Addison\u2019s disease or autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome type 2. During the 1960 presidential campaign, Kennedy\u2019s adversaries claimed that he had the disease, but as the Los Angeles Times reports, a cunningly worded statement issued at the time by his doctors asserted that Kennedy did not have Addison\u2019s disease caused by tuberculosis (which is the cause of the diseases in only 20% of sufferers). As a result of this statement, the matter was dropped. The truth was, though, that JFK did suffer from Addison\u2019s disease, but in his case it was autoimmune in origin. The disease causes the adrenal glands (which produce adrenaline and other hormones) to wither and results in symptoms such as fatigue, dizziness, muscle weakness, weight loss, difficulty standing up, nausea, sweating, and changes in mood and personality. Kennedy collapsed twice, once during a congressional visit to Britain, as a result of Addison\u2019s disease.</p> <p>JFK\u2019s medical records, studied posthumously by navy doctor Lee R Mandel, <a href=\"http://articles.latimes.com/2009/sep/05/science/sci-jfk-addisons5\">revealed that the president was taking</a> 500mg of vitamin C twice daily; 10mg of hydrocortisone daily; 2.5mg of prednisone twice daily; 10mg of methyltestosterone daily (to combat weight loss and gonadal atrophy associated with the steroids he was taking); 25mg of liothyronine (a synthetic thyroid hormone) twice daily; 0.1mg fludrocortisone daily; and diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate, two tablets as needed.</p> <h2>Franklin D Roosevelt (1882-1945)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5c37c4c8a06c708a0ce676c33548abd6fbb34950\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5c37c4c8a06c708a0ce676c33548abd6fbb34950/0_11_594_356/500.jpg\" alt=\"FDR in 1924.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">FDR in 1924.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PhotoQuest/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In 1921, at the age of 38, Roosevelt suffered a severe attack of polio, which resulted in the total paralysis of both legs. The previous year he had run as vice-president on Democratic candidate James M Cox\u2019s ticket. His illness seemed to threaten his future political career, but it did not. In 1928, he was elected governor of New York and in 1932 defeated Herbert Hoover to become president, in which office he served until his death in 1945 \u2013 becoming thereby the last president to serve more than two four-year terms in office. In 1944, hospital tests revealed that the president, a lifelong chain smoker, had high blood pressure, atherosclerosis, coronary heart disease causing angina pectoris and congestive heart failure, but his declining health was hidden from the public. During the 1944 election campaign, his personal physician, Admiral Ross McIntire, told reporters what he must have known to be untrue, namely: \u201cThe president\u2019s health is perfectly OK. There are absolutely no organic difficulties at all.\u201d There are even claims that he used the office of censorship to quash reports of his declining health before the election, which he won \u2013 only to die the following year, shortly after experiencing a massive cerebral haemorrhage.</p> <h2>Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand (1916-1996)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"80f8ac68e97c50b0dede6151542e6b4cf19317f9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/80f8ac68e97c50b0dede6151542e6b4cf19317f9/0_167_2878_1726/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mitterrandin 1992.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mitterrandin 1992.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Franck Perry/AFP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The French president died of prostate cancer in 1996, a year after the end of his two-term, 1981-95 presidency. During those long years in the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace, he and his doctors concealed his condition from the French public. David Owen, in his book <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/in-sickness-and-in-power.html\">In Sickness and in Power: Illness in Heads of Government During the Last 100 Years</a>, reveals the lengths they went to to conceal his condition.</p> <p>When Mitterrand <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/features/3636287/David-Owen-Tony-Blair-and-John-F-Kennedy-may-have-been-power-crazy.html\">had to be given regular intravenous oestrogen hormone therapy</a>, the president\u2019s personal physician \u201chung the intravenous drip on a picture hook or a coat hanger so as not to have to hammer a nail into the wall of an embassy or another government\u2019s guest house\u201d.</p> <p>Shortly before his death, Mitterrand <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2005/jul/15/1\">had an intimate farewell supper with friends</a>. Each diner was presented with a sizzling roasted ortolan, a sparrow-like bird the size of a lemon. He and his guests placed napkins over their heads. Then each bent over their dish, inhaled its delicate vapours, took the bird by its beak and sucked out the innards, including bones, through its rectum. In part because hunting the songbird was illegal in France, this supper \u2013 just like Mitterrand\u2019s cancer \u2013 remained a secret until after his death.</p> <h2>Harold Wilson (1916-1995)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e6f2f15b9ce17cb037fdd837e5eaecd8aa60a7ad\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e6f2f15b9ce17cb037fdd837e5eaecd8aa60a7ad/0_1483_6036_3621/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Wilson in 1971.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Wilson in 1971.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Imagno/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>During the British prime minister\u2019s second term of office from 1974-76, he suffered symptoms that were later diagnosed as colon cancer. He may also have suffered from Alzheimer\u2019s while in office (like Reagan). Neurologist Dr Peter Garrard analysed Wilson\u2019s changing speech patterns at the dispatch box, just as he had those of novelist Iris Murdoch, and found evidence that the prime minister might well have been suffering from Alzheimer\u2019s without knowing it. Garrard said: \u201cLanguage is known to be vulnerable to the earliest stages of Alzheimer\u2019s disease, and the findings of the earlier Iris Murdoch project confirmed that linguistic changes can appear even before the symptoms are recognised by either the patient or their closest associates.</p> <p>\u201cIf such changes are apparent during the effortful and relatively controlled process of creative writing, then the cognitive demands of spontaneous speech production make it even more likely for them to be detectable in spoken output.\u201d Garrard argued that such effortful cognitive demands may have prompted Wilson to retire from office.</p> <h2>Winston Churchill (1874-1965)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f0159721107c83180b84721de3425aaa3d92baad\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f0159721107c83180b84721de3425aaa3d92baad/0_257_2723_1633/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Churchill in 1942.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Churchill in 1942.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Popperfoto/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In his 1966 memoir, Churchill\u2019s personal physician Charles Wilson, the first Baron Moran, revealed that \u201cBlack Dog\u201d was the name Churchill gave to \u201cthe prolonged fits of depression from which he suffered\u201d. The claim that Britain\u2019s wartime leader was clinically depressed has ever since remained controversial, though Churchill acknowledged in his book Painting as a Pastime that he was prey to the \u201cworry and mental overstrain [experienced] by persons who, over prolonged periods, have to bear exceptional responsibilities and discharge duties upon a very large scale\u201d. To combat such worry and overstrain, Lord Moran reported, Churchill was prone to take solace in whisky and cigars, especially during the darkest days of the second world war. He suffered a heart attack at the White House in 1941 and contracted pneumonia a few years later.</p> <p>During his second term as prime minister from 1951 to 1955, Churchill was, in the words of his biographer Roy Jenkins, \u201cgloriously unfit for office\u201d. Ageing and increasingly unwell, he often conducted business from his bedside. He had suffered a stroke while on holiday in 1949 and, while in office in 1953, suffered another. Despite being paralysed down one side and doctors fearing he might not survive the weekend, he conducted a cabinet meeting without, it is claimed, anyone noticing his indisposition. News of this stroke was kept from parliament and the public, who were told that he was suffering merely from exhaustion. <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/history/past-prime-ministers/winston-churchill\">He left office in 1955</a>. A year after his retirement, he suffered another stroke.</p> <h2>Tony Blair (1953-) </h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1ddf854b68079a0e8948a5deb57152da8b693979\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1ddf854b68079a0e8948a5deb57152da8b693979/0_265_2048_1229/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Blair in 2004.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Blair in 2004.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Abbas Momani/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In 2004, the then prime minister was rushed to Hammersmith hospital in west London for emergency treatment after he complained of chest pains and an irregular heartbeat. The Guardian reported at the time: \u201cNo 10 immediately played down the incident, but the image of the youthful prime minister struck down by a heart condition sent shockwaves through the government.\u201d He was found to be suffering from supraventricular tachycardia, and the following year was treated for a heart flutter. \u201cIt\u2019s not particularly alarming but it\u2019s something that you should get fixed \u2013 it\u2019s a routine procedure,\u201d he said later. \u201cI\u2019ve had it for the last couple of months and it\u2019s not impeded me doing my work and feeling fine, but it is as well to get it done.\u201d At the time, Blair placed a great deal of emphasis on being fit and healthy. He told interviewers that, at 51, he weighed about 83kg (13st), less than he did a decade before. In part, this was due to his healthy lifestyle \u2013 playing tennis regularly and insisting his aides ensure time for for workouts in his daily diary.</p> <h2>Gordon Brown (1951-)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"eedd775026a0a0849f4dfc11c33a93ba6552eb0f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/eedd775026a0a0849f4dfc11c33a93ba6552eb0f/0_267_3004_1802/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Brown last year.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Brown last year.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Roberto Ricciuti/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In 2009, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2009/sep/27/andrew-marr-gordon-brown-health\">on Andrew Marr\u2019s Sunday morning BBC TV show</a>, prime minister Gordon Brown gave a detailed description of his difficulties with his eyesight. He lost the sight in one eye after a teenage rugby accident and has a retinal detachment in his other eye, leaving him with the \u201csame fear\u201d that he will completely lose his sight. He told Marr: \u201cAlthough I have problems with my eyes and it has been very difficult over the years, I think people understand that you can do a job and you can work hard. And I think it would be a terrible indictment of our political system if you thought that because someone had this medical issue, they couldn\u2019t do the job.

He had started smoking aged nine and continued the habit as an adult, suffering emphysema and heart failure as a result. A year before he succeeded Yuri Andropov, he had been absent for three months because of bronchitis, pleurisy and pneumonia. Despite these seeming disqualifications for office, he still managed to serve \u2013 in name at least \u2013 as the leader of the Soviet Union for 13 months. In reality, from the end of 1984 until his collapse into a coma and death in March 1985, he rarely left Moscow\u2019s heavily guarded Central Clinical hospital, and when he did, he only upset the Soviet people with his cadaverous TV appearances. Chernenko was the third Soviet leader to die during Ronald Reagan\u2019s presidency, aged 73. \u201cHow am I supposed to get anyplace with the Russians if they keep dying on me?\u201d the American reportedly remarked.</p> <h2>Fidel Castro (1926-)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5c8c6588f46ce206e6c3e5085a73605692f0dda2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5c8c6588f46ce206e6c3e5085a73605692f0dda2/0_182_2000_1200/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Castro in 2004.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Castro in 2004.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jose Goiti/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In 2006, the Cuban leader underwent surgery for intestinal bleeding. The then US president, George W Bush, was less than thrilled about the news of Castro\u2019s recovery: \u201cOne day, the good Lord will take Fidel Castro away.\u201d Castro retorted: \u201cNow I understand why I survived Bush\u2019s plans and the plans of other presidents who ordered my assassination: the good Lord protected me.\u201d Instead of being taken down by American hitmen, Castro stood down in 2008, writing: \u201cIt would betray my conscience to take up a responsibility that requires mobility and total devotion, that I am not in a physical condition to offer.\u201d To be fair, he was nearly 90. There has been much speculation since that Fidel suffers from diverticulitis, a digestive disease in which pouches within the large bowel wall become inflamed; Havana has not confirmed this. Quite possibly, Castro worries that Americans are still trying subtle techniques to kill him. In March, following Barack Obama\u2019s Cuban visit, Castro wrote that the US president\u2019s words were so sugary, he feared he was going to have a heart attack.</p> <h2>Theresa May (1956-)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9622e57ef9a1e58b2f040dc696aee56dd5d02ba4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9622e57ef9a1e58b2f040dc696aee56dd5d02ba4/0_71_4096_2458/1000.jpg\" alt=\"May earlier this month.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">May earlier this month.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Will Oliver/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In 2012, the then home secretary went to see her doctor about a heavy cold because she feared that it could develop into bronchitis, as had happened to her husband.

  "<p>On Sunday afternoon, Hillary Clinton\u2019s doctor revealed that she had been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/11/hillary-clinton-leaves-911-ceremony-after-feeling-overheated\">diagnosed with pneumonia</a> two days earlier. The admission came after she was filmed stumbling into her van after leaving a 9/11 memorial ceremony early. Pneumonia is a serious illness, but it can be treated with antibiotics.</p> <p>The incident divided opinion along familiar lines: for the Trumpian right it was confirmation that Hillary is sickly, perhaps far more than she lets on. Some Clinton supporters railed against the press\u2019s obsession with her health, arguing that it feeds conspiracy theories \u2013 and why on earth should it matter?</p> <p>Of course a presidential candidate\u2019s health matters. Both Trump and Clinton can rightly expect scrutiny of their records and fitness for office. But the press also has a duty to place medical problems in perspective.</p> <p>The effects of the illness may last a few more days, or a month. And the coming hours will be utterly dominated by coverage of it. But the next president is going to be elected for at least four years. Hillary Clinton is sick right now, but her opponent has flaws that won\u2019t disappear with a course of pills. Here\u2019s a reminder of some of the factors that should weigh heavier than a bout of pneumonia. </p> <h2>Donald Trump\u2019s attitude to climate change</h2> <p>The Republican candidate has said he would <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/26/donald-trump-environmental-policy-climate-change-keystone-xl\">withdraw</a> from the Paris deal on cutting emissions, and in 2014 referred to the scientific consensus on global warming as \u201c<a href=\"https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/418542137899491328?lang=en\">bullshit</a>\u201d, stating that \u201cour planet is freezing\u201d. The <a href=\"http://www.climatecentral.org/gallery/graphics/the-10-hottest-years-on-record\">10 hottest years on record</a> have all occured since 1998. </p> <h2>Donald Trump\u2019s religious test for migrants</h2> <p>In December 2015, Trump called for \u201ctotal and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States\u201d. Since then his position has shifted somewhat; in June he <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2016-06-25/trump-says-immigration-plan-wouldn-t-feature-mass-deportations\">said</a> \u201cI want people that have bad thoughts out\u201d and his finance chairman <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/07/24/politics/donald-trump-muslim-ban-election-2016/\">explained</a>: \u201cIt is about Muslims from countries that support terrorism.\u201d The RNC chairman, Reince Priebus, has denied that this would amount to a religious test. </p> <h2>Donald Trump\u2019s support of torture</h2> <p>In February, Trump <a href=\"http://www.factcheck.org/2016/07/trump-torture/\">said</a> \u201cTorture works. OK, folks?\u201d and has endorsed waterboarding, which was banned by George W Bush in 2006, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/28/donald-trump-ohio-rally-isis-torture-tpp-rape\">saying</a>: \u201cI like it a lot. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s tough enough.\u201d</p> <h2>Donald Trump\u2019s attitude towards freedom of the press</h2> <p>He argued that libel laws should be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/feb/26/trump-pledges-curb-press-freedom-libel-laws-first-amendment\">expanded</a>, so that \u201cwhen the New York Times or the Washington Post writes a hit piece, we can sue them\u201d.</p> <h2>Donald Trump\u2019s attitude towards women</h2> <p>Trump has <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/book-party/wp/2015/08/05/donald-trump-on-women-sex-marriage-and-feminism/?utm_term=.6feaf23fe1e0\">written</a> that \u201cWomen have one of the great acts of all time. The smart ones act very feminine and needy, but inside they are real killers.\u201d He has criticized female public figures for their appearance and retweeted the question: \u201cIf Hillary Clinton can\u2019t satisfy her husband what makes her think she can satisfy America?\u201d before deleting it. He also <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQfJpTUYr2Q\">stated</a> that \u201cthere has to be some form of punishment\u201d for women who have abortions (he subsequently <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2016-03-30/trump-says-abortion-ban-should-carry-punishment-for-women\">released a statement</a> that, where abortion was illegal, doctors, not women, should bear criminal responsibility). </p> <h2>The prospect of Donald Trump as commander in chief</h2> <p>Retired General John Allen has <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2016/07/john-allen-donald-trump-226479\">warned of</a> a \u201ccivil military crisis where the military could be ordered to conduct illegal activities\u201d if Trump is elected. Former CIA director, Michael Hayden, has expressed concern about how \u201cerratic\u201d Trump is, <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2016/08/michael-hayden-trump-military-226606\">saying</a>: \u201cHe\u2019s inconsistent.

  "<p>For years, the BBC has been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2014/feb/27/bbc-false-balance-fox-news-global-warming\">criticised</a> for the false balance of its climate change coverage. And for years, the BBC has apparently been doing \u201c<a href=\"http://downloads.bbc.co.uk/bbctrust/assets/files/pdf/our_work/science_impartiality/trust_conclusions.pdf#page=3\">ongoing work</a>\u201d to fix it. So far, however, this \u2018reform\u2019 has been more like a triumph of the middling. Yes, the BBC may broadcast less outright misinformation, but as a scientist and a citizen, I still feel let down by its continually careless handling of climate denial - most recently two weeks ago. This nod to mediocrity is a disservice to science, to public trust, and to the biggest news story in the world. And it is a huge, missed opportunity.</p> <p>As a young PhD graduate working on climate change solutions, I am confronted daily by a world where the warnings of science are undercut by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2015/aug/17/fox-news-inner-struggle-with-climate-misinformation\">Fox \u2018News\u2019</a> and its <a href=\"http://www.ecowatch.com/wall-street-journal-willing-to-print-truth-about-climate-change-if-you-1891174269.html\">ilk</a>. It is a very different world to the trustworthy BBC broadcasts of David Attenborough and the Royal Institution Christmas Lectures that I grew up with, which helped inspire me to become a scientist. But as a recent BBC News segment by Science Editor David Shukman sadly reminded me, those worlds can too easily collide.</p> <p>Shukman\u2019s broadcast was an interesting one. An important perspective on the \u201cpolitical battle over the future of fuel\u201d in the swing state of Ohio, and its implications for U.S. energy policy. I transcribed it <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nnTclsQtlshkrj7Xz1XU0GoyFD_yVUlGpoI-9Nktf_M/edit\">here</a>. It was all pretty benign until, halfway through, something in Shukman\u2019s narration caught my ear (emphasis mine): </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><em>The problem with coal comes when you burn it. It releases carbon dioxide, which is <strong>blamed </strong>for global warming. <strong>Donald Trump says</strong> that isn\u2019t a problem. But <strong>Hillary Clinton says</strong> it is, and she\u2019s offering a greener future instead ... </em></p> <p><em><strong>While the debate rages over whether climate change is a threat or not</strong> \u2026</em></p> </blockquote> <p>Shukman\u2019s accompanying BBC <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-37034052\">blog post</a> beats the same drum, outlining the candidates\u2019 \u201cstarkly different visions of global warming\u201d: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><em>The Democratic Party contender says she believes in the science of climate change. By contrast, the Republican candidate talks down the threat of rising temperatures.</em></p> </blockquote> <p>As harmless as they sound, words like \u201cblamed\u201d, \u201cdebate\u201d, and \u201cbelieve\u201d - without careful context - are the <a href=\"https://www.climatecommunication.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Somerville-Hassol-Physics-Today-2011.pdf#page=4\">currency of public confusion</a>. \u201cWho, exactly, blames carbon dioxide for global warming?\u201d we are forced to wonder.

Most importantly, who\u2019s right in this blame game? </p> <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/GeoffreySupran/status/769574268933922816\">For the record</a>, carbon dioxide is not \u201cblamed\u201d for global warming - it \u201ccauses\u201d it. That is the unequivocal scientific <a href=\"http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/11/4/048002\">consensus</a> the world over.</p> <p>Confusion, in turn, <a href=\"http://eiui.ca/current-literature-the-conflict-between-journalistic-balance-and-scientific-credibility-in-science-reporting/\">fosters</a> doubt.

It demotes the importance of climate change to the electorate. It means we demand less of our leaders, and less of ourselves. And it is all that those who <a href=\"http://www.merchantsofdoubt.org/\">oppose</a> action on climate change need to win. </p> <p>The psychology of climate communication is of course <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/behavioural-insights/climate-change-consensus-who-cares\">not</a> black-and-white, but as one <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/nclimate/journal/v1/n9/full/nclimate1295.html\">peer-reviewed study</a> summarised:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><em>In short, people who believe that scientists disagree on global warming tend to feel less certain that global warming is occurring, and show less support for climate policy. </em></p> </blockquote> <p>The BBC should know better, because <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2011/jul/20/bbc-climate-change-science-coverage\">over</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/apr/02/mps-criticise-bbc-false-balance-climate-change-coverage\">over</a>, it has been indicted for mistakes like this.

The primaries have left us with two nominees who are rather geriatric, stiff and well-fed.</p> <p>But as Joe Biden (73 years old) likes to say: don\u2019t compare me to the Almighty, compare me to the alternative.</p> <p>In this case, the alternative is an overweight 70-year-old man who loves fast food, and whose gastroenterologist declared that he would be the healthiest president ever.</p> <p>Donald Trump\u2019s gut doctor explained in recent interviews that this \u201chealthiest\u201d judgment was compared mostly to people now residing in their graves. \u201cAll the rest of them are sick or dead,\u201d Dr Harold Bornstein <a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/trump-doctor-wrote-health-letter-just-5-minutes-limo-waited-n638526\">told</a> NBC News.</p> <p>This is an unkind comparison for the current commander-in-chief, who works out every day and seems not to have an inch of fat on his bones. It is true that Barack Obama gave up basketball a few years ago, so maybe Bornstein knows something we don\u2019t. Then again, he also admitted he wrote about Trump\u2019s health <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/27/donald-trump-doctor-letter-health-harold-bornstein\">in five minutes</a> while a Trump limo idled outside his office.</p> <p>Still, there are no two ways about it. This was Hillary\u2019s Worst. Weekend. Ever. (Apart from that whole impeachment saga and the 2008 primaries.) Just as she looked like she was running away to a landslide victory, a combination of a gaffe and a hot wobble has thrown the entire election into disarray.</p> <p>Of course until now, the gaffes have all emerged from the motor-mouth of Donald Trump. They have been so numerous, and so offensive, they have almost lost their power to shock. </p> <p>But with Hillary Clinton\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/10/hillary-clinton-basket-of-deplorables-donald-trump\">off-the-cuff remarks about the bigotry of Trump\u2019s supporters</a>, we have officially reached the point of no return. This deplorable election, featuring a deplorable candidate, is now circling the drain because the only respectable candidate expressed her disdain for racist voters.</p> <p>Voters hold an unusual amount of respect in any election. We may have lost our respect for politicians, sports stars, religious leaders and just about every profession, but voters remain sacrosanct. So Clinton\u2019s comments have crossed a line: an unforced error that reveals how flawed a campaigner she is.</p> <p>\u201cYou know, to just be grossly generalistic,\u201d she told a Manhattan fundraiser, \u201cyou could put half of Trump\u2019s supporters into what I call the basket of deplorables.

And they fell through the Clinton administration, and the Bush administration, and each successive administration has said that somehow these communities are going to regenerate and they have not.</p> <p>\u201cAnd it\u2019s not surprising then they get bitter, they cling to guns or religion or antipathy toward people who aren\u2019t like them, or anti-immigrant sentiment or anti-trade sentiment, as a way to explain their frustrations.\u201d</p> <p>The speaker of these grossly generalistic insults of the pro-gun, pro-God culture of Middle America? Barack Obama, of course.</p> <p>Those comments came to light in April 2008, as Obama was fighting one Hillary Clinton for votes in the Pennsylvania primary. \u201cI was taken aback by the demeaning remarks Senator Obama made about people in small-town America,\u201d Clinton said at the time. \u201cHis remarks are elitist and out of touch.\u201d</p> <p>Clinton\u2019s staffers started handing out stickers saying \u201cI\u2019m not bitter\u201d and she went on to win the primary by nine points. She ultimately lost the nomination by a convincing margin.</p> <p>What of the lasting damage to candidate Obama from this revealing insight into this elitist character? In the general election, Obama won Pennsylvania by 10 points. He took God-fearing Virginia by 6 points, and gun-loving Indiana by 1 point.</p> <p>Ah, yes. But what about Mitt Romney\u2019s unforgettable gaffe \u2013 also at a fundraiser among the super-wealthy \u2013 when he condemned not just half of his opponent\u2019s supporters, but half of the population of the United States?</p> <p>\u201cThere are 47% of the people who will vote for the president no matter what,\u201d he said, \u201cwho are dependent upon government, who believe that they are victims. These are people who pay no income tax \u2026 and so my job is not to worry about those people. I\u2019ll never convince them that they should take personal responsibility and care for their lives.\u201d</p> <p>Why did the Romney gaffe stick? Because it played into months of multi-million-dollar advertising and messaging from the Obama campaign about Romney\u2019s lack of compassion for the middle class. After all those attacks, the gaffe seemed like Romney\u2019s confession of the truth.</p> <p>So where is the comparable anti-Clinton narrative, bolstered by huge ad spends and a consistent communications strategy? (And no, tweets don\u2019t count.) The Trump campaign, such as it is, has no major ad spending, and nothing that resembles a strategy in communications, policy or politics. It is singularly ill equipped to profit from this gift of a gaffe.</p> <p>If any candidate plays into this gaffe-fest, it\u2019s Trump himself. Because the real power of a gaffe is that it exposes some unspeakable truth. And the truth is that many Trump supporters are indeed attracted by the \u201cracist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, Islamophobic\u201d eruptions of the candidate himself.</p> <p>Trump built his candidacy on questioning the birthplace of the country\u2019s first black president. He went on to suggest that the same president harbored sympathies for Isis. <a href=\"http://www.publicpolicypolling.com/main/2016/05/gop-quickly-unifies-around-trump-clinton-still-has-modest-lead.html\">Sure enough</a>, two-thirds of Trump supporters believe Obama is Muslim and 59% think he wasn\u2019t born in the United States. It\u2019s unlikely they hold these views in an adorable way.</p> <p>Deplorable, on the other hand, might be a great word to describe a candidate who suggests that gun owners should shoot Hillary Clinton to stop her proposals on gun safety? That would be the <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2016/08/trump-violent-rhetoric-history-226873\">same candidate</a> whose butler posted that someone should shoot Obama, and whose supporters regularly chant \u201ckill the bitch\u201d when Clinton\u2019s name is mentioned. </p> <p>Clinton isn\u2019t missing the other appeal of Donald Trump: the aspirational side of his policy agenda that his supporters are yearning for. There is no other appeal of Trump and no aspirational agenda. That\u2019s why the Clinton campaign is digging in for a long fight about Trump\u2019s deplorable nature.</p> <p>Was the comment elitist, tone-deaf and self-defeating? Could it \u2013 along with the health scare stories \u2013 narrow the Clinton poll lead by a point or two? As Sarah Palin would say, you betcha.</p> <p>But please spare us the false equivalency. There are worse political crimes than such gaffes. And there are older, unhealthier candidates running for president.</p>",

In 2008, Barack Obama\u2019s doctor offered <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2014/06/president-obama-health-107797\">a 276-page report</a> about the senator, then 47, and John McCain, then 71 and <a href=\"http://articles.latimes.com/2008/may/24/science/sci-melanoma24\">the survivor of several brushes with skin cancer</a>, made almost 1,200 pages of medical history available.</p> <p>Clinton can be expected to recover swiftly \u2013 pneumonia is a common illness that most people get over in about two weeks, though it can become dangerous for older people and infants. The infection typically develops after a cold or flu: Clinton\u2019s doctor said the former secretary of state was suffering from persistent allergies before the diagnosis. </p> <p>Dr Lisa R Bardack, of Mount Kisco Medical Group in New York, prescribed antibiotics and rest and advised Clinton change her schedule, which has sent her traveling almost daily around the US, often to the large fundraisers or rallies. That schedule was under discussion on Sunday.</p> <p>Campaigns can act as petri dishes for the politicians, aides and the reporters who attend them, and recent elections have seen several instances of candidates persevering through or bowing out over illness. </p> <p>The former US representative Michele Bachmann, for example, was an early leader in the 2012 Republican primary but cited <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/michele-bachmann-releases-physicians-note-on-migraines/2011/07/20/gIQAcnTiQI_story.html\">debilitating migraines</a> to explain why she suddenly left a debate. She eventually released a doctor\u2019s letter explaining the headaches were so strong they required medication. That same year, former Texas governor Rick Perry campaigned despite recent back surgery, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2012/12/03/rick-perrys-back-problems-worse-than-we-knew/\">reportedly using painkillers </a>to cope.</p> <p>Two decades earlier, Massachusetts senator Paul Tsongas ran against Bill Clinton in the Democratic presidential primary.

A subsequent presidential election had its own health scare: Republican vice-presidential candidate Dick Cheney <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/10/15/cheney.hospital/index.html?iref=topnews\">had his fourth heart attack</a> shortly after voters went to the polls in November 2000.</p> <p>Questions of seniority and health followed Ronald Reagan\u2019s 1984 campaign, when the 73-year-old was running for re-election as the oldest president in history. Reagan broached the issue at a debate against his younger opponent, Walter Mondale, joking: \u201cI am not going to exploit for political purposes my opponent\u2019s youth and inexperience.\u201d</p> <p>Only eight presidents have died in office, and four of those were assassinated. Not long after his inauguration in 1841, 68-year-old William Henry Harrison caught a cold that developed into pneumonia, according to his doctor, though he may have actually <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/01/science/what-really-killed-william-henry-harrison.html\">contracted enteric fever</a>. Despite attempts to medicate Harrison with opium and other toxins, he became the first president to die in service.</p> <p>Less than a decade later, Zachary Taylor died in office, only five days after falling ill, probably from cholera. In 1923, Warren G Harding died from heart disease \u2013 a sudden heart attack while he was visiting San Francisco \u2013 aged 57.</p> <p>Franklin Delano Roosevelt, who was diagnosed with polio at 39 and lived with increasing paralysis through his time in office, only <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/05/health/05docs.html\">allowed voters a partial view</a> of his health through four elections and three and a half terms. He used a wheelchair only in private, relying on crutches and weighted podiums to stand in public, and retreated often to Warm Springs, Georgia, where he owned a rehabilitation clinic.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a3a97fd4b51476d3dbdac23bc18ac384bf5bc7ca\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a3a97fd4b51476d3dbdac23bc18ac384bf5bc7ca/0_0_2775_1665/1000.jpg\" alt=\"dick cheney with bust\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dick Cheney had a heart attack shortly after voting took place in 2000.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Brendan Smialowski/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The public knew of his affliction but Roosevelt often portrayed himself as improving, and only rarely would he allow photographs while seated in his wheelchair or comment publicly about his condition.

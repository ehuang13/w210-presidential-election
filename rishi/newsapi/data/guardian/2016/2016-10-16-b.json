But in speaking out about her experience, Heller joins <a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/2016/10/14/politics/trump-women-accusers/\">eight other women</a> who have publicly accused Trump of inappropriate come-ons, touching, or kissing over the past several decades. The allegations have opened a chasm within the Republican party as the presidential campaign enters the crucial final weeks, and have inspired Trump to issue a series of fulminating denials. This week, Trump called some of the women who have accused him \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2016/oct/13/trump-sexual-misconduct-allegations-election-clinton-obama\">horrible, horrible liars</a>\u201d.</p> <p>But Heller does not believe Trump\u2019s many accusers are lying. </p> <p>Their alleged encounter took place almost two decades ago \u2013 Heller believes the year was 1997 and she was at a Mother\u2019s Day brunch \u2013 at Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago estate. Heller, her husband, her three children and her in-laws were among dozens of families seated at big round tables in what she and a relative who spoke to the Guardian recall was an open lobby.</p> <p>Trump made the rounds greeting members of his club. When he stopped at their table, Heller recalled, and her mother-in-law introduced her, she stood and extended her hand.</p> <p>\u201cHe took my hand, and grabbed me, and went for the lips,\u201d she claimed. </p> <p>Alarmed, she said she leaned backwards to avoid him and almost lost her balance. \u201cAnd he said, \u2018Oh, come on.\u2019 He was strong. And he grabbed me and went for my mouth and went for my lips.\u201d She turned her head, she claims, and Trump planted a kiss on the side of her mouth. \u201cHe kept me there for a little too long,\u201d Heller said. \u201cAnd then he just walked away.\u201d<br></p> <p>\u201cI was angry and shaken,\u201d she continued. \u201cHe was pissed. He couldn\u2019t believe a woman would pass up the opportunity.\u201d She added that he seemed to feel \u201centitled\u201d to kiss her. </p> <p>The Guardian heard accounts that matched Heller\u2019s from two other people: Susan Klein, the friend who was emailing with Heller, and a relative seated at the table with Heller that day. The relative, who declined to be named for fear of retaliation, recalled that Heller sat back down with a stunned look on her face.</p> <p>\u201cI remember she was really freaked out,\u201d said the relative. The relative didn\u2019t see Heller\u2019s entire interaction with Trump, but saw him get \u201cin her face\u201d and saw Heller pull away. \u201cHe was very forceful \u2026 She really was definitely affected by this man who was very aggressive toward her.\u201d</p> <p>Heller and the relative both recalled that no one at the table quite knew how to react. \u201cI was shook up,\u201d said Heller.

Heller met Clinton briefly at a March fundraiser, and in January she donated the individual maximum of $2,700 to Clinton\u2019s campaign. She believes she has also attended a party where the Clintons were present.</p> <p>In addition, her husband\u2019s family is involved in a years-long effort to recover initiation fees that her late in-laws paid to join Mar-A-Lago. The club\u2019s rules state that the fees are refundable under certain circumstances when an individual is no longer a member, and Heller has placed at least one phone call to a club manager attempting to recover the money, totaling several thousand dollars.</p> <p>But Heller says her encounter with Trump predates that effort.</p> <p>\u201cMy motivations for speaking,\u201d she said, are to show \u201cit\u2019s not \u2018just talk\u2019\u201d, as Trump has claimed. \u201cIt\u2019s action.\u201d</p> <p>Klein, Heller\u2019s friend and neighbor, told the Guardian that she had heard the story long before the tape surfaced.</p> <p>Klein said she learned about Heller\u2019s alleged brush with Trump in the summer of 2015. It was shortly after Trump launched his run for the presidency, and Heller confided her story to the ladies\u2019 Mahjong group the women both belong to near their homes in New York. Klein recounted Heller\u2019s telling of story to the Guardian in similar detail.<br></p> <p>\u201cAnd when this tape came out, I couldn\u2019t believe it, because it was exactly what he said he did and had done to Cathy,\u201d Klein said.</p> <p>Klein forwarded a breaking news alert to Heller on 7 October, the day news of the tape broke. \u201cYou were one of Trump\u2019s victims,\u201d she wrote. \u201cHe said when he sees a pretty woman, he just kisses her, he doesn\u2019t even wait.\u201d</p> <p>Later that night, Heller replied: \u201cThe stories coming out go so well with how he treated me!\u201d</p> <p>On Saturday afternoon, the Trump campaign denied the accusation. \u201cThere is no way that something like this would have happened in a public place on Mother\u2019s Day at Mr Trump\u2019s resort,\u201d spokesman Jason Miller said in a statement. \u201cIt would have been the talk of Palm Beach for the past two decades.</p> <p>\u201cThe reality is this: for the media to wheel out a politically motivated Democratic activist with a legal dispute against this same resort owned by Mr Trump does a disservice to the public, and anyone covering this story should be embarrassed for elevating this bogus claim.\u201d</p> <p>Heller said that besides her January donation to Clinton, she had \u201calso bought a woman\u2019s card from Hillary,\u201d alluding to <a href=\"https://shop.hillaryclinton.com/products/the-woman-card\">a $5 card</a> sold by the campaign after Trump accused his rival of \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jan/03/donald-trump-hillary-clinton-woman-card-middle-east\">constantly playing the woman card</a>\u201d. </p> <p>She added that although she supports Clinton, she is not an activist \u2013 \u201cI\u2019ve never done any work for the Democratic Party\u201d \u2013 and that she is not pursuing any legal action against Mar-A-Lago.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/787359730465329152\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Nothing ever happened with any of these women.

Similarly, 45% of non-college-educated whites said the deck was stacked against people like them, while only 29% of college-educated white voters agreed with the sentiment.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Diggles added: \u201cWhite people without a college degree are much more likely to see a rigged system, to see the forces of globalization acting against them and they don\u2019t feel like they have control over their own destiny.\u201d</p> <p>Gregory Rosenthal, a retina surgeon and a member of <a href=\"http://www.r4c16.org/\">Republicans for Clinton</a>, is deeply disdainful of Trump\u2019s anti-intellectual appeal to uneducated voters\u2019 fears and anxieties and equally critical of the GOP nominee\u2019s apparent want for complex ideas and speech. <br></p> <p>\u201cTrump is an imbecile like the fictitious Chauncey Gardiner, supported by a rogues\u2019 gallery of cynics hoping to control him,\u201d Rosenthal wrote in an emailed response, making reference to the lead character in the 1979 movie Being There.</p> <p>Rosenthal described his gradual split with the Republican party over its nominee as a \u201cslow motion spiral into a dark hole\u201d and that nothing Trump does at this point could win back his vote.</p> <p> This isn\u2019t the first time he has supported a Democratic nominee, however. In 2008, Rosenthal voted for Obama after John McCain selected Sarah Palin as his running mate.</p>",
  "<p>The longer an American has stayed in school, the more likely he or she is to register to vote and to cast a ballot on election day. </p> <p>At one extreme, in the 2012 presidential election just 21.6% of adults who left school before ninth grade voted. At the other, according to statistics from the <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/hhes/www/socdemo/voting/publications/p20/2012/tables.html\">Census Bureau</a>, 74.7% of adults who had an advanced degree voted. Though the precise numbers may not be known, observers are aware of the link between education and voting \u2013 it\u2019s one of the clearest correlations in political behavior research.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"21e30fe36dae918a6f0204a241004d6de07d0cbf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/21e30fe36dae918a6f0204a241004d6de07d0cbf/15_0_540_435/500.jpg\" alt=\"Educational status and voting\" width=\"500\" height=\"403\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>It\u2019s generally <a href=\"http://web.mit.edu/berinsky/www/files/edu.pdf\">assumed</a> that an education \u2013 for <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2015/10/education-solving-inequality/412729/\">those who are able</a> to afford it \u2013 improves civic engagement: that educated people feel they have a greater stake in society and feel it is worth their time to vote. In terms of shaping outcomes in 2016, though, it\u2019s not just turnout that matters \u2013 the way educational status tends to align with party inclination counts too.</p> <p>Again, the results are pretty clear. The Democratic party is preferred by college graduates, even though as recently as 2002 that was not the case. That\u2019s partly because non-white Americans now make up a <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.pewhispanic.org/2013/05/09/hispanic-high-school-graduates-pass-whites-in-rate-of-college-enrollment/\">larger share</a> of the college population, and those voters are less likely to be Republican.</p> <p>This election has been dominated by headlines about the non-college educated white Americans who form Republican nominee Donald Trump\u2019s support base. In 2012, about 55% of that demographic group showed up to vote, and 60% voted Republican.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"b3ca6ab1b6d8bc3b3501b67f0cfd863924c7f119\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b3ca6ab1b6d8bc3b3501b67f0cfd863924c7f119/0_0_420_714/294.jpg\" alt=\"Educational status and voting\" width=\"294\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>To understand how those people might affect this election, consider a few different hypothetical scenarios:</p> <p><strong>1.</strong> Non-college educated whites are no less likely to be Republican in 2016 and 100% of them show up to vote \u2013 which, let\u2019s face it, would never happen. According to polling analysis site FiveThirtyEight\u2019s <a href=\"http://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2016-swing-the-election/\">calculations</a>, Hillary Clinton would still narrowly win, by two percentage points. </p> <p><strong>2.</strong> Non-college educated white people are no more likely to vote, but 98% of those who do vote, vote for Trump \u2013 which, again, is never going to happen. Trump would win by a landslide of 27%. </p> <p><strong>3.</strong> Now consider a more realistic final hypothesis. Non-college educated white people become a little more Republican and a little more likely to vote \u2013 let\u2019s suggest that turnout rises to 65% from 55% and Republican vote share rises to 70% from 60%. Trump would win the White House with 52% of the national vote.</p> <p>All of these scenarios, however, assume that nothing else has changed since 2012 \u2013 that other educational groups like college graduates and other racial groups show up in the same numbers, with the same voting intentions, as they did four years ago. Clearly, that won\u2019t be the case. This election has repeatedly shown that no party can afford to rest on its laurels about whom it can count on to vote.</p>",

He narrowly lost the presidency to John Kennedy in 1960, and then lost a bid to be California\u2019s governor, but bounced back in 1968 to win the White House. He escalated, then ended, the war in Vietnam and opened relations with Mao\u2019s China. A landslide re-election in 1972 gave way to<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/watergate\"> Watergate</a>, when spying on political foes, and covering it up, forced his resignation.

Alec Baldwin returned as Donald Trump, and Kate McKinnon was introduced by the moderators as: \u201cCan we say this yet?\u201d \u201cProbably fine.\u201d \u201cPresident Hillary Clinton.\u201d </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/oct/09/no-groping-for-laughs-as-alec-baldwin-nails-trump-on-saturday-night-live\">No groping for laughs as Baldwin nails Donald Trump on Saturday Night Live</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Baldwin\u2019s Trump is still mostly facial expressions and excruciating pauses \u2013 more mimicry then genuine impression \u2013 while McKinnon\u2019s Clinton feels lived-in and comfortable.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pf_BGqEfMs0\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Pf_BGqEfMs0?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>The sketch included some classic SNL elements, imitating the candidates\u2019 awkward staging during the town hall debate, and brilliantly turning their decision not to shake hands into an awkward dance. But when McKinnon\u2019s Clinton mocked the idea she would be intimidated by women like Paula Jones in the audience, the joke felt more like a Samantha Bee quip than an SNL<em> </em>line. It was a little jarring, but ultimately this shift could be a good thing; SNL has many funny people at its disposal with many varied strengths, and it will help them immensely to shake up even something as traditional as a debate satire.</p> <p>Emily Blunt was a strong host, an immensely talented actor who was down for anything and flitted easily between melodramatic, goofy, sexy, and sweet. Unfortunately, her monologue was another musical number, this time a take on \u201cGet Happy!\u201d to cheer things up in the face of a grim news cycle. There were puppies and cookies, and while it was cute and chipper, it was immediately forgettable.</p> <p>The first post-monologue sketch was, dispiritingly, about two hookers; the joke (helpfully summarized at the end of the sketch) was the duo\u2019s long list of rules and requirements. Blunt\u2019s goofy, mid-Atlantic-accented prostitute had a few good lines, while Leslie Jones got to be very funny with her quirks \u2013 \u201cI can only role play as Stewie from the Family Guy\u201d \u2013 but it didn\u2019t have much to build to and ended blandly.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/nbcsnl/status/787507223542976512\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Hillary!

Entertaining, but it was no <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-QG-rFf4po\">Twin Bed</a>.</p> <p>Next, Vanessa Bayer ended up the lone audience member at a short film festival forced to ask questions to the dozens of cast and crewmembers on stage. Bayer\u2019s deer-in-the-headlights performance was spot-on and made this weird, silly sketch work.</p> <p>Weekend Update led with all things Trump, and co-host Colin Jost seemed, understandably, exhausted by the entire thing. Michael Che has found his footing as an update host, even if this audience seemed eager to find him shocking, groaning at some relatively harmless jokes. The most biting moment came from Bayer as a little girl doing the news in a sing-songy musical voice, who was outraged at Today co-host Billy Bush\u2019s $10m payment \u201cfrom this network!\u201d, earning a well-deserved applause break.</p> <p>Keen viewers \u2013 and many Twitterers \u2013 also caught onto the show\u2019s <a href=\"http://mashable.com/2016/04/26/snl-less-commercials-more-branded-content/#QiKD6nR11uqb\">new product placement</a> in a few later, lesser sketches \u2013 a bizarre stream of characters pulling through a Burger King drive-thru, then a robot sketch that prominently featured the Hondo logo. Whether it\u2019s meta-sketches or branded content, the 40-year-old institution is changing with the times.</p>"

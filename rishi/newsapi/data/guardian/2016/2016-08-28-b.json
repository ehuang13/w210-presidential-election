A Morning Consult survey <a href=\"https://morningconsult.com/2016/08/28/trump-gains-ground-clinton-black-voters-still-wary/\">released</a> on Sunday found Clinton leading by only three points, 43-40, in a head-to-head matchup.

This squares with a Quinnipiac <a href=\"https://www.qu.edu/images/polling/us/us08252016_U88mxwn.pdf\">survey last week</a> finding that 90% of likely voters have already made up their minds.</p> <p>The defibrillator now attached to the Trump campaign is in some ways plain to see. In the past two weeks, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/26/steve-bannon-florida-registered-vote-donald-trump\">the campaign leadership has been remade</a>, the candidate has redoubled <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/27/donald-trump-dwyane-wade-cousin-shooting-reaction\">outreach to non-white voters</a> and the campaign has spent its first millions on TV ads in battleground states.</p> <p>A shift by Trump on immigration, particularly given the influence of Hispanic voters in a number of battleground states, would seem of a piece with those changes.

The governor has long been an enthusiastic supporter and has stumped the state on thebusinessman\u2019s behalf. Furthermore, Trump\u2019s Iowa campaign director is Branstad\u2019s son, Eric, a veteran operative who during the caucuses led a bipartisan advocacy campaign on behalf of <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jan/10/iowa-caucus-corn-ethanol-republicans-democrats-ted-cruz\">the renewable fuels industry</a>. In Iowa at least, as election day approaches, Trump can count on the party machinery going into fully into gear.</p> <p>This is not to say Iowa Republicans are unfamiliar with intra-party conflict, and a vocal \u201cNever Trump\u201d contingent is to be found among those who supported Ted Cruz, the victor of the caucuses. But it receives no establishment support. Even congressmen in swing districts are happy to appear with Trump.</p> <p>In contrast, Democrats are off the pace they set in the past two election cycles, regarding organizational goals like absentee ballot requests and thanks to lingering bad blood from the caucuses, when many supporters of Bernie Sanders felt the state party chair, Andy McGuire, tilted the scales on Clinton\u2019s behalf. There is open campaigning to replace McGuire after the presidential vote.</p> <h2>Blue collar, white voter \u2026 red state?</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f6f14ee228d1c8150ab7d80337f6ccf224d69658\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f6f14ee228d1c8150ab7d80337f6ccf224d69658/0_233_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A man and child wait for Trump to speak\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A man and child wait for Trump to speak.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Carlo Allegri/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In recent decades Iowa has seen almost no demographic change. Ninety-one per cent white, it was one of a handful of states where Barack Obama <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/blog/2012/nov/07/obama-reelection-senate-democrats-live\">won a majority of white voters four years ago</a>. But many of the blue-collar white voters who have traditionally voted Democratic in the eastern part of the state are increasingly attracted to Trump. </p> <p>In fading factory towns like Dubuque and Waterloo, long bastions of Democratic support, Trump\u2019s anti-free trade and anti-immigration message is increasingly finding an audience. </p> <p>In the suburbs of Des Moines and Cedar Rapids, meanwhile, he is not losing many moderate Republicans \u2013 mostly because such areas are home to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jan/09/iowa-senator-ted-cruz-republican-presidential-caucus\">significant numbers of evangelical Christians</a>, to whom Clinton is simply anathema. If such voters do not vote for a third party candidate or stay home, Trump will be their man.</p> <p>New Trump supporters have, however, presented new challenges. Traditionally, Republican operatives scorn Democratic campaigns, which tend to be based on hiring hundreds of staffers to go door to door, getting marginal voters to sign up for absentee ballot requests. Republican voters have been far more consistent, meaning the party\u2019s campaigns have instead focused on tapping into networks of social conservatives, in particular home-schoolers. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/aug/28/donald-trump-comments-death-nba-dwyane-wade-cousin-political-speech-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/5xt4d\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2690131\"            data-video-name=\"Donald Trump comments on death of Dwyane Wade's cousin \u2013\u00a0video\"            data-video-provider=\"AP\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57c2a9eee4b0655f72768734\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/08/28/160828TrumpWade_h264_publish.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11572764&amp;format=video/m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11572764&amp;format=video/webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/aug/28/donald-trump-comments-death-nba-dwyane-wade-cousin-political-speech-video\">Donald Trump comments on death of Dwyane Wade\u2019s cousin \u2013 video</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Now, with social conservatives less enthusiastic about Trump than other Republicans, the Trump campaign\u2019s efforts in Iowa must become non-traditional \u2013 in effect, Democratic-style efforts meant to turn out former Democrats. </p> <p>This shift has been buoyed by what Kauffman, the Republican Iowa state chair, sees as a \u201cresurgence of rural populism\u201d. Iowa has a long and bipartisan history of rabble-rousing, going back to the 1890s. In the 1930s, during the Great Depression, farmers held dramatic strikes and even kidnapped a judge who presided over foreclosures. In parts of the state, martial law was declared. That tradition had receded, but Kaufmann has seen Trump hauling it back to the surface.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/27/republican-donors-trump-congress-local-races-sheldon-adelson\">Turned off by Trump: Republican mega-donors focus on congressional races</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Republican gains are borne out in registration figures. Since November 2012, Democratic voter registration in Iowa has fallen by 15,000. In the same time, Republicans have picked up almost 20,000 voters. This effort has been helped by two strong midterm results, eradicating the Democratic bench and leaving the party holding only one of the state\u2019s four congressional seats.</p> <p>In the shifting political math of 2016, all this makes Iowa far more winnable for Trump than many traditionally more competitive states. Accordingly, his campaign has committed significant resources. It is expected that Trump will campaign in the state three or four times a month until election day. Saturday\u2019s Roast and Ride was a taster.</p> <p>Even if this is not enough, and Trump loses Iowa, the coalition he has built may point to a long-term shift which will make the state less purple and more red. As Kaufmann said, win or lose: \u201cI think we have the ingredients for a realignment.\u201d</p> <p>That was a statement with which one well-connected Democrat agreed, though he did not want to attach his name to such an opinion. As he said mournfully this weekend: \u201cIncreasingly, it seems like it is a Republican state and they just let Democrats live here.\u201d</p>",

The future president and first lady visited an art gallery, watched Spike Lee\u2019s Do the Right Thing at the cinema, and talked and talked. Their meeting of minds is recounted in a movie, <a href=\"http://southsidewithyou.com/\">Southside with You</a>, which opened on Friday to mixed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jan/25/southside-with-you-review-obamas-first-date-is-before-sunset-sans-subtlety\">reviews</a>.</p> <p>The flattering portrait was released to 813 cinemas in North America, far more than first planned, after positive reaction at the Sundance film festival in January. Opinion polls showing the president\u2019s approval rating well above 50% will also have done no harm. \u201cMr Obama hasn\u2019t even left office, but the cinematic hagiography has begun,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/26/movies/southside-with-you-review.html\">the New York Times commented</a>.</p> <p>Written and directed by 31-year-old Richard Tanne, Southside with You stars Parker Sawyers as Barack and <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/21/movies/tika-sumpter-southside-with-you-michelle-obama.html\">Tika Sumpter</a> as Michelle; the executive producer is the musician and Obama fan John Legend. It meanders through a series of conversations \u2013 reminiscent of Richard Linklater\u2019s Before Sunrise \u2013 against the backdrop of southside Chicago in the late 1980s. At one point, the ambitious young lawyers walk past a wall bearing the name of people killed on the city streets.</p> <p>The movie <a href=\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/08/17/how-true-is-southside-with-you-fact-checking-barack-and-michelle-obama-s-romantic-first-date.html\">sticks mostly to the facts</a>, although a community meeting in a church, where Obama displays his rare talent for oratory, is incorporated from a later date. Michelle, 26, asks 28-year-old Barack if he has dated white women. Tanne has said he doesn\u2019t know if this happened but imagines it probably did at some point. Valerie Jarrett, who in real life had dinner with the couple early in their relationship and is now a senior adviser to the president, does not appear.</p> <p>Some critics have <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/goingoutguide/movies/barack-obama-takes-michelle-robinson-on-a-first-date-in-southside-with-you/2016/08/24/f2fe0544-6874-11e6-8225-fbb8a6fc65bc_story.html\">praised the film</a> and others have been lukewarm. Obama\u2019s conservative foes are likely to dismiss the film as propaganda. It comes at a wistful moment for the president\u2019s admirers, as he enters the final stretch, his speeches sometimes punctuated by audience cries of \u201cI love you!\u201d and \u201cfour more years!\u201d </p> <p>The contrast with his predecessor, George W Bush \u2013 whose final year in the White House was greeted by Oliver Stone\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/oct/04/oliver.stone.george.bush\">scathing biopic, W</a> \u2013 could not be starker. Where Obama gets a gentle romantic comedy, Bush was seen boozing, going to war on a flimsy premise and threatening the family legacy. </p> <p>\u201cAt the end of the Obama years, we get a glorification,\u201d said Joshua Kendall, a presidential historian. \u201cAt the end of the Bush years, we get a denigration.\u201d</p> <p>Obama\u2019s reputation appears to have grown in inverse proportion to his potential successors, with Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump enduring record disapproval ratings.

People [think] there\u2019s an honesty and integrity about him.\u201d</p> <p>Southside with You is only the first cinematic valentine to Obama. Another film is imminent: <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt5477566/\">Barry</a>, about his time as a student in New York. Should America\u2019s first black president write another memoir, a screen adaptation might be expected to follow.</p> <p>\u201cThe problem with biography in general is it tends to be hagiography or denigration, in movies even more than books,\u201d Kendall said. \u201cIn general, people don\u2019t tend to want to take in the complexity.\u201d</p> <p>Obama is far from the first president to be lionised \u2013 or demonised \u2013 by Hollywood. Abraham Lincoln\u2019s reputation was burnished by John Ford\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.criterion.com/films/766-young-mr-lincoln\">Young Mr Lincoln</a> in 1939 and Steven Spielberg\u2019s Lincoln in 2012. Richard Nixon suffered a similar fate to Bush when he was played by Anthony Hopkins in Nixon, also directed by Stone, in 1995.</p> <p>The British writer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2006/sep/17/theatre\">Peter Morgan</a>, the author of political dramas including The Deal, The Queen, Frost/Nixon, The Special Relationship and The Audience, said: \u201cIn the US, when they talk about the president, they also talk about the head of state. I think they tend to portray their presidents heroically or as villains.\u201d<br></p> <p>Morgan has not yet seen Southside with You but suggested that, in general, it was wise to let the dust settle before turning political lives into art. </p> <p>\u201cI thought W was done far too quickly. I\u2019m normally an admirer of Oliver Stone, but it was rushed out. I think the rule of thumb is to wait for 10 years. If you wait, then you have the possibility of something having a metaphorical aspect and being about more than itself.\u201d</p> <p>Recalling his own foray into depicting Nixon in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/jan/23/frost-nixon-film-review\">a stage play and film</a> about the former president\u2019s landmark TV interviews with the British broadcaster David Frost, Morgan said: \u201cIn America, it was a play about Richard Nixon. In Britain, it was a play about David Frost. </p> <p>\u201cI had a particularly terrifying screening in Washington where all the old Watergate bounty hunters came to watch.

Franklin D Roosevelt, another president who might be expected to receive heroic treatment, was instead portrayed having an affair with his cousin in 2012\u2019s Hyde Park on Hudson, starring Bill Murray and Laura Linney. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/nov/14/the-butler-review\">Lee Daniels\u2019 The Butler</a> saw presidents come and go through the eyes of a black butler played by Forest Whitaker.</p> <p>When he was played by Kevin Spacey opposite Michael Shannon in Elvis &amp; Nixon earlier this year, for once Watergate was not the focus of a film about the 37th president. A recent HBO adaptation of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/apr/08/robert-schenkkan-lyndon-b-johnson-all-the-way-bryan-cranston\">Robert Schenkkan\u2019s play All the Way</a> presented Bryan Cranston\u2019s richly nuanced depiction of Lyndon Johnson as both angel and ape. Coming soon at the Venice film festival is the premiere of Jackie, featuring Natalie Portman as Jackie Kennedy in the aftermath of her husband\u2019s assassination in 1963.</p> <p>Not every politician, however, reads and watches coverage of themselves as assiduously as Trump does.

  "<p>The map of competitive states is expanding this year as Donald Trump\u2019s poll numbers dipped to surprising lows in historically red states such as Georgia and Arizona. The last time either state voted Democratic was two decades ago.</p> <p>But even as the small club of battleground states grows this year, fewer than 10 states will likely determine the outcome of this year\u2019s race. </p> <p>Relying on the same handful of states to decide the outcome of presidential elections is a fairly recent phenomenon. Just three decades ago, when politics weren\u2019t yet so polarized, all 50 states were up for grabs, swinging between parties from one election to the next.</p> <p>Looking <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1984/11/07/politics/07REAG.html?pagewanted=all\">somber and drained</a> near midnight on 6 November 1984, Democrat Walter Mondale conceded victory to Ronald Reagan in the presidential election after Reagan won 49 of 50 states. Mondale won only his home state of Minnesota.<br></p> <p>Such blowout elections may seem incredible today, but Reagan\u2019s win was less exceptional at the time. Just 12 years earlier, in 1972, Richard Nixon also swept 49 out of 50 states against George McGovern to become president. And in 1964, Lyndon B Johnson won 44 states to Barry Goldwater\u2019s six.<br></p> <p>That\u2019s in stark contrast to today\u2019s political landscape.<br></p> <p>Despite campaign troubles and <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/other/trump_favorableunfavorable-5493.html\">low favorability ratings</a>, Trump will almost certainly win at least 20 states, if not 25 \u2013 half the US \u2013 on election night. In a different decade, a candidate plagued by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/10/trump-assassination-remark-clinton-second-amendment\">controversial statements</a>, with a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/20/hillary-clinton-fundraising-report-donald-trump-us-election\">historically underfunded campaign</a>, and who many party elites have <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2016/may/14/who-supports-donald-trump-the-new-republican-center-of-gravity\">publicly denounced</a> might have been tanking in more states.</p> <p>The term \u201cswing states\u201d is well known today, but the same few states determining several consecutive presidential elections is a recent occurrence.</p> <p>The phrase \u201cswing state\u201d wasn\u2019t mentioned in books until the 1950s, according to <a href=\"https://books.google.com/ngrams\">Google Ngram Viewer,</a> a service that shows how often phrases have been used in texts over time. But between 2000 and 2008, usage of the term more than tripled. During that period, Ohio, Florida, Virginia and a handful of others coalesced into the group we now think of as swing states.<br></p> <p>Since 2000, 40 states have voted for the same party\u2019s candidate in all four presidential elections. By contrast, in the four elections between 1984 and 1996, states \u201cswung\u201d more often: only 17 states voted for the same party\u2019s candidate in the four consecutive elections during that period.<br></p> <p>Increasing political polarization is a big factor in the swing state phenomenon. The roots of current polarization stretch back to <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2014/01/08/what-we-know-and-dont-know-about-our-polarized-politics/\">about the 1970s</a>; since then, the parties have become not only more ideologically sorted but also more ideologically divergent, and their members more hostile toward the opposing party.</p> <p>Liberal Republicans and conservative Democrats used to make up a much larger share of both the US Congress and the broader population. Even a decade ago, conservative Democratic representatives in Congress voted alongside Republicans almost as often as they voted alongside Democrats. Now, conservative Democrats in the House and Senate have been unseated by Republicans, and liberal Republicans have lost their seats to Democrats.<br></p> <p>It\u2019s also increasingly rare for members of either party to break party lines when voting, both for ideological reasons and as strategic moves in an increasingly intense competition for party control.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/08/flipped-polarization-slider/\" data-alt=\"Graphic showing US legislators becoming more polarized.\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/08/flipped-polarization-slider/\">Graphic showing US legislators becoming more polarized.</a> </figure>  <p>Voters\u2019 ideas are also becoming more homogenous and more in sync with their chosen party\u2019s platform.

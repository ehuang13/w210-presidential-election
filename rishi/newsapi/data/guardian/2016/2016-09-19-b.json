We cannot let it go on.\u201d</p> <p>While the central themes of Clinton\u2019s stump speech were mostly met with polite applause, it was the urgency of her appeal against Trump\u2019s racial divisiveness that brought the crowd to its feet. It is the hope of Clinton\u2019s campaign that, in addition to her platform on issues such as college affordability, equal pay and the environment, the former secretary of state can persuade young voters to view this election as a binary choice on core values and inclusivity.</p> <p>Polling has shown young voters are far more likely to reject the premise \u2013 pushed in particular by Trump and the so-called \u201calt-right\u201d conservative movement \u2013 that a more racially inclusive outlook is akin to \u201cpolitical correctness\u201d. They are also more embracing of immigrants and have been turned off by Trump\u2019s rhetoric against Latinos, Muslims and other minorities.</p> <p>Even so, Clinton has struggled to capture the support of the young Americans who have reliably voted Democratic in recent cycles and helped propel Barack Obama to victory in both 2008 and 2012. </p> <p>Monday\u2019s event, part of a broader effort by the Clinton campaign to target millennial voters, was an acknowledgment that Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson and Green party candidate Jill Stein, who are attracting support from a third of voters under the age of 30, could imperil Clinton\u2019s hold over a critical voting bloc.</p> <p>Clinton made it clear she was under no illusion that young voters were entirely satisfied with her as an alternative to Trump, while nodding to her discomfort with the \u201cpublic part\u201d of public service. </p> <p>\u201cI also know that even if you are totally opposed to Donald Trump, you still may have some questions about me. I get that,\u201d she said. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/19/donald-trump-arizona-latino-voters-democrats\">As Trump slips into red with Latinos, Democrats hope to turn Arizona blue</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cI will never be the showman my opponent is, and you know what?

Hold us accountable for our ideas, both of us.\u201d</p> <p>With a significant faction of young voters still up for grabs, Clinton\u2019s campaign dispatched some of its most popular surrogates to woo them over the past week. First lady Michelle Obama, Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren and Clinton\u2019s former primary opponent Bernie Sanders all stumped on college campuses, while the campaign and its allies launched both television and digital advertising aimed at galvanizing millennials. </p> <p>Brian Fallon, a spokesman for Clinton campaign, said the campaign was aware of the task at hand. But he added that it was \u201ca distortion\u201d of the data to compare Clinton numbers among young voters with those of Obama, since the president\u2019s support was being gauged from exit polling \u2013 in other words, those who turned up to cast their ballot for his re-election as opposed to how many young voters supported him with two months still remaining.</p> <p>\u201cBy some measures, we\u2019re ahead of where President Obama was in 2012,\u201d Fallon told the Guardian. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of work that goes on in the last seven weeks.\u201d </p>  <figure class=\"element element-audio\" data-canonical-url=\"https://soundcloud.com/politics-for-humans-guardian-us/its-millennial-week-in-election-season-politics-for-humans-podcast\"> <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"460\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?visual=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F283806286&show_artwork=true\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  <p>\u201cElection Day is what counts, and we think we\u2019ll be successful among young voters. But we have to work for them.\u201d</p> <p>With recent surveys showing Trump closing in on her lead, Clinton called on young voters who might be complacent or disillusioned to understand the influence of their vote.</p> <p>\u201cIt is going to be close.

But the first-time voter confessed to being moved by what he heard.</p> <p>\u201cAfter today, it\u2019s changed my perspective and I think it might make me go vote for Hillary,\u201d Ramesh said. \u201cSeeing how grounded she was was the most impressive thing to me. </p> <p>\u201cTrump is more of a celebrity seeking the limelight. Trump would definitely ruin the public image of America and America won\u2019t be seen as that country that everyone yearns to come to.\u201d</p> <p>Ariel Epstein, a sophomore at the nearby University of Pennsylvania, did not require convincing. Having already cast her vote for Clinton in the primary, she came away instead with a renewed purpose of mobilizing her friends and classmates to register to vote.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m definitely worried because a lot of people our age are Bernie-or-busters,\u201d she said, citing the Vermont senator\u2019s overwhelming support among young voters during the Democratic primary.</p> <p>\u201cBeing here today made me more determined. You can just see the divide between her and Trump \u2013 it\u2019s ridiculous that they\u2019re even being considered on the same playing field.\u201d</p> <p>Invoking her own story from when she was in college, Clinton recalled grappling with the same frustration toward the political system during the Vietnam war. </p> <p>\u201cIt can be tempting to think that no one will tell you the truth and nothing\u2019s ever going to change,\u201d she told those who might be skeptical of a seasoned politician such as herself. \u201cBut you\u2019re here today because you refuse to accept cynicism. You know that the next 50 days will shape the next 50 years.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>An explosion on the streets of Manhattan, pipe bombs in New Jersey, and a shootout with a terrorist suspect: a jittery election, filled with hyperbole, just grew more breathless.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/19/new-york-bombing-suspect-ahmad-khan-rahami\">Suspect in New York bombing arrested after shootout with police</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Of course most of that hype has emerged from the mouth of Donald Trump, and he embraced the emergence of a new terror campaign well before officials confirmed Saturday\u2019s explosion as a bomb.</p> <p>Whether this helps or hurts Trump\u2019s candidacy depends a lot on whether you are already primed for the politics of fear. If Trump and Clinton sound like they\u2019re talking to two different audiences, that\u2019s because the polls suggest they really are.</p> <p>The United States is deeply divided not just about how to respond to terrorism, but about how serious the terrorist threat is.</p> <p>Recent surveys have underscored the wide gap in perceptions between Republicans on one side, and Democrats and independents on the other.</p> <p>According to a <a href=\"http://www.people-press.org/2016/09/07/15-years-after-911-a-sharp-partisan-divide-on-ability-of-terrorists-to-strike-u-s/\">recent study by the Pew Research Center</a>, 58% of Republicans think that terrorists are more capable of attacking the United States than they were on 9/11. That is 24 points higher than independents and 27 points higher than Democrats.</p> <p>Over the last three years, independents and Democrats have barely changed their views on the prospect of terrorist attacks on the homeland. In contrast, Republicans have become sharply more concerned, up 18 points in the same period.</p> <p>The big question about this increase is not whether it\u2019s justified; it plainly isn\u2019t. None of the terrorist attacks across the world since 9/11 have come close to the mass murders perpetrated on that day.</p> <p>What has changed, however, is the Republican rhetoric about American weakness under President Obama. In this regard, Donald Trump is no different from the other dozen candidates he beat in the GOP primaries.</p> <p>\u201cUnder the leadership of Obama and Clinton, Americans have experienced more attacks at home than victories abroad,\u201d Trump posted on Twitter on Monday. \u201cTime to change the playbook!\u201d</p> <p>How you react to this depends on what you consider attacks at home or victories abroad. As Trump himself has pointed out, the 9/11 attacks were on President Bush\u2019s watch: an observation that outraged the GOP foreign policy establishment. As for a victory abroad, Trump\u2019s definition of success includes trade wars, travel bans, mass deportations and giant border construction.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s real skill is the politics of excess. Where other officials consider the policy implications of their words, Trump lives and dies through the power to shock \u2013 not the power to scare.</p> <p>Fifteen years after 9/11, and a decade into our mass experiment with social media, we may be numbed to fear. On the streets of Manhattan on Monday, there were no signs of New Yorkers changing their daily habits as they did for months after the Twin Towers fell.</p> <p>But the power to shock lingers precisely because it is so hard to break through the digital noise of social media. Trump\u2019s willingness to say things that are excessive, unjustified and outrageous enables him to.</p> <p>He lacks the self-restraint of an elected official who may be held responsible for his performance. Like the current occupant of the Oval Office, for instance. Speaking to reporters in New York on Monday, President Obama urged the media to be responsible. \u201cIt does not help if false reports or incomplete information is out there,\u201d he noted pointedly. \u201cSo try to, as much as possible, stick to what our investigators say, because they actually know what they\u2019re talking about.\u201d</p> <p>As an attack on the press, this is mild by Donald Trump\u2019s standards. Then again, Trump has no desire to calm public fears in any situation.</p> <p>Obama\u2019s press advice teed up a bigger argument: that stoking fear was precisely what terrorists were trying to accomplish. \u201cEven as we have to be vigilant and aggressive, both in preventing senseless acts of violence but also making sure that we find those who carry out such acts and bring them to justice, we all have a role to play as citizens in making sure that we don\u2019t succumb to that fear,\u201d he explained.</p> <p>\u201cBy showing those who want to do us harm that they will never beat us, by showing the entire world that as Americans we do not, and never will, give in to fear, that\u2019s going to be the most important ingredient in us defeating those who would carry out terrorist acts against us.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s safe to say this is not a worldview shared by Donald Trump, who tweeted out loud about how many hidden terrorists might be lurking in our midst.</p> <p>\u201cOnce again someone we were told is ok turns out to be a terrorist who wants to destroy our country &amp; its people \u2013 how did he get thru system?\u201d Trump <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/777910435425226753\">wrote</a>.</p> <p>He was referring to Ahmad Khan Rahami, the suspect detained on Monday, who was a naturalized US citizen.</p> <p>Unexpected events normally provide the most revealing moments in a presidential campaign. And there are few things more unexpected than an actual terrorist attack, no matter the number of casualties or the number of foiled bombs.</p> <p>So far voters have favored Hillary Clinton\u2019s response to terrorism over Donald Trump\u2019s. According to a <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/16/us/politics/hillary-clinton-donald-trump-poll.html\">recent poll for the New York Times and CBS News</a>, 49% of voters think Clinton would do a better job on terrorism and national security, a four-point lead over Trump. By a 22-point margin, Clinton is favored over Trump to handle foreign policy. Whether that lead can be sustained in the immediate aftermath of a real-life bomb remains to be seen. </p> <p>Clinton indulged in her own hyperbole on Monday by focusing on Trump\u2019s reaction to the weekend bombs. She called Trump a \u201crecruiting sergeant for the terrorists\u201d by supporting the terrorists\u2019 notion of a war with Islam, rather than a war with jihadis. \u201cThe kinds of rhetoric and language Mr Trump has used is giving aid and comfort to our adversaries,\u201d she told reporters.</p> <p>This presidential campaign has now entered the final, fevered stages of the cycle. A week out from the first debate, questions of temperament and terrorism are likely to dominate the next several days, if not weeks.</p> <p>Like everything else in this contest, the cooler heads are unlikely to prevail. Even when they favor better policy.</p>",
  "<p>Governor Chris Christie of New Jersey was informed in real time about the plot to wreak revenge on a small-town mayor who refused to back him for re-election by creating traffic chaos over the George Washington bridge, federal prosecutors said on Monday.</p> <p>The stunning claim was made during opening remarks by the prosecution at the trial of two of Christie\u2019s once close associates in Newark. Bridget Kelly, the governor\u2019s then deputy chief of staff, and Bill Baroni, former deputy head of the Port Authority which controlled the bridge, are charged with instigating lane closures in September 2013 as an act of political spite against Mark Sokolich, the mayor of Fort Lee that sits in the shadow of the GWB. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/08/bridgegate-trial-chris-christies-new-jersey-donald-trump\">Bridgegate trial and Chris Christie's role could mean more trouble for Trump</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Though Christie himself has not been charged, how much he knew about any nefarious intent behind the gridlock is the elephant in the courtroom. Delivering his opening statement, assistant US attorney Vikas Khanna referred to a 9/11 memorial ceremony held on the third day of the traffic crisis that was attended by Christie and several of his inner team.</p> <p>There has long been speculation about what was said at that event after <a href=\"http://blogs.wsj.com/metropolis/2014/01/14/christie-official-who-arranged-bridge-closures-together-during-fiasco/\">photos</a> of Christie emerged in the company of Baroni and Kelly. Also present at the ceremony was David Wildstein, another top Port Authority executive who has already pleaded guilty to conspiracy and is now the star witness for the prosecution.</p> <p>Khanna told the jury they would hear testimony from Wildstein in which he would describe the brief conversation that took place there. \u201cDuring those precious few minutes, they bragged about the fact that there were traffic problems in Fort Lee and that Mayor Sokolich was not getting his calls returned.\u201d</p> <p>Christie has consistently denied he knew at the time that his associates had colluded in creating traffic hell for Fort Lee. But the suggestion that he was in the loop has followed him around like a bad smell for the past three years, helping to <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/11/us/politics/chris-christie.html\">destroy his bid</a> for the Republican presidential nomination, which collapsed in February.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/10/chris-christie-lied-bridgegate-aide-staff\">Chris Christie 'flat out lied' about staff's Bridgegate involvement, ex-aide said</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Since flaming out of the race for the White House, Christie has put his eggs into the Donald Trump basket. The claims emanating from the so-called Bridgegate trial are awkwardly timed given that Christie is acting as Trump\u2019s surrogate on <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/07/christie-trump-vice-president/490829/\">law and order</a>.</p> <p>Both Kelly, 44, and Baroni, also 44, have pleaded not guilty to all charges. Their own defense could also prove uncomfortable for Christie as they have indicated they will call on witnesses who are well versed in the inner workings of the governor\u2019s administration.</p> <p>Fort Lee\u2019s traffic nightmare began on 9 September 2013 and lasted for four days. Two out of three toll lanes that had been reserved as the town\u2019s access point to the GWB \u2013 the world\u2019s busiest bridge for cars \u2013 were closed in what prosecutors allege was a vindictive act. Mayor Sokolich, a Democrat, had previously indicated he would not endorse Christie in his gubernatorial re-election bid, a stance that angered Christie\u2019s office that had been trying to present him as a genuinely bipartisan politician.</p> <p>The traffic back-up that ensued occurred in the first week of the school year, creating havoc throughout Fort Lee.</p> <p>In a now notorious email sent a month before lanes were closed, Kelly said to Wildstein: \u201cTime for some traffic problems in Fort Lee.\u201d The official replied: \u201cGot it.\u201d</p>",
  "<p><br> Donald Trump has upset Sir Cameron Mackintosh and co-creators of the stage musical Les Mis\u00e9rables for playing one of their songs at his Miami rally.</p> <p>Mackintosh, a leading British theatre impresario, is to make his objection felt in a joint statement with Alain Boublil, the musical\u2019s librettist and others who own the copyright. </p> <p>A copy released to the Guardian said: \u201cThe authors of Les Mis\u00e9rables were not asked for permission and did not authorise or endorse usage of Do You Hear the People Sing? at last [week\u2019s] Trump rally in Miami, and have never done so for any of the songs from the musical for this or any other political event.\u201d</p> <p>Les Mis\u00e9rables has broken box office records worldwide, seen by more than 70 million people in 44 countries. It is a story of \u201cbroken dreams and unrequited love, passion, sacrifice and redemption\u201d, with songs that include I Dreamed A Dream. In Miami, the Republican presidential nominee took the stage as Do You Hear the People Sing? blasted through the loudspeakers.</p> <p>Mackintosh\u2019s statement said: \u201cAs the musical\u2019s popularity and universal message have been part of international popular culture for more than 30 years now, countless political and social movements around the world, including the first Bill Clinton and Obama campaigns, have independently embraced songs from the musical as a rallying cry for their own cause.\u201d</p> <p>Trump has upset musicians before. In May, he faced <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/may/04/rolling-stones-donald-trump-songs-campaign-events\">demands by the Rolling Stones to stop playing their music at his campaign events</a>. Earlier, he faced criticism from Neil Young for using his Rockin\u2019 in the Free World. Whether Mackintosh takes legal action remains to be seen.</p> <p>The intellectual property lawyer Mark Stephens of Howard Kennedy, said politicians were supposed to clear the use of songs. Sometimes permission was obtained without disclosing it was for a political purpose and there could be a question about whether Trump\u2019s campaign said it would be used at a rally, he added. \u201cThat\u2019s where political parties very often come unstuck,\u201d Stephens said.</p> <p>Asked whether Mackintosh could potentially have a legal case against Trump, he said: \u201cAssuming that there wasn\u2019t a fully disclosed, informed consent given, then he can sue for infringement of copyright.\u201d</p> <p>The Trump campaign did not respond to a request for comment. </p> <p>Trump is among numerous politicians who have upset musicians. Bruce Springsteen objected to Ronald Reagan\u2019s attempt to use Born in the USA as a backdrop for his re-election in 1984, and Mick Fleetwood has said that Bill Clinton\u2019s campaign never sought permission for his 1992 campaign anthem, Don\u2019t Stop.</p> <p>Sometimes, however, there is harmony between musicians and politicians. The Northern Irish group D:Ream approved Tony Blair\u2019s use of Things Can Only Get Better during the Labour party\u2019s 1997 campaign.</p>",

  "<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/russia\">Russia</a>\u2019s new parliament will be overwhelmingly loyal to the Kremlin, after elections marked by a record low turnout threw up few surprises.</p> <p>With more than 93% of the votes counted on Monday morning, the United Russia party, backed by Russia\u2019s president, Vladimir Putin, and led by its prime minister, Dmitry Medvedev, had won 54% of the vote. The other three parties to clear the 5% barrier required to make it into the Duma are all broadly loyal to the Kremlin line. United Russia will take more than three-quarters of the 450 seats in the Duma.</p> <p>The communists, and the far-right nationalists of Vladimir Zhirinovsky\u2019s Liberal Democratic party took about 13% of the vote, while the liberal Yabloko party and the opposition <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/13/russian-opposition-party-regional-election-kostroma\">Parnas</a> garnered miserly returns.

United Russia candidates also dominated the direct voting, meaning that in the end they will control 76% of the seats in the new Duma, giving them the two-thirds majority required to change the constitution. The projected 343 seats for United Russia is an increase of more than 100 from the previous parliament.<br></p> <p>In recent years, the Duma has been a pliant body with little real voice, and the two MPs out of 450 who had pursued an independent line have not been re-elected. One, Ilya Ponomarev, is living in exile while the other, Dmitry Gudkov, was beaten by a United Russia candidate in a Moscow district.</p> <p>Turnout in the election was just 47%, the lowest in the history of modern Russia. In major cities, the turnout was even lower, with just 28% of eligible voters making it to the polls in Moscow. </p> <p>In Crimea, which was voting in the first parliamentary elections since annexation by Russia in 2014, turnout was also low. Only 40% of Crimeans had cast their ballots with two hours of voting remaining, and the turnout was on course to be lower than the last time Crimeans voted in Ukrainian parliamentary elections. After the widespread euphoria over rejoining Russia two years ago, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/19/crimeans-still-tigerish-over-split-with-ukraine\">life has not improved in the way many Crimeans had hoped</a>, which has led to discontent and apathy similar to that in other parts of Russia.</p> <p>The national average was boosted by some provincial regions, where officials are known to demand local residents, and especially public service workers, come out to vote.</p> <p>\u201cThe situation is tough and difficult but the people still voted for United Russia,\u201d Putin said on Sunday evening.

However, most election observers noted that the elections were much cleaner than the parliamentary elections five years ago. Then, multiple violations prompted tens of thousands of Muscovites to come out on to the streets for a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/feb/04/anti-putin-protests-moscow-russia\">season of protests</a> that lasted several months and rattled the Kremlin.</p> <p>While the day of the voting was cleaner and some opposition candidates were allowed on to the ballot, Kremlin critics say the vote is skewed from the outset given the partisan nature of state television and access to resources. However, few expect a new season of protests, after a crackdown in 2012 dissuaded many opposition-minded Russians from dissent. </p> <p>The next big election in Russia is the presidential vote, scheduled for early 2018.

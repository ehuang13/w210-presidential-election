  "<p>A few weeks ago I got a message from a university friend in Ohio. He sent me a <a href=\"http://revisionisthistory.com/episodes/01-the-lady-vanishes\">podcast interview</a> with Julia Gillard in which she detailed the misogyny she experienced as Australia\u2019s prime minister, and asked, \u201cIs it really like that over there?\u201d</p> <p>Yes. Not always. But, unfortunately, yes.</p> <p>As Americans contemplate their first female president, they are curious about how a 21st century, first-world, English-speaking nation handles its first female leader. Understandably, America is looking to Australia\u2019s very recent experience with Gillard. Culturally, the two countries share much. Also, Gillard is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/oct/21/julia-gillard-from-australias-first-female-prime-minister-to-international-superstar\">good friends</a> with Hillary Clinton and appears in her <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/20/julia-gillard-backs-hillary-clinton-us-presidential-campaign-video\">campaign material</a>. Furthermore, Gillard is also often in the US, speaking publicly, and is able to give the American media <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/27/julia-gillard-urges-americans-of-all-parties-to-defend-hillary-clinton-against-sexism\">direct insight</a> into her time in office.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/oct/24/elizabeth-warren-trump-clinton-nasty-women-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/593xf\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2836581\"            data-video-name=\"'Nasty women vote': Elizabeth Warren takes a swipe at Trump \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"Reuters\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-580e6205e4b0219a00d38178\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/10/24/161024warren_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/10/24/161024warren.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/10/24/161024warren_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/oct/24/elizabeth-warren-trump-clinton-nasty-women-video\">\u2018Nasty women vote\u2019: Elizabeth Warren takes a swipe at Trump</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>This trend has picked up pace since Clinton was endorsed at the Democratic national convention in July.

She calculated that she didn\u2019t need to confront it because it would fade. Instead, the misogyny grew stronger, louder and uglier. </p> <p>Like the proverbial frog in the pot of water, Gillard didn\u2019t recognise the environment around her was growing hotter until it boiled over. Neither did most of us \u2013 as Gillard points out now, no one was seriously calling out the insinuations, insults and jibes, and as a result the pattern of sexist attacks grew bolder and were adopted and legitimised by her political opponents. </p> <p>My university friend also asked if I, as first female premier of New South Wales, experienced the same kind of sexism that Gillard did. The answer is yes: it was different, but yes. </p> <p>For example, my Liberal opponent Barry O\u2019Farrell often described me as \u201c<a href=\"https://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/Hansard/Pages/HansardResult.aspx#/docid/HANSARD-1323879322-45695\">the Kim Kardashian of state politics</a>\u201d. Apparently my shared gender and initials with Ms Kardashian meant the TV reality star and I were one and the same, never mind what policies or experience or qualifications I brought to the job of MP, minister and premier. (Mr O\u2019Farrell also used parliament to <a href=\"https://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/Hansard/Pages/HansardResult.aspx#/docid/HANSARD-1323879322-46338\">compare</a> Carmel Tebbutt to a whining puppy and <a href=\"http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/barry-ofarrell-accused-of-racial-slur-against-indigenous-labor-frontbencher-linda-burney-20130820-2s93s.html\">to tell Linda Burney</a> she hadn\u2019t achieved her positions on merit, that she could play a hooker on a rugby league team, and to describe her as \u201ccasting her spells\u201d.) </p> <p>When I finally stood up to his Kardashian bullying, the media \u2013 who had said almost nothing about his constant belittlement \u2013 went into <a href=\"http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/keneally-keeps-up-with-kardashians-by-turning-the-jibe-on-ofarrell-20120214-1t49p.html\">meltdown</a> about how I handed it back to him.</p> <p>But I tell you what, he never did it again.</p> <p>Frankly, Australia, that we didn\u2019t stand up for our first female prime minister when the ugly strain of sexism reared its head: that\u2019s on all of us. We deserve the reputation we are gaining in America.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihd7ofrwQX0\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ihd7ofrwQX0?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Julia Gillard labels Tony Abbott a misogynist in 2012. </figcaption> </figure>   <p>Weirdly, though, Clinton might be less likely to face Gillard\u2019s fate, because of Donald Trump.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s public comments, tweets and <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-recorded-having-extremely-lewd-conversation-about-women-in-2005/2016/10/07/3b9ce776-8cb4-11e6-bf8a-3d26847eeed4_story.html\">recorded private conversations</a> are so egregiously disrespecting of women that almost no one can overlook them.

She will also have Republican opponents who will find it politically necessary between now and the congressional mid-terms to convince voters, women and men alike, that they aren\u2019t all misogynistic thugs. In short, unlike Gillard, Clinton will be able to call out the sexism when it happens.

In a year that seems ripe for third-party candidates, Libertarian Gary Johnson and Jill Stein of the Green party are seeking to capitalise but have fallen back in the polls in recent weeks.</p> <p>Sixty-one per cent of survey respondents say neither political party reflects their opinions today, while 38% disagree. Nearly eight in 10 (77%) independents and a majority (54%) of Republicans took this position, while less than half (46%) of Democrats agree. There was virtually no variation across class or race.</p> <p>Both Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton and Republican standard bearer Trump continue to suffer historically low favourability ratings, with less than half of the public viewing each candidate positively (41% v 33%). Clinton is viewed less favourably than the Democratic party (49%), but Trump\u2019s low rating is more consistent with the Republican party\u2019s own favourability (36%).</p> <p>The discontent with parties and candidates extends to the electoral process itself, which Trump claims is rigged against him.

A majority (55%) of white working class Americans endorsed the idea whereas less than a third (29%) of those with college degrees agreed.</p> <p>Jones told an <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/PRRIpoll/videos/vb.38428034839/10154587865909840/?type=2&amp;theater\">audience at the Brookings Institution</a> thinktank in Washington on Tuesday: \u201cIt fits very well with this portrait of Americans who see a very non-responsive political system to their situation. So when you feel parties aren\u2019t attuned to you, government\u2019s not attuned to you, nobody\u2019s got your back, this kind of sentiment is, I think, what you get.</p> <p>\u201cIf you get a strong leader who\u2019s coming in to shake things up \u2013 someone who\u2019s said, \u2018I\u2019m the guy. Only I can solve this problem\u2019 \u2013 I think it\u2019s appealing to this kind of sentiment. It\u2019s people who feel like the system\u2019s largely failed them.

When people feel excluded from the normal process of society, they will endorse extreme measures in order to ensure they get part of that society. There is a segment that we don\u2019t often come into contact with except through data that very much feels that way and they find Trump\u2019s authoritarian demeanour reassuring rather than frightening.\u201d</p> <p>Olsen argued it is incumbent on the election victors to listen to the views of people who think differently from them, comparing the situation with Brexit. \u201cIf the answer to our future is lean in without listening, we will eventually see a violent revolt that will shock everyone, in the way that [the leave vote] shocked Britain.\u201d</p> <p>People name terrorism as the most important issue and are closely divided on the benefits of free trade. Some 58% oppose building a wall along the Mexican border, while 41% are in favour.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s campaign was rocked earlier this month by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/07/donald-trump-leaked-recording-women\">the release of a 2005 video</a> in which he boasted about sexually assaulting women. But the PRRI\u2019s findings suggest its impact on the electorate might be less than supposed. Some 61% of people say an elected official who commits an immoral act in their personal life can still behave ethically and fulfill their duties in their public and professional life.

When it becomes clear on the timing of Article 50 and the market\u2019s perception on the relationship between UK and EU. It\u2019s a bit early to determine that.

It also comes as Carney has two months to decide whether or not to leave the BOE in 2018, or stay on until 2021, he will make a formal announcement by the end of the year.</p> <p>If Carney voices concerns about the deteriorating relationship with the government then this would be the worst outcome for the pound in our view, as the last thing an already Brexit-frazzled foreign exchange market needs now is discord between the UK authorities.

  "<p>There was something of a knife-edge feel to the news this week. Months of apprehension over the outcome of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-elections-2016\" title=\"\">US election</a> seemed to have given way to discussion about how comprehensively, rather than if, Hillary Clinton will win the presidential vote on 8 November. (Though I suspect few of us who witnessed the Brexit vote earlier this year will entirely trust the polls until the results are in.)</p> <p>In <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/calais\" title=\"\">Calais</a>, meanwhile, thousands of refugees and migrants boarded buses destined for other parts of France as the port\u2019s infamous Jungle camp was due to be demolished. And a short distance to the east, in Brussels, representatives of the EU and Canada agonised over a bilateral trade deal, seven years in the negotiating, which looked like it might be completely derailed by a Belgian province over concerns about the market for pork products.</p> <p>In Iraq, where an uneasy alliance of regional factions advanced on the Islamic State stronghold of Mosul, there was also a feeling of distraction, as though all parties were already contemplating battles to come rather than those at hand. Our cover story this week concerns one such force, the Kurdish fighters known as the peshmerga, who have returned to reclaim the lands they lost to Isis two years ago and who now dream of building their own nation state in fragile northern Iraq. From outside Mosul, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/martin-chulov\" title=\"\">Martin Chulov</a> reports.</p> <p>In Nigeria, a controversial music video shone a revealing light on growing cultural tensions between the country\u2019s Muslim and Christian populations. There\u2019s better news from Kenya, which is making strong progress in enabling better lives for its young people, but less encouraging dispatches from Ethiopia and Venezuela, where respective governments have been flexing their muscles to suppress citizens\u2019 protests.</p> <p>Elsewhere we visit Gibraltar, the British financial services enclave that faces an uncertain future after Brexit. And from the UK a Guardian investigation has resulted in a tax office investigation into the rights of vulnerable workers employed in the so-called gig economy.</p> <p>The Weekly Review hears from Mexico, where a trio of female rap musicians are spearheading a popular fightback against a wave of violent crimes against women. We get down and muddy at an Australian country truck festival, and hear about the Arctic cities where melting permafrost is structurally undermining many buildings.</p> <p>Culture has an interview with the willowy Australian actor Elizabeth Debicki, on the fast track to prominence after having stolen the show in the recent BBC TV adaptation of John Le Carre\u2019s The Night Manager. There\u2019s also a revealing glimpse of the unexpectedly eclectic architecture of Tehran.</p> <p>Rugby league aficionados (I know there will be many of you among our southern hemisphere readers) may enjoy an interview on our Sports pages with England captain Sam Burgess, a star of the game\u2019s Australian NRL competition.</p> <p>To round things off, Gaby Hinsliff laments the demise of good old-fashioned cash in favour of ubiquitous digital payments. In fact, when all\u2019s added up, I\u2019d be willing to wager a small sum that you\u2019ll find this week\u2019s paper another compelling read.

The most benign interpretation of the appeal of Donald Trump\u2019s campaign slogan \u201cMake America great again\u201d is the mourning of those certainties \u2013 jobs, benefits, pension \u2013 that came with these machines. \u201cI was fascinated by the idea of nature taking over these once great industrial structures that have been left abandoned in Muncie,\u201d writes David. </p> <p>But Muncie, as many are keen to point out here, may be down but it is not out. \u201cThe companies that are part of the manufacturing economy are smaller and don\u2019t all have the big names like BorgWarner, Chevrolet, Exide, Ball etc,\u201d explained Brad Hanauer, who works for a small lithium ion battery company, in an email. \u201cBut companies continue to locate and invest here because of the manufacturing know-how that is concentrated in this region.\u201d I\u2019ll be speaking to Brad in the coming weeks to find out more.</p> <p>Meanwhile, like the<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/membership/2016/oct/18/view-from-middletown-us-muncie-america\"> Lynds</a> before me, I am becoming embedded in life here. I have a social life I can barely keep up with. Last week I spoke to some community college students about my project and heard their views on teenage life in Muncie \u2013 most, predictably, wanted to leave for somewhere bigger. This week I\u2019m talking to university students. </p> <p>Sunday was my wedding anniversary. My wife found out from one of the contacts I\u2019d interviewed where I would be \u2013 at the Urban Light church \u2013 and managed to get flowers delivered. Pastor Andrew called me to the front and presented me with them, commiserating for not being able to spend the moment with my family.</p> <p>In the next instalment, I ask what it is about Donald Trump that keeps his supporters loyal \u2013 and is there anything he could do, at this stage, to shake their support for him?</p> <p>You can <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/membership/ng-interactive/2016/oct/11/view-middletown-gary-younge-us-presidential-election\">catch up on the project in full here</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/membership/2016/oct/11/us-election-gary-younge-muncie-indiana\">share your thoughts or recommendations here</a> and <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/events/183617795414091/\">get involved on Facebook</a> here.</p> <p><strong>Gary Younge</strong><br>editor-at-large <br>The Guardian</p>",
  "<p>Back in August, when Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump began <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/31/donald-trump-tv-media-empire-ailes\">consulting with Roger Ailes</a> and hired <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/17/donald-trump-stephen-bannon-breitbart-news-kellyanne-conway\">Breitbart CEO Stephen Bannon</a> to head his campaign, it was widely seen as Trump\u2019s first move in shifting his focus away from actually running for president and instead leveraging his name into a media empire. His son-in-law <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/18/us/politics/donald-trump-tv-jared-kushner.html\">Jared Kushner\u2019s recent overtures</a> to LionTree, a bank with a history of media investments, has only furthered that speculation.</p> <p>But what if a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/24/trump-tv-facebook-live-us-election-media-tomi-lahren\">Trump News Network</a> is just one part of the master plan? What if, in addition to a new Trump media empire, he\u2019s preparing his followers to coalesce into a brand-new Trump political party?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/21/political-third-parties-spoilers-abolitionists-movement\">Third parties aren't 'spoilers'. They're at the cutting edge of democracy | Kevin Zeese</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There are historical analogues that point toward to the short-term viability of the idea. Despite the fact that our two-party system has had a lock on electoral politics since the 1790s, there have always been third parties \u2013 this year there are <a href=\"https://ballotpedia.org/Presidential_election_in_Colorado,_2016\">22 presidential candidates</a> on the Colorado ballot.</p> <p>The 1850s saw the rise of the American Party, better known as the \u201cKnow Nothings,\u201d that were staunchly anti-immigrant and anti-Catholic. In 1856, their standard bearer, former president Millard Fillmore, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/aug/18/donald-trump-immigration-know-nothing-dangerous-republicans\">garnered 22% of the vote</a>.</p> <p>The danger in a new Know Nothing party under Trump isn\u2019t that he\u2019ll run again \u2013 though that\u2019s the certainly not off the table \u2013 it\u2019s the damage they might do in the 2018 midterm elections.</p> <p>Trump has convinced his most ardent supporters that this year\u2019s presidential contest is rigged. Well, in 1876, the election actually was rigged, and the aftermath of that contest sheds light on what could happen in America in the next few years.</p> <p>The 1876 election pitted New York\u2019s Democratic governor, Samuel J Tilden, against Rutherford B Hayes, the former Republican governor of Ohio. On election night, some southern states, including Florida and Louisiana, <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=wUMiCwAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA40&amp;dq=tilden%20florida%20south%20carolina&amp;pg=PA40#v=onepage&amp;q=tilden%20florida%20south%20carolina&amp;f=false\">tried to throw the election to Hayes</a>, even though it was clear that Tilden was winning. Moreover, when the electoral college met in December, three states submitted fraudulent returns, which meant that neither candidate had a majority. Ultimately, a special Election Commission voted 7-6 along party lines to appoint Hayes to the presidency.</p> <p>Not surprisingly, there was widespread <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=tshkbytuaM4C&amp;lpg=PT62&amp;dq=disgust%201876%20election&amp;pg=PT62#v=onepage&amp;q=disgust%201876%20election&amp;f=false\">disgust</a> both with the election and \u201cthe seemingly endless procession of scandals emanating from the nation\u2019s capital\u201d. This could easily describe the mood of voters today on both sides of the aisle.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/24/muslim-american-i-will-vote-my-conscience-by-abstaining\">As a Muslim-American, I will vote my conscience this November. By abstaining | Qanta Ahmed</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Two years later, in the 1878 midterm elections, Americans showed their dissatisfaction with \u201cpolitics as usual\u201d by voting in 13 members of <a href=\"http://www.u-s-history.com/pages/h212.html\">the populist Greenback Party</a> to the House of Representatives. The party hoped to reform both the American financial system and the country\u2019s labor laws. While 13 congressmen doesn\u2019t seem like many, it was nearly 14% of the national vote. Not only did both Democrats and Republicans lose seats \u2013 the rise of the Greenbacks meant any hope Hayes had of gaining traction in congress was lost.</p> <p>More recently, look at the reaction in 1964 after Lyndon Johnson cruised to an unprecedented victory over Barry Goldwater. Republican stalwarts complained that the press had been <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=v5X0PYgrjc4C&amp;lpg=PA156&amp;dq=bias%20against%20goldwater%201964%20shaffer&amp;pg=PA154#v=onepage&amp;q=bias%20against%20goldwater%201964%20shaffer&amp;f=false\">biased against Goldwater from the start</a>, and many pundits saw LBJ\u2019s victory as the death knell for the Republican party. </p> <p>But a funny thing happened in the midterm elections of 1966. Rather than repudiate Goldwater conservatism, the Republicans used it to increase their power in Congress. While they didn\u2019t capture control of either chamber from the Democrats, enough Republicans were elected to put the brakes on <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=-8ItjzFZB6sC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=busch%20horses%20in%20midstream&amp;pg=PA100#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false\">Johnson implementing his Great Society programs</a>.</p> <p>Picture what could happen in 2018 if a Trump Party \u2013 its voters fueled by a 24-hour-a-day Trump News Network \u2013 makes significant inroads in the House. It will make the Tea Party\u2019s resistance to Barack Obama seem tame by comparison. The Tea Party, at its heart, is about Constitutional originalism and has generally operated within the framework of the Republican party.<br></p> <p>A Trump Party will have no such strictures. Since Donald Trump doesn\u2019t seem to understand the Constitution or care about the Republican brand, it\u2019s likely a Trump Party won\u2019t have any qualms about simply blowing up Washington and watching it burn \u2013 while all of it is gleefully covered on Trump News. </p> <p>Some have argued that Trump\u2019s presidential campaign is <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/01/donald-trump-2016-brand-business-213515\">damaging his brand</a>. But that\u2019s only true if his goal was to return to being a real estate developer/reality TV host after the election. </p> <p>Imagine a Trump Party that first makes significant inroads in 2018 in congress, and then runs a presidential candidate in 2020 \u2013 could this third party candidate restrict Hillary Clinton to just one term? Both Rutherford Hayes and Lyndon Johnson declined to seek renomination. Could a Trump Party make it so difficult for her to govern that she simply throws in the towel?</p> <p>If that\u2019s the case, Trump will have vaulted himself from being a New York City real estate tycoon to a major figure in American political history. And while politics in Washington will grow even more polarized, Trump\u2019s legacy will be secured, which is the only thing he truly cares about.</p>",
  "<p>If only it were Elizabeth Warren on the brink of taking the White House.

Instead, the racism and bigotry that infests significant swathes of the country has been distilled into human form and paraded for a global audience. Hillary Clinton is the only means to stop the victory of a candidate who could send the last remaining superpower hurtling into a political death spiral.

But Warren is unapologetically in the tradition of courageous Americans who confront elites and stand up for the rights and freedoms of the average citizen. She has, naturally, been abused by the horror show that is Trump: because she claims Native American heritage, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/jun/11/donald-trump-repeatedly-elizabeth-warren-pocahontas-us-election-presidential-video\">he calls her \u201cPocahontas\u201d</a>.</p> <p>Despite the earlier hopes of many American progressives, it will not be Warren in the White House next year. But both Warren and Sanders have risen to prominence for a reason. Growing numbers of Americans are disenchanted with a society where so much wealth exists alongside so much insecurity. Trump \u2013 although sadly not Trumpism \u2013 will almost certainly be defeated at the polls by the decent American majority next month. But President Clinton may swiftly find herself under pressure from an emboldened progressive movement \u2013 one with very little patience.</p>",

But the polls in general look good \u2013 look great \u2013 for her. <strong>Clinton hit 53% support</strong> in ABC News\u2019 tracking poll at the weekend, while Trump averages 41.5% support nationally.

He thinks that because he has a mouthful of Tic Tacs he can force himself on any woman within groping distance.\u201d<br></p> <p>Warren\u2019s comments referred to the publication earlier this month of an Access Hollywood <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/07/donald-trump-leaked-recording-women\">recording from 2005</a> that captured Trump bragging that he could kiss and grope women without their consent because he is a \u201cstar\u201d. \u201cI better use some Tic Tacs just in case I start kissing her,\u201d Trump says on the tape. \u201cYou know, I\u2019m automatically attracted to beautiful \u2013 I just start kissing them. It\u2019s like a magnet. Just kiss. I don\u2019t even wait. And when you\u2019re a star, they let you do it. You can do anything ... Grab \u2019em by the pussy.\u201d</p> <p>The Republican candidate has denied claims from nearly a dozen alleged victims who have come forward since the emergence of the recording of him boasting of groping women.<br></p> <p>Though once tipped as a leftwing alternative to Clinton, Warren has become a loyal stalwart for the campaign after her early attacks on Trump seemed to provoke him.</p> <p>\u201cShe gets under his thin skin like nobody else,\u201d Clinton said of Warren as she began her speech. \u201cI expect if Donald heard what she said he\u2019s tweeting like mad.\u201d</p> <p>On the campaign trail, Warren, the so-called scourge of Wall Street, has furiously attacked Trump, who has nicknamed her \u201cPocahontas\u201d, a reference to her claim of Native American ancestry, and \u201cGoofy Liz Warren\u201d. During a speech in Cincinnati, she fired back: \u201cYou want to see \u2018goofy\u2019? Look at him in that hat.\u201d</p> <p>Warren, a progressive power player who the Clinton campaign fretted might cast her support behind Bernie Sanders in the primary, has become one of her sharpest attack dogs on the trail. She withheld her endorsement until after Clinton was the clear victor in the Democratic primary.</p> <p>Facing a rising populist tide led by Sanders on the left, Clinton\u2019s staff and allies carefully plotted how to \u201csurvive\u201d what they called the \u201cWarren primary\u201d, ie one dominated by the issues pushed by Warren and Sanders such as regulating Wall Street, according to hacked campaign emails published by WikiLeaks.</p> <p>The campaign has not verified the authenticity of the emails and has called the hack <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/11/clinton-campaign-wikileaks-hack-russia-donald-trump\">a partisan attack</a> intended to sway the election.

Democrats have their eye on taking back the Senate, and losing Warren would have hurt their chances. In Massachusetts, the governor appoints the temporary replacement if a senator steps down, and he is currently a Republican, Charlie Baker.</p> <p>Instead, Warren and her deep bench of allies are working to push the progressive agenda both publicly and privately, said Adam Green, co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee.</p> <p>\u201cElizabeth Warren is an agenda-setter and she\u2019s shown during the election that she\u2019s a very powerful ally to have on your side,\u201d Green said. \u201cBut she\u2019s also a powerful person to have against you and therefore all the incentives point towards partnering with Elizabeth Warren on key appointments and setting the policy agenda so that everybody\u2019s fighting in the same direction.\u201d</p> <p>There was no initial response to Clinton and Warren\u2019s remarks from Trump, who spoke later in Florida, but there are increasing signs of panic within his campaign, which is now up to 12 points behind in some polls since the Access Hollywood tape emerged.</p> <p>Instead, the Republican nominee added opinion pollsters to the long line of people to blame for his ailing presidential campaign, accusing Democrats of \u201cmaking up phony polls\u201d and the press of refusing to highlight the handful of less reputable pollsters still showing a tighter race.</p> <p>\u201cWe are winning and the press is refusing to report it. Don\u2019t let them fool you \u2013 get out and vote!\u201d he tweeted on Monday. \u201cMajor story that the Dems are making up phony polls in order to suppress the the Trump [sic]. We are going to WIN!\u201d</p> <p>Even the Republican\u2019s campaign manager has acknowledged he is \u201cbehind\u201d and facing a number of structural disadvantages against the well-organised and well-financed Clinton campaign.</p> <p>But Trump himself has struck a defiant tone, refusing to say whether he would accept the result on 8 November if it shows him losing and claiming \u2013 without evidence \u2013 that voter fraud is widespread. </p> <p>With just two weeks to go until polling day, campaigning hit a new intensity on Monday.

Michelle Obama is due to return to the stage later this week, appearing alongside Clinton for the first time, in Winston Salem, North Carolina.</p> <p>Barack Obama attacked Trump\u2019s fellow Republicans on Sunday during a speech in Las Vegas in which he questioned why they were only now choosing to distance themselves from his campaign.</p> <p>\u201cThey just stood by and said nothing.

The 2004 election, which saw George W Bush re-elected despite the mounting unpopularity of the Iraq war, saw an explosion of unfounded conspiracy theories that Republicans were in cahoots with the manufacturers of electronic voting machines and would never lose an election again. (The theory fell apart as soon as Democrats retook control of the House of Representatives two years later.)</p> <p>This year, a hard core of Bernie Sanders supporters remains convinced that the senator from Vermont was cheated out of the Democratic presidential nomination by the underhanded maneuvering of the Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee \u2013 despite the fact that Clinton <a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-system-isnt-rigged-against-sanders/\">won 3m more primary votes</a>.</p> <p>American history is hardly lacking in examples of real voter manipulation and electoral skullduggery, especially in the segregation-era deep south. To this day, the US electoral system is widely viewed as an <a href=\"http://kimalex.blogspot.com/2004/12/jimmy-carter-on-npr-air.html\">anomaly</a> in the western world because of persistent problems with the reliability of its voting machinery, frequent bureaucratic incompetence, the lack of uniform standards from state to state or even county to county, the systematic exclusion of <a href=\"http://www.sentencingproject.org/issues/felony-disenfranchisement/\">more than 6 million felons</a> and<strong> </strong>ex-prisoners, and the tendency of election officials to adopt rules that benefit their party over democracy itself.</p> <p>Until 2000, though, these issues were not widely aired in public. Then the battle over Florida ripped a veil off a dysfunctional system and offered an opportunity not just for meaningful electoral reform \u2013 a slow and frustrating process \u2013 but also for new forms of political warfare unseen since the darkest days of the segregation era in which the electoral process itself became fair game, particularly for the Republicans.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7457c2bbdb7242882d04cec113b8c9a50a47473c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7457c2bbdb7242882d04cec113b8c9a50a47473c/0_0_2048_1229/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Attorney Nicole Pollard, Judge Charles Burton and attorney John Bolton review questionable ballots for the 2000 presidential election in Florida.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Attorney Nicole Pollard, Judge Charles Burton and attorney John Bolton review questionable ballots for the 2000 presidential election in Florida.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rhona Wise/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It began, perhaps, when the hand recount of punch card ballots requested by Al Gore and the Democrats \u2013 something both parties had routinely pressed for in previous contested elections \u2013 was recast by many leading Republicans in their talking points as a form of \u201c<a href=\"http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0011/22/ip.00.html\">slow-motion grand larceny</a>\u201d.</p> <p>Then, in Missouri, Republican Senator Kit Bond took one look at African American voters in overcrowded precincts in St Louis casting ballots beyond the official poll closing time \u2013 something that has since become standard practice in many states \u2013 and denounced what he called a \u201c<a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/story?id=122543\">major criminal enterprise</a>\u201d.</p> <p>Soon, a narrative took hold that Democrats were habitual vote-stealers \u2013 something that was indubitably true in the days of Boss Tweed in 1860s New York but now took the form of a racist dog-whistle because the voters under most suspicion were black or Latino.

  "<p>AT&amp;T, the US\u2019s second largest wireless telecommunications company, agreed to acquire media powerhouse Time Warner over the weekend <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/oct/22/att-buy-time-warner-donald-trump\">in a deal worth $85bn</a>.</p> <p>One of the largest acquisitions of all time, the deal brings together Time Warner\u2019s content brands including HBO, CNN and Warner Bros with AT&amp;T\u2019s portfolio of mobile, broadband and satellite TV services \u2013 the company has more than 130 million mobile phone customers and 25 million pay-TV subscribers through DirecTV.</p> <p>AT&amp;T\u2019s CEO Randall Stephenson said the deal would enable the two companies to move quicker and operate better in a world where people increasingly access content on their mobile devices.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/oct/22/att-buy-time-warner-donald-trump\">AT&amp;T agrees to buy Time Warner for $85bn as Trump slams deal</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThe world of distribution and content is converging, and we need to move fast, and if we want to do something truly unique, begin to curate content differently, begin to format content differently for these mobile environments, and this is all about mobility,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Gartner analyst Akshay Sharma said the deal was about AT&amp;T trying to become smarter. \u201cInstead of being a dumb pipe provider, now it\u2019s all about content and user experience,\u201d he said. </p> <p>However, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/23/trump-att-time-warner-deal-clinton-kaine\">critics were concerned</a> that the deal could lead to less consumer choice, higher prices and a threat to media plurality. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump said that it would give the combined company \u201ctoo much concentration of power\u201d and that he would block the deal if he wins next month\u2019s election.</p> <p>But what does it mean for consumers?</p> <h2>Pricing problems</h2> <p>A key concern is whether the newly merged company might use its huge distribution network (the customers of DirecTV and its wireless and broadband services) to give an unfair advantage to its own content, delivering it in a way that is faster or more accessible than competitor content. This would, of course, violate the <a href=\"https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/02/zero-rating-what-it-is-why-you-should-care\">principle of net neutrality</a>, whereby internet service providers should not favor or block any particular products or websites. </p> <p>AT&amp;T has form for this. It already offers <a href=\"http://www.fiercewireless.com/wireless/at-t-mobility-ceo-lurie-defends-carrier-s-directv-zero-rating-no-regulatory-concerns\">AT&amp;T wireless customers the ability to watch DirecTV without it counting against their data plan</a>. This \u201czero-rating\u201d strategy means it\u2019s cheaper to stream DirecTV than it is to use other services. Following the Time Warner deal, AT&amp;T could extend this zero rating to Game of Thrones, Harry Potter movies or NFL football on TNT. That\u2019s good news for AT&amp;T customers but could be seen to give its own service an unfair advantage over competitors such as Dish Network\u2019s Sling TV or on-demand services such as Netflix and Hulu, unless they pay AT&amp;T to have their own zero-rating deal.</p> <p>\u201cWhether it\u2019s channel position or recommendations on your home screen, the distributor certainly has the technical capability to give their own content more visibility than their competitors if they are left to do so,\u201d said analyst Jim Nail of Forrester Research.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/oct/24/att-time-warner-merger-shares-fall-investors\">AT&amp;T and Time Warner shares fall as investors' doubts over merger grow</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The end result is that it becomes harder for other content providers to compete for end users\u2019 attention. In the long run this could mean less competition altogether, which could lead to higher prices. </p> <p>Not everyone agrees. \u201cIn reality, regulatory constraints mean that it is almost impossible to use vertically owned content to the advantage of distribution, and it is equally impossible to use captive distribution to the advantage of vertically owned content,\u201d analyst Craig Moffett said.</p> <h2>A less clunky experience between devices</h2> <p>This type of deal should allow AT&amp;T to create a better user experience as they access content across multiple devices, whether that\u2019s their cellphone, tablet or TV \u2013 an experience that has traditionally been clunky and painful for users.</p> <p>\u201cThey can connect the dots as the content flows from the big screen to the laptop to smartphone or tablet,\u201d Sharma said. AT&amp;T will be able to data mine a person\u2019s location, devices and behaviour in order to provide the right content at the right time in a more efficient way. </p> <p>\u201cIt makes for a more holistic user experience that could lead to consumer-friendly innovations.\u201d</p> <h2>More targeted advertising</h2> <p>Like it or not, advertising helps fund most of the content we consume. The merger of AT&amp;T and Time Warner could mean more granularity to ad targeting. AT&amp;T has already launched addressable TV advertising, where different households watching the same program will see different commercials, through DirecTV. This approach could be extended throughout all of the new company\u2019s offerings and across platforms. </p> <p>\u201cI know ads are painful to watch sometimes, but it\u2019s necessary because it pays the bills. More contextual advertising means the doctor might get the ad for Mercedes or BMW while the child might see Pepsi, Coca-Cola or video game ads,\u201d Sharma said. </p>",
  "<p>Not since the communist era has a Polish government faced as much criticism from the west as the one in charge today. It is now exactly a year since Law and Justice (PiS), a socially conservative, Eurosceptic and nationalist party, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/27/poland-law-justice-party-wins-235-seats-can-govern-alone\" title=\"\">swept to power</a>, winning a parliamentary majority with 37.5% of the vote. This followed the triumph of PiS\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/andrzej-duda\" title=\"\">Andrzej Duda</a> in the earlier presidential election, giving the party full control over Poland\u2019s executive arm of government.</p> <p>Since then, the ruling party has come under <a href=\"http://www.politico.eu/article/poland-democracy-failing-pis-law-and-justice-media-rule-of-law/\" title=\"\">heavy fire</a> from <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/rule-no-1-for-polands-new-right-wing-government-ignore-the-critics/2016/02/14/d3e5124a-c9bb-11e5-b9ab-26591104bb19_story.html\" title=\"\">western media</a> and institutions, which have accused it of dismantling democracy with policies designed to limit civil liberties, control media, politicise the civil service and <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-03-11/polish-government-battles-to-blunt-critical-rule-of-law-report\" title=\"\">neuter judicial independence</a>. In July this year, the European commission issued Warsaw with a three-month ultimatum to address threats to the rule of law or face potential sanctions. PiS reacted scornfully, with party leader Jaros\u0142aw Kaczy\u0144ski calling the <a href=\"http://www.politico.eu/article/polish-leader-commission-criticism-amuses-me-jaroslaw-kaczynski-beyong-eu-treaty-power/\" title=\"\">commission\u2019s ultimatum \u201camusing\u201d</a>. Kaczy\u0144ski has also been widely criticised in Europe for claiming migrants arriving on the continent <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/oct/24/law-and-justice-poland-putin-russia\" title=\"\">could cause \u201cepidemics\u201d</a> due to \u201cvarious parasites and protozoa, which don\u2019t affect their organisms, but which could be dangerous here\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/05/polish-government-performs-u-turn-on-total-abortion-ban\">Poland's abortion ban proposal near collapse after mass protests</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Yet, despite the barrage of critical opinions from the western world, which Poles have historically aspired to, PiS remains the most popular party in Poland, <a href=\"http://www.parlamentarny.pl/sondaze/cbos-pis-z-38-proc-poparciem-nowoczesna-16-proc-po-15-proc,115.html\" title=\"\">currently polling at 38%</a>, which is higher than the combined support of all other parliamentary parties put together. There are several reasons for this, revealing dynamics observable not only in the wider eastern European region, but further west as well.</p> <p>While PiS is strongly rightwing on social issues, its economic approach can be described as leftist. It emphasises the need to tackle inequality and propagates strong welfare policies. It introduced unconditional monthly cash payments equivalent to \u00a3100 for all parents who have more than one child towards the upkeep of each subsequent child until he or she is 18. So if you have three children, you get \u00a3200 per month and so forth. For parents with one child, the payment is conditional on low income.</p> <p>No previous government ever embarked on such a generous social programme. PiS\u2019s approach puts many Polish leftists in a bind. On the one hand, they deplore the party\u2019s unashamedly xenophobic rhetoric; on the other, they like its economic views, especially in comparison to the main opposition parties, Civic Platform and Nowoczesna, both dominated by folk still enamoured with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_Hayek\" title=\"\">Hayek</a>. In effect, some on Poland\u2019s left are not as mobilised against PiS as they could be.</p> <p>While the west may have considered post-communist Poland a model of free-market success, many Poles felt marginalised in a society where successive governments espoused a \u201csink or swim\u201d attitude towards citizens, irrespective of whether it was the left or the right in power. Individual success was emphasised above all. PiS\u2019s more communitarian approach is appealing to many Poles who feel they now have a government interested in more than just macro-economic indicators.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"877a7f5cf416e0a7e6c164c42dcb0473106b7a6f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/877a7f5cf416e0a7e6c164c42dcb0473106b7a6f/0_0_2211_2497/885.jpg\" alt=\"A poster of Jaros\u0142aw Kaczy\u0144ski\" width=\"885\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Jaros\u0142aw Kaczy\u0144ski has been widely criticised in Europe for claiming migrants arriving on the continent could cause \u2018epidemics\u2019.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kacper Pempel/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A second factor in PiS\u2019s continued popularity is that western Europe, where most criticism of the ruling party stems from, is now viewed far more critically than before by many Poles. PiS and its&#xa0;rightwing media allies are successfully&#xa0;portraying it&#xa0;as a den of politically correct madness, where hopelessly naive policies have put Europeans at increased risk of Islamic terrorism and being overrun by migrants.&#xa0;</p> <p>EU elites are portrayed as fanatical multiculturalists and secularists who are furious that a traditionally oriented, non-politically correct government is in control of Poland. Meanwhile, Kaczy\u0144ski insists: \u201cIt is completely untrue that to achieve western levels of development, we have to adopt their social models. That is hogwash.\u201d He insists Poland can achieve western-level economic development while maintaining age-old traditional Polish values and remaining a homogenous white Catholic country. In an age when much of Europe is facing an identity crisis, this message is resonating.</p> <p>A few years ago, no Polish government would have been able to get away with openly defying EU institutions without losing credibility domestically. But western opinion no longer has that kind of influence in Poland, especially among the numerically dominant conservatives. This is one of the most significant mental shifts in contemporary Poland and signals a new era in societal attitudes towards the west, one in which its economic development remains admired, but its cosmopolitan liberal values are largely rejected.</p> <p>PiS also remains popular because while Kaczy\u0144ski is highly controversial and generally disliked, the official faces of the government, Beata Szyd\u0142o, the prime minister, &#xa0;and Duda, the president,&#xa0;are both personable unassuming types who help the party maintain a folksy image. There is currently no leftist party in parliament and the liberal opposition is weak and divided. Moreover, both opposition party leaders, Grzegorz Schetyna of Civic Platform and Ryszard Petru of Nowoczesna, are nauseatingly opportunistic, the kind of politicians who won\u2019t take a public stance on any issue till they\u2019ve seen at least half a dozen opinion polls. People are sick of sly, calculating politicos; these days people value authenticity, even if they disagree with their views. PiS employs crude rhetoric, but comes across as authentic.</p> <p>Barring any major political or economic earthquakes, PiS will likely rule Poland for a while to come, providing momentum to the generally Eurosceptic, illiberal and authoritarian tendencies currently triumphing in eastern Europe. Its success should serve as a warning bell to liberals and leftists in the whole of Europe. A growing number of people are becoming increasingly willing to tolerate authoritarian and xenophobic tendencies from parties that offer them a sense of community and security.</p> <p>Ignoring this reality won\u2019t make it go away. On the contrary, if we don\u2019t respond adequately to this dynamic, we might all soon wake up in a Europe where parties similar to PiS have suddenly become the mainstream.</p>"

The suit demands unspecified compensatory damages.</p> <p>According to the complaint, Phillip \u201cproduced a pistol, put his right index finger on the trigger, and drove the barrel into Vincent\u2019s knee cap\u201d during a car trip to check on volunteers in Greenville, South Carolina in February:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Phillip pushed the barrel into Vincent\u2019s knee.

  "<p>In a fiery speech that sharply criticized her opponent\u2019s economic vision for the US, Hillary Clinton said Donald Trump\u2019s proposals will only benefit the rich, while destroying the economy in tandem.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Speaking before hundreds of union workers and supporters on Thursday, Clinton positioned her plan as a boon for the middle class, with a pledge to curry support in Congress for the largest investment in \u201cgood-paying jobs\u201d since the second world war by rebuilding infrastructure across the nation.</p> <p>\u201cWe will put Americans to work, building and modernizing our roads, our bridges, our tunnels, our railways, our ports, our airports,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are way overdue for this, my friends. We are living off the investments that were made by our parents\u2019 and grandparents\u2019 generations.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/08/donald-trump-tax-plan-business-income-middle-class\">Trump\u2019s plan</a>, by contrast, doesn\u2019t offer any \u201ccredible solutions to the very real economic challenges we face\u201d, she said.<br></p> <p>\u201cHe would give trillions in tax cuts to corporations \u2026 that would explode our national debt and eventually lead to massive cuts in priorities like education, healthcare and environmental protection,\u201d Clinton said.</p> <p>Clinton\u2019s campaign said her plan would add more than 10m jobs across the US. It would include employment opportunities for outgoing prison inmates and youth, as well as billions of dollars for infrastructure projects. Despite embracing a more upbeat view of the nation\u2019s outlook compared to her opponent, Clinton noted that income inequality has continued to increase in recent years.</p> <p>\u201cIt is just too hard to get ahead today,\u201d she said. \u201cBut there are commonsense things that your government can do that would give Americans more opportunities to succeed. Why don\u2019t we do it? Because powerful special interests and the tendency to put ideology ahead of political progress have led to gridlock in Congress.\u201d</p> <p>Clinton\u2019s 50-minute speech in south-east Michigan followed an economic policy rollout on Monday by her opponent \u2013 whose remarks in Detroit were <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/08/donald-trump-tax-plan-business-income-middle-class\">interrupted more than a dozen times</a> by protesters. Trump\u2019s subdued speech (by his standards) took repeated shots at Clinton, in particular by saying her \u201cfailed\u201d economic agenda is indicative of problems in Detroit, which emerged from municipal bankruptcy just under two years ago. </p> <p>The former secretary of state vehemently pushed back against Trump on Thursday, saying his plan is a rehashed playbook of trickle-down economics, and will only benefit millionaires and billionaires. In particular, she dubbed one aspect of her opponent\u2019s plan as the \u201cTrump loophole\u201d: a proposal to slash income taxes for corporations by more than half.</p> <p>\u201cIt would allow him to pay less than half the current tax rate in income for many of his companies,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019d pay a lower rate than millions of middle class families.\u201d One analyst, she noted, said Trump\u2019s plan would be a \u201creally nice deal \u2013 for Donald Trump\u201d.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s proposal to eliminate the estate tax, which applies to estates larger than $5.45m for individuals, would also shore up his family\u2019s finances, Clinton said.</p> <p>\u201cThat alone would save the Trump family $4bn,\u201d she claimed. \u201cIt would do nothing for 99.8% of Americans. So they\u2019d get a $4bn tax cut, and 99.8% of Americans would get nothing. Just think of what we could do with those four billion.\u201d</p> <p>The Democratic nominee\u2019s speech didn\u2019t highlight new significant economic proposals, instead taking aim at Trump\u2019s pledge for immense deregulation, including a temporary moratorium on federal agency rules. She said Trump\u2019s plan would eliminate regulations that \u201cstop polluters from poisoning the air our children breathe, and the water we drink\u201d. In Michigan, the city of Flint has been reeling from a <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/flint-water-crisis\">two-year water contamination crisis</a>, an issue Clinton has repeatedly highlighted on the campaign trail this year.</p> <p>\u201cNow there is a myth out there that he will stick it to the rich and powerful because, somehow, he\u2019s really on the side of the little guy,\u201d she said. \u201cDon\u2019t believe it. Not when he pledges to rip up basic rules that hold corporations accountable.\u201d</p> <p>She also hit back on Trump\u2019s intense criticism to US trade deals supported by Barack Obama and former president Bill Clinton.</p> <p>\u201cIt is too often that past trade deals have been sold to the American people with rosy scenarios that did not pan out,\u201d she said. But the answer, she added, isn\u2019t to \u201crant or rave and cut ourselves off from the world\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThat would end up killing even more jobs; the answer is to finally make trade work for us, not against us,\u201d she said. \u201cSo my message to every worker in Michigan and across America is this: I will stop any trade deal that kills jobs or holds down wages, including the Trans-Pacific Partnership.\u201d</p> <p>Clinton\u2019s trade remarks were, perhaps, the latest in a move to appeal to progressives who remain skeptical of her policy stances, following the exit of Senator Bernie Sanders from the Democratic presidential race. In public, Clinton\u2019s support for the TPP has wavered since last fall, when she <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/oct/07/hillary-clinton-opposes-trans-pacific-partnership-tpp\">broke from the Obama administration</a> and came out against the 12-country deal. Still, last month, Clinton ally and Virginia governor Terry McAuliffe said he believes the candidate will support TPP, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2016/07/terry-mcauliffe-hillary-clinton-tpp-trade-226253\">albeit with some changes</a>. </p> <p>Political observers viewed the stop in Macomb County \u2013 famous for producing so-called \u201cReagan Democrats\u201d, who propelled the former president\u2019s candidacy in the 1980s \u2013 as a sign of Clinton mounting the beginnings of a competitive campaign in Michigan.</p> <p>Clinton showed signs of weakness in the primary, when Sanders <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/mar/08/bernie-sanders-wins-michigan-primary-hillary-clinton\">dramatically won </a> by a nail-biting 1.5%. But local officials believe that, despite an expected close race in Michigan, Clinton has turned a corner.</p> <p>Ed Bruley, chairman of the Macomb County Democratic party, <a href=\"http://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/politics/2016/08/10/clinton-targets-trump-battleground-macomb-county/88546956/\">told the Detroit News</a> that Clinton was \u201coutworked in the primary but she\u2019s making the right moves now\u201d by focusing on the middle class and economic policies. </p> <p>\u201cI think it\u2019s going to be close. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a walk-away,\u201d he told the newspaper of the Clinton-Trump race in Macomb County. \u201cBut I think Clinton is doing the right stuff. By coming here, she\u2019s demonstrating that she\u2019s committed.\u201d Clinton opened up a near double-digit lead on Trump <a href=\"http://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/politics/2016/08/03/poll-clinton-leads-trump-michigan/88048440/\">in recent state polls</a>.</p> <p>Clinton\u2019s state campaign shouldn\u2019t relax a moment, though, said Michigan\u2019s former Democratic governor James Blanchard.</p> <p>\u201cI once won an election by 70% and I didn\u2019t know I was going to do that until the day after. I once lost an election by a quarter of a point and everyone told me I was going to win by 20. So you really have to be careful on polls,\u201d Blanchard said. </p> <p>The former governor and US congressman said the close primary race in Michigan with Sanders was a \u201cgood wake-up call\u201d for the Clinton campaign.</p> <p>\u201cThey didn\u2019t really spend any time here,\u201d Blanchard said. \u201cI think the polls, again the polls showed a big lead.

  "<p>Donald Trump refused to back down from his false claim that Barack Obama was \u201cthe founder of Isis\u201d on Thursday, insisting: \u201cHe was the founder ... The way he got out of Iraq was the founding of Isis.\u201d<br></p> <p>The Republican presidential candidate was speaking to conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt, who had attempted to reframe <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/11/donald-trump-calls-barack-obama-the-founder-of-isis\">his remark</a>, telling him: \u201cI know what you meant \u2013 you meant that he created the vacuum, he lost the peace.\u201d </p> <p>But Trump disagreed. \u201cNo, I meant that he\u2019s the founder of Isis, I do,\u201d he said. \u201cHe was the most valuable player \u2013 I gave him the most valuable player award. I give her too, by the way,\u201d he added of his Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton. </p> <p>Trump did acknowledge that the root of his argument was that if Obama \u201chad done things properly, you wouldn\u2019t have had Isis\u201d, but he repeated: \u201cTherefore, he was the founder of Isis.\u201d </p> <p>And he doggedly pursued that line of thought in a later speech to homebuilders in Miami on Thursday, now suggesting it was Clinton who would be given \u201cthe most valuable player award\u201d by Islamic State. \u201cHer only competition is Barack Obama,\u201d he said, adding of Clinton: \u201cOh boy, is Isis hoping for her.\u201d </p> <p>Trump\u2019s remarks about Isis came while he is still dealing with backlash from his hint that gun rights supporters might attack Clinton, something that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/10/trump-assassination-remark-clinton-second-amendment\">seemed to cause genuine shock</a> in a country that has grown used to Trump pushing the boundaries of appropriate political discourse. On Thursday, Patti Davis, the daughter of late Republican former president Ronald Reagan, joined his critics to lambast him for what she called a \u201cglib and horrifying comment\u201d. </p> <p>\u201cI am the daughter of a man who was shot by someone who got his inspiration from a movie, someone who believed if he killed the president the actress from that movie would notice him,\u201d she said, referring to the attempted assassination of Reagan by John Hinckley in 1981. </p> <p>Trump\u2019s remark about Clinton, she said, \u201cwas heard by the person sitting alone in a room, locked in his own dark fantasies, who sees unbridled violence as a way to make his mark in the world, and is just looking for ideas. Yes, Mr Trump, words matter. But then you know that, which makes this all even more horrifying.\u201d</p> <p>Trump first claimed Obama was \u201cthe founder of Isis\u201d on Wednesday night at a rally in Sunrise, Florida.</p> <p>\u201cIsis is honoring President Obama,\u201d Trump said of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/isis\">Islamic State</a>. \u201cHe is the founder of Isis. He founded Isis. And, I would say the co-founder would be crooked Hillary Clinton.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/aug/11/trump-hillary-clinton-isis-mvp-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/4qfvq\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2648483\"            data-video-name=\"Donald Trump: Hillary Clinton is the 'MVP' of Isis \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"Reuters\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57acb80ae4b0f231200d9fea\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/08/11/110816trumpmvpclinton_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/08/11/110816trumpmvpclinton.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/08/11/110816trumpmvpclinton_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/aug/11/trump-hillary-clinton-isis-mvp-video\">Trump doubles down on his Isis comments, saying that Hillary Clinton is the group\u2019s MVP</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>On Thursday, Clinton attacked Trump for the remarks on Twitter. \u201cIt can be difficult to muster outrage as frequently as Donald Trump should cause it, but his smear against President Obama requires it,\u201d <a href=\"https://twitter.com/HillaryClinton/status/763785696041730049\">she wrote</a>. \u201cNo, Barack Obama is not the founder of Isis. Anyone willing to sink so low, so often should never be allowed to serve as our commander-in-chief.\u201d</p> <p>Since July\u2019s Republican convention, Clinton has taken a firm lead in the polls as Trump has struggled from controversy to controversy, pursuing a feud with the Muslim family of a dead US army captain and suggesting Russia publish any of Clinton\u2019s missing emails it has hacked, before this week\u2019s inflammatory remarks. The Democratic candidate is 7.9 points ahead in the latest polling average <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/us/general_election_trump_vs_clinton-5491.html\">compiled by Real Clear Politics</a>.</p> <p>On Thursday, <a href=\"http://time.com/4447527/donald-trump-republican-national-committee/\">Time magazine claimed</a> that Republican National Committee chair Reince Priebus had told Trump that if he did not manage to right his campaign, the party might abandon support for his presidential bid and focus instead on Republicans running for Congress elsewhere in the country.</p> <p>Quoting two anonymous party officials familiar with the conversation, Time said Priebus had told Trump that internal polling suggested he was on track to lose the election and that he would have been better off heading to his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida for a break than hitting the trail after the convention.</p> <p>Trump dismissed the story. \u201cReince Priebus is a terrific guy,\u201d he told Time. \u201cHe never said that.\u201d</p> <p>Clinton was attempting to shift the focus to the economy on Thursday with a speech in Detroit. She intended to try to make the case that Trump\u2019s policies would benefit him and his wealthy friends, and to characterize his plans as an update of \u201ctrickle-down economics\u201d. </p> <p>Her speech was in part a response to one given by Trump in the beleaguered Rust Belt city <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/08/donald-trump-tax-plan-business-income-middle-class\">on Monday</a>, when he proposed dramatically slashing taxes, reducing income tax brackets from seven levels to three \u2013 of 12%, 25% and 33% \u2013 and eliminating income taxes for individuals who earn less than $25,000 annually, or $50,000 for a married couple. </p> <p>That speech had been intended to reboot his flagging campaign, but was soon overtaken by the controversy over his \u201csecond amendment people\u201d comments, which in turn gave way to Wednesday\u2019s remarks about Obama and Isis. </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/republicans\">Republicans</a> have long sought to blame the turmoil in the Middle East on the Obama administration\u2019s foreign policy, often criticizing the president for underestimating the threat Isis poses. But Trump has routinely gone a step further by stating directly that Obama is sympathetic to terrorists. Immediately after the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/18/orlando-nightlcub-shooting-pulse-florida-attack-timeline\">12 June mass shooting</a> at an LGBT nightclub in Orlando, Florida, which left 49 dead and 53 injured, Trump said cryptically that Obama \u201cdoesn\u2019t get it or he gets it better than anybody understands\u201d. </p> <p>In his speech on Wednesday, the former reality TV star pointedly chose several times to repeat the president\u2019s full name, Barack Hussein Obama.</p> <p>The origins of Isis trace back to the aftermath of the US invasion of Iraq in 2003. The group has been deemed an offshoot of al-Qaida, which carried out the attacks on 9/11. Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, the Jordanian militant terrorist viewed as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jun/10/how-isis-crippled-al-qaida\">the founder of Isis</a>, was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/jun/08/iraq.alqaida\">killed in a US airstrike</a> in Baghdad in 2006.</p> <p>Although Isis has expanded rapidly during Obama\u2019s tenure, seizing in particular on the Syrian civil war, the administration has also made gains in its military campaign against the extremist group. US army Lt Gen Sean MacFarland said on Wednesday an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/11/isis-ranks-dwindle-to-15000-amid-retreat-on-all-fronts-claims-pentagon\">estimated 45,000 fighters</a> linked to Isis had been killed in the two years since the US-led military coalition against the network was launched.</p> <p>Trump has not articulated a clear strategy against Isis, other than to threaten a ruthless bombing campaign and continuously push his proposal to ban Muslim immigration from the US.</p>",

  "<p>Donald Trump escalated his rhetoric against Barack Obama on Wednesday, dubbing the US president as the \u201cfounder of Isis\u201d.<br></p> <p>The Republican presidential nominee\u2019s comments, made at a rally in Sunrise, Florida, came as Trump continued to face a backlash for hinting a day earlier that his opponent, Hillary Clinton, be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/10/hillary-clinton-responds-trump-second-amendment-violence-election\">assassinated by gun rights supporters</a>.</p> <p>\u201cIsis is honoring President Obama,\u201d Trump said of Islamic State. \u201cHe is the founder of Isis. He founded Isis. And, I would say the co-founder would be crooked Hillary Clinton.\u201d</p> <p>Trump\u2019s declaration echoed an attack he made against Clinton last week, also in Florida, in which he said the former secretary of state \u201cshould get an award from them as the founder of Isis\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/10/hillary-clinton-responds-trump-second-amendment-violence-election\">Clinton: Trump hinting at assassination is a 'casual inciting of violence'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Republicans have long sought to blame the turmoil in the Middle East on the Obama administration\u2019s foreign policy, often criticizing the president for underestimating the threat posed by Isis. But Trump has routinely gone a step further by stating directly that Obama is sympathetic to terrorists. </p> <p>The former reality TV star employed the same tactic on Wednesday, referring to the president by his full name \u2013 Barack Hussein Obama \u2013 and repeating it several times for emphasis of his claim that Obama had founded Isis.</p> <p>The origins of Isis trace back to the aftermath of the US invasion of Iraq in 2003. The group has been deemed an offshoot of al-Qaida, which carried out the attacks on 9/11. Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, the Jordanian militant terrorist viewed as <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jun/10/how-isis-crippled-al-qaida\">the founder of Isis</a>, was <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/jun/08/iraq.alqaida\">killed in a US airstrike</a> in Baghdad in 2006.</p> <p>Although Isis has expanded rapidly during Obama\u2019s tenure, seizing in particular on the Syrian civil war, the administration has also made gains in its military campaign against the extremist group. US army lieutenant general Sean MacFarland said on Wednesday an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/11/isis-ranks-dwindle-to-15000-amid-retreat-on-all-fronts-claims-pentagon\">estimated 45,000 fighters</a> linked to Isis had been killed in the two years since the US-led military coalition against the network was launched. </p> <p>Trump has not articulated a clear strategy against Isis, other than to threaten a ruthless bombing campaign and continuously push his proposal to ban Muslim immigration from the US. </p> <p>He has also seized on recent terrorist attacks to revive conspiracies about Obama\u2019s birthplace and religion. <br></p> <p>Immediately after the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/18/orlando-nightlcub-shooting-pulse-florida-attack-timeline\">12 June mass shooting</a> at an LGBT nightclub in Orlando, Florida, which left 49 dead and 53 more injured, Trump said Obama \u201cdoesn\u2019t get it or he gets it better than anybody understands\u201d. <br></p> <p>In addition to insinuating that Obama, a Christian, is secretly a Muslim, Trump has also falsely stated the president was born in Kenya when he was, in fact, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/apr/27/barack-obama-birth-certificate-released\">born in Hawaii.</a></p>",
  "<p>Hedge funds and other western investors have been piling into gold this year, pushing investment to a record high and driving the price of bullion to its biggest first-half gain since 1980.</p> <p>The latest report from the World Gold Council, which represents gold miners, indicates that global gold demand reached 2,335 tonnes in the first six months of the year. </p> <p>Buying by institutional and retail investors, mainly in the west, hit a new high of 1,064 tonnes, 16% above the previous record set in the first half of 2009, at the height of the global financial crisis. Investment accounted for the biggest chunk of gold buying for two consecutive quarters \u2013 the first time this has ever happened.</p> <p>Exchange-traded funds, which track the spot price of gold, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/may/12/gold-demand-soars-strongest-first-quarter-on-record\">had a stellar first half</a>, recording inflows of nearly 580 tonnes. </p> <p>Hedge funds, Japanese pension funds and bond investors, put off by low yields, have been buying gold amid heightened global uncertainty, according to John Mulligan, the industry body\u2019s head of member and market relations. </p> <p>He explained that gold, regarded as the ultimate safe haven, had become more attractive due to low or negative interest rates and uncertainty around the UK\u2019s decision to leave the EU and the US presidential election. </p> <p>Investors have been snapping up gold bars and coins in several markets, notably the US where demand soared 101% between April and June, as gold eagle coins proved popular. </p> <p>The Royal Mint posted a sharp rise in profits, which it attributed partly to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jul/24/royal-mint-makes-mint\">last year\u2019s launch of Signature Gold</a>, an online site allowing investors to buy or sell part of the 400oz gold bars held in its vaults. The Mint said there had been a huge spike in demand after the Brexit vote.</p> <p>The gold price surged 25% rise to an average of $1,259.6 (\u00a3968.14) an ounce in the second quarter. The sharp rise put consumers off buying jewellery and other gold.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/aug/2016-08-10T16:06:10/embed.html\" data-alt=\"Gold price in dollar terms\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/aug/2016-08-10T16:06:10/embed.html\">Gold price in dollar terms</a> <figcaption>Gold price in dollar terms</figcaption> </figure>  <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/feb/20/china-india-biggest-gold-market\">China and India, the world\u2019s biggest gold consumers</a>, saw jewellery purchases fall by 15% and 20% in the second quarter, to 144 tonnes and 98 tonnes respectively. </p> <p>In India, farmers \u2013 who account for two-thirds of the country\u2019s gold demand \u2013 are under pressure following a patchy monsoon and are buying less as a result.

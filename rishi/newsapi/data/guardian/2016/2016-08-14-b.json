  "<p>In search of answers about plummeting polls and reports of despair within his presidential campaign, Republican nominee Donald Trump questioned the role of a free press on Sunday, as his allies struggled to argue that their candidate remained focused on winning the general election.<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/aug/14/donald-trump-fairness-balance-falters-bbc-us-media\">Fairness and balance falters before Trump in the US media</a> </p> </aside>  <p>At a Saturday night rally in Fairfield, Connecticut, Trump went so far as to say that his race is not against the Democratic nominee, Hillary Clinton, but against journalists. \u201cI\u2019m not running against Crooked Hillary,\u201d he told a crowd. \u201cI\u2019m running against the crooked media.\u201d</p> <p>On Sunday, the nominee challenged the application of first amendment rights: \u201cIt is not \u2018freedom of the press\u2019 when newspapers and others are allowed to say and write whatever they want even if it is completely false!\u201d</p> <p>Trump has previously argued that Congress should \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/feb/26/trump-pledges-curb-press-freedom-libel-laws-first-amendment\">open up our libel laws</a>\u201d so that people could sue newspapers, although he himself has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/video/2016/jul/22/donald-trump-denies-ted-cruz-father-assassination-jfk\">cited tabloid stories without evidence</a>.</p> <p>Earlier on Sunday, campaign chairman Paul Manafort tried to pour cold water on the reports that had enraged Trump. </p> <p>\u201cTrump is very plugged in,\u201d Manafort told on CNN. \u201cVery connected. We\u2019re seeing crowds that are end of October numbers, not August numbers. He\u2019s appearing to between 10, 15, 20,000 people. That tells you the campaign is working.\u201d</p> <p>The campaign chief also argued that Trump had \u201ca substantive week\u201d, noting the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/08/donald-trump-tax-plan-business-income-middle-class\">competing economic plans</a> that he and Clinton each presented. \u201cOur plan very clearly laid out how he was going to cut taxes, lower the tax rates for small businesses, how that would create more jobs. He talked about his trade policy.\u201d</p> <p>But Manafort was also forced to answer for Trump\u2019s remark that \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/aug/09/trump-clinton-second-amendment-people-video\">second amendment people</a>\u201d might act against Clinton, and a campaign staffer\u2019s criticism of the parents of a US army captain killed in Iraq.</p> <p>Manafort\u2019s defence followed a New York Times report <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/14/us/politics/donald-trump-campaign-gop.html?hp&amp;action=click&amp;pgtype=Homepage&amp;clickSource=story-heading&amp;module=first-column-region&amp;region=top-news&amp;WT.nav=top-news\">of confusion</a> at the heart of the Trump campaign, quoting from more than 20 associates who anonymously described the candidate as increasingly angry, glum, and refusing to follow counsel from his advisers. Separately, Politico <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2016/08/donald-trump-rnc-support-226987\">reported</a> that Republican party leaders had started private talks about cutting off financial support for their nominee.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s campaign has put Politico on<a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/2016/06/14/media/donald-trump-media-blacklist/\"> a so-called \u201cblacklist\u201d</a> of organizations it denies press credentials to, and Trump tweeted that the Times \u201chas become a newspaper of fiction\u201d. On Saturday he wondered aloud about banning the outlet from his events.</p> <p>Then Trump spent Sunday morning <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/764866887511572480\">tweeting aspersions </a><a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/764867963845484545\">about the press</a>, critiquing various elements of coverage and largely ignoring his opponent, despite recent, damaging reports about <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/email-batch-provides-additional-evidence-that-clinton-foundation-donors-got-access-at-state-department/2016/08/10/de2c0066-5f1a-11e6-9d2f-b1a3564181a1_story.html\">her relationship with donors </a>and <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/as-senator-clinton-promised-200000-jobs-in-upstate-new-york-her-efforts-fell-flat/2016/08/07/339d3384-58d2-11e6-831d-0324760ca856_story.html\">her record as a senator.</a> On Sunday, CNN reported that the FBI would give Congress notes from agents\u2019 three-hour interview with Clinton, over her use of a private email server while secretary of state. Clinton herself has <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2014/05/hillary-clinton-media-105901\">quarreled with the press</a> for years, and the Democratic nominee has not held an official press conference in more than 250 days.</p> <p>Yet Trump persisted with his personal crusade, writing: \u201cMy rallies are not covered properly by the media. They never discuss the real message and never show crowd size or enthusiasm.\u201d</p> <p>Trump\u2019s rallies are filmed in their entirety <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NoahGrayCNN/status/764623770128646144\">by a shared camera</a>, and he often spends long sections of his speeches, including Saturday\u2019s, denigrating journalists, sometimes by name. \u201cI am not only fighting Crooked Hillary, I am fighting the dishonest and corrupt media and her government protection process,\u201d he added on Sunday.</p> <p>In the background behind Trump and Manafort\u2019s media criticism, new polling data shows Trump falling behind secretary Clinton by five or more points in key swing states, including Virginia, Colorado, Florida and Pennsylvania. A <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2016-election/polls-clinton-running-table-key-battlegrounds-n629136\">newly released NBC-Wall Street Journal poll</a> shows Clinton leading in Virginia and Colorado by double digits. </p> <p>Nationally, polling averages show Clinton <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/us/general_election_trump_vs_clinton-5491.html\">with a nearly seven-point lead</a>. Reflecting the average, a recent poll Washington Post/ABC poll showed Clinton leading 50% to 42%. <br></p> <p>Meanwhile, the queue of Republicans looking to abandon Trump grew larger on Sunday. Carlos Gutierrez, a former cabinet member for George W Bush, told CNN that he would vote for Clinton.</p> <p>\u201cI am afraid of what Donald Trump would do to this country,\u201d he said. \u201cI am not thinking about a Republican. I am thinking about a US citizen. I think, at some point, you have to put the party aside and say, \u2018What\u2019s best for the country?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Meanwhile, Maine\u2019s Republican senator Susan Collins, who wrote<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/08/susan-collins-donald-trump-washington-post-op-ed-republican\"> a scathing op-ed rejecting Trump last week</a>, told CBS that while she respected his candor, \u201cthere\u2019s a big difference between that and treating people with respect and common decency. And there\u2019s where, in my judgment, Donald Trump has failed.\u201d </p> <p>Collins said she was taking a look at the Libertarian ticket \u201cbecause it\u2019s headed by two former Republican governors who are very successful governors\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/13/trump-recruits-election-observers-voter-intimidation-fears\">Trump recruits 'election observers' as he warns of potential voter fraud</a> </p> </aside>  <p>One of Trump\u2019s few outspoken allies in the Senate, Jeff Sessions, defended the nominee\u2019s erratic campaign in the general election. \u201cHe was so exuberant.

You\u2019re dealing with a different constituency.\u201d</p> <p> </p> <p>But as Republican officials scrambled to assert a coherent direction for their candidate\u2019s campaign, Trump himself may have already offered the clearest sign of his strategy.</p> <p>\u201cI just keep doing the same thing I\u2019m doing right now,\u201d Trump said on Thursday, when asked about his plans to catch up to Clinton. \u201cAnd at the end, it\u2019s either going to work or I\u2019m going to have a very, very nice long vacation.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Braving the heatwave sweeping the eastern US, thousands of workers marched in Richmond on Saturday chanting: \u201cIf you want our vote, come get our vote!\u201d</p> <p>That was the overarching message of the first national Fight for $15 convention, which was held just weeks after both Democrats and Republicans held their conventions to nominate their candidates for the next US president.</p> <p>At the convention, the attending low-wage workers unanimously decided to push political candidates to commit to raising US wages, agreed to hold a national day of action on 12 September, and resolved to demonstrate at all presidential and vice-presidential debates.</p> <p>Additionally, the workers said they would support ballot initiatives to raise minimum wage in cities and states. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/MaryKayHenry/status/764524396795031552\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/FightFor15?src=hash\">#FightFor15</a> workers chanting &quot;If you want our vote, come get our vote!&quot; <a href=\"https://t.co/teAbIaZUwy\">pic.twitter.com/teAbIaZUwy</a></p>&mdash; Mary Kay Henry (@MaryKayHenry) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MaryKayHenry/status/764524396795031552\">August 13, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>The convention in Richmond \u2013 the former capital of the Confederacy \u2013 was organized to draw focus to the links between economic and racial justice.

  "<p>The former Republican, marijuana-smoking, Everest mountaineering ex-governor of New Mexico and presidential nominee of the Libertarian party has a problem: he\u2019s barred from the presidential debates. To appear on stage with Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump this autumn, Gary Johnson needs to boost his national polling numbers to 15% from <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/us/general_election_trump_vs_clinton_vs_johnson-5949.html\">around 8%</a> now. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/11/libertarian-candidate-gary-johnson-anti-trump-republicans\">Libertarian Gary Johnson: Jeb Bush and anti-Trump Republicans will vote for me</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Without that national exposure, and the blockbuster ratings the three scheduled Clinton-Trump dust-ups are likely to produce, it\u2019s hard for anyone to see how Johnson, 63, or either of two other minor-party candidates, the Green party\u2019s Jill Stein or even <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/08/republican-evan-mcmullin-presidential-run-trump\">Evan McMullin, a 40-year-old former CIA counterterrorism officer</a>, could ever become more than mere electoral curiosities.</p> <p>But the emergence of three independent candidates, during a year of record dissatisfaction with the major party candidates, may still make for an unpredictable twist to the story. Polling data suggests libertarians on both sides of the political divide are giving independent candidates a second look, and in Las Vegas on Friday, Johnson and Stein spoke before a gathering of Asian American and Pacific Islander voters to press their cases. </p> <p>Soft-spoken and wearing Nikes, Johnson presented a platform of social libertarianism, fiscal conservatism and non-interventionism in foreign affairs. He argued at the gathering that in this, \u201cthe craziest election of all time\u201d, he had a chance: \u201cI might be the next president of the United States.\u201d</p> <p>A just-released <a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/first-read/polls-clinton-ahead-trump-midwest-battlegrounds-n626541\">WSJ-NBC poll </a> gave Johnson 15% in the crucial swing state of Colorado, and Stein 6%. In Las Vegas, he was asked repeatedly if a vote for him or any third-party candidate was somehow wasted. </p> <p> \u201cA wasted vote is voting for somebody you don\u2019t believe in. That\u2019s a wasted vote,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cVote for the person you believe in \u2013 that\u2019s how you bring about change. I hope after having made my pitch today that you\u2019ll realize, if you want to waste your vote on Clinton or Trump, have at it.\u201d</p> <p>Stein, who spoke separately at the event, similarly argued that many Americans were looking for an alternative to Trump and Hillary Clinton, whom she dubbed as \u201cthe most disliked and untrusted\u201d major-party nominees in US history. <br><br>\u201cDemocracy needs a moral compass,\u201d she told a gathering of Asian American and Pacific Island groups. \u201cIt\u2019s not just about who you don\u2019t like the most or who you are most afraid of.\u201d <br></p> <p>Stein, who like Johnson represented her party in 2012, has outlined policy positions that include a \u201cGreen New Deal\u201d, focused on renewable energy jobs and aimed at making the United States transition to 100% renewable energy complete by 2030. Stein has also proposed a reduction in the military budget by a third and the creation of a regional food systems based on sustainable organic agriculture.<br></p> <p>On the Republican side, Evan McMullin, a beneficiary of the grounded \u201cNever Trump\u201d movement, failed to get on the ballot in 26 states before he\u2019d even sent out his first campaign release. McMullin nonetheless tried to give disaffected conservatives an alternative to the Republican nominee who, he says, has tapped into \u201cpeople\u2019s darkest prejudices and deepest fears\u201d.</p> <p>McMullin\u2019s best hope \u2013 and likely his only one \u2013 to make an electoral dent would require Trump\u2019s departure from the race, though the nominee has made no overt sign that he wants to quit. \u201cLike millions of Americans, I had hoped this year would bring us better nominees who, despite party differences, could offer compelling visions of a better future,\u201d McMullin said in his announcement. </p> <p>\u201cInstead, we have been left with two candidates who are fundamentally unfit for the profound responsibilities they seek.\u201d</p> <p>But can they begin to make a difference? Only once in recent election cycles have third party candidates had any significant influence, when in 1992, Texan businessman Ross Perot took <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1992/11/04/us/1992-elections-president-overview-clinton-captures-presidency-with-huge.html?pagewanted=all\">18% of the vote</a>, carving into the support for incumbent Republican George HW Bush and helping Arkansas governor Bill Clinton to victory. Some Democrats blamed third-party candidate Ralph Nader for delivering George W Bush the election in 2000, but the third-party candidate <a href=\"http://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/national.php?year=2000\">won a paltry 2.74%</a> of the vote, and his supporters were <a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-states-that-love-and-hate-third-party-candidates/\">split</a> between Republicans and Democrats.</p> <p>Johnson\u2019s running mate, former Massachusetts governor William Weld, said he\u2019d seen interest and fundraising pick up as Trump\u2019s campaign has floundered. Their campaign recently reported a $1m one-week fundraising haul and has reported that more than 40,000 people have pledged to donate at least $15 to his campaign on 15 August.</p> <p>But that was in a relatively tight race. With Clinton now leading Trump by double digits in some key battleground states, the impact of any third-party candidate could be limited. </p> <p>\u201cAt the moment it doesn\u2019t look like they can have much impact at all,\u201d said Hank Sheinkopf, a veteran Democratic adviser. \u201cBut if the race gets closer, they could throw it either way.\u201d</p> <p>Sheinkopf reasoned that this election has become more about personalities and less about what party leaders want. The long-term impact may be a significant shift in how people view Democrats and Republicans, he said. As it now stands, Stein, Johnson and McMullin could act as a convenient parking spot for voters disgusted with both candidates.</p> <p>Earlier this month, a federal judge rejected a challenge brought by Johnson and Stein arguing that the bar for inclusion is set artificially high. Yet there are signs the ground could be shifting. Mike McCurry, now co-chair of the Commission on Presidential Debates and a former press secretary for Bill Clinton, hinted that a third podium might be needed.</p> <p>\u201cSome of our production people may have said, \u2018Just in case, you need to plan out what that might look like,\u2019\u2019 McCurry <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2016/08/debates-clinton-trump-johnson-stein-226806\">told Politico</a>. \u201cWe won\u2019t know the number of invitations we extend until mid-September.\u201d</p> <p>Ron Faucheux, president of Clarus Research Group, a nonpartisan polling company, said there was broad support for including even minor candidates. \u201cPolls show that voters think third party candidates should be included,\u201d he said, \u201cand in an election like this, where polls show a majority of voters dislike both main party candidates, there is a good reason to give them the opportunity to at least look at other options.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/05/green-party-convention-jill-stein-bernie-or-bust-clinton\">'The only other option': Bernie Sanders backers turn to Green party's Jill Stein</a> </p> </aside>  <p> But even Johnson and Stein were somewhat wistful about their prospects, casting themselves as agents of change who, at best, could represent the beginning of a break with the current two-party system.</p> <p>\u201cThe biggest message is \u2018consider us\u2019 as a very, very viable alternative to this two-party system that has become so polarized that they\u2019re not able to do anything,\u201d Johnson has said. </p> <p>Stein advanced a similar argument. \u201cWe\u2019re having a political reorganization in this election because the Republicans are kind of falling apart,\u201d she said, \u201cand the Democrats have kind of split with a lot of the Bernie Sanders supporters just not happy with the alternative.\u201d </p> <p>She argued that it was by elections about \u201cthe lesser of two evils\u201d that the country inherited many of its problems. </p> <p>But first, the two have to get on TV. </p> <p> </p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s no way I\u2019m going to win the presidency if I\u2019m not in the presidential debates,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cI do believe anything is possible given that right now, arguably the two most polarizing figures in American politics today are running for office.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>\u201cI love polls. I love polls,\u201d Donald Trump told a South Carolina audience in December, while he was still one of many contenders in the Republican primary. But, he hedged, \u201cif they turn negative, I don\u2019t like them.\u201d</p> <p>Sure enough, Trump has been singing a different tune in the general election, during which he\u2019s mostly trailed Democratic rival Hillary Clinton.</p> <p>Even his moment in the spotlight during the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2016/jul/31/hillary-clinton-donald-trump-convention-speeches-america\">Republican national convention in mid-July</a> was cut short by the Democratic convention just one week later. Trump briefly surged to a one-point lead over Clinton soon after the RNC. But Clinton\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/03/trump-clinton-unpopularity-2016-election-prediction-winner\">convention bump</a> \u2013 which put her seven points ahead in polling averages \u2013 not only wiped out Trump\u2019s short-lived lead but built upon her previous dominance.</p> <p>The Guardian analyzed RealClearPolitics polling averages from three previous election cycles to look at what could affect Clinton\u2019s lead. How the candidates fare in the polls before election day may yet defy all expectation; this has been a tumultuous election season to say the least. But if history is any guide, Clinton\u2019s current lead hinges on her performance in upcoming debates, the ability to avoid (any more) scandals, and bigger-picture issues like the economy and national security, which are beyond either candidate\u2019s direct control.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <h2>The convention bump: what does it mean, and will it last?</h2> <p>Looking back at previous election years, it\u2019s not unusual to see both candidates rise in the polls after their conventions. After all, conventions are essentially pep rallies with loads of free press for each party\u2019s candidate.<br></p> <p>\u201cThe candidate is the center of attention and the center of profuse praise for several days,\u201d said Scott Keeter, senior survey adviser at Pew Research Center. Candidates also usually benefit from increased party unity, as infighting left over from the primary race tends to slow by the convention, Keeter said.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>One candidate getting a bigger and longer lasting convention bump is also not unusual. But who comes out with the bigger net gain from conventions doesn\u2019t necessarily predict who will win in November.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4973953ddd50ebb2574f0b90c441fc309de3a2bc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4973953ddd50ebb2574f0b90c441fc309de3a2bc/0_91_3344_2007/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Hillary Clinton at the Democratic national convention.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hillary Clinton at the Democratic national convention.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Timothy A. Clary/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Take John McCain\u2019s 2008 campaign: Going into convention season that year, Barack Obama led McCain by a point and a half. After the Democratic convention, which was first that year, Obama seemed to rise about a point or two in the polls. But a big boost for McCain after the GOP convention the following week gave him about a two-point lead over Obama. In total, McCain got a net gain of about three and a half points but went on to lose to Obama in November.<br></p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/08/07/the-new-postabc-poll-shows-just-how-badly-donald-trump-blew-his-convention/\">nature of Clinton\u2019s gains</a>, combined with Trump\u2019s further stumbles in the past few weeks, could mean that her post-convention rise in the polls marks a <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/06/upshot/why-a-meaningful-shift-in-the-trump-clinton-race-may-be-at-hand.html\">meaningful shift</a> rather than a temporary gain.<br></p> <p>But even if Clinton\u2019s lead holds for the next few weeks, she shouldn\u2019t get too confident. Debates, gaffes, and unpredictable geopolitical events have all taken hits on even the most prolonged convention bumps in previous elections.<br></p> <h2>The candidates\u2019 next chance to shine: the debates</h2> <p>Clinton and Trump will go head to head on 26 September during the first general election debate \u2013 that is, if Trump decides <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/31/nfl-presidential-debates-schedule-donald-trump\">to show up.</a> The debate will be the next big opportunity \u2013 or at least the next planned opportunity \u2013 for the candidates to bask in the national spotlight and gain an edge in the polls.<br></p> <p>In the past, debates have had a big influence on the number of people who say they will vote for a given candidate. After the 2004 and 2012 convention seasons, both George W Bush and Obama were able to hold onto their convention bumps for a few weeks. (For Bush, his post-convention bump lasted about a month. For Obama, his numbers stayed high for two weeks.)<br></p> <p>But, in both cases, the candidates\u2019 poll numbers took a hit after the first debate.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/08/polling-debates/\" data-alt=\"Charts showing poll numbers for Romney and Kerry rising after debate wins.\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/08/polling-debates/\">Charts showing poll numbers for Romney and Kerry rising after debate wins.</a> </figure>  <p>Despite trailing Bush in the polls for much of the fall of 2004, a majority of viewers polled thought John Kerry won the first debate. The candidates sparred over the war in Iraq for nearly two-thirds of the debate, and Bush\u2019s defenses appeared weak in the face of Kerry\u2019s persistent criticisms. Bush subsequently lost around five points of his polling lead.<br></p> <p>A similar scene played out again in 2012, between another incumbent, Obama, and Republican challenger Mitt Romney. Despite trailing in the polls, Romney was well prepared for the first debate, and Obama \u2013 often glancing at his notes \u2013 didn\u2019t perform particularly well. More than seven in 10 Americans told Gallup that Romney did a better job, which was reflected in post-debate polls when Obama\u2019s lead decreased by around three points.<br></p> <p>If Clinton\u2019s current lead holds up by the first debate in late September (which would be a very long post-convention bump indeed), her debate performance could once again change the balance of the race.<br></p> <h2>Economic or geopolitical shocks could move the polls</h2> <p>While it\u2019s easier to predict swings in the polls because of planned events such as conventions and debates, it\u2019s more difficult to forecast how unpredictable factors \u2013 including geopolitical shocks or economic slowdown \u2013 could impact the candidates\u2019 chances of victory.</p> <p>McCain\u2019s reaction to the financial crisis and his association with the outgoing president likely contributed to the collapse of his post-convention polling bounce.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/08/polling-economics/\" data-alt=\"Chart showing McCain's loss in polls after financial crisis comments.\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/08/polling-economics/\">Chart showing McCain's loss in polls after financial crisis comments.</a> </figure>  <p>The morning after Lehman Brothers collapsed, McCain, who was leading in polls at the time, argued that the economy was \u201cfundamentally sound\u201d. The comment caused an uproar. McCain was in the tough position of representing the incumbent party during a financial meltdown and was now on record saying things that further damaged his image. McCain\u2019s poll numbers sank the following week, and he wouldn\u2019t recover his lead again before that year\u2019s election.<br></p> <p>Signs of an economic crisis could particularly hurt Clinton, who has aligned herself closely with Obama\u2019s legacy.</p> <p>Questions of national security \u2013 terrorist attacks or foreign military conflicts \u2013 could throw greater uncertainty into the election, too.<br></p> <p>Security \u2013 and Isis especially \u2013 has been a central issue for both campaigns this year. On terrorism, for instance, some polls show voters believe Clinton would handle such unrest better. Other polls have <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/hillary-clinton-donald-trump-tied-going-into-conventions-cbsnyt-poll/\">both candidates head to head</a>.<br></p> <h2>Scandals and controversy: will we reach a tipping point?</h2> <p>Scandals and gaffes have hurt candidates before, but whether the same holds true for this election is anyone\u2019s guess. Both Trump and Clinton are trailed by scandal \u2013 the looming Trump University lawsuit and email-gate, respectively.<br></p> <p>The FBI\u2019s decision not to press criminal charges over Clinton\u2019s private email server was a central news story in early July. After FBI director James Comey complained that Clinton <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/07/fbi-james-comey-hillary-clinton-email-investigation\">showed \u201cgross negligence\u201d</a> regarding her emails, Clinton\u2019s poll numbers dropped by a few points, though they\u2019ve bounced back since. How much more impact the email controversy will have remains to be seen.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/08/polling-emails/\" data-alt=\"Chart showing polls dropping after FBI Director James Comey criticized Clinton for her use of a private email server.\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/08/polling-emails/\">Chart showing polls dropping after FBI Director James Comey criticized Clinton for her use of a private email server.</a> </figure>  <p>Meanwhile, Trump says controversial things so routinely that the word \u201cgaffe\u201d has lost all meaning. From the day he announced his candidacy, Trump\u2019s speeches, television appearances, and tweets have been rife with insults. But many of his rhetorical barbs didn\u2019t lead to big shifts in his polling numbers \u2013 to the amazement of many analysts.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>It\u2019s hard to say that the right insult or combination of controversial statements couldn\u2019t bring down Trump\u2019s chances of getting elected. Just in the past couple weeks, he <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/30/donald-trump-muslim-father-khizr-khan-democratic-convention-speech\">attacked the family</a> of a fallen marine captain, suggested the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/02/donald-trump-calls-hillary-clinton-the-devil-and-suggests-election-will-be-rigged\">election will be rigged</a>, and hinted at an <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/09/trump-gun-owners-clinton-judges-second-amendment\">assassination attempt</a> against Clinton. This combination of statements may have contributed to Trump\u2019s dip in the polls after the GOP convention.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>But just four years ago, these things mattered.<br></p> <p>In September 2012, Romney was already trailing Obama in the polls when a surreptitiously recorded video leaked of Romney, behind closed doors, describing 47% of Americans as entitled and \u201cdependent upon government, who believe that they are victims\u201d. The polls swung about one percentage point in Obama\u2019s direction shortly thereafter, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/sept-27-the-impact-of-the-47-percent/\">Nate Silver estimated</a>.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>It\u2019s still possible that the right controversial statement could cause a shift in this year\u2019s polls, too. After all, there are about three months between now and election day.</p> <ul> <li><em>An earlier version of this article incorrectly said that Trump surged to a four-point lead following the Republican convention, when he rose by four points to a one-point lead.</em></li> </ul>"

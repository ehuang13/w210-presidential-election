A survey by the <a href=\"https://morningconsult.com/2016/09/25/trump-edges-clinton-ahead-first-debate/\">Morning Consult website</a> gave Trump an edge of one point.</p> <p>The debate on Long Island is predicted to draw an audience of 100 million, a record for a political event. National security will feature among the topics. Many are intrigued by the prospect of car-crash television and just how ugly things might turn. Online fact-checkers and a vast following on Twitter are likely to play a major role in real time in shaping the narrative of victory and defeat.</p> <p>On NBC\u2019s Meet the Press on Sunday, host Chuck Todd wondered if the aim of inviting Cuban, <a href=\"http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2016/06/mark-cuban-donald-trump-wealth\">who has questioned Trump\u2019s financial worth</a>, was to get under Trump\u2019s skin. </p> <p>Podesta replied: \u201cNo, I think Mark Cuban is one of the business leaders who was never involved in partisan politics who\u2019s endorsed Hillary because he thinks she\u2019ll do better for the economy.

You know I\u2019m in your corner and will definitely be at the debate!\u201d</p> <p>On Sunday, his allies sought to defuse the issue. Vice-presidential candidate Pence told Fox News Sunday: \u201cGennifer Flowers will not be attending the debate tomorrow night. Donald was using the tweet yesterday really to mock an effort by Hillary Clinton and her campaign to really distract attention from where the American people are going to be focused tomorrow night, which is on the issues, it\u2019s on the choice that we face.\u201d</p> <p>Trump\u2019s campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/25/donald-trump-gennifer-flowers-debate-hillary-clinton\">told CNN\u2019s State of the Union</a> she could not confirm that Flowers would attend. </p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe how easily baited the Clinton campaign was,\u201d she said. \u201cBasically, Mr Trump was saying, \u2018Look, if Mark Cuban is going to send out these texts that say \u2018<a href=\"https://twitter.com/mcuban/status/779125122628136962\">the humbling at Hofstra</a>\u2019 and this is his big downfall, then Mr Trump was putting them on notice that we could certainly invite guests that may get into the head of Hillary Clinton. </p> <p>\u201cBut we have not invited her formally and we don\u2019t expect her to be there as a guest of the Trump campaign.\u201d</p> <p>One of the debate\u2019s numerous subplots will be the question of whether Trump might be provoked into lashing out, perhaps by confronting Clinton with her husband\u2019s past infidelities in a bid to humiliate her. It would be a risky move for the tycoon, himself thrice married.</p> <p>Conway said: \u201cHe has a right to defend himself against anything that Secretary Clinton may say in response. There\u2019s no plan to do that. I\u2019m not going to reveal what we have been doing in our debate conversations.

Answer the questions that the American people have. They deserve and expect these candidates to be talking about the issues.\u201d </p> <p>Clinton\u2019s campaign manger, Robby Mook, told the same show: \u201cNobody knows which Donald Trump is going to show up to this debate.

Clinton is a seasoned politician who has been preparing with mock debates reportedly featuring her aide Philippe Reines in the role of her opponent. Trump is a brash businessman and TV showman who hurled insults at his opponents during the Republican primaries.</p> <p>On CBS\u2019s Face the Nation on Sunday, Paul Ryan, the House speaker who, as Mitt Romney\u2019s running mate, debated Joe Biden in 2012, advised Trump: \u201cOver-prepare. Look, Hillary Clinton\u2019s been doing this most of her life. She is the consummate pro. This is new for Donald. So I think he should obviously over-prepare for it. </p> <p>\u201cAnd the thing I believe, obviously I prepared for these myself. You have to offer the country a vision, go on offence, prosecute your case, hold your opponent accountable. But then \u2026 show the country the direction you want to go and \u2026 prepare, prepare, prepare. And I hope he\u2019s doing that.\u201d</p> <p>On Sunday morning, Trump met Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu at Trump Tower in New York City. Netanyahu was due to meet Clinton later. </p> <p>A Trump campaign statement said: \u201cMr Trump acknowledged that Jerusalem has been the eternal capital of the Jewish people for over 3,000 years, and that the United States, under a Trump administration, will finally accept the long-standing Congressional mandate to recognize Jerusalem as the undivided capital of the state of Israel.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e95d50a7bff4c1ae8815afd30bb1b407810e275f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e95d50a7bff4c1ae8815afd30bb1b407810e275f/0_0_2277_1366/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Carter Page\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Carter Page, whom Donald Trump has named as a foreign policy adviser, speaks at the World Trade Center in Moscow.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dmitry Serebryakov/TASS</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Trump could face difficult questions from Clinton, and indeed debate moderator Lester Holt, over his business ties to Russia and repeated praise for its president, Vladimir Putin.

  "<p>America has seldom been so divided going into a general election. And that division is showing up even in the housing markets of states that traditionally vote Democratic and those that vote Republican.<br></p> <p>A new report issued by a real estate data company, HouseCanary, and given exclusively to the Guardian found that over the last four decades, housing prices have risen significantly higher in blue (Democratic-leaning) states than in red (Republican-leaning) states. </p> <p>Since 1984, blue states have seen their house values go up from an average of $85,000 to $312,000, while red states saw an increase from $75,000 to $184,000. Blue states now account for 77% of the total value of homes in United States.</p> <p>Higher housing prices in the liberal-leaning blue states might have a twofold effect on voters\u2019 outlooks: while homeowners feel the benefits of the economic recovery, those who do not own homes are grappling with the effects of income inequality as house prices increase \u2013 often out of their reach.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/09/red-blue-state-home-value-year/\" data-alt=\"Average home value in blue and red states\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/09/red-blue-state-home-value-year/\">Average home value in blue and red states</a> </figure>  <p>The prices also show a profound shift in wealth in the US.</p> <p>\u201cIf you look at 20 to 30 years ago, Republican red states had higher net worth than Democrats in blue states. And now what you are seeing is this sea change happening where there is this growing divide in our country,\u201d said Jeremy Sicklick, co-founder and chief executive of <a href=\"https://www.housecanary.com/about\">HouseCanary</a>. \u201cThis helps illustrate some of the appeal that probably Donald Trump has had in some of these red states, where there have been these factory closures and exodus from these once proud industrial centers in the north.\u201d</p> <p>As this trend played out, those people who had resources to move to places with more jobs did so, contributing to this growing inequality, explained Sicklick. </p> <p>The divide between blue states and red states is likely to continue growing. According to HouseCanary, over the next three years, house values in all states are likely to grow between 10% to 12% \u2013 but those increases will look significantly different in blue states and in red states.</p> <p>\u201cAt this point, the average home in a blue state is [worth] almost double [the price] in a red state, and because of that, you are going to see this continued divide. Over the next three years, we expect the average homeowner in blue states to grow their value by $39,000 to $40,000 \u2013 versus in red states, [where] the average homeowner will grow their value by $20,000,\u201d said Sicklick. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/09/real-estate-square-map/\" data-alt=\"house value by political leaning blue state red state\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/09/real-estate-square-map/\">house value by political leaning blue state red state</a> </figure>  <p>To determine which states were blue states and which were red states, HouseCanary relied on elections and the statistical analysis website <a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.com/\">FiveThirtyEight</a>\u2019s projections for the 2016 presidential elections. The projections used were released on 16 August. According to Sicklick, even if some of the swing states were to end up voting Republican instead of Democratic as predicted in the projections, the analysis would still hold up. </p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think any swing state changes \u2013 whether they are Ohio or Iowa or other swing states \u2013 would have a material impact on the overall findings,\u201d he said. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/apr/01/average-manhattan-apartment-costs-hits-record\">Average Manhattan apartment costs $2m, and developers are to blame</a> </p> </aside>  <p>After all, not all blue states are equally expensive.

Or the latest outrage from Donald Trump, or his kids. It\u2019s idiocy ad nauseam. </p> <p> With the two main candidates finally set to meet face-to-face for the first televised debate tomorrow, you\u2019d be forgiven for hoping that might be finally about to change. I wish I shared that confidence. </p> <p> I do believe that both Clinton and Trump will engage in a free-for-all in an effort to show just how tough they\u2019ll be when it comes to homeland security. That\u2019s probably inevitable, given that the debate will take place only about 10 days after a bomb exploded in a dumpster on West 23rd Street in Manhattan, injuring 29 people.</p> <p> Clearly, it\u2019s important for the two candidates to spell out their views on national security issues. Hopefully this can be accomplished with a minimum of melodrama and a maximum of substantive dialogue.</p> <p> What worries me is that there\u2019s one aspect of national security that no one has mentioned, that no one will mention, and that neither of the two major candidates is even thinking about.</p> <p>What am I talking about? The risk that we could be heading for another financial crisis \u2013 one that might make the events of 2008 look like a walk in the park. And that kind of event \u2013 the prospect that the banking system will collapse, leaving us without access to our savings, and with no way to pay our bills or collect our paychecks \u2013 is just as much of a threat as the more conventional perils that spring to mind when I use the phrase \u201cnational security\u201d.</p> <p> Let\u2019s be clear: statistically it\u2019s much more likely that the next president will have to deal with a massive financial crisis than it is that she or he will have to contend with a terrorist attack of the magnitude of 9/11. It not a certainty, but it is a possibility given our never-ending cycles of boom and bust. And neither has even mentioned how they\u2019d prevent, or respond to, to such an event.</p> <p> The problem with trying to evaluate the probability of a financial crisis is that all the risk-management tools we use inevitably rely on what happened in the past. Inevitably, the next crisis comes from something we hadn\u2019t imagined could or would become a problem, or hadn\u2019t been watching. After the collapse of Long-Term Capital Management in 1998, regulators knew they needed to worry about \u201ccontagion\u201d, or the way that the financial links between banks and other financial counter-parties, could spread problems, like a virus, throughout the system. But they were looking at hedge funds, not mortgage lending. </p> <p> Someone needs to ask Trump and Clinton who their top candidates for treasury secretary are \u2013 and what kind of instructions they would give that individual in terms of monitoring the financial markets and guarding against catastrophic outcomes. </p> <p>Well-informed candidates could deliver revelatory responses. Someone representing a traditional Republican view, for instance, might echo the view that private equity tycoon Stephen Schwarzman of Blackstone Group put forth in a <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/how-the-next-financial-crisis-will-happen-1433891718\">Wall Street Journal opinion piece last year</a>, and argue that new rules passed following the 2008 crisis might create another liquidity crunch, cutting off access to capital just when it\u2019s needed most. </p> <p>Someone from the other side of the aisle would focus on the fact that the shadow banking system has exploded in size since the 2008 crisis. The private funds that form part of this universe <a href=\"http://www.americanbanker.com/bankthink/unregulated-shadow-banks-are-a-ticking-time-bomb-1079892-1.html\">now handle about 60% of all trading</a> in the US Treasury securities market \u2013 found in virtually every major investment portfolio \u2013 using high-speed trading based on algorithmic models. </p> <p>This does assume that we end up with an informed candidate, of course, and not just someone who blusters that because he is rich, we should trust him with the nation\u2019s finances. (Forget about that unpleasant matter of the multiple corporate bankruptcies \u2026) Or someone who does seem to be well-informed, but who may still be getting a lot of her information on the subject from one powerful constituency. (Yeah, I\u2019d still like to see those speeches, even if I can pretty much guess what\u2019s in them.)</p> <p>An informed moderator would asked an informed candidate during tomorrow\u2019s debate what kinds of risks have been created in the name of trying to jumpstart the economy by keeping interest-rates at rock-bottom levels? </p> <p>At best, the result has been a surge in the issuance of junk bonds \u2013 speculative investments offering above-average bond yields \u2013 because investors have become desperate enough to take those risks. In some areas \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-03-17/energy-junk-bond-revival-cut-short-as-7-billion-lost-in-10-days\">particularly energy</a> \u2013 they have discovered the perils of that approach, sometimes losing billions in days when crude oil prices slumped. But what will happen when interest rates make all of these bonds look like bad investments?</p> <p>At worst? Well, that\u2019s a trickier matter altogether. The Federal Reserve now has an astonishing $4.5tn on its balance sheet, compared to only about $1tn at the onset of the financial crisis. The difference? That\u2019s all the assets it bought from the banks to stabilize the banks and keep interest rates low. Now, how does it reduce that bloated balance sheet without freaking markets out? <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/520377e8-037e-11e5-b55e-00144feabdc0.html#axzz4L6i9gz1k\">No one really knows</a>, because no one has ever done it before. That\u2019s another factor that could end up causing or worsening a crisis, because it means the Fed\u2019s hands would be tied behind its back in the midst of another crisis. So \u2013 how would the next president cope in such an eventuality? </p> <p>Both presidents have said they want to reinstate Glass-Steagall financial regulations and break up the big banks. Setting aside the merits of that policy, how would the deal with the instability that would accompany its implementation?</p> <p>While we\u2019re on the subject \u2026 Since most banks today would fail a <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2014-03-19/most-big-banks-would-fail-a-real-stress-test\">real stress test</a>, do the candidates know what one incorporating realistic scenarios would look like? In other words, can they do more than utter the words, \u201cI\u2019d get tough on big banks and make sure they wouldn\u2019t take foolish risks with your money again\u201d?</p> <p>All of this matters even in the best of all possible worlds. And when it comes to financial markets, we aren\u2019t living in the best of all possible worlds. Stocks and bonds alike are priced for perfection, and when that\u2019s the case, the slightest hiccup \u2013 like comments made by Federal Reserve officials early this month \u2013 can <a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/2016/09/09/us-markets.html\">ignite a big selloff</a>. And there are many, many things that could send markets into a tailspin, and generate a massive loss of confidence. </p> <p>Including, it\u2019s worth noting, whether or not the country\u2019s next commander-in-chief seems to have a grasp of how financial markets work, and how to manage that part of his or her national security responsibility. </p> <p>I\u2019m hoping financial security will make it into Monday\u2019s debate. But given this election cycle I\u2019m not holding my breath.</p>",
  "<p>For decades, Republican presidential candidates have had the same relationship with the state of Pennsylvania that Charlie Brown had <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/culturebox/2014/10/the_history_of_lucy_s_pulling_the_football_away_from_charlie_brown_in_peanuts.html\">with a football</a>.<br></p> <p>With 20 electoral votes, the Keystone state has always been a tempting prize to aim for.

He thought Clinton needed to achieve a margin of 375,000 to 400,000 in the fifth-largest city in the country.</p> <p>The suburbs were the prize, he said, adding that he was confident Clinton would do well there. Romney, Rendell said, \u201cwas a very good suburban Republican candidate. He looked the part, was somewhat moderate and had been governor of Massachusetts.\u201d The result was that Obama carried those four counties by \u201conly\u201d 120,000 votes. Rendell thought it was possible Clinton, against the more extreme Trump, could double such margins. </p> <p>Brabender, in contrast, thought Trump was making strides in the suburbs. The Republican nominee was doing two things right, he said. First, he was striking \u201cmore of a scripted tone, more presidential and certainly something that\u2019s more in line with what they would expect to see out of a president.\u201d Second, by emphasizing issues such as childcare, he was clearly trying to talk to suburban voters.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/23/hillary-clinton-national-security-plan-isis-baghdadi\">Hillary Clinton's plan to stop Isis: hunt down leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cI\u2019ve always argued that Trump wasn\u2019t getting enough votes for people who didn\u2019t want to vote for Clinton.\u201d he said. \u201cAnd now, for the first time, they are starting to look at him as a viable alternative.\u201d</p> <p>As Madonna noted, however, \u201cTrump is still losing the four suburban Philadelphia counties.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s got to win a higher percentage of college-educated voters that really predominate in the Philly suburbs,\u201d he said. \u201cThese are places where the economy is much more diversified.\u201d</p> <p>In particular, Madonna said, the Republican nominee has a problem with women. \u201cIn my poll and every poll, and national polls, he\u2019s not doing well with women,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s losing women double digits in my state.

The Real Clear Politics polling average <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/pa/pennsylvania_trump_vs_clinton-5633.html\">has him down by almost seven points</a>.

  "<p>Ted Cruz refused on Saturday to say that Donald Trump is fit to be president, even as he defended his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/23/ted-cruz-support-donald-trump\">surprise endorsement</a> a day earlier of a man he called a \u201cpathological liar\u201d during the bitter tussle for the Republican presidential nomination.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/24/hillary-clinton-donald-trump-habitual-liar-presidential-debate\">Clinton: \u2018habitual liar\u2019 Trump must be curbed in presidential debate</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Speaking at the <a href=\"https://www.texastribune.org/festival/\">Texas Tribune Festival</a> in Austin, Cruz said he forgave Trump for insults directed at him and his family and had been persuaded to fall in line by his belief that Hillary Clinton, the Democratic nominee, must not be allowed to enter the White House, where he fears she would appoint liberal supreme court justices and trample over the constitution.</p> <p>\u201cI talked with both Donald and [his running-mate] Mike Pence yesterday,\u201d Cruz said. \u201cHe was very gracious, he said thank you for the support.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to move on and put the past behind us,\u201d he added.</p> <p>Still, Cruz gave no impression that his antipathy towards Trump, or opinion of his presidential qualifications, have changed much since the spring. \u201cI have been very clear that I have significant disagreements with him.\u201d</p> <p>Making it clear he feels Trump is merely his least unpalatable option on the ballot, the Texas senator did not retract his criticisms, but he declined to repeat them during an onstage interview with Evan Smith, chief executive of the Texas Tribune, at the University of Texas. </p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re in a general election, I don\u2019t think it is productive for me to criticise the Republican nominee today,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cDo you consider Donald Trump to be fit to be president?\u201d Smith asked. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We\u2019re in a general election, I don\u2019t think it is productive for me to criticise the Republican nominee today</p> <footer> <cite>Ted Cruz</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cI think we have one of two choices,\u201d Cruz said. He then talked about how hard he had tried to win the primary, and said the electoral process has produced \u201ceffectively a binary choice\u201d.</p> <p>In May, after Trumpdenigrated Heidi Cruz, the senator\u2019s wife, and Trump <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/02/ted-cruz-indiana-heckler-canada-zodiac-killer\">claimed that Cruz\u2019s father had a link to the assassination of John F Kennedy</a>, Cruz\u2019s finally unleashed an explicit condemnation of the businessman with whom he had feuded for months.</p> <p>The Texas senator <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/03/donald-trump-ted-cruz-jfk-assassination-indiana-primary-philanderer\">responded with a diatribe</a> against Trump, calling him \u201cutterly amoral\u201d, a \u201cpathological liar\u201d, \u201ckooky\u201d, a \u201cserial philanderer\u201d, a \u201cbully\u201d, a \u201cnarcissist at a level I don\u2019t think this country has ever seen\u201d and a \u201cbraggadocious, arrogant buffoon\u201d who risked plunging America \u201cinto the abyss\u201d.</p> <p>Trump retorted <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/727634574298255361?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\"> on Twitter</a>: \u201cWow, Lyin\u2019 Ted Cruz really went wacko today. Made all sorts of crazy charges. Can\u2019t function under pressure \u2013 not very presidential. Sad!\u201d</p> <p>That night, Cruz ended his campaign after Trump won the Indiana primary, a vote that effectively clinched the nomination. In the months that followed, as other White House hopefuls and senior party figures got behind Trump, however reluctantly, Cruz declined to follow. </p> <p>At the Republican National Convention in July, he urged his audience to \u201cvote your conscience\u201d in a speech that drew boos and accusations of disloyalty.</p> <p>Still, time appears to have bridged some of the rift, even if Cruz has found himself teetering on the edge of another abyss. Cruz announced his about-turn on <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/tedcruzpage/posts/10154476728267464\">Facebook</a> on Friday, writing that defeating Clinton was all-important. After much soul-searching, he wrote, he would honour a pledge made last year to support whomever became the nominee. </p> <p>\u201cIn my view, by any measure Hillary Clinton\u2019s manifestly unfit to be president,\u201d Cruz said in Austin on Saturday.</p> <p>\u201cThe @SenTedCruz endorsement was a wonderful surprise. I greatly appreciate his support! We will have a tremendous victory on November 8th,\u201d Trump <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/779660413000617985\">tweeted</a> on Saturday. Only a few months earlier, in July,<a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2016/07/trump-no-accept-cruz-endorsement-226019\"> Trump said</a>: \u201cI don\u2019t want his endorsement. If he gives it, I will not accept it \u2026 nobody cares.\u201d</p> <p>With his political future seemingly in question and Trump\u2019s improved showing in recent polls putting added pressure on him to back the GOP candidate, Cruz tried to justify his decision to the Texas crowd. He argued he was being faithful to the party\u2019s choice and his conservative principles, even though he had previously made it clear he saw the two as incompatible.</p> <p>That meant conveying that even though he still feels Trump is an imperfect candidate, he would at least be a better defender of the US constitution and conservative values than Clinton. This delicate task \u2013 supporting Trump without praising him \u2013 required a verbal tightrope act, and Cruz often wobbled.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Whatever path I went down \u2026 there was no option that wouldn\u2019t result in people being deeply, deeply unhappy</p> <footer> <cite>Ted Cruz</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>During a question and answer session, a Muslim woman asked what she could expect from a Trump presidency. </p> <p>\u201cThat is a question you\u2019re going to have to ask yourself,\u201d Cruz said, to jeers from many in the audience, before he pivoted to a favourite topic, his belief that a strong leader is required to combat \u201cterrorism\u201d.</p> <p>He was also asked how, with a wife and two daughters, he could support a misogynist. </p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s a question I have wrestled with,\u201d Cruz said. \u201cAt the same time I want my daughters to have a country where they enjoy freedom of speech, where they enjoy rights under the bill of rights.\u201d</p> <p>Cruz\u2019s move risks undermining his self-proclaimed stance as an uncompromising, principled conservative who is unafraid to break ranks.

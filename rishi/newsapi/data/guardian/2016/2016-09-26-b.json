  "<p>Fran\u00e7ois Hollande <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/26/calais-migrant-camp-must-go-by-end-of-year-francois-hollande\" title=\"\">visited Calais</a> on Monday, his first visit since <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/may/06/francois-hollande-wins-french-election\" title=\"\">he came to office</a> in 2012. He promised that the sprawling, inadequate refugee camp would close \u201cby the end of the year\u201d. Last week, President Hollande\u2019s predecessor in the Elys\u00e9e palace, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-37428424\" title=\"\">Nicolas Sarkozy, also went to Calais</a>, making the kind of radical statements he believes will earn him the sympathy of far-right voters in the run-up to rightwing presidential primaries due in November. French politics is swerving towards populism; identity politics is overtaking most public discourse. And humanitarian concerns for the fate of the migrants in Calais risk being swamped by electoral politics.</p> <p>On his visit, Mr Sarkozy said France risked being \u201coverrun\u201d by migrants, the kind of rhetoric that sits squarely with the views of Marine Le Pen\u2019s Front National, Europe\u2019s largest far-right party, whose ideology is increasingly becoming the reference point in France\u2019s political battles. Mr Sarkozy has also suggested that anyone holding a French passport should accept that their ancestors were \u201cthe Gauls\u201d.</p> <p>France is still reeling from the impact of terrorism. Old tensions between ethnic or religious communities have been exacerbated by a wave of paranoia about minorities and migrants, and it is being cynically amplified by politicians. The left is not entirely innocent. President Hollande, who has yet to announce whether he will seek re-election, recently tried to cast himself as the republic\u2019s bulwark against xenophobia by trying, and failing, to rewrite the constitution to introduce measures to strip dual nationals of their citizenship. One far-left presidential candidate, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/11/jean-luc-melenchon-leftwing-enters-french-2017-presidential-race\" title=\"\">Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon,</a> has suggested refugees would do better to stay in their own countries.</p> <p>In this dive to the bottom, Ms Le Pen is the winner: polls indicate she is a racing certainty for the second round of the 2017 elections, while so severely is the left divided, its chances of reaching the second round currently appear close to zero. Like the rest of European social democracy, France\u2019s centre-left sees its base fast eroding. Centrist votes are now being courted by an outsider, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/07/frances-emmanuel-macron-launches-political-movement\" title=\"\">Emmanuel Macron</a>, the 38-year-old ex-banker who resigned last month as economics minister to launch the En Marche! (Forward!) political movement. He certainly fascinates the media, but his programme, like his intentions, remains vague.</p> <p>So the main battle is being waged on an increasingly populist right. The exception is Alain Jupp\u00e9, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/01/alain-juppe-from-cold-grey-automaton-to-saviour-of-france\" title=\"\">prime minister in the 1990s</a>, whose moderation could be the antidote to Mr Sarkozy\u2019s polarising postures. Mr Jupp\u00e9 believes a steady, principled and inclusive message is the best way to counter the Front National. Elsewhere in Europe, when mainstream politicians have pandered to anti-migrant sentiment, it\u2019s often the populist parties that have gained. That Mr Jupp\u00e9, a 72-year-old Gaullist, looks the best bet against Ms Le Pen says a lot about the weakness of the French left. The stakes have never been higher: and all Europe is watching to see if France\u2019s slide into populism can be averted.</p>",
  "<p>Donald Trump is winning his war on reality, and can thank America\u2019s biggest news outlets for it. Ahead of tonight\u2019s presidential debate, Trump\u2019s campaign has taken umbrage at the idea that NBC Nightly News anchor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/26/lester-holt-debate-moderator-trump-clinton-fact-check-election\">Lester Holt</a> might fact-check him, or venture to ask follow-up questions. \u201cAll that we\u2019re asking is that, if Donald Trump lies, that it\u2019s pointed out,\u201d Clinton\u2019s campaign manager, Robby Mook, modestly proposed on ABC\u2019s This Week yesterday. \u201cA lot of people,\u201d Trump warned in response, \u201care watching to see whether or not [Holt] succumbs to that pressure.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>In terms of fact-checking, the bar to doing my job is currently higher than for a man looking to lead the free world</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Even more bizarre than Trump\u2019s bullying is that <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2016/09/presidential-debate-fact-checking-228653\">networks have caved in to it</a>, rejecting calls for live, on-screen fact-checking (with the exception of Bloomberg TV). That task will now fall entirely to Holt, who\u2019s already facing pushback on the idea that he should intervene in the all-too-likely event that Trump spews nonsense.</p> <p>The Commission on Presidential Debates head, Janet Brown, told CNN that, \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea to get the moderator into essentially serving as the Encyclopedia Britannica,\u201d adding that it\u2019s the \u201ccandidates\u2019 job to fact-check each other \u2013 not the moderator\u2019s job to fact check them\u201d.</p> <p>Under normal circumstances, Brown\u2019s argument might hold up: like Lincoln and Douglas did in 1858, two candidates could come together and \u2013 with some loose facilitation \u2013 hash out their visions for America\u2019s future. But this is no normal election, and Trump is no normal candidate.</p> <p>Any journalist with half any eye toward the future of their profession should have more than a few concerns about what Trump\u2019s authoritarianism and aversion to basic accountability will have on their industry. Worth remembering here is that his campaign has seen a reporter <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/apr/14/trump-campaign-manager-corey-lewandowski-battery-charges\">forcibly grabbed</a>, the Washington Post banned and sexist insults launched at women journalists who dare cross him. If Trump does become president, it isn\u2019t too hard to imagine the White House press corps shrinking to Sean Hannity, Milo Yiannopolous and a handful of misogyny-fueled alt-right Redditors.</p> <p>Still, Trump isn\u2019t an aberration so much as an extension of the Republican party\u2019s toxic last 50 years. Even if he loses in November, the racist myth-making that Trump has brought to the mainstream\u2019s surface will linger on \u2013 and it will be the media\u2019s job to call it for what it is.</p> <p>As a young journalist who\u2019s spent most of her career writing for small progressive outlets, the bar to do my job \u2013 fact-checking myself, and being subject to fact-checking from others \u2013 is currently higher than the one set for a man looking to lead the free world. The bar for a Trump success coming into this debate, in fact, might be the lowest of any set for a presidential candidate in history. According to MSNBC, his only tasks tonight are to \u201cstop lying\u201d, \u201cshow humility\u201d and \u201cfill in gaps in his policy proposals\u201d.</p> <p>Clinton\u2019s job, conversely, is to out-compete an embodied YouTube comments section. There aren\u2019t two candidates facing off tonight. There\u2019s a presidential hopeful on one side of the stage, and an existential threat to democracy and the fourth estate on the other. If moderators choose not to intervene, it will be at their own risk.</p>",

Less than 24 hours later, a poll from the <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/politics/\">LA Times and USC Tracking</a> put Donald Trump 4% ahead. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/sep/24/trump-clinton-presidential-debate-styles-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/54e38\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2746232\"            data-video-name=\"Trump v Clinton: an analysis of debate styles \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"DNC, RNC, MSNBC, CBS, CNN, NBC, Getty, Fox News\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57e61353e4b03598d1ce816b\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/09/24/160924debfinal_h264_publish.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11572835&amp;format=video/m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11572835&amp;format=video/webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/sep/24/trump-clinton-presidential-debate-styles-video\">Trump v Clinton: an analysis of debate styles</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Both pollsters are considered credible, which makes this even more confusing. </p> <p>This series is intended to help you make sense of the ceaseless onslaught of numbers by taking a closer look at just one poll. But to start us off, I want to talk about a crucial tool in polling analysis: the <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/us/general_election_trump_vs_clinton-5491.html\">average</a>. </p> <p>The site <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/us/general_election_trump_vs_clinton-5491.html\">Real Clear Politics</a> (RCP) takes the average of all recent credible polls to create a moving average. Right now, RCP has Clinton with 45.9% of the vote while Trump has 43.8%, meaning that the Democratic nominee is ahead by 2.1%. </p> <p>Notice how Democrats aren\u2019t singing from the rooftops or gloating on Twitter? It\u2019s because 2.1% means nothing. </p> <p>It\u2019s so small, it could be down to errors in the ways that polls are conducted. It\u2019s so narrow, it could easily be reversed by individuals who change their mind or who are not honestly disclosing how they plan to vote. <br></p> <p>The takeaway? Going into <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/25/hillary-clinton-donald-trump-debate-gennifer-flowers\">tonight\u2019s debate</a>, the two candidates are neck and neck. </p> <p>But how much do debates matter? As my former colleague Lauren Leatherby has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/14/hillary-clinton-polls-convention-trump-election-data\">pointed out</a>, they have hurt candidates in the polls (see Barack Obama in 2012 and George Bush in 2004). But ultimately those candidates have been able to recover by election day (see, uh, the same candidates). </p> <p>So even if tonight produces a clear loser, the November vote is not a done deal. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/08/polling-debates/\" data-alt=\"Charts showing poll numbers for Romney and Kerry rising after debate wins.\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/08/polling-debates/\">Charts showing poll numbers for Romney and Kerry rising after debate wins.</a> </figure>  <ul> <li><em>You can get in touch with any questions you\u2019d like to see answered in this series by emailing mona.chalabi@theguardian.com</em><br></li> </ul>",
  "<p>Murders in the US rose<strong> </strong>10.8% last year, the biggest single-year percentage jump since 1971, according to data released Monday by the FBI.<br></p> <p>The rising violence was driven by an increase in the murders of black men, and by an increase in the number of gun murders. At least 900 more black men were killed in 2015 than in 2014, according to FBI data.</p> <p>There were roughly 1,500 additional firearm murders in 2015. No other type of weapon saw a comparable increase.

Murder and violent crime are still dramatically lower than they were at the peak of the violent crime wave of the late 1980s and early 1990s. The national murder rate last year was about half what it was in 1991. </p> <p>Even as murders rose, the country\u2019s overall crime rates did not increase as substantially. There was a 3.9% increase in the estimated number of violent crimes, but a 2.6% decrease in the estimated number of property crimes. </p> <p>Speaking at a violence prevention conference in Little Rock, Arkansas, attorney general Loretta Lynch said that, despite an \u201coverall increase\u201d in violent crime, 2015 still represented \u201cthe third-lowest year for violent crime in the past two decades\u201d.</p> <p>Her prepared remarks did not mention the 10.8% increase in murders. </p> <p>\u201cWe still have so much work to do,\u201d Lynch said. \u201cBut the report also reminds us of the progress that we are making. It shows that in many communities, crime has remained stable or even decreased from the historic lows reported in 2014.\u201d </p> <p>A third of the murder increase was driven by upticks in just ten larger cities: Baltimore, Chicago, Houston, Washington DC, Milwaukee, Philadelphia, Nashville, Kansas City, Missouri, St Louis, and Oklahoma City. </p> <p>Baltimore saw the greatest increase in murders, with 133 more people killed in 2015 than in 2014, pushing the city to its <a href=\"http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/baltimore-city/bs-md-ci-deadliest-year-20160101-story.html\">highest-ever murder rate</a>. Some of America\u2019s largest cities, including New York and Los Angeles, saw their murder numbers remain near historic lows in 2015.</p> <p>Black men and women face <a href=\"http://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/fv9311.pdf\">much less violence</a> today than they did in the early 1990s, belying Donald Trump\u2019s<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/20/donald-trump-african-american-communities-north-carolina\"> claim last week </a>that \u201cour African American communities are in the worst shape they\u2019ve ever been ... ever.

The supplementary homicide data includes a racial breakdown of murder victims submitted by most, but not all, law enforcement agencies.</p> <p>In 2015, black men were about nine times more likely to be murdered than white men, and black women were three times more likely to be murdered than white women, according to the analysis. </p> <p> Compared with the early 1990s, when the biggest contributors to the crime increase were the country\u2019s largest cities, \u201cit\u2019s slightly smaller cities that are having the biggest impact on rising murders\u201d, said John Pfaff, a Fordham University law professor who studies criminal sentencing and incarceration. The 10 cities that drove a third of the murder increase only account for 13% of total murders in the US, he noted. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/09/percent-firearm-homicides/\" data-alt=\"Guns uses for homicides\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/09/percent-firearm-homicides/\">Guns uses for homicides</a> </figure>  <p>There is no consensus yet on what factors might be driving a sharp increase in murders alone, but crime has become a politically charged election issue, and the uptick will probably figure in Monday\u2019s presidential debate. </p> <p>Crime trend experts said they expected politicians to overplay the significance of the new numbers and to react with \u201chysteria\u201d.<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/13/fbi-murder-rate-rise-donald-trump-presidential-debate\">FBI to reveal likely murder spike on same day as first presidential debate</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cYou lost 50lb. You gained back a couple.

Last year, 143 of the city\u2019s murder victims were black men and boys killed with guns, according to data from the police department. Local residents were not optimistic that a debate over a national murder increase would make them safer.</p> <p>\u201cHow do we use that data to elevate the consciousness of our community? How do we use that data to provide the opportunity for people to get meaningful jobs, with livable wages?\u201d said Jeffrey Boyd, a St Louis alderman who has lost three young male relatives to gun violence since 2003.</p> <p>\u201cI have no confidence in our federal government that they will provide an extra dime for anything.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/09/fbi-homicide-update/\" data-alt=\"Murders since 1960\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/09/fbi-homicide-update/\">Murders since 1960</a> </figure>  <p>Advocates for criminal justice reform said they worried the one-year uptick would fuel calls for a return to damaging, tough-on-crime policies. The US has <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/07/07/yes-u-s-locks-people-up-at-a-higher-rate-than-any-other-country/\">one of the highest incarceration rates</a> in the world, and both violent crime and mass incarceration disproportionately affect black Americans. </p> <p>The human cost of an overreaction to the murder increase could be \u201ca lot bigger\u201d than the toll of the rising violence itself, Pfaff said. He said he expected the increase to prompt calls for more arrests and more prison time. </p> <p>The wealthier white Americans whose votes help determine crime policy \u201cdon\u2019t tend to be those who feel the costs\u201d, Pfaff said. </p> <p><strong></strong> </p> <p>Early data from large cities this year suggests that 2015\u2019s uptick in murders may not be a single-year increase. A <a href=\"https://www.brennancenter.org/publication/crime-2016-preliminary-analysis\">report from the Brennan Center</a>, analyzing murders in 30 large cities this year, projected an additional 13.1% increase in the murder rates for those cities in 2016, with most of that increase being driven by just three cities: Chicago, Baltimore and Houston. Together, the national large city increases in 2015 and 2016 were projected to drive a 31.5% increase in the murder rate compared with 2014. </p> <p>\u201cThere is no evidence of a national murder wave, yet increases in these select cities are indeed a serious problem,\u201d the Brennan Center report concluded. Chicago alone has seen a close to 50% increase in shootings and murders this year. </p> <p>The FBI director, James Comey, has repeatedly drawn a connection between increasing violence and \u201ca change in how the police are doing their work\u201d due to the continuing nationwide protests over police killings of black citizens. </p> <p>\u201cIn today\u2019s YouTube world, are officers reluctant to get out of their cars and do the work that controls violent crime?\u201d he asked in 2015, describing \u201ca chill wind that has blown through law enforcement over the last year\u201d.</p> <p>In May, he suggested the increasing violence could be related to \u201cmarginal pullbacks by lots and lots of police officers\u201d, and said that police leaders across the country had seen a change in how their officers do their jobs. </p> <p>Barack Obama\u2019s administration has repeatedly rejected any connection between protests over police violence and increasing murders. But a Justice Department-funded report on the 2015 murder increase concluded that there <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/15/ferguson-effect-homicide-rates-us-crime-study\">might be some connection</a> between public anger over police killings and an increase in community violence. </p> <p>Criminologists caution that crime and violence are highly local, and driven by a tangle of so many different factors that it is nearly impossible to say exactly what causes a given increase or decrease. Crime statistics are also easy to over-dramatize. Murder numbers in a small town, for instance, can be dramatically distorted by a single incident with multiple casualties. A town that typically sees a murder a year will see a 100% increase in murders if it ends the year with two. </p> <p>New York City, which saw more than 2,000 murders a year in the early 1990s, saw just 352 last year, according to New York police department data. Los Angeles, which saw more than 1,000 murders a year in the early 1990s, has seen fewer than 300 in recent years. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e56e37e8dcb6826254bcb9285a380f860fd29d67\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e56e37e8dcb6826254bcb9285a380f860fd29d67/0_176_4200_2520/1000.jpg\" alt=\"donald trump\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Donald Trump has attacked the Obama administration for a \u2018rollback of criminal enforcement\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sara D Davis/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Trump has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/23/trump-vision-of-violence-city-homicides-obama\">blamed Obama</a> and his administration for a \u201crollback of criminal enforcement\u201d that has made the country less safe. </p> <p> This criticism is not supported by the FBI\u2019s murder data. Murders have declined through most of Obama\u2019s two terms, with a serious uptick only in his second-to-last year in office. Between 2008, the year before Obama took office, and 2014, murders dropped, with 2,000 fewer Americans murdered in 2014 than in the last year of George W Bush\u2019s administration. </p> <p>Crime experts also cautioned that a single-year uptick was not a trend. \u201cIt\u2019s the curse of success. Because we\u2019re doing better, a similar absolute change will look worse,\u201d Pfaff said.</p> <p>Despite a general downward trend over the past decades, nationwide murder numbers have increased in some recent years. In 2005, for instance, murders increased by 3.67%, according to FBI data, then increased a further 3% in 2006.</p> <p>In October 2006, the Police Executive Research Forum released a <a href=\"http://www.policeforum.org/assets/docs/Critical_Issues_Series/a%20gathering%20storm%20-%20violent%20crime%20in%20america%202006.pdf\">report </a>warning the country about \u201ca gathering storm of violent crime that threatens to erode the considerable crime reductions of the past\u201d. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>\u201cViolent crime in many of the nation\u2019s cities, from one coast to the other, has begun to spike upwards,\u201d the report argued. \u201cThe percentage of violent crime in America had the largest single-year increase in 14 years.\u201d</p> <p>The next year, murders resumed a downward trend.</p> <p>\u201cEveryone started freaking out. It was a two-year thing,\u201d Butts said.</p> <p>Criminal justice reform is \u201cone of the greatest civil rights efforts of our time\u201d, said Rashad Robinson, the executive director of Color of Change, the nation\u2019s largest online racial justice organization. <br></p> <p>Trump and other politicians, he said, \u201chave started us down a path to undo long-fought gains in criminal justice reform, and we should not let the positive momentum be derailed by a lack of facts, by fear, by racism and by demagoguery\u201d.</p> <p>Even Heather Mac Donald, a conservative crime analyst who saluted Trump\u2019s \u201claw and order\u201d focus, said in July that it was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/23/trump-vision-of-violence-city-homicides-obama\">inaccurate</a> to blame federal crime policy for murder increases. </p> <p>In general, the president and the federal government have very little power to determine the country\u2019s response to crime and violence. The country has 18,000 local law enforcement agencies of different kinds, including more than <a href=\"http://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/lpd13ppp.pdf\">12,000 local police departments</a>, which are largely independent from federal control. Most power to determine crime policy is in the hands of state legislators, and local mayors, police chiefs and prosecutors. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Trump and Clinton have outlined competing visions of violence prevention,<strong> </strong>with Trump touting a tough-on-crime approach, and Clinton focusing on the need to reform police treatment of black Americans and reduce gun violence through tougher gun control laws. </p> <p>These contrasting views have symbolic importance, but neither Trump nor Clinton would have much direct influence, as president, over how cities and states address violence. The justice department can use federal funding as a carrot or stick for local departments to adopt different policies, but this is a fairly limited tool for pushing top-down changes.</p> <p><em>Jamiles Lartey contributed reporting from St Louis</em></p>",

Reading is for fun and for me that\u2019s a big deal, but it also sharpens the nose for the unmistakable odour of bullshit,\u201d said King.</p> <p>\u201cWe live in a society where many believe that libraries and other cultural endeavours, everything from <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shakespeare_in_the_Park_festivals\">Shakespeare in the Park</a> to poetry slams and free concerts, are of minor importance. As if learning to think is a thing that just happens naturally, like learning to walk. Believe me, it\u2019s not. Learning to think is the result of hard work and steady effort.\u201d</p> <p>This \u201cdisregard\u201d for culture, said King, leads to \u201cilliteracy or semi-literacy in a national population where large numbers of people are lazy thinkers without any of that nose for bullshit\u201d.</p> <p>This means, he said, that politicians \u201care allowed to slide by with generalities rather than specifics\u201d, and \u201celected officials who are supposed to be the best, the smartest, often resort to outright misinformation\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cNote the way that Donald Trump falls back on saying this-and-such is going to be huge or this-and-such is beautiful. Any writer or reader worth his salt will say those words by themselves mean absolutely nothing,\u201d he said. \u201cTrump makes me wince not as a Democrat, which I am, but as a writer and reader. Listening to his speeches is like listening to a piano fall down stairs. It\u2019s all dissonance and no music. God, I\u2019m going to miss Obama \u2026 There was poetry, always music, in what he said.\u201d</p> <p>In an interview with Ron Charles at the Washington Post, also this weekend, King admitted to being frightened that Trump might actually win this November.</p> <p>\u201cA Trump presidency scares me more than anything else,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/09/24/master-of-horror-fiction-stephen-king-says-trump-presidency-scares-me-to-death/\">he told Charles</a>. \u201cI would have laughed three or four months ago, but I think that Trump has a real shot. I think that Hillary Clinton has been a lacklustre candidate, frankly, and there\u2019s been a sense of entitlement about her campaign like: \u2018Ah, it\u2019s my turn and I\u2019m running against a buffoon therefore I am already president.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>King, author of novels from It to The Shining, said he believed that the key to the situation was fear. \u201cWe\u2019re afraid the government is going to take away our guns, we\u2019re afraid that Mexico is going to invade the United States, we\u2019re afraid of this, we\u2019re afraid of that, we\u2019re afraid of taxes, we\u2019re afraid of transgender bathrooms \u2013 the whole thing,\u201d he told Charles. \u201cAs long as people are fearful, it\u2019s hard to have a rational discussion.\u201d </p> <p>Speaking at the festival, King also singled out the governor of Maine, his own state, Paul LePage, for criticism. LePage <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/paul-lepage-ziki-fly_us_56c4eaf1e4b0b40245c8e429\">said earlier this year that asylum seekers were bringing the \u201cziki\u201d [LePage\u2019s words] fly to Maine</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/31/paul-lepage-maine-trump-like-governor\">Paul LePage: is this one outburst too many for Maine's Trump-like governor?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThe statement is mind-boggling in its own right. That governor LePage might have believed it is more so. That many accept it as a fact is the most mind-boggling of all,\u201d said King, urging his listeners to support reading and libraries, because \u201cthe ability to think clearly and logically leads to good decision-making, and I believe that the ability to think clearly grows along with the ability to read.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFor my wife and me, libraries were a lifeline at a time when we could rarely afford books \u2026 and the same is true for others today. We live in a rural state where many, most even, small-town libraries are flat broke. It\u2019s because the small towns can\u2019t afford to support them; and the reason they can\u2019t is because the people in those towns vote for the dough to go to other places. Libraries are not seen as a priority when there are potholes in the road. Sure, cash is tight but it always is,\u201d said King. \u201cThe question becomes how to grow literacy in America, and supporting those small-town libraries is the way my wife and I chose to do it.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>It is a curiously grotesque image. While a tightly packed crowd all took selfies with the Democratic party\u2019s US presidential candidate, a sly photographer slipped around the side.

They all have their backs turned to her while they hold up phones to take pictures of \u2026 themselves, with the blue-suited HRC in the background. No one seems to want a picture just of the candidate. It\u2019s a selfie or nothing. Meanwhile, waving and smiling, Clinton cuts an eerily isolated figure on her little stage, up against the wall, separated from the selfie-shooters by a railing, like a <a href=\"http://uk.phaidon.com/agenda/art/articles/2013/february/08/the-truth-behind-francis-bacons-screaming-popes/\">Francis Bacon Pope</a> in his glass booth.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/26/hillary-clinton-presidential-debate\">Hillary: here\u2019s what you need to do to ace the debate | Carla Sorey-Reed</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Cue <a href=\"https://mobile.twitter.com/StephenMangan/status/780321160508628992\">jeremiads on Twitter</a> against our stupid, selfish, vacuous age. The dark side of digital democracy is so dark that we can\u2019t even see ourselves. We rage against social media, on social media, lament the selfie \u2026 on Twitter, a social media platform famous for restricting its profound essayists to 140 characters. Uh-huh. Yet there may be more to this picture than a grim revelation of the idiocy of our age. It may not quite be the hellish vision of democracy\u2019s death in the echo chamber of digital self-regard that it superficially appears to be.</p> <p>At least I hope so, because Hillary Rodham Clinton is currently the last best hope for western civilisation, the final wall against the coming Age of Trump. If the image this picture seems to present is true, we\u2019re all damned. Looking lost and ignored as people turn their backs on her to preserve their own faces for posterity \u2013 me with that politician! \u2013 the only sane choice in the 2016 US presidential election is visibly lost in trivial-mindedness. What hope of getting her arguments across if the crowd is too distracted by selfies to listen? And if the criterion of victory is going to be celebrity impact in a low-attention-span culture, the horrific truth shows its orange face: in a race to the bottom of modern culture, Trump cannot lose.</p> <p>Yet this picture may not be as bleak a comment on the modern world as all that. It takes a side-view that reveals the comedy of contemporary mores \u2013 but are these people really behaving so very badly? Imagine a photograph of the same scene taken from a different angle, facing the crowd of selfie-seekers full-on. It might be rather moving and impressive. It would show Hillary Clinton in the distance, with a mass of admirers who all face the camera as they take their pictures with her.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/sep/26/millennials-presidential-debate-trump-hillary-clinton-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/54cce\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2745023\"            data-video-name=\"What millennials want to hear from the first presidential debate \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57e57a1fe4b03598d1ce7f96\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/09/23/160922hofstra_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/09/23/160922hofstra.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/09/23/160922hofstra_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/sep/26/millennials-presidential-debate-trump-hillary-clinton-video\">What millennials want to hear from the first presidential debate</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>For who are we actually seeing here?

At the Labour party conference, people are reportedly queueing up to have selfies with Jeremy Corbyn and other heroes of the hour. I myself treasure my selfie with Len McCluskey.</p> <p>The same thing is going on here. Taking a selfie has now become the natural way for many people to mark important events, from dates to nights out to weddings \u2013 why not great political moments as well? Traditionally, portraits were painted of rulers and leaders at weighty historical moments.

Every single photographer in that crowd may be a PhD in political theory who is taking a selfie ironically to send to fellow faculty members at Princeton. In a culture that licenses and promotes stupid acts you can\u2019t assume everyone who goes along with convention is stupid, let alone a coldhearted narcissist.</p> <p>We won\u2019t know the truth about this picture, and about our time, until the US election results are in. This American election may produce hell or hope. It may leave the entire world in the grip of a very dangerous man, or it may mean that the US gets its first female president to follow its first black president. Our digital age is also being tested. Has the escalation of social media, including the endless sharing of selfies, degraded and destroyed proper political debate? Is the echo chamber of sharing similar views on Twitter and Facebook empowering monsters to destroy democracy?</p> <p>If that is the apocalyptic truth of our age, this picture is an allegory of it. As they concentrate on sharing their selfies with their friends, these people turn their backs on reality. But maybe it\u2019s not that bad. Maybe they sincerely want to record a great historical moment. And maybe they will be part of Hillary Clinton\u2019s majority and the democratic world\u2019s recovery of reason.</p>",

As Dean Garfield, president and CEO of the Washington DC-based technology industry advocacy group the Information Technology Industry Council (ITIC), points out, it is unusual for trade agreements such as the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/internationaltrade\">Trans Pacific Partnership</a> (TPP) to take center stage in a presidential election.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>What your industry does, if you can call it an industry, is bullshit.

Public statements by both nominees on key issues, as well as their publicly available lobbying records, have been documented by the Washington DC-based Center for Responsive Politics (CRP) and its Opensecrets.org site, which together provide a rich trove of data about the issues major technology companies care about in the context of this year\u2019s elections. </p> <h2>Google: anti-competitiveness, labor issues and copyright</h2> <p>According to CRP, the number one technology company spender on lobbying is Alphabet, the parent company of Google. So far in 2016 (up to the last CRP update on 9 August), Alphabet has already spent $8.04m on lobbying \u2013 putting it on pace to spend a little less than the $16.66m it spent for the whole of 2015. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/dec/17/google-lobbyists-congress-antitrust-brussels-eu\">Revealed: how Google enlisted members of US Congress it bankrolled to fight $6bn EU antitrust case</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The top issues Alphabet attempted to tackle with that money were copyright, patent and trademark issues (a common item for all the tech companies on the list), labor, antitrust and workplace issues, consumer product safety, science and technology \u2013 and homeland security.

The company used that money to lobby on issues around computers and technology, taxes, consumer product safety, transportation and trade. </p> <p>It was also no surprise to see Amazon lobbying on issues related to aviation, airlines and airports \u2013 given its involvement in both the use of drones and shipping goods by air. </p> <h2>Facebook: national security, intelligence and patent law</h2> <p>Facebook is the third-largest lobbying spender, according to CRP, spending $4.97m so far this year. And it has a lot of government issues to care about. </p> <p>Homeland security, intelligence, computers and information technology, copyright, patent and trademark issues \u2013 and taxes \u2013 make up the top five issues on which it has chosen to lobby. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/may/05/us-tech-firms-visas-hillary-clinton-donald-trump-immigration\">Facebook, Apple and Amazon to lobby next president over tech worker visas</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Amongst the bills on which Facebook has offered comment is the \u201cRequiring Reporting of Online Terrorist Activity Act\u201d \u2013 which the Washington-based Center for Democracy &amp; Technology criticized as requiring \u201call providers of Internet communications services to report to government authorities when they obtain \u2018actual knowledge\u2019 of apparent \u2018terrorist activity\u2019 on their services\u201d. </p> <p>Facebook CEO and founder Mark Zuckerberg has also been very active in lobbying for immigration reform.

David Axelrod, the former chief strategist and senior advisor to President Barack Obama, has a great story in his 2015 memoir, <em>Believer,</em> in which he describes a phone conversation with the late Apple cofounder, Steve Jobs \u2013 one in which Jobs appeared to be deeply unimpressed with political media consultants, despite Jobs having requested the meeting after a personal visit from then Senator Barack Obama to Apple\u2019s offices in Cupertino. </p> <p>Axelrod quotes Jobs as saying: \u201cWhat your industry does, if you can call it an industry, is bullshit.

Not surprisingly, its top five issues for lobbying were tied to taxes, copyright, patent and trademark, telecommunications, computers and information technology \u2013 and trade. </p> <p>The copyright issues are understandable given the huge legal battles that Apple has engaged in \u2013 most notably with Samsung \u2013 to preserve the unique elements of its products (a case is before the US supreme court this month).</p>",
  "<p>You can\u2019t win an election with a debate, but you can certainly lose one. And with the polls this close, the candidates\u2019 task is not about preaching to the choir; it\u2019s about capturing that elusive 10% that will ultimately decide the election.</p> <p>There are nervous Democrats all over the country. I know because I am one. As a black woman with a black husband and son, I deem a Donald Trump presidency a very real threat to my lifeblood and livelihood. I also work as a speaker coach, and was part of a team hired to train podium speakers at the 2016 Democratic national convention. I worked closely with Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Angela Bassett, Senator Cory Booker, and Governor Howard Dean.</p> <p>I\u2019m not advising Hillary, but if I were, here\u2019s what I\u2019d say to her.</p> <h2>The audience will be emotionally fact-checking</h2> <p>You have staff aplenty making sure you know what to say about your campaign platforms, policy stances, and social positions. But here\u2019s the catch. People can read the <em>what</em>. We\u2019re watching the debates to see and hear the <em>how</em>: how you interact with your opponent, with the host, and with us, the audience. We\u2019re emotionally fact-checking. What about you represents us?</p> <p>I\u2019ve heard it said that you\u2019re not a natural public speaker. But you\u2019re a good conversationalist, and you know what? Public speaking and holding a conversation aren\u2019t that far apart. Trust yourself as a communicator. Shrink the room.</p> <h2>Use the power of storytelling</h2> <p>In a memorable <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUV4Ha_Tf_4\">video</a>, shown at the Democratic national convention, you spoke of your mother being left home alone overnight at age four and walking by herself to a corner cafe to get food. You took your time, you allowed the details of the story to unfold, your emotion was contained yet visible, and through the natural pauses and silences of storytelling, you were able to transfer ownership of the universality of the emotion to the audience \u2013 all in 30 seconds.</p> <p>That story is the cornerstone of my understanding of who you are. You created something more meaningful and stickier than any sound bite \u2013 a story bite. Practice concise stories about yourself or specific individuals that you\u2019ve met on the campaign trail that you can share during the debate to dovetail back into your message. And a bonus: stories are very hard to interrupt.</p> <h2>Put Trump in a trick bag </h2> <p>At Trump\u2019s first interruption, turn to him and graciously say, \u201cI think the audience would appreciate it if we could agree not to interrupt one another. Can we agree on that?\u201d If he agrees, then you have successfully managed him. If he doesn\u2019t, he looks like an uncivilized bully.</p> <p>This one\u2019s a little harder, but it would be a thing of beauty if you could provoke Trump into putting his thin-skinned quick temper or flip-flopping on full display. Perhaps in response to a question about gun control: \u201cWhat kind of person brags that he could shoot someone and not lose voters?\u201d</p> <p>If Trump accuses you of playing \u201cthe woman card\u201d \u2013 own it! We want to see the \u201cgrace and grit\u201d that Meryl Streep referred to when speaking of you at the convention. Seize control of the game: \u201cIn case you haven\u2019t noticed, Donald, it\u2019s the hand I was dealt. I\u2019ve played it all my life, sometimes with long odds, which makes the victories won even sweeter\u201d.</p> <h2>Do eye contact \u2013 well</h2> <p>During the 3 October 2012, presidential debate, Barack Obama assumed he was off-camera and could safely study his notes while Mitt Romney was answering a question. Instead, Obama was televised non-stop on a split screen. That night, we learned that looking down, even when not speaking, does not inspire confidence. </p> <p>During the primary debates you occasionally fell into the trap of holding \u201cschool teacher\u201d eye contact \u2013 characterized by sharp eye movement intended to rein in an undisciplined class. Darting eyes crack like a whip and smack of an older, judgmental disciplinarian \u2013 a look that\u2019s probably not endearing to millennials. Instead, smoothly and slowly, first turn your head and your eyes will follow.</p> <p>Respond with your head up and with steady eye contact. In the primary debates, Bernie was a master at this. He rarely, if ever, looked down. If he didn\u2019t have an immediate answer, with his head up and eyes steady, he would first validate the question, then hedge with a bit of context while he thought about his answer.</p> <p>Looking down only rarely suggests humility or gathering one\u2019s thoughts. Instead, when the stakes are high, looking down is more likely to be interpreted as a lack of confidence or commitment to what you\u2019re saying \u2013 or condescension, remorse or guilt. None of that is what you\u2019re aiming for in the debate, so keep your head up. Head up, not chin up \u2013 there\u2019s a difference.</p> <h2>Remember who this is about</h2> <p>Most of all, Hillary, remember that the debate is not about Donald. It\u2019s not even about you. It\u2019s about us. Just talk to us. And let us see that you\u2019re enjoying the conversation. </p>",
  "<p>Leading shares are falling back on a cocktail of concerns.</p> <p>Investors are nervous ahead of the debate later between US presidential candidates Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, as well as uncertain over the state of play of Brexit. On top of that, oil producers are meeting in Algeria with the possibility of an agreement to support prices, albeit a slim one, which as seen crude prices edge higher.</p> <p>The biggest faller is <strong>InterContinental Hotels</strong>, down 142p or 4% to \u00a331.43 after Morgan Stanley cut its recommendation from equal weight to underweight on worries about the outlook for the US.

Meanwhile, multiple signals are flashing that the US hotel cycle is peaking. We cut RevPAR forecasts, partly offset by an assumed $500m buyback, but IHG looks fully valued so we move underweight.</p> <p>IHG has enjoyed a strong re-rating. [It] has an attractive and resilient business model, with an attractive 5.6% free cash flow yield, and M&amp;A is a theme, but it has historically traded at a discount to peers, partly as its RevPAR and net system growth have underperformed. </p> <p>... meanwhile there are multiple red flags over the US hotel cycle ... US RevPAR growth has been slowing for some time (2014 8.3%, 2015 6.4%, year to date 2.7%), and we think it will weaken further given declining occupancy, anaemic rate growth, accelerating supply growth, one-fifth of submarkets in RevPAR decline, \u2018compression nights\u2019 analysis suggesting Airbnb now having an impact, and independent hotels outperforming brands. If we match these occupancy/RevPAR trends to the last two cycles, IHG shares are holding up much better. </p> <p>IHG is a quality operator, but when RevPAR turns, all hotel stocks de-rate sharply, which in the last downturn was to 8-9 times EBITDA (versus IHG currently on 12 time 2017e). M&amp;A speculation may continue to provide support, but we think that IHG sees itself as more of a buyer than a seller, and it no longer owns \u2018trophy\u2019 assets.</p> </blockquote> <p>Overall the <strong>FTSE 100</strong> is currently down 81.03 points at 6828.40, with banks under pressure.

The rally in markets started to come unstuck on Friday after investors became significantly more bearish about the prospect of any OPEC deal, with short positions escalating sharply. While oil prices have bounced slightly this morning, on hopes that Saudi Arabia may be prepared to cut output at a later date, fears are growing that oversupply in the oil market will subdue prices for the foreseeable future.</p> <p>Possibly the most significant risk event for markets this year, the US election is already compelling and tonight\u2019s first televised US Presidential debate is likely to prove must-watch TV. So far, the only markets and sectors to pay much attention to the upcoming election are US healthcare stocks and Mexican assets - but with a little over a month before November\u2019s vote, investors need to start trying to establish what the result might mean for markets more widely.</p> </blockquote>",

Episode one sees them settle in, with leader Nick Knowles \u2013 who looks like he has beef and cigarettes for breakfast \u2013 joshing with a couple of DIY SOS builders he\u2019s brought along.

This first episode sees the philosopher explore whether we can ever justify killing, as well as dissecting Jeremy Bentham\u2019s theory of \u201cthe greatest happiness of the greatest number\u201d.

Live from Hofstra University on Long Island, Matt Frei presents coverage of the first of three scheduled face-offs and, considering Trump\u2019s ability to freestyle absolute gibberish, it should be both entertaining and terrifying. <em>Graeme Virtue</em></p> <h2>Film choice</h2> <p><strong>Water For Elephants </strong>(Francis Lawrence, 2011) 6.40pm, Film4<br>Old-fashioned charm floods this depression-era romantic drama, adapted from Sara Gruen\u2019s bestseller.

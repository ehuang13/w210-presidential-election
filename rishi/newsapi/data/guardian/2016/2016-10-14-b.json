Sure, his administration was plagued with scandal, assassination attempts and his daughter\u2019s abduction, but when it came down to policy decisions, he always made the tough calls and did them for the most high-minded reasons. If America could actually elect a fictional character, it would be this one. <strong>Approval rating: 100%</strong></p> <h2>David Palmer (Dennis Haysbert), 24</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ae9a45da7cad4fbe72b98e3cf829361114213b06\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ae9a45da7cad4fbe72b98e3cf829361114213b06/0_466_2046_1228/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dennis Haysbert.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Of course television had its first black president before the nation had its own, but from the very first hour of this action show, Palmer\u2019s life was in danger because of it. You would think that people suspected he wasn\u2019t born in this country or something. While he always managed to escape with the help of Jack Bauer, he eventually quit his re-election campaign and let a Republican become president. It was a fatal mistake, because that man\u2019s vice-president would eventually conspire to kill Palmer. Oh, and his personal life was a mess between his scheming wife, his chief of staff brother, and a lover whose scandal nearly derailed his campaign. <strong tabindex=\"-1\">Approval rating: 40%</strong></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/oct/12/trump-dangerous-clinton-mirrors-the-most-shocking-presidential-attack-ads-ever-aired\">The mud-slingers: the most shocking presidential attack ads ever aired</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>Conrad Dalton (Keith Carradine), Madam Secretary</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f0ba990df776006b7416aaa60dbea28530d0f85c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f0ba990df776006b7416aaa60dbea28530d0f85c/0_59_1333_800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"President of the bowties.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>The worst part about Dalton, honestly, is his collection of bowties.

Just as this bumbling, self-obsessed politician was ill-equipped for VP, she was equally ill-equipped to be president. Luckily, her term only lasted eight months. During her re-election campaign, Meyer found herself in an unprecedented electoral college tie, which eventually led to, through a series of hilarious coincidences, her being ousted from office entirely. She may be a total screw-up, but at least she\u2019s <em>our</em> total screw-up. <strong>Approval rating: 90% (but really 0%)</strong></p> <h2>Allison Taylor (Cherry Jones), 24</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1c6c7b4e5e8373d85864d61446a545ef65107b47\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1c6c7b4e5e8373d85864d61446a545ef65107b47/0_80_1533_919/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The idealistic president.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>This long-running show had many presidents both good and bad, but none were as idealistic as Taylor.

  "<p>Contrary to the throaty moans of TV pundits and the aggrieved posts clogging your social media feeds, there is a miraculous silver lining to this methodical meat grinder of a presidential election. Something magnificent has occurred that only a once-in-a-lifetime pile of spoiled bologna like Donald Trump could manifest. The pearl-clutching, holy-rolling conservative media is exposing itself. Not literally, even if <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/aug/08/roger-ailes-sexual-harassment-accusations-fox-tv-producer\">Roger Ailes</a> has thought about it once or twice after one too many highballs at the country club.</p> <p>Former Boston Red Sox pitcher <a href=\"http://www.philly.com/philly/blogs/real-time/Curt-Schilling-attempts-to-defend-Trumps-sexual-comments-about-a-10-year-old-girl.html\">Curt Schilling has found a new appreciation for his very \u201cbeautiful\u201d son </a>and sees no problem marveling at the attractiveness of underage girls. Rush Limbaugh, once a man committed to making Bill Clinton pay for his marital infidelity, has seen the light and now does not blink twice at stepping out on your wife<a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2016/10/rush-limbaugh-defends-trump-assault-229751\"> if they \u201clet you do anything\u201d</a>. Observing this is like watching a cat try to escape a burlap sack. The moral majority is struggling to find comfort with the most immoral candidate they could find.</p> <p>Now, seeing that their position is uniquely untenable, they are gamely attempting to claim that it is the Democrats who are the true hypocrites. After all, <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2016/10/rush-limbaugh-defends-trump-assault-229751\">Obama listens to hip-hop and has invited rappers to the White House</a>. Ann Coulter tweeted that Michelle Obama should be ashamed of herself for chastising Trump while giving credence to the notion that Beyonc\u00e9 is a role model for young girls, even though she has, in song, <a href=\"http://www.dailydot.com/irl/ann-coulter-beyonce-twitter/\">declared that her is \u201cpussy curvalicious, served delicious\u201d</a>. Only human strawman Ann Coulter could find any equivalency between extoling the virtues of one\u2019s genitals and claiming someone else\u2019s as yours to do with as you please \u2013 and in any case, that line (from Feeling Myself) was delivered by Nicki Minaj.</p> <p>The thing is, Jay Z, Beyonc\u00e9, and Kanye West are not running for president (yet). No one is wondering if Fetty Wap is fit to run the most powerful military in the world or knows how to solve the Syrian refugee crisis. I have yet to find much support for a last-minute J Cole write-in candidacy, though I feel like DJ Khaled is subtly preparing to run for his local school board.</p> <p>If the above sounds preposterous to you, try to remember how we all felt when Donald Trump announced his candidacy for president. It seemed like the universe was taking the collective piss out of all of us, declaring that any dimwit possessing enough Twitter followers and a penchant for personal embarrassment could be a viable option for the highest office in the land. This ambulatory piece of salmon jerky can offer himself up for public service and it\u2019s treated as totally normal. The only thing Donald Trump has ever done that remotely resembles a selfless act was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/07/billy-bush-donald-trump-lewd-comments-tape-arianne-zucker\">when he inadvertently got Billy Bush fired from the Today Show</a>.</p> <p>Beyonc\u00e9 is not running for president, but Donald Trump is, which is why his words are the ones that matter here. The line for what is acceptable has moved so far, so fast, that the idea of a rapper in the White House should not be so unpleasant to the average Bible-humping conservative. As the Republican party further normalizes outrageous behavior by supporting their wholly unqualified, monstrous candidate, they welcome the very thing they seem so afraid of. </p> <p>There is no such thing as morality in politics any more. What we define as \u201cgood\u201d is irrelevant. Conservative pundits have torn down the wall between them and the popular culture with a glee and aplomb that borders on mania. People who claim faith like Ralph Reed have willfully turned themselves into bigger jokes than they were four years ago. When Desiigner becomes president in 12 years and changes the lyrics of the Star-Spangled Banner to some mindless gibberish about BMWs, it will be their fault.</p>",

The disrespect of our ambitions and intellect. The belief that you can do anything you want to a woman. It is cruel. It\u2019s frightening. And the truth is, it hurts.\u201d</p> <p>In her 25-minute speech, Obama did not mention black women or women of color but she didn\u2019t have to. That it was her \u2013 a black mother of two daughters she raised in a \u201chouse built by slaves\u201d \u2013 who delivered the definitive rebuke to Trump and his treatment of women registered the point that all women are vulnerable to sexism, sexual harassment and assault. </p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t stop thinking about this,\u201d Obama said. \u201cIt has shaken me to my core in a way that I couldn\u2019t have predicted. So while I\u2019d love nothing more than to pretend like this isn\u2019t happening, and to come out here and do my normal campaign speech, it would be dishonest and disingenuous to me to just move on to the next thing like this was all just a bad dream.\u201d</p> <p>More than a year before the tape\u2019s release and the allegations, Trump lost his temper over a debate question about his history of making offensive and lewd remarks about women. In the months between, Trump attacked a grieving Gold Star mother, who is Muslim, and body-shamed a Latina beauty queen who revealed that he had called her \u201cMiss Piggy\u201d.<br></p> <p>All the while Republicans largely stood by his side. <a href=\"http://nymag.com/thecut/2016/10/women-needed-to-hear-michelle-obamas-new-hampshire-speech.html\">As many have noted</a>, Republicans and the media only drew the line on his behavior <a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/2016/10/07/social-media-reacts-to-trumps-remarks-about-women.html\">in response to instances of impropriety </a>\u2013 and later allegations of sexual assault \u2013 against white women.</p> <p>The Obamas, as articulated often by her husband, have long believed that the \u201carc of the moral universe\u201d bends away from people like Donald Trump, but the 2016 election has surely tested their faith. At turns, it\u2019s hard not to see 2016 and the rise of Donald Trump as a referendum on history, a sharp rebuke to the candidacy of the first black president and a blockade against the first woman president. In so many ways, he is everything Obama and Clinton are not. </p> <p>\u201cIt reminds us of stories we heard from our mothers and grandmothers about how, back in their day, the boss could say and do whatever he pleased to the women in the office, and even though they worked so hard, jumped over every hurdle to prove themselves, it was never enough,\u201d Obama said. \u201cWe thought all of that was ancient history, didn\u2019t we \u2026 but here we are, in 2016, and we\u2019re hearing these exact same things every day on the campaign trail.\u201d</p> <p>Michelle Obama, who has carefully cultivated an everywoman appeal, is indisputably Clinton\u2019s most powerful \u2013 and popular \u2013 surrogate on the trail. And perhaps only Trump could have brought together the former rivals and first ladies \u2013 one who cannot wait to leave the White House and the other who cannot wait to get back in. </p> <p>During the second presidential debate on Sunday, Trump tried to step between the women. He <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/oct/11/donald-trump/donald-trump-base-claim-about-michelle-obama-criti/\">falsely</a> claimed that Obama had run \u201csome of the most vicious commercials I\u2019ve ever seen\u201d against Clinton during the 2008 Democratic primary. </p> <p>\u201cYou talk about friend? Go back and take a look at those commercials,\u201d Trump said.</p> <p>But to anyone paying attention, the attack on their friendship felt empty. Obama\u2019s New Hampshire speech was her sixth campaign event for Clinton in a month. In battleground states across the country, Obama has aggressively made the case for Clinton in a way no one else \u2013 not even Bill Clinton \u2013 has been able to crystallize. </p> <p>\u201cIn Hillary, we have a candidate who has dedicated her life to public service, someone who has waited her turn and helped out while waiting,\u201d Obama said on Thursday. \u201cShe is an outstanding mother. She has raised a phenomenal young woman. She is a loving, loyal wife. She\u2019s a devoted daughter who cared for her mother until her final days. </p> <p>\u201cAnd if any of us had raised a daughter like Hillary Clinton, we would be so proud. We would be proud.\u201d </p>",

The clearest indication of what his campaign thinks in private came this week, when <a href=\"http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2016/10/13/trump-campaign-withdraws-from-virginia/\">aides confirmed reports</a> they were pulling staff and advertising out of Virginia to preserve resources for battleground states where the campaign still thinks there is a chance of turning things around in the 24 days left.</p> <p>With diverse swing states like Virginia and Colorado now firmly off any realistic target list, Trump\u2019s sole remaining path to victory relies on winning Ohio, Florida, Pennsylvania and North Carolina, states where he is currently an <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/2016_elections_electoral_college_map.html\">average of two points, three points, eight points and three points behind, respectively</a>. </p> <p>Instead, Democrats are now increasingly focused on attacking Republican strongholds rather than defending Rust Belt swing states that once looked vulnerable to Trump\u2019s populist surge.</p> <p>Clinton\u2019s running mate, Tim Kaine, has spoken of his growing confidence about winning Arizona and Georgia. Other \u201c<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2016/10/12/clinton-campaign-eyes-expansion-states-of-utah-arizona-and-georgia/\">expansion states</a>\u201d that the Democrats have their eyes on in the hope of the landslide include Utah, where an unknown independent candidate Evan McMullin is destroying Trump\u2019s natural lead among religious conservatives. Even Trump\u2019s lead in Texas is now down within the margin of error in some polls.</p> <p>Republicans still hope there is time to push back. One of Trump\u2019s few remaining loyal supporters in the party, running mate Mike Pence, has promised his boss will respond swiftly and specifically to the deluge of recent sexual abuse allegations. Others, such as a former candidate Ben Carson, say \u201cit doesn\u2019t matter\u201d whether Trump accusers are \u201clying or not\u201d because bigger issues are at stake for America. What matters is that \u201cthe train is going off the cliff\u201d, Trump\u2019s erstwhile opponent told CNN on Friday.</p> <p>But the reason that many other party leaders, such as the House speaker, Paul Ryan, have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/10/paul-ryan-ends-support-trump-campaign-endorsement-republicans\">deserted their candidate</a> in recent days is that the real battle has now shifted from the White House to Congress.</p> <p>Despite a naturally favourable set of Senate races up for Democrats this cycle, Republicans had hoped there was a chance of holding on to control of the upper chamber thanks to strong candidates such as Marco Rubio in Florida and John McCain in Arizona. But the Trump effect now seems to be hurting them whether they distance themselves from the nominee or not. The <a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2016-election/polls-clinton-ahead-florida-pennsylvania-n662076\">latest Florida poll</a> shows Rubio clinging to just a two-point lead, while McCain has finally unendorsed Trump.</p> <p>For Democrats, the dithering of uncertain Republicans is irresistible. \u201cI understand that Ted [Strickland]\u2019s opponent has finally withdrawn his support from Donald Trump, after looking at the polling, now that it\u2019s politically expedient,\u201d Obama said of his party\u2019s rival in Ohio. \u201cBut he supported him up until last week. So I guess it was OK when Trump was attacking minorities, and suggesting that Mexicans were rapists and Muslims were unpatriotic, and insulting Gold Star moms, and making fun of disabled Americans. I guess that didn\u2019t quite tip it over the edge.

Of course, that included time he spent interrupting, another toddler trait. In addition to the tantrums, Trump gets his <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/298736-trump-defends-his-3-am-tweet-storm\">days and nights mixed up</a>.

  "<h2>Monday</h2> <p>The Donald Trump groping tape did have one immediate effect in the UK. It caused <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/10/top-tories-distance-trump-groping-boasts-jacob-rees-mogg-iain-duncan-smith\">MPs Iain Duncan Smith, Jacob Rees-Mogg and Michael Fabricant to start backtracking </a>on their support for the Republican presidential hopeful. One might ask what it was about Trump\u2019s racism, tax avoidance and proven mendacity the three Tory MPs had previously found so irresistible, but better that one sinner repenteth etc ... Trump might secretly be relieved that Rees-Mogg has dropped out; in the Conservative leadership election, the Somerset MP managed to back the loser time after time. First he backed Boris Johnson. When he dropped out, he switched to Michael Gove. When the Tories decided Gove\u2019s future lay in writing newspaper columns, Rees-Mogg bet the house on the completely useless Andrea Leadsom. Mind you, Trump seems more than capable of losing the election on his own. He recently told a rally in Florida to make sure they voted for him on 28 November. The election is on 8 November.</p> <h2>Tuesday</h2> <p>Never let it be said that the House of Commons ignores the big issues. While a handful of MPs debated the crisis in Aleppo, a similar number were to be found in Westminster Hall arguing over <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/13/boris-johnson-waffling-foreign-affairs-select-committee-brexit\">whether the Queen should be given a brand new royal yacht</a>. This was a question no one in the country \u2013 not even the Queen \u2013 had been asking themselves until Johnson idly mentioned it a few weeks ago to distract people from asking tricky questions about Brexit to which he didn\u2019t know the answer, but it had the monarchists out in force. Tory Jake Berry suddenly remembered that literally thousands of constituents had written to him offering to hand over their life savings. Not even Sir Jake \u2013 as he will no doubt soon be called \u2013 could compete with Sir Gerald Howarth for sycophancy. \u201cThe day Britannia was decommissioned was the worst day of my life,\u201d he solemnly declared. \u201cLet us put that error right.\u201d Howarth has led a very sheltered life. As with all Westminster Hall debates, nothing was resolved other than a general consensus that it would be quite nice if a kind philanthropist \u2013 that rules out Sir Philip Green \u2013 were to donate a yacht to Her Majesty.</p> <h2>Wednesday</h2> <p>One item that may have escaped you is the news that the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/oct/11/owing-2m-durand-academy-state-school-in-south-londonto-be-stripped-of-management\">Durand academy in south London is likely to be stripped of its management team</a>, after refusing to repay \u00a32m in government funds and charging pupils to use its swimming pool through a complex network of payments and companies. Durand was one of Gove\u2019s flagship schools and the former education secretary seldom missed an opportunity to be photographed with former headteacher Sir Greg Martin. For those with first-hand experience of Durand, the real question was how it took the Department for Education so long to cotton on that the school was being run so badly. Those who complained were threatened with writs by legal firm Carter Ruck, and only a year ago the public accounts committee declared it was unhappy with the school\u2019s accounts. Martin, who was knighted for services to education in 2013, at one point paid himself \u00a3230,000 for running the school and another \u00a3165,000 for managing the gym he had set up as a separate company on the school site; he also used the site to run a dating agency.</p> <h2>Thursday</h2> <p>Brexit means no breakfast. As the pound fell to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/78478eee-e170-32d3-bdbb-b88a98f2f9bd\">a record 168-year low</a> (FT, paywall) against the dollar, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/12/tesco-running-low-key-unilever-brands-price-row-supplier-supermarket-falling-pound\">Unilever and Tesco reached a standoff over the price of Marmite</a>, with the supermarket refusing to stock the product if the multinational increased the price by 10%. I\u2019m one of those people who can\u2019t stand Marmite, and the absence of the spread is one of the few upsides of Brexit. But for others, the Great Marmite Swindle is the end of days, with people busy sharing recipes on Twitter: a litre of brewer\u2019s yeast; a pinch of sea salt, an onion, a couple of carrots, a turnip and half a stick of celery should do the trick. Marmite was considered to be a matter of such national concern that the government was again forced to give a running commentary on not giving a running commentary on Brexit. \u201cThere are own-brand yeast extracts that are available,\u201d said the leader of the house, David Lidington, not entirely reassuringly in the Commons. Though no cheap Vegemite. The pound is down 17% against the Australian dollar since 23 June. Open for business. At a price.</p> <h2>Friday</h2> <p>Never mind the rights and wrongs of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/oct/13/bob-dylan-wins-2016-nobel-prize-in-literature\">giving the Nobel prize to a singer-songwriter</a> \u2013 personally, I\u2019d have given it to Leonard Cohen, whose literary output I rate considerably higher \u2013 but at least eveyone knows who Bob Dylan is. When the French writer JMG Le Cl\u00e9zio won the prize back in 2008, very few literary editors in the UK or the US had even heard of him, let alone read any of his books, and they had to quickly scrabble through their contacts books in a desperate attempt to find someone who could write a couple of hundred words about him. Though Dylan is best known as a lyricist, he has had one venture into prose, the 2004 book Chronicles Volume One, which was part autobiography and part fiction. Volume Two is yet to appear. To give you a flavour of his style, here\u2019s a digested read extract. \u201cPeople told me what my lyrics meant. It was news to me. One album was supposedly intensely autobiographical. Let them think so. I knew it was based on a bunch of Chekhov short stories.

She talked of the \u201clash of bondage\u201d and the \u201csting of servitude\u201d and then described waking up every morning in the White House, \u201ca house built by slaves\u201d and watching her daughters, \u201ctwo beautiful intelligent young black women\u201d playing with their dogs: \u201cand because of Hillary Clinton, my daughters, and all our sons and daughters, take for granted that a woman can be president of the United States\u201d.</p> <p>Last night she talked of women doing what women have always done \u201cjust trying to get through it \u2026 trying to pretend this doesn\u2019t really bother us\u201d. She ended: \u201cThis is not normal, this is not politics as usual \u2026 this has got to stop right now.\u201d</p> <p>When she speaks, Michelle Obama doesn\u2019t stop being the wife of the president, but she transcends it. She becomes the personification of the best of her country. Perhaps there is something in the first lady status, in politics but not of it, that uniquely privileges the holder of the office. Who in Britain can make that nonpartisan appeal to ordinary human decency? Last night she spoke for everyone who thinks politics can be better than this.</p>",

  "<p>Tammie Hagen has a secret code for finding felons.

Thirteen thousand former offenders who registered to vote when McAuliffe first attempted an automatic clearance were later told they had been disenfranchised once again, when the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/22/virginia-executive-order-felon-voting-supreme-court\">court ruled his executive action was in breach</a> of the state constitution. </p> <p>Hence the effort through individual signatures, as groups such as <a href=\"http://www.newvirginiamajority.org/\">New Virginia Majority</a>, for which Hagen now works, are scrambling to find suitable candidates for gubernatorial clemency. The effort is as much about overcoming weary cynicism as getting paperwork to the governor\u2019s office in time.</p> <p> \u201cIt felt pretty bleak,\u201d says Hagen as she describes reaction to the first setback. \u201cPeople were really discouraged. I came across lots who were reluctant to try again. \u2018It\u2019s not going to happen,\u2019 they\u2019d say, \u2018my vote\u2019s not going to happen.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>It is a feeling with which she can sympathise, as she says she had \u201cconsigned\u201d herself \u201cto never voting in my life\u201d, thanks to a string of \u201cpetty drug offences\u201d that led to her first felony conviction at 25 and a last one six or seven years ago.</p> <p>But rehabilitation led to a conviction that ex-offenders deserve to play a role in political life.

They would simply prefer more stringent tests before the right is restored.</p> <p> \u201cThe best argument that the other side has to make is that it is important to do what we can to reintegrate felons back into society and it certainly would be a bad thing if society sent a message that once you have committed a felony your civil life is over,\u201d Clegg says.</p> <p> \u201cBut the automatic reinfranchisement of felons misses an opportunity to do that kind of reintegration. There should be a ceremony like a naturalisation ceremony, where you go down to the courthouse and the person brings their friends and family around and everyone has a little American flag. That would be meaningful.\u201d</p> <p> For those on the streets trying to persuade ex-offenders to give democracy a second chance, there is plenty of meaning in the process already.</p> <p> \u201cThese are folks who have been systematically kicked out of the system, who have been ignored,\u201d says Matthew Rogers, regional field director of New Virginia Majority in Alexandria. </p> <p>\u201cMany of them do not even know their rights have been restored. So many of them break down in tears they are so excited.\u201d</p>",

And as Bill Cosby and Roger Ailes could attest, women are no longer willing to remain silent about what men have done with impunity in the past.</p> <p>This week, a man finally acknowledged on national television what many women already understood about the 2016 election. \u201cThis is a gender war,\u201d Donny Deutsch announced on MSNBC\u2019s Morning Joe the morning after the second debate. \u201c<a href=\"https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/lifeandstyle/women\">Women</a> in America are going to stand up and revolt \u2013 every woman in American who has ever been held down, oppressed, harassed.

If only women voted on election day, Hillary Clinton would win in a landslide with 458 electoral votes to only 80 for Trump, as Nate Silver reported on <a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/election-update-women-are-defeating-donald-trump/\">FiveThirtyEight.com</a>.</p> <p>As recent days have finally made clear, the 2016 election constitutes a referendum on male entitlement \u2013 and a Clinton victory will herald an earthquake that remakes the social landscape as dramatically as it does the national agenda.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"2d1223555c4b4dd73de0a9d865b1d6e18db8e897\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2d1223555c4b4dd73de0a9d865b1d6e18db8e897/0_0_575_633/454.png\" alt=\"silver-electionupdate-womenvoted\" width=\"454\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>On one issue after another, polls reveal the widening divisions between men and women. Announcing the results of a survey measuring public reactions to Trump\u2019s infamous \u201cgrab her by the pussy\u201d remarks, ABC\u2019s Rachel Tillman <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/43-percent-americans-trump-withdraw-presidential-race/story?id=42671346\">wrote</a>, \u201cThere was a stark gender gap, with 62% of women less likely to vote for him while 55% of men say it will make no difference on their vote.\u201d</p> <p>Such differences should surprise no one, because men lead entirely different lives than women. Over the course of their lifetime, 57% of women report having been touched or grabbed in a sexual way by a stranger in public. Thirty-seven percent of women have had a stranger masturbate in front of them at least once in public.</p> <p>But strangers pose less of a danger than loved ones; more than a third of female murder victims are killed by their intimate partners. One in five women will be <a href=\"http://ncadv.org/learn-more/statistics\">sexually assaulted</a> in their lifetime \u2013 most often by someone they are close to. Trump\u2019s first wife accused him of such acts; in a sworn deposition during their divorce, Ivana Trump <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/donald-trump-ex-wife-claim-he-raped-her-resurfaces-in-new-documentary-a6836151.html\">used</a> the word \u201crape\u201d to describe forced sex in which her husband pulled out fistfuls of her hair.</p> <p>Is it any wonder that the segment of the electorate that is routinely victimized views such offenses differently than the segment of the electorate that commits them?</p> <p>Whether the crime is harassment, domestic violence or murder, the root cause includes an overwhelming sense of male entitlement: \u201cI get to do this to you because I\u2019m the man and you\u2019re a woman.\u201d Such privilege carries an assumption of ownership, as with property rights: experts on domestic violence attest that men are more likely to assault female partners when they feel they\u2019re losing control, as when threatened with a divorce or a restraining order.</p> <p>And men who fear they\u2019re losing control have fueled the rise of Donald Trump. The gender gap between Trump\u2019s support and Clinton\u2019s is particularly staggering among men who are ill-equipped in comparison with their female peers. An ABC News/Washington Post poll at the end of September showed Trump with an overwhelming 59-point lead among among white men who don\u2019t have college degrees \u2013 76% of whom supported him. In an era when women make up nearly 60% of college and graduate school students, those men are falling further and further behind.</p> <p>Despite such numbers, any real recognition of their import has been a long time coming. For the last year and a half, as myriad so-called experts struggled to understand the Trump phenomenon, their analyses focused on race, religion, ethnicity, class and income. With notable obtuseness, they resisted the most universal explanation well past the time when it should have been obvious.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Throughout this campaign, Trump\u2019s public persona has constituted a textbook illustration of male domination</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Throughout this campaign, Trump\u2019s public persona has constituted a textbook illustration of male domination: gaslighting, threatening and insulting at every turn. he has consistently acted like a vicious bully who will stop at nothing to subordinate his foes. At his first debate with Hillary Clinton, he interrupted her 51 times.</p> <p>But Trump\u2019s interrupting and shouting over his adversaries during the debates were only an extension of the domineering traits that have long been clear. This week\u2019s news included reports from Miss USA contestants, some as young as 15, that Trump deliberately walked in on them backstage while they were naked. Trump has even bragged about doing so: \u201cI sort of get away with things like that,\u201d he said on The Howard Stern Show in 2005.</p> <p>As the possessor of a penis, celebrity and a fortune, Trump has never questioned his right to inspect and rank women in terms of his own interest in having sex with them. For decades his objectification of women has remained as consistent as the ugliness of his values; as a self-appointed judge of female worth, he and his beauty pageants and reality shows have perpetuated the misogynistic standards that nullify the value of any woman who is not very young, very thin and conventionally attractive.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/oct/12/miss-arizona-donald-trump-naked-girls-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/577az\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2800383\"            data-video-name=\"Trump 'walked in on naked girls', says former Miss Arizona \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"Reuters/CBS\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57fe79e5e4b03b22b4fb2ae7\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/10/12/161012missusa_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/10/12/161012missusa.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/10/12/161012missusa_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/oct/12/miss-arizona-donald-trump-naked-girls-video\">Trump \u2018walked in on naked girls\u2019, says former Miss Arizona</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>And with Trump, the double standards are so extreme it would be laughable if they weren\u2019t so destructive, from his fat-shaming of former Miss Universe Alicia Machado to the gratuitous insult he lobbed at Heidi Klum when he announced, apropos of nothing, that the supermodel was \u201c<a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2015/08/18/politics/donald-trump-heidi-klum-no-longer-a-ten/\">sadly, no longer a 10</a>\u201d.</p> <p>Nor did Trump \u2013 a chronic philanderer currently married to his third wife, having dumped the previous two after each had borne him children \u2013 see anything wrong with attacking Hillary Clinton over her husband\u2019s past infidelity. No matter what awful things men do, it\u2019s always the woman\u2019s fault.</p> <p>But women are becoming ever less compliant \u2013 and female insurrection is particularly upsetting to men who are already anxious about their ability to maintain their authority.</p> <p>Women have always been penalized for violating conventional gender norms, but no woman has ever had a realistic chance of winning the White House until now \u2013 and the backlash against Clinton\u2019s temerity was apparent from the start of her campaign. </p> <p>As Sandy Garossino wrote in the National Observer, \u201cUntil she ran for president, Clinton was the most admired woman in the world \u2026 So what the hell happened? The woman ran for president, that\u2019s what. Who does she think she is?\u201d</p> <p>Clinton\u2019s approval ratings have fluctuated wildly for decades. But the 2016 campaign ratcheted up the stakes to the point where the Republican nominee has promised to jail the female opponent who trounced him in both debates.</p> <h2>The confidence of the mediocre white man</h2> <p>Invoking the popularity of a tote bag that reads, \u201cLord, Give Me the Confidence of a Mediocre White Man,\u201d Jessica Valenti wrote about how exasperating it is to deal with \u201ca bombastic but woefully under-informed man who is convinced of how much smarter he is than you\u201d. When the article was published in the Guardian, its headline was: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/28/mediocre-male-donald-trump-clinton-debate\">Why the mediocre male\u2019s days may be numbered</a>.</p> <p>Such predictions are, of course, what those men are worried about. In the early days of the modern women\u2019s movement, Gloria Steinem observed humorously that the reason many men oppose equality is that they fear women will treat them the same way they\u2019ve treated women.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"764f4aa7d91c081705eb385fcf56e3573a2ffb46\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/764f4aa7d91c081705eb385fcf56e3573a2ffb46/0_0_3719_2479/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Donald Trump at a campaign rally in West Palm Beach, Florida.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Donald Trump at a campaign rally in West Palm Beach, Florida.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Evan Vucci/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Then as now, it\u2019s true that Not All Men behave badly. But the archetype is painfully familiar, as Nicholas Kristof pointed out in a New York Times op-ed column headlined: <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/29/opinion/that-seventh-grade-bully-is-running-for-president.html\">A 7th grade bully runs for president</a>. Kristof\u2019s litany of characteristic behaviors was withering: \u201cThe boasts about not doing homework, the habit of blaming others when things go wrong, the penchant for exaggerating everything into the best ever, the braggadocio to mask insecurity about size of hands or genitals, the biting put-downs of others, the laziness, the self-absorption, the narcissism, the lack of empathy \u2013 and the immaturity that reduces a woman to her breasts.\u201d</p> <p>As Kristof\u2019s list suggests, the less hard-working or accomplished men are, the more threatened they seem by the prospect of having to compete on a level playing field \u2013 and the more they resist the prospect of real female empowerment.</p> <p>Despite growing competition, many men \u2013 like Trump in the run-up to the first debate \u2013 refuse to compensate by working harder, no matter how poorly they fare. Time-use studies show that <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/blogs/xx_factor/2015/01/06/gender_and_housework_even_men_who_don_t_work_do_less_than_women.html\">even when men don\u2019t have jobs</a>, they do far less housework and childcare than their working wives.</p> <p>Whether the issue is slacker husbands or discriminatory bosses who perpetuate the inequities of the gender pay gap, some women remain acquiescent to the unfairness of the status quo \u2013 but a lot of others are simply fed up. The question is: how many \u2013 and are they exasperated enough to head for the polls in droves? And will enough fair-minded men join them to elect the first female president in American history?</p> <p>The answer depends on how far we\u2019ve come in accepting the idea of women as truly equal human beings who sometimes outdo their male counterparts. Last month Vanity Fair reposted <a href=\"http://www.vanityfair.com/news/1994/06/hillary-rodham-clinton-first-lady\">a profile I wrote in 1994</a>, when the then first lady was working on healthcare reform. The article quoted a powerful Capitol Hill insider who compared Mrs Clinton\u2019s performance with that of her husband, the president. \u201cI\u2019ve seen them both make presentations, with dozens of senators at the table, and she\u2019s better than he is,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd these guys know it. They\u2019ve sat in rooms with her, and they\u2019ve sat in rooms with him. He\u2019s good \u2013 he\u2019s very good. She\u2019s just fucking perfect.\u201d</p> <p>In a globalized world increasingly riven by conflicts of byzantine complexity, Clinton\u2019s hard-earned knowledge and experience constitute her strongest claim to the Oval Office. But her rival \u2013 and the male minions who laud him as a \u201cgenius\u201d for evading taxes \u2013 fail to appreciate even that obvious point.</p> <h2>Is this the president we want for our sons?</h2> <p>As election day approaches, the larger question is how much sense of self-preservation will be manifested by the nation\u2019s adult females.</p> <p>Will American women \u2013 and the men who actually care about their welfare \u2013 support the leadership of a man who feels entitled to kiss strangers on the mouth and brag about grabbing crotches, simply because he is rich and famous and male?</p> <p>Will voters agree that a man should view and rank all women according to their physical attributes and fire those he doesn\u2019t find sexually desirable, because he thinks a woman\u2019s value is measured by her looks?</p> <p>Will voters approve the double standards of a man who publicly humiliates women for their sexual conduct even as he laughs off his own far more lurid transgressions?</p> <p>Will the electorate agree that males don\u2019t have to play by the rules \u2013 that men don\u2019t need to do what\u2019s best for their families (like refraining from dumping the mothers of their children in tabloid sex scandals) or for the economy (like paying contractors who provided services instead of cheating them) or for their country (like paying taxes)?</p> <p>The Clinton campaign has been running a commercial featuring some of Trump\u2019s denigrating comments about women, superimposed over pictures of uncertain young girls scrutinizing themselves in the mirror as they struggle to decide whether their bodies define their value in the world. \u201cIs this the president we want for our daughters?\u201d the ad asks.</p> <p>That leaves out an equally critical question: is this the president we want for our sons?</p> <p>A vote for Trump is a vote for the continuation of male entitlement \u2013 for the arrogance and inequity of unearned privilege, for the acceptance of irresponsibility in personal, familial and civic behaviors, and for the perpetuation of all the hateful biases that oppress women solely because of their gender.</p> <p>Is this the world we want to keep on living in, or is it finally time for us to demand a better one?</p> <p></p>",
  "<p>How did WikiLeaks go from darling of the liberal left and scourge of American imperialism to apparent tool of Donald Trump\u2019s divisive, incendiary presidential campaign?</p> <p>Thursday brought another WikiLeaks dump of nearly 2,000 emails hacked from the Hillary Clinton campaign, allegedly by Russians. As usual, they were inside-the-beltway gossip rather than game-changing: the campaign tried to <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/email-clinton-campaign-move-back-illinois-primary-42783309\">push back the Illinois primary</a>, believing it would make life harder for moderate Republicans.</p> <p>That has not stopped Trump trying to make hay from the leaked emails and deflect attention from allegations of sexual harassment against him. \u201cVery little pick-up by the dishonest media of incredible information provided by WikiLeaks,\u201d he tweeted on Wednesday. \u201cSo dishonest! Rigged system!\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/13/wikileaks-emails-trump-clinton-campaign-leaks-media-bias\">If Trump leaks are OK and Clinton leaks aren't, there's a problem | Trevor Timm</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Clinton\u2019s speeches to Wall Street banks were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/07/wikileaks-hillary-clinton-paid-wall-street-speeches\">apparently revealed in an email dump</a> last Friday, just minutes after the release of a video in which Trump was caught boasting about groping women \u2013 timing that many felt was more than just chance. This follows a hack in July designed to embarrass Clinton on the eve of the Democratic National Convention. </p> <p><a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2016/08/06/accusing-wikileaks-bias-beside-point/\">Robert Mackey</a> of The Intercept website wrote in August: \u201cThe <a href=\"https://twitter.com/wikileaks\">WikiLeaks Twitter feed</a> has started to look more like the stream of an opposition research firm working mainly to undermine Hillary Clinton than the updates of a non-partisan platform for whistleblowers.\u201d</p> <p>The seeming alliance between Trump and WikiLeaks is an astonishing role reversal. In 2010 it was lauded by transparency campaigners for releasing, in cooperation with publications <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/the-war-logs\">including the Guardian</a>, more than a quarter of a million classified cables from US embassies around the world. WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange became a hero to many.</p> <p>At the time, Republican politicians expressed outrage at WikiLeaks, but now some are seizing on its revelations as potential salvation for Trump\u2019s ailing candidacy. Newt Gingrich, the former House speaker, took part in a media conference call about an email that purportedly showed Clinton campaign mocking Catholics.</p> <p>Conversely, liberal activists have expressed dismay at the hack of Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta\u2019s email account and the calculated timing of the release. Neil Sroka, spokesperson for the pressure group Democracy for America, said: \u201cThere is a huge difference between risotto recipes in John Podesta\u2019s emails and the Pentagon Papers. The news value of these Podesta emails is fairly limited and the activist value is even less.\u201d</p> <p>Sroka added: \u201cWikiLeaks is like the internet. It can be a force for good or a force for bad. Right now it is propping up a candidate running the most hateful campaign in modern times.\u201d</p> <p>Last week US intelligence officials blamed Russia for previous hacks. It is not yet known whether Podesta\u2019s emails were hacked by the Russians, but US officials say the attack fits the same pattern. Russian president Vladimir Putin has denied the allegation.</p> <p>Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook told reporters on Thursday: \u201cThe Department of Homeland Security took the unprecedented step of saying ... beyond any doubt that this hack and then the leaking of the emails was perpetrated by the Russian government for the purpose of intervening in the election and trying to affect the outcome in favor of Donald Trump. This is getting closer and closer to the Trump campaign itself.\u201d</p> <p>All of which raises the question: do Assange, Putin and Trump form a triangle? Are they in communication with each other or merely exploiting a coincidence of interests? </p> <p>Trump has praised Putin and numerous links with Russia have emerged this year. But on Wednesday he denied any business interests beyond staging Miss Universe there. He has contradicted earlier statements about knowing Putin.</p> <p>Assange was asked by <a href=\"http://www.democracynow.org/2016/7/25/julian_assange_choosing_between_trump_or\">Democracy Now earlier this year</a> whether he prefers Clinton or Trump. \u201cYou\u2019re asking me, do I prefer cholera or gonorrhea?\u201d he replied. Sarah Harrison, a WikiLeaks editor, has said it would publish documents damaging to Trump if it had them. \u201cIt\u2019s not that we\u2019re choosing publications to pick a certain line,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-10-11/how-julian-assange-turned-wikileaks-into-trump-s-best-friend\">she told Bloomberg</a>.</p> <p>But some observers argue that Assange\u2019s war on Clinton is personal: she was secretary of state at the time of the diplomatic cables leak. Her perceived secrecy and hawkish foreign policy represents the antithesis of his anti-US imperialist worldview. The capricious, nihilistic, non-ideological Trump might seem like a kindred spirit by comparison.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.atlanticcouncil.org/about/experts/list/alina-polyakova\">Alina Polyakova</a>, deputy director of the Eurasia Center at the Atlantic Council think tank in Washington, said: \u201cMy impression of Julian Assange is that he sees US hegemony in the international world order as the biggest problem facing us today. In his attempt to bring \u2018transparency\u2019, he ends up siding with the very regimes that deny transparency and human rights. That\u2019s the irony of my enemy\u2019s enemy is my friend.\u201d</p> <p>She added: \u201cI think the Russian government is in fact using WikiLeaks: the connection seems pretty clear to me. Is the Trump campaign tied to WikiLeaks? That\u2019s hard to say but I would be surprised if there\u2019s no coordination.\u201d</p> <p>Russia has uncomfortable associations for WikiLeaks. In 2010 its point man there, Israel Shamir, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/andrewbrown/2010/dec/17/wikileaks-israel-shamir-russia-scandinavia\">was exposed as an antisemite</a> and Holocaust denier. A website, israelshamir.com, carries numerous articles, <a href=\"http://www.israelshamir.com/article/a-lousy-dancer/\">one of which comments</a>: \u201cMs Clinton decided to blame her spectacular lack of success on Putin, as well. If she were honest, she\u2019d admit that she is unpopular, even among her own milieu.\u201d </p> <p>In an email, Shamir denied that Assange is coordinating with Russia. \u201cThe problem is that incredible revelations of emails are totally suppressed by the Clintonesque media,\u201d he wrote. \u201cInstead of discussing Clinton\u2019s hate to ordinary Americans, Clinton\u2019s order to assassinate Assange etc, you discuss whether Russians are involved. Shame!\u201d</p> <p>Assange remains holed up at the Ecuadorian embassy in London after claiming asylum, where he\u2019s been for four years. Two women in Sweden have accused him of rape and other sexual offences, which he denies, citing a wider conspiracy. Assange has expressed fears that, if extradited to Sweden, he would be in danger of being sent to the US, where he thinks he could face the death penalty.</p> <p>A former associate of Assange, who did not wish to be named, noted that there will be presidential elections in Ecuador in 2017 and the current leader, Rafael Correa, has stated that he will stand aside after 10 years in office. This could make Assange feel uncertain about his future protection. </p> <p>\u201cI believe he is basically hoping that Trump will be lenient on him,\u201d the former associate said. \u201cIt\u2019s about Julian Assange. I feel he\u2019s just desperate and it\u2019s a shame.\u201d<br></p> <p>The site has lost its halo in the eyes of what it used to be its core constituency, the ex-colleague added. \u201cAll the lefties were WikiLeaks softies. Now they are getting a different perspective. It\u2019s obvious Julian Assange has lost his ability to be neutral.\u201d</p> <p>But others who know Assange defend him. <a href=\"http://www.vaughansmith.com/\">Vaughan Smith</a>, a journalist and former army officer who allowed the WikiLeaks founder to stay at his UK home for more than a year, said in a text message: \u201cI don\u2019t believe for a minute that Julian is liaising with Moscow.</p> <p>\u201cHis whole thing is that he\u2019s not supposed to know the identity of his sources, who leave material anonymously to protect themselves. He checks that it\u2019s genuine and puts out as much of it as he can. That\u2019s his compact with whistleblowers. As for Clinton and Trump? He hasn\u2019t expressed a preference to me.\u201d</p> <p>And some Democratic voters have declined to criticise the leaks, which appear to show how the Clinton campaign worked to defeat Bernie Sanders in the primary elections. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/anondescript\">Dave Handy</a>, a political organiser and Sanders supporter who will now vote for Clinton, said: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say I\u2019m glad but they\u2019re doing a necessary thing.</p> <p>\u201cEven if it\u2019s a ploy, it\u2019s the truth. No one has denied this.\u201d</p> <p>He added: \u201cThe Democratic party and the Clinton campaign have colluded for the last two years to make sure she becomes the nominee and to make sure she becomes president. As someone who will vote for her, we can only pray this is not how she runs her administration.\u201d</p>",

It has shaken me to my core in a way that I couldn\u2019t have predicted.\u201d </p> <p>In visceral terms and with a heightened sense of urgency, Obama painted the choice for president as a moral imperative.<br></p> <p>\u201cThis is not normal, this is not politics as usual,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is disgraceful, it is intolerable, and it doesn\u2019t matter what party you belong to. ...

This was a powerful individual speaking freely and openly about sexually predatory behavior and actually bragging about kissing and groping women, using language so obscene that many of us are worried about our children hearing it when we turn on the TV. </p> <p>\u201cTo make matters worse, it now seems very clear that this isn\u2019t an isolated incident. It\u2019s one of countless examples of how he has treated women his whole life.\u201d</p> <p>The New Hampshire rally was Obama\u2019s sixth campaign event for Clinton. The ever-popular first lady has proved to be one of the Democratic candidate\u2019s most powerful surrogates, after delivering <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/26/michelle-obama-convention-speech-female-president\">a smash-hit speech at the party convention</a> in July.</p> <p>On Thursday, Obama told the crowd she had planned to deliver her normal campaign speech, but said it would have been \u201cdishonest and disingenuous\u201d to do so, as she felt compelled to address Trump\u2019s remarks on women. She never referred to Trump by name, instead calling him \u201cher opponent\u201d or simply the Republican \u201ccandidate\u201d. She did not turn to discuss Clinton until halfway through her remarks.</p> <p>Obama implored voters repulsed by the coarseness of the presidential campaign to consider the impact a Trump presidency would have on young girls and boys \u2013 and the message it would send to the world. </p> <p>\u201cIf you vote for someone other than Hillary, or you don\u2019t vote, you are helping to elect her opponent,\u201d she said. \u201cImagine how that will feel.\u201d</p> <p>She continued: \u201cWe need to recover from our shock and depression and do what women have always done in this country.

Because he had said so many damning things out in the open, it hardly seemed necessary to skewer his personal life.</p> <p>Harth\u2019s story is a complicated one and her character, like the characters of most living, breathing women, is also complex. But her accusation against Trump was always plausible. She has stood by it for 20 years. Now, finally, Harth\u2019s account and those of women like her are not just gaining traction. They have been placed center stage in the campaign.</p> <p>Trump addressed crowds on Thursday calling the most recent allegations \u201cslander and libels ... part of a concerted, coordinated, and vicious attack\u201d, while Michelle Obama made a <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2016/10/flotus-speech-229741\">powerful speech</a> on what\u2019s at stake this election. If we don\u2019t vote against Trump, she said at a campaign event in Manchester, New Hampshire, \u201cWe\u2019re telling our sons that it\u2019s OK to humiliate women\u201d. It\u2019s not just the sexual assault allegations, she explained, though they cannot be marginalized. It\u2019s about Trump\u2019s entire world view. \u201cWhat\u2019s more, strong men,\u201d Obama said, \u201cmen who are truly role models, don\u2019t need to put down women to make themselves feel powerful\u201d.<br></p> <p>Women know this. Americans know this. Why then did it take <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\">Donald Trump</a> bragging about sexual assault on video for the country to take the claims seriously?</p> <p>This is an issue that\u2019s come up before this year, and not just on the presidential campaign trail. We didn\u2019t need one woman to come forward against Bill Cosby in order to get society\u2019s attention \u2013 we didn\u2019t even need 10 of them to. We needed male comedian Hannibal Buress to make a joke about it.

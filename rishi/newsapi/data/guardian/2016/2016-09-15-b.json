As she climbed the steps to the podium, she gripped a guard rail carefully.</p> <p>\u201cFor millions of moms and dads, if they get sick there is no backup, they are on their own,\u201d she said, turning her experience into a renewed call for better provision of healthcare and family leave. \u201cThat\u2019s the story for too many people in America.\u201d</p> <p>Earlier Donald Trump, who has pulled level in some recent opinion polls, made his most explicit reference yet to his opponent\u2019s health, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/15/donald-trump-dr-oz-medical-report\">releasing medical records</a> that boasted of his ability to \u201cendure \u2013 uninterrupted \u2013 the rigors of a punishing and unprecedented presidential campaign\u201d.</p> <p>The physical examination also revealed the 70-year-old Republican to be overweight, at 236lbs, but he claimed he had bolstered his physical condition by giving speeches on the campaign trail.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a lot of work,\u201d said Trump. \u201cYou know, when I\u2019m speaking in front of 15, 20,000 people and I\u2019m up there using a lot of motion, I guess in its own way it\u2019s a pretty healthy act. A lot of times these rooms are really hot, like saunas and I guess that\u2019s a form of exercise.\u201d</p> <p>Clinton truck a defiant tone, ignoring a young male heckler who shouted \u201cyou suck\u201d to calmly set out the differences between the two campaigns.</p> <p>\u201cI confess I will never be the showman that Trump is,\u201d she said, before returning to familiar campaign messages on the economy and social justice.</p> <p>\u201cI have been involved in politics for many years. It\u2019s not an easy business. Sometimes it can be rough. People accuse me of all kinds of things, but nobody every accused me of quitting and I will never ever give up.\u201d</p> <p>The Democratic nominee also addressed widespread criticism the she had been slow to acknowledge the seriousness of her recent illness, both to herself and the public.</p> <p>\u201cAs you may know I recently had a cough that turned out to be pneumonia\u201d she said. \u201cI tried to power through it, but even I had to admit that maybe a few days rest would do me good \u2026 I am not great at taking it easy under ordinary circumstances, but with just two months to go until election day [home] was the last place I wanted to be.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhen it comes to public service,\u201d she said, \u201cI am better at the service bit than the public bit.\u201d</p> <p>Unusually, the half-hour speech started 15 minutes early. It was the first of a series of events now scheduled for the next few days. After speaking to reporters, Clinton was due to head to Washington DC for a public dinner and then to Philadelphia, New York and Florida before returning to North Carolina next week.</p> <p>Warning there were just \u201c54 days to the most consequential vote in our lives\u201d, Clinton has enlisted support from Michelle and Barack Obama and dispatched prominent liberal allies Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders to shore up the campaign in the crucial swing state of Ohio.</p> <p>Earlier on Thursday, a new <a href=\"https://www.scribd.com/document/324094160/CBS-NYT-AM-presidential-poll-toplines-Sept-15-2016#from_embed\">poll for CBS and the New York Times</a> showed Clinton and Trump on 41% each, while <a href=\"http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/elections/election_2016/white_house_watch\">Rasmussen had Trump up by 2%</a>.

  "<p>Experts and officials in Moscow have raised doubts about whether the hackers who leaked athletes\u2019 medical data are linked to Russia, even though the World Anti-Doping Agency has said the attacks on it originated in Russia.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/15/fancy-bears-leak-british-olympians-48-tues\">Fancy Bears expected to leak names of another 48 British Olympians with TUEs</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A new website attributed to the \u201cFancy Bears\u2019 hack team\u201d \u2013 like the Russian \u201cFancy Bear\u201d group <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jul/26/dnc-email-leak-russian-hack-guccifer-2\" title=\"\">accused of hacking the Democratic National Committee\u2019s email servers</a> this summer \u2013 published leaks this week showing that Wada had given the Olympic gymnast Simone Biles and the tennis players Serena and Venus Williams, as well as the British Tour de France winners Chris Froome and Bradley Wiggins, exemptions to take restricted substances.</p> <p>The dots seemed easy enough to connect: after Russia\u2019s track and field team and other athletes were banned from the Olympics over findings of state-sponsored doping, Kremlin hackers began carrying out attacks on Wada and the court of arbitration for sport (Cas), which said it had been targeted in August. Following this week\u2019s leaks, though, Russian officials and media have denied any involvement by compatriots and also suggested Wada followed double standards, giving Western athletes greater leeway to use drugs than Russian athletes.</p> <p>On Wednesday the country\u2019s sports minister, Vitaly Mutko, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/14/russian-sports-minister-vitaly-mutko-denies-link-wada-hackers\" title=\"\">denied the Wada hack could be connected to his homeland</a>, then the country\u2019s UK embassy tweeted on Thursday: \u201cWada hacking: There should be nothing private about doping files of participants of Olympics,which are a very public affair. Some are more equal than others?\u201d</p> <p>The state news agency RIA Novosti headlined its news piece: \u201cWada allowed the Williams sisters and the gymnast Biles to take doping,\u201d and included a cartoon of a muscle-bound black female tennis player in a USA jersey carrying a golden trophy full of pills.</p> <p>Wada\u2019s director general, Olivier Niggli, said Wada had been informed by law enforcement that the attacks \u201care originating out of Russia\u201d. The security firm Crowdstrike has previously said Fancy Bear and another group involved in the DNC hack, Cosy Bear, are likely backed by Russian intelligence agencies.</p> <p>Russian experts, however, cast doubt on this conclusion. Sergei Nikitin, a digital forensic analyst at the Moscow-based security company Group-IB, said not enough information was available to trace the attacks to Russia. He said companies usually publish a report with more exact evidence on how exactly their system was compromised.</p> <p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have this in the case of the DNC and Wada hacks, so it\u2019s not clear on what basis conclusions are being drawn that Russian hackers or special services were involved. It\u2019s done on the basis of the website design, which is absurd,\u201d he said, referring to the depiction of symbolically Russian animals, brown and white bears, on the \u201cFancy Bears\u2019 Hack Team\u201d website.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/15/tue-fancy-bears-wada-leaks\">What is a TUE? 11 key questions on the Fancy Bears Wada leaks | Sean Ingle</a> </p> </aside>  <p>According to Alexander Baranov, head of the information security department at the higher school of economics in Moscow, the hackers were most likely amateurs who published a \u201csemi-finished product\u201d rather than truly compromising information. \u201cThey could have done this more harshly and suddenly,\u201d he said. \u201cIf it was [state-sponsored] hackers, they would have dug deeper. Since it\u2019s enthusiasts, amateurs, they got what they got and went public with it.\u201d</p> <p>But leading cyber security firms have long been finding patterns in Fancy Bears\u2019 activities that give them confidence the hackers are linked to the Russian state. The group, which is also known as APT28, Strontium or Sofacy, has been active since at least 2008 but increased its activities tenfold in 2015, according to Kaspersky Labs. It said in a statement to the Guardian that Fancy Bears is a Russian-speaking group focusing on \u201cNato countries, Ukraine, governments and military contractors\u201d, targets that have tense relations with the Kremlin. Crowdstrike has said Fancy Bears is likely tied to the GRU, Russia\u2019s military intelligence agency.</p> <p>Since the Wada breach was a result of a phishing attack, in which deceptive emails entice users to reveal their passwords, the attackers did not employ malware that could be checked against that typically used by Russian groups. But the US security firm ThreatConnect said the way the phishing was carried out was consistent with Fancy Bears\u2019 past activities.</p> <p>In creating phishing emails, the Wada attacker registered domain names with the same domain registrar Fancy Bears used in the DNC hack, as well as another domain registrar often used by Fancy Bears, according to a ThreatConnect report. The domains were registered shortly after Russian Olympic and Paralympic athletes were banned from competing in Rio de Janeiro, and the deceptive email addresses were written with a formula used by Fancy Bears before.</p> <p>Nikitin said Fancy Bear was most likely a criminal group leaking politically sensitive information to get \u201cfree advertising\u201d in the media for its blackmarket services.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/15/fancy-bears-chris-froome-bradley-wiggins-tues-cycling\">Wiggins and Froome leaks raise familiar questions for cycling but do little else</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But Toni Gidwani, ThreatConnect\u2019s director of research, said whereas cyber criminals will target many people in the hopes of finding easy scores, Fancy Bear had a history of tailoring its attacks to specific targets and, having breached them, lingering on their servers gathering information. \u201cWe\u2019re pretty comfortable that Fancy Bear is linked to the Russian government, taking what we know about their attacks on the whole,\u201d Gidwani said. \u201cThe level of complexity we see them pull off in these attacks, it would be very difficult for this organisation to be criminally motivated or an ideological hacktivist.\u201d</p> <p>The new ostentatious Fancy Bears website, the leak of Wada data on the Russian Olympic boxer Misha Aloyan and the claim by a Twitter account calling itself Anonymous Poland that it was targeting Wada and Cas were not typical of a Russian state hacker group, Gidwani admitted. But she said the people doing the hacking and those leaking the information could be different and called new accounts claiming credit for the attacks \u201cfaketivists\u201d meant to throw investigators off the scent.</p> <p>Gidwani said the suspected Russia-backed attacks would likely continue until at least the US presidential election: \u201cIt\u2019s almost like Joker in Batman, to cause as much chaos as possible and cause people to question the integrity of these systems, whether that\u2019s the US elections and our leadership or international structures that regulate doping in sport.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Wisconsin governor Scott Walker broke his silence on Thursday over <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/14/corporate-cash-john-doe-files-scott-walker-wisconsin\">leaked documents obtained by Guardian US</a>, which revealed his links to a complex network of conservative donors and the influence of corporate cash in the election process.<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2016/sep/14/john-doe-files-scott-walker-corporate-cash-american-politics\">Scott Walker, the John Doe files and how corporate cash influences American politics</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In an interview with Milwaukee\u2019s WTMJ 620, the Republican governor described as \u201cbaseless\u201d the legal investigation into alleged campaign finance violations that produced the 1,500 pages of documents.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s what we often see in media outlets where you get bits and pieces shaped to push their agenda,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.wtmj.com/shows/charlie-sykes/gov-scott-walker-addresses-john-doe-document-leak\">Walker said</a>. \u201cThe bottom line is we\u2019ve had several courts in this state that have shut this down, this baseless investigation down, because it clearly didn\u2019t show that what was done that was not lawful there.\u201d<br></p> <p>Known as the \u201cJohn Doe investigation\u201d, several Wisconsin prosecutors launched a probe into what they suspected were criminal campaign finance violations by the campaign committee of Walker, a former Republican presidential candidate who dropped out early in the primary race. The prosecutors claimed Walker\u2019s committee operated a coordinated network that involved outside lobby groups, thereby allowing unlimited amounts of corporate money to funnel into a third-party group closely aligned with his campaign. In July 2015, the Wisconsin supreme court halted the investigation.<br></p> <p>In saying prosecutors misunderstood campaign finance law to pick on people and groups \u201cwholly innocent of any wrongdoing\u201d, the state\u2019s high court took the extraordinary step to order all documents produced as part of the investigation to be destroyed and later held under seal \u2013 however at least one set survived that was leaked to Guardian US.<br></p> <p>Walker told the radio station that unspecified people related to the investigation who \u201close in the court of law, repeatedly\u201d now \u201cwant to play this out in the court of public opinion \u2013 and do so with only bits and pieces, without the full story\u201d.<br></p> <p>\u201cThe bottom line is that people, not only at the supreme court level, but even initially at the circuit court level, where a distinguished reserve judge \u2013 who, as far as we can tell, has no aligned political allegiance with anyone \u2013 initially shut this down,\u201d Walker said. \u201cAnd that assertion\u2019s been held many times over.\u201d<br></p> <p>Charlie Sykes of WTMJ then proceeded to ask Walker about headlines on Wednesday following <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/14/corporate-cash-john-doe-files-scott-walker-wisconsin\">the John Doe leak</a>, particularly that Wisconsin\u2019s Republican-controlled legislature in 2013 passed new laws making it difficult for victims of lead paint poisoning to file lawsuits against lead producers, following a $750,000 donation to a group aligned with the governor.<br></p> <p>Walker said the donation was irrelevant to his support for the lead law.<br></p> <p>\u201cThe shocking thing for many,\u201d Walker said, \u201cmight be that people actually in elected office do the things they\u2019ve said. I, and plenty of others in the legislature, have said for years \u2013 almost a decade or more now \u2013 that lawsuit reform was an important issue in the state.\u201d </p> <p>The governor said he disagreed with a previous court ruling \u201cthat said you can be sued as an employer, even if there\u2019s no evidence your company had anything to do with what they\u2019re suing about\u201d.<br></p> <p>\u201cWe thought that was wrong, we thought that sent a bad sentiment,\u201d Walker said. \u201cWe thought that would discourage people hiring people in the state of Wisconsin, and bring business to the state.\u201d<br></p> <p>The leak prompted Milwaukee County district attorney John Chisholm, a Democrat who launched the John Doe investigation, on Wednesday <a href=\"http://host.madison.com/wsj/news/local/govt-and-politics/leaked-john-doe-documents-paint-fuller-picture-of-case-against/article_63254ac5-dbf2-5b4b-8714-4dd6694da9a9.html\">to proclaim his support</a> for determining the source of the leak, and said it\u2019s \u201cnot merely a violation of the John Doe secrecy order, it\u2019s a crime under Wisconsin law\u201d.<br></p> <p>In his interview, Walker echoed the sentiment. \u201cI think those involved in law enforcement in this state \u2013 if they want people to take seriously the order of the court \u2013 should certainly do that, no matter what the issue is,\u201d he said. \u201cOtherwise, what kind of system do we live in?</p> <p>\u201cAs I mentioned, in this case, the worst part about it is, they\u2019ve lost in the court of law because several courts have said this is a baseless investigation, and yet, now, they\u2019re trying to leak bits and pieces of it in the court of opinion, without people knowing all the facts.</p> <p>\u201cAnd the things people should focus in on,\u201d he continued, \u201care the fact this has been shut down, because they couldn\u2019t provide a basis for showing anything was illegal.\u201d <br></p> <p>The US supreme court will consider later this month a petition from the prosecutors asking for a full review of the decision to shut their case down.</p>",
  "<p>Donald Trump attempted to combat widespread criticism of his sketchy economic policies by setting out what he presented as a new vision for the country that he audaciously claimed would create 25m new jobs in a decade and put the American worker first.<br></p> <p>Addressing one of the country\u2019s most august economic debating societies, the Economic Club of New York, the Republican presidential nominee sought to dispel the criticism that has dogged his campaign that his mathematics do not add up in balancing tax cuts and new spending. Sticking closely to a pre-prepared script \u2013 despite an initial malfunctioning of his teleprompter - he delivered a speech that was billed in advance by his senior advisers as the culmination of his thinking on how to get America back to work.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/15/donald-trump-dr-oz-medical-report\">Donald Trump to Dr Oz: I feel 'as good today as I did at 30'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cAmerican cars will travel the roads,\u201d he said, \u201cAmerican planes will soar the skies, American ships will patrol the seas, American steel will send new skyscrapers into the clouds, American hands will rebuild this nation, and American energy harvested from American sources will power this nation.\u201d</p> <p>Despite the unapologetically populist tone, Trump tried to puncture criticisms that his plan lacked substance by putting figures to his ambitions. He projected 25m new jobs would be created broadly within the timeframe of a two-term Trump presidency, as a result of an average annual growth rate that would rise from current projections of about 2% to 3.5% through his tax-cutting and trade policies.</p> <p>The audaciousness of that boast is underlined by comparison with previous presidents. It would bring American job creation levels back to the golden days enjoyed by Bill Clinton in the 1990s when the dotcom boom and an expanding global economy saw 21m jobs created under his watch.</p> <p>By contrast, Barack Obama\u2019s two terms in the White House have seen almost 10m jobs created within a sluggish recovery from the 2008 collapse.</p> <p>Even more audaciously, Trump said he could achieve such a boon to employment while keeping the national budget deficit neutral. \u201cIf we achieve 4% growth it will reduce the deficit,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Buoyed by <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/16/us/politics/hillary-clinton-donald-trump-poll.html?hp&amp;action=click&amp;pgtype=Homepage&amp;clickSource=story-heading&amp;module=first-column-region&amp;region=top-news&amp;WT.nav=top-news&amp;_r=0\">new polls</a> showing him in effect tied nationally with his Democratic rival Hillary Clinton, the real estate billionaire said he could pull off such a turnaround in the US economy through a combination of traditional conservative tax cutting and by tearing up trade deals and bringing jobs back to America from Mexico and China. His words were given added poignancy, though he did not make overt reference to the fact, by the setting of his speech in the ballroom of the Waldorf Astoria on Park Avenue, a legendary hotel bought by a Chinese insurance company in 2014.</p> <p>On taxes, Trump proposed to simplify the tax code into three brackets down from seven, and to take poor earners out of tax altogether with individuals with an income under $25,000 (\u00a319,000) and married couples under $50,000 paying no tax. </p> <p>However, with his tax cuts applying to all earners, no matter how wealthy, they would have a regressive effect. The Tax Policy Center has calculated the richest 0.1% would on average see tax cuts under his plan of $1.3m in 2017 compared with just $5,100 for everybody else.</p> <p>Trump tried to counter that criticism that he was putting forward policies that would benefit the 1% by modelling how average families would fare under his vision. A married couple earning $5m a year with two children and $12,000 in child care expenses would only get a 3% reduction in their tax bill, he said, compared with a 35% reduction for a similar couple earning $50,000 and with $8,000 in child care.</p> <p>\u201cPeople earning $5m will receive virtually no change in their tax bill at all,\u201d he said. </p> <p>But in other parts of his address, he underlined reforms that would be to the advantage of wealthy Americans, including his proposed abolition of the estate tax that is only paid on inheritances valued at over $5m. He also repeated his promise to slash the business tax rate from 35% to 15%, earning a robust cheer from the many corporate leaders eating lunch on the ballroom floor in front of him.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s economic manifesto has been widely criticized by analysts. This week the global firm <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-trump-economy-idUSKCN11J25M\">Oxford Economics</a> predicted that the US economy could shrink by $1tn by the end of a single term Trump presidency as a result of his proposed tax cuts, barriers to trade and mass deportation of undocumented immigrants.</p> <p>That would be the equivalent of 5% of US GDP, with knock-on effects for growth around the world.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/14/trump-clinton-health-medical-records-ohio-rally\">Donald Trump questions Clinton\u2019s health at rally in Ohio: \u2018You think this is easy?\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>One of the specific sticking points with the Trump plan highlighted by experts has been how the sums add up.

The candidate replied that he believed \u201ceventually, over time it will work out. The big thing over neutrality is the amount of business we will generate, and how we will stop companies take jobs out of the country\u201d.</p> <p>Despite the new figures that he peppered through his talk, the policy he outlined remained posited on faith that his strong leadership would bring about levels of growth and job creation that have eluded recent incumbents of the Oval Office. \u201cThis is what our new future will look like,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m going to lower your taxes, I\u2019m going to get rid of regulation, I\u2019m going to unleash American energy.

But even within this subgenre, Lyndon B Johnson has been a surprisingly recurrent character. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/sep/13/jackie-review-natalie-portman-kennedy-jfk\">Jackie review \u2013 Natalie Portman astonishes in remarkably intimate portrait</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Bryan Cranston took on the role in HBO\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/tv/2016/06/29/all-the-way-bryan-cranstons-charisma-blew-everyone-else-clean-o/\">All the Way</a>, he cropped up in Pablo Larrain\u2019s Oscar-tipped <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/sep/13/jackie-review-natalie-portman-kennedy-jfk\">Jackie</a> and he\u2019s now front and centre in Rob Reiner\u2019s earnest but entertaining drama. He\u2019s played by Woody Harrelson, an odd choice for anyone who\u2019s ever seen a picture of Johnson, but with heavy prosthetics, distracting at first and also strangely useless given that he ends up looking more like Nixon. </p> <p>The film focuses on Johnson\u2019s rivalry with John F Kennedy as the pair go up against each other as the democratic candidate and once Johnson loses, we see him deal with life as an over-experienced vice-president and, after tragedy strikes, president. Overwhelmed with responsibility and disrespected by Kennedy\u2019s aides, he finds himself stuck in a difficult situation.</p> <p>From the first notes of worthy presidential music, it\u2019s clear that LBJ is not going to worry itself with reinventing the political biopic. Reiner\u2019s take on the Kennedy years of Johnson\u2019s life is strictly conventional, even down to the oft-used marching drums in the background, but it\u2019s solidly entertaining nonetheless, its adherence to formula never dulling its drama.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dg3k23ixGqQ\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/dg3k23ixGqQ?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>The dialogue might often resort to painfully clunky exposition but it never resorts to a simplistic portrayal of Johnson and his politics. As an older southern democrat, he\u2019s torn between his heritage and Kennedy\u2019s progressive views and, in particular, his strong belief in the importance of civil rights. He\u2019s painted as a man playing both sides but also learning, his pragmatism and values ultimately ushering him towards equality. It\u2019s refreshing in a rigid, and often cliched, film as this to see such a flawed protagonist.</p> <p>There\u2019s also a pleasing focus on political minutiae, detailed enough but accessibly conveyed and the film weaves in the growing issue of aesthetics (Johnson is deeply aware of his position as workhorse compared to JFK\u2019s showhorse) at a time when media representation was starting to have a profound effect on voters. There\u2019s also a nicely played scene where Johnson discusses the importance of civil rights with a bigioted southern senator (a believably foul Richard Jenkins) as his black maid serves them dinner.</p> <p>Harrelson overcomes the heavy layer of prosthetics to deliver a commanding and layered take on the president. He easily flips from confidence (bragging about the size of his penis to a busy room) to embarrassment (a Dallas crowd eager for JFK has no interest in him) and it\u2019s a pleasure to see him play something other than wisecracking support. Yet Jennifer Jason Leigh has precious little to do in the thankless role of his wife and, at a tight 98 minutes, the film feels somewhat short on their relationship.</p> <p>It\u2019s a well-worn road but Reiner steers with skill, delivering his best film since 1995\u2019s The American President, hinting that he might have more political tales in him yet. It might not go all the way but it\u2019s a biopic that\u2019s just about worth your vote.</p>",
  "<p>There are very few victims of Russian hackers who emerge with their reputations enhanced. Colin Powell may be unique for that alone, judging from the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2016/sep/14/hacked-colin-powell-emails-jolt-presidential-race\">bluntness of his leaked emails</a> about Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton.</p> <p>To be clear: hacking personal emails is reprehensible, and those behind the hack are scumbags who are trying to manipulate American voters.</p> <p>To be doubly clear: the news media (including this column) have no principles and no shame in exploiting the ill-gotten product of those scumbags. Guilty, as charged.<br></p> <p>And yet the Powell emails are so insightful and direct, it seems a shame \u2013 even if we have no sense of shame to let them pass by without comment.<br></p> <p>First, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/14/colin-powell-emails-trump-disgrace-but-no-clinton-vote\">the emails</a> are as scathing as they are fresh from his outbox. One, dating from June, describes Donald Trump as \u201ca national disgrace\u201d and \u201can international pariah\u201d. Powell said Democrats had no need to attack Trump because he was \u201cin the process of destroying himself\u201d.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Another, from just last month, describes Trump\u2019s pursuit of Barack Obama\u2019s birth certificate as racist. \u201cYup, the whole birther movement was racist,\u201d Powell said. \u201cThat\u2019s what the 99% believe. When Trump couldn\u2019t keep that up he said he also wanted to see if the certificate noted that he was a Muslim\u2026 As I have said before, \u2018What if he was?\u2019 Muslims are born as Americans everyday.\u201d<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>You might say he considered Trump and his supporters deplorable.</p> <p>As Buzzfeed <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/andrewkaczynski/colin-powell-calls-trump-national-disgrace-in-personal-email?utm_term=.pjyzxWePJ#.esPQg45BK\">reports</a>, the emails were obtained by <a href=\"http://dcleaks.com/\">DCLeaks.com</a>, a site with reported links to Russian intelligence. If such reports are true, the Russians may have finally misread the impact of their leaks. Far from making Powell look foolish, the emails only savage the candidate who so admires Vladimir Putin.</p> <p>Powell was astonished, for instance, that Trump would hire Roger Ailes, the disgraced former head of Fox News, who now sits in a cesspool of sexual harassment claims. \u201cAiles as an advisor won\u2019t heal women, don\u2019t you think,\u201d wrote Powell.</p> <p>Powell was already a national treasure. Not just as a former general, national security adviser, chairman of the joint chiefs and secretary of state. But as the best qualified and most charismatic man never to have run for president.</p> <p>There was a good reason why Bill Clinton\u2019s team was so worried Powell might run for election as the Republican nominee in 1996: because he could have won, and reshaped the political landscape for a generation.</p> <p>Instead he served another president who spent his first term siding with Powell\u2019s haters. Like Tony Blair, Powell was na\u00efve to think he could talk sense into George W Bush, or outflank his arch enemies, Dick Cheney and Donald Rumsfeld.</p> <p>They set him up as the fall guy for their half-baked case for war, cashing in on his credibility. They filled the first draft of his UN speech with bogus reports linking Saddam Hussein to 9/11, leaving Powell\u2019s team no time and no room to weed out all their fabrications. Still he later called the speech a painful and devastating moment: a permanent blot on his record, as he put it.</p> <p>That directness is what shines through the emails, along with a sharp sense of political and media analysis.</p> <p>Quite rightly, Powell is uncomfortable about condemning every Trump eruption because the response merely adds fuel to the fire. \u201cYou guys are playing his game, you are his oxygen,\u201d he wrote to one would-be interviewer. \u201cI will watch and pick the timing, not respond to the latest outrage.\u201d</p> <p>He put it more succinctly in another email: \u201cTo go on and call him an idiot just emboldens him.\u201d</p> <p>Powell is also blunt about Hillary Clinton\u2019s failings, especially the effort to excuse her use of a private email server by pointing to his email use in the state department.</p> <p>\u201cHRC could have killed this two years ago by merely telling everyone honestly what she had done and not tie me into it,\u201d he wrote late last month. \u201cI told her staff three times not to try that gambit. I had to throw a mini-tantrum at a Hamptons party to get their attention. She keeps tripping into these \u2018character\u2019 minefields.\u201d</p> <p>There is surely the opening of a whole book chapter in that Hamptons party. Obama likes to say that the smallness of our politics doesn\u2019t match the magnitude of our challenges. You don\u2019t get much smaller than a mini-tantrum about an email server.</p> <p>\u201cI would rather not have to vote for her, although she is a friend I respect,\u201d Powell <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/15/us/politics/colin-powell-emails-hack-donald-trump.html?hp&amp;action=click&amp;pgtype=Homepage&amp;clickSource=story-heading&amp;module=first-column-region&amp;region=top-news&amp;WT.nav=top-news&amp;_r=0\">wrote</a> in another email, that described her \u201cunbridled ambition\u201d and her husband\u2019s unbridled libido.</p> <p>Naturally, Trump has shown none of Powell\u2019s self-control or strategic thinking in responding to the hacked emails.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>\u201cI was never a fan of Colin Powell after his weak understanding of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq = disaster,\u201d Trump <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/776269061823074304\">tweeted</a> on Thursday morning. \u201cWe can do much better!\u201d</p> <p>This from a real estate developer who supported the invasion of Iraq and has repeatedly lied about it throughout the course of the campaign. But as Powell says, calling him an idiot just emboldens him. So we will just have to settle with deplorable.</p> <p>Powell likes to tell the story of a post-Soviet meeting of security officials in Europe. There he was confronted by an old Russian general who chastised him for wanting to keep Nato alive when the Warsaw Pact had died. Powell grinned as he recounted his reply: \u201cIt\u2019s hard to close a club that people still want to join. I can\u2019t help it if my club is more popular than yours.\u201d</p> <p>Powell\u2019s personal club remains more popular than anybody else\u2019s. Not least because he never ran for president, never suffering the kind of reputational damage that is strewn across that battlefield.</p> <p>As the Russian hackers have unwittingly revealed, Powell remains a sharp observer of presidential politics, no matter whose club you belong to.</p>",

She \u2013 and the rest of the adult Trump kids \u2013 stole the show throughout the week.<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/15/trumps-childcare-plan-good-for-rich-what-about-rest-of-us\">Trump's childcare plan is good for the rich. But what about the rest of us? | Carmel Martin</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Ivanka in particular has all her father\u2019s \u201cpros\u201d and almost none of his incredibly off-putting cons. She has balanced motherhood with owning her own company. She has been successful in practically every area of business, including <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2016/06/07/ivanka-trump-book-working-women/\">her work</a> as an author, all while keeping a certain amount of traditional femininity that Republicans still praise. She came into the political spotlight as an outsider but has proven she has plenty of acumen on the campaign trail, at the same level or even beyond that of her father. She has access to the Trump family\u2019s self-funding resources. She would even have Donald Trump himself at her disposal as a fiercely loyal supporter unafraid to speak his mind on camera.</p> <p>In addition to bringing a sharp sense of business management and outside perspective, Ivanka doesn\u2019t carry the same downsides as Donald. She has managed to stay above her father\u2019s controversial statements about birth certificates, immigration and war heroes. She doesn\u2019t have a combative relationship with the press or drive away young and Hispanic voters. Throughout the 2016 campaign, Ivanka has remained poised, well-spoken and relatable.</p> <p>Bonus: Ivanka Trump cancels out Hillary Clinton\u2019s \u201cwoman\u201d card.</p> <p>There are many incredible Republican women, both elected and in leadership, but the GOP has yet to secure a serious female presidential contender. This perpetuates the stereotype that the party consists of mostly old white men, especially since the presidential race gets more news coverage than any other campaign. While the stereotype doesn\u2019t hold true down-ballot, the past few Republican presidential candidates haven\u2019t helped the GOP image problem regardless of the broad choices at the start of the primary.</p> <p>The Trumps intimately understand the importance of image. Ivanka\u2019s image includes her own lovely features and her picture-perfect all-American family. If she ran on a Republican ticket, she\u2019d be hard to ignore.</p> <p>In addition to her non-political qualities, we have already seen the kind of policies Ivanka would want to focus on in a hypothetical run for office. Her convention speech touched on some controversial ideas among conservatives, such as the role of the government in paid maternity leave and childcare (she was instrumental in crafting her father\u2019s policy in that area). </p> <p>How the federal government should approach these issues is still up for debate among both parties, but Ivanka\u2019s raising the issue shows how in touch she is with the real-world problems facing Americans. Ivanka showed both an awareness of these challenges and a certain sensitivity that her father lacks. Her openness about her own family, including adorable pictures of her new baby, probably doesn\u2019t hurt either.</p> <p>She also focused on the importance of equal opportunity for all. Both Trumps have hired and promoted women for leadership positions, but Ivanka doesn\u2019t have any on-the-record sexist comments to accompany hers. In fact, when she <a href=\"http://time.com/4417579/republican-convention-ivanka-trump-transcript/\">talked</a> about her father hiring the best person for the for the job, it became quite clear that Donald\u2019s faith in his daughter was not misplaced. She offered a far more convincing profile of her father as a smart and caring businessman than anything Trump has said on his own.</p> <p>Many Trump supporters argue that their candidate is a real person, unlike the \u201cestablishment\u201d politicians in Washington. But the Trump brand \u2013 plastered across casinos, hotels and televisions shows \u2013 has made Donald larger than real life. </p> <p>Ivanka, on the other hand, posts Instagram photos without makeup, is frank about her motherhood and retains a down-to-earth persona effortlessly exuded during her meetings with voters. A strong woman who has managed to balance her family and success seems like a no-brainer.</p> <p>Even though Ivanka turns 35 next month, making her eligible for the office of commander-in-chief, she sadly won\u2019t be on the ballot in place of her dad. But since family dynasties have been in political fashion for the past 15 years in the US, she might consider what she could bring to the GOP in future races.</p>",
  "<p>It is mid-afternoon and the Venice Lido is a ghost town baking in the sun. The film festival wound down the previous evening, and now the thoroughfare between the beach and the cinemas is deserted except for construction workers in threes and fours dismantling the decorations. The glitz has faded. The stars are gone.</p> <p>Well, most of them. Denzel Washington and Chris Pratt are the last men standing in this tumbleweed town. In the street, their faces loom menacingly out of the posters for the remake of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/sep/08/the-magnificent-seven-review-denzel-washington-chris-pratt-antoine-fuqua-toronto-film-festival-tiff\">The Magnificent Seven</a>, in which an ethnically diverse cast of outlaws and miscreants defend oppressed townsfolk from a brutal tyrant. Seated at a table in a hotel room, the actors appear somewhat less than magnificent. Washington is slumped in his seat. He is 61, heavy-set, tired-looking. He may be dressed in a baggy, grey T-shirt and jogging bottoms but his magnetism is undimmed. When he peers straight at you, there\u2019s a crackle of electricity in the air. Those aren\u2019t ordinary eyes: they\u2019re the eyes of all the indomitable men he\u2019s played, from Steve Biko to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/feb/19/malcolm-x-spike-lee-biopic-black-cinema-selma-the-butler\">Malcolm X</a>, the boxer Ruben Carter in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/apr/24/the-hurricane-rubin-carter-denzel-washington\">The Hurricane</a> to the drug lord Frank Lucas in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2007/nov/16/russellcrowe.denzelwashington\">American Gangster</a>. He sweats gravitas.</p> <p>His 37-year-old co-star \u2013 who is wearing jeans and a thin suede jacket, and sporting a sketchy beard \u2013 carries his fame more lightly. Pratt made his name as a deliriously dopey member of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/parks-and-recreation\">Parks and Recreation</a> ensemble. Superstardom only descended, though, once his loosey-goosey charms were transposed to a blockbuster setting in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/guardians-of-the-galaxy\">Guardians of the Galaxy</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/jurassic-world\">Jurassic World</a>. A <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apo12sMt-rY\">second Guardians movie</a> is due next May.</p> <p>For now, it\u2019s all about The Magnificent Seven. Except neither Washington nor Pratt seems especially keen to go on the record about any resonance the film might have in the wider world. With a cast list that offers a rebuke to conventional Hollywood casting (there\u2019s even a woman among the seven heroes) and a conflict that pits poor against rich, the movie is in the tradition of westerns that comment on our times, such as <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjjAHAmY-DU\">Soldier Blue</a> or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/oct/19/wild-bunch-peckinpah-action\">The Wild Bunch</a>. The film\u2019s director, Antoine Fuqua, who coaxed Washington toward an Oscar-winning performance as a corrupt cop in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2002/feb/01/culture.peterbradshaw\">Training Day</a>, has said westerns \u201creflect where we are in the world\u201d.

Why make the film now? \u201cYou\u2019re putting too much on it, man!\u201d Washington hoots. \u201cIt\u2019s a movie. Antoine was excited about westerns. He grew up watching them with his grandma. He wanted to see me and Chris riding on horses. Next thing I know \u2026\u201d He mimes trotting along on horseback, invisible reins in his hands. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t, like: \u2018How are we going to reflect society?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Point taken. As Washington <a href=\"http://www.interviewmagazine.com/film/new-again-denzel-washington/\">pointed out in 1990</a>, \u201cGuys won\u2019t spend $15 on Friday night to take their girls to see [<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/jun/10/cry-freedom-richard-attenborough-reel-history\">Cry Freedom</a>, in which he played Steve Biko]. Making movies like that shows that we\u2019re committed to doing something about the issues, but people can see issues on the news for free.\u201d But doesn\u2019t The Magnificent Seven fall into the category of entertainment that carries a thoughtful, progressive message? \u201cThat\u2019s for the audience to decide. We\u2019ll see. No hidden baggage over here!\u201d He raises his arms, as though inviting me to frisk him. \u201cI\u2019m sorry if I\u2019m not deep enough for you. I\u2019m trying!

Pratt leans in. \u201cThere\u2019s definitely a conversation that\u2019s happening around the world and the movie seems to have become part of that. But that wasn\u2019t our intention. I\u2019m not the most articulate guy. I wish I were. So I\u2019m not gonna be the one to express it. At the end of the day, it\u2019s two hours of kickass entertainment.\u201d</p> <p>I try another tack. The villain, played by Peter Sarsgaard, is a greedy industrialist whose only love is for land and power. Any current presidential candidates spring to mind? Washington is having none of it. \u201cNah. That\u2019s what you may see. The audience may not.\u201d I\u2019m part of the audience, though. \u201cAre you? You gonna pay to see the movie?\u201d I\u2019ve already seen it. \u201cAre you gonna pay? Answer the question.\u201d I tell him I would do had I not seen it. I start to explain that I paid to see <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/feb/26/safe-house-review-denzel-washington\">Safe House</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/nov/28/unstoppable-denzel-washington-review\">Unstoppable</a> and many of his other films. But it\u2019s too late. He\u2019s already laughing and braying (\u201cA-ha! See? Right?\u201d) and wagging his finger triumphantly.</p> <p>\u201cThe average person who\u2019s paying to see it is just looking for a good time. When I did Cry Freedom, a doctor friend told me: \u2018Denzel, I have life and death in my hands every single day. I go to the movies to escape.\u2019 What I got from that was that just because it\u2019s important to me doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s important to the everyday person. We just try to give them enough to get the monkey off their back so they can feel like: \u2018Hey, I\u2019m Chris Pratt up there,\u2019 or \u2018I\u2019m Denzel.\u2019 It ain\u2019t that deep.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9f5d085a555697ebe074e1f3a43325d2dadd27ae\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9f5d085a555697ebe074e1f3a43325d2dadd27ae/79_0_1675_1005/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Chris Pratt in Guardians of the Galaxy.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Chris Pratt in Guardians of the Galaxy.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Uncredited/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I point out that films can easily contain both action and ideas. They\u2019re not mutually exclusive. He has starred in plenty of examples \u2013 Malcolm X, Crimson Tide, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2006/mar/26/philipfrench1\">Inside Man</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/jan/31/flight-review\">Flight</a>. \u201cSure,\u201d he concedes. The pressing issue now is why neither actor will offer even the most superficial interpretation of the new picture. Is there a danger that if they describe it as one thing \u2013 the \u201cdiversity western\u201d, say, or the \u201canti-Trump allegory\u201d \u2013 then it will become fixed as that forever? \u201cNo, there\u2019s a danger if <em>you</em> do,\u201d Washington tells me. \u201cHow many readers you got?\u201d I tell him what I can remember about circulation figures and online traffic. \u201cWhat an opportunity you have.\u201d He sits back in his seat in the manner of a statesman who has settled a complex debate decisively, rather than an actor who has avoided a question. He stares at me for a moment, then his face breaks into a smile. \u201cI\u2019m just messing witchoo,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Once again, Pratt steps in with a placatory aside. \u201cIt\u2019s tough these days. I\u2019m expecting people to talk about this movie and form their own opinions. I want theirs to be as valuable as mine. I\u2019m not a politician. I\u2019m not in the business of trying to shape people\u2019s opinions. I\u2019m an entertainer. I know there\u2019s a giant industry now of talking about stuff and saying stuff.\u201d</p> <p>Washington lunges forward, palms downwards on the table. \u201cToday\u2019s subject: phones,\u201d he says in the mock-authoritative voice of a news anchor. \u201cAre phones safe for you? We have three experts on the left. And three experts on the right. We\u2019ll be right back after this.\u201d Pratt launches into an advertising jingle \u2013 \u201cMaybe it\u2019s Maybelline!\u201d \u2013 and the two men rock back and forth, laughing raucously. I laugh too, although I\u2019m confused. Pratt\u2019s objection, as far as I can make out, is that people are prone to discussion. He sets me straight: \u201cI find myself kind of withdrawing a bit. Look, no one pays me for my opinion. If I say something stupid and it becomes a headline, it\u2019s, like: \u2018Guess what Chris said!\u2019 Then everyone clicks on this stupid thing I said.\u201d He looks into his lap. \u201cThis is going really well,\u201d he says quietly.</p> <p>I ask if they\u2019ve both simply resolved to keep personal and political opinions private. \u201cWould you?\u201d Washington shoots back. I tell him that if he asked me a question, I\u2019d answer it straight. \u201cWho would you vote for if you could vote in the US election?\u201d Easy. Hillary Clinton. And him? \u201cThat\u2019s private.\u201d Pratt perks up: \u201cI\u2019m writing \u2018Denzel\u2019 on the ballot,\u201d he says.

I ask how he feels now and for a moment he looks like a man sick to death of having things he said more than 20 years ago read back to him. \u201cI hope so,\u201d he admits finally. Then it\u2019s back to entertainment. \u201cWhatever I\u2019m thinking doesn\u2019t have anything to do with the people who go see the movie to have fun. I never saw any movie because I read an article about it.\u201d Ah. Now the unspoken question hanging in the air is: why are we doing this interview?</p> <p>Instead, I steer it back to him. As a young actor, Washington was a big fan of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/james-earl-jones\">James Earl Jones</a>. Wouldn\u2019t he have been interested in Jones\u2019s opinions? He swivels round in his chair to address Pratt: \u201cI saw James Earl Jones do Oedipus the King. He was magnificent. I went backstage and he let me try on his rings in the dressing room. They were huge! And he had this big, booming voice.\u201d He turns back to me. \u201cThat\u2019s what it was. Not: \u2018Mr Jones, what are your political opinions?\u2019 Who cares?\u201d So wouldn\u2019t he have been curious to read about what Jones thought? \u201cThat assumes I was reading.\u201d</p> <p>Pratt jumps in. \u201cThey didn\u2019t market that kind of thing,\u201d he says. On the contrary, I tell him, whenever I research actors from the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s, they are invariably more forthcoming in their interviews. They offer opinions. They risk controversy. They don\u2019t always play it safe. He asks me why that is and I suggest to him that information spreads so quickly now, and in so many different directions, that self-censorship and rigid PR management are the only ways to exert control. \u201cYou\u2019re in the fortunate position of being able to research and take your time,\u201d Washington tells me. \u201cBut, with clickbait, it doesn\u2019t even need to be true. It just has to be first. \u2018Oh, it was all lies? Who cares?\u2019\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8900206e7f841ee2c5514558c9d070189fd1c0f6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8900206e7f841ee2c5514558c9d070189fd1c0f6/800_0_2261_1357/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Denzel Washington and Chris Pratt at The Magnificent Seven premiere in Venice.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Denzel Washington and Chris Pratt at The Magnificent Seven premiere in Venice.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ettore Ferrari/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Indeed, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/jan/24/denzel-washington-flight-movie-star\">last time the Guardian interviewed Washington</a>, the paper was upbraided by his publicists, who claimed that a quote about him not having made friends with his white counterparts in Hollywood had been taken out of context. The furore spread in an instant. Websites inveighed against this newspaper for printing falsehoods. Only after a few days did it transpire that Washington\u2019s representatives had made no such objection. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2013/feb/28/fake-denzel-washington-spokesman\">The complaint itself was a hoax</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/sep/08/the-magnificent-seven-review-denzel-washington-chris-pratt-antoine-fuqua-toronto-film-festival-tiff\">The Magnificent Seven review: moderate remake opens 41st Toronto film festival</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Such misunderstandings perhaps help to explain all the pussyfooting. Even so, Washington and Pratt have managed not to deliver a single tangible opinion \u2013 unless you count their views on the risks of giving opinions. It\u2019s a tonic, then, to speak to Fuqua, who tells me that, yes, his version of The Magnificent Seven is unequivocally a portrait of the modern world. \u201cEverything\u2019s a little chaotic. We\u2019re a bit divided. We\u2019re fighting enemies we can\u2019t see and who don\u2019t play by our rules. There is tyranny. But the best part is we have a choice. In the film, we have black, white, Asian, Mexican, Native American, a white woman, all coming together to fight injustice.\u201d</p> <p>Fuqua has no issue with the movie being seen as an emblem of diversity. \u201cThere\u2019s a problem. We did something about it. And here\u2019s the beauty part: MGM and Sony backed it. No one said: \u2018A black man? A Native American?\u2019\u201d He is even happy for the villain to be regarded as a Trump surrogate. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say not to. He represents that type. When I said tyranny, I meant raping the land, stealing people\u2019s money. I made the movie because I wanted to say that.\u201d I breathe an internal sigh of relief at his directness. That wasn\u2019t so hard, was it? Nothing like getting blood out of stones or opinions out of A-list actors.</p> <p>\u2022 The Magnificent Seven opens in the UK on 23 September.</p>",
  "<p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t half as important as you think you are.\u201d That was the implicit message for Britain in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/14/junckers-speech-was-all-about-concrete-ideas-to-heal-a-divided-eu\" title=\"\">state of the European Union address</a> by European commission president Jean-Claude Juncker. It was a welcome signal for European citizens and politicians exasperated by British indecision and outright incompetence post-referendum. But it was a message unlikely to even register with all those pundits and politicians in Britain still convinced that the EU needs the UK more than vice versa.</p> <p>Modelled on the rather more showily delivered American version, the state of the European Union speech marks the beginning of the political season in Brussels. With the Brexit vote less than three months ago, it naturally contained a number of allusions to British politics. Juncker stated that Europeans face \u201cthe unhappy prospect of a member leaving our ranks\u201d. This he \u201crespected\u201d and \u201cregretted\u201d, as he <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2016/sep/14/jean-claude-juncker-uk-a-la-carte-access-single-market-video\" title=\"\">highlighted the rise in hate crimes</a> against Europeans in Britain since the Brexit vote. Since the penny does not seem to have dropped yet, Juncker reiterated that there is no way the UK can end up with a better deal post-Brexit than it enjoyed as a member.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2016/sep/14/jean-claude-juncker-uk-a-la-carte-access-single-market-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/53xen\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2717384\"            data-video-name=\"Juncker: Europe cannot accept violence against Polish workers \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"AP\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57d91795e4b067ad30087916\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/09/14/160914Juncker1_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/09/14/160914Juncker1.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11872695&amp;format=video/webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2016/sep/14/jean-claude-juncker-uk-a-la-carte-access-single-market-video\">Juncker: Europe cannot accept violence against Polish workers</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>But these were a handful of remarks scattered around a 6,000-word speech that took a good 50 minutes to deliver. Juncker wanted to address the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/13/jean-claude-juncker-eu-is-facing-existential-crisis\" title=\"\">concerns that actually exercise Europeans</a>: refugees, terrorism, economic stagnation, a dysfunctional eurozone architecture and Russian expansionism.

In fact, the prospect of Brexit seems to have helped the EU at least in the short term, with a number of countries seeing an unexpected surge in support for the EU. In the words of prominent German member of the European parliament Manfred Weber: \u201cMany people are now in favour of the EU [after the Brexit vote]. In Germany we have not had these results since the 1970s.\u201d</p> <p>Meanwhile in the Netherlands, the country often held up by Brexiteers as the next to leave, all major parties say they want to reform rather than leave the EU. It is only <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/18/dutch-far-right-leader-geert-wilders-goeson-trial-for-inciting-hatred\" title=\"\">Geert Wilders</a>\u2019 PVV party that actually wants an exit. He currently polls at just under 20%.</p> <p>Medical science uses the word \u201ccrisis\u201d for the point where a patient either irrevocably collapses or turns the corner towards recovery. On the basis of Juncker\u2019s speech, this is the stage where the commission now feels the EU and the eurozone find itself. Following the speech, Vivien Pertusot from the French Institute for International Relations called them the polycrises: urgent and potentially devastating crises occurring simultaneously and often amplifying or feeding on one another while driving member states apart.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/13/restricted-travel-british-people-nigerian-visa-passports\">Welcome to the world of restricted travel, British people | Chibundu Onuzo</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cNever before have I seen so little common ground between our member states,\u201d said Juncker, himself an EU veteran like few others. The EU is in greater danger than ever before, he continued, with greater levels of selfishness, nationalism and parochialism.</p> <p>Yet Juncker also slipped in good news of the sort that somehow rarely reaches the mainstream British press. There had been one million jobs created in Spain over the past three years, and seven million more elsewhere. Public deficits are, on average, now below 2% across the eurozone, down from a terrifying 6.3% in 2009. Juncker might have added the eurozone\u2019s healthy current account surplus, meaning it continues to export more than it imports. This is a stark contrast to the US and Britain, two nations that are becoming ever more indebted because they buy more from foreign countries than they sell.</p> <p>Easily the most refreshing element in the speech, at least for those who have had to endure the Brexit \u201cdebate\u201d, was Juncker\u2019s emphasis on realism. Where Brexiteers continue to indulge in narcissistic fantasies about getting the best of all worlds from the EU while making Britain a world power again, Juncker struck a very different tone. Insisting that \u201csolidarity is the glue that holds the union together\u201d he pointed out that Europeans today make up 8% of the world population. In 2050 that will be down to 5%. \u201cBy then you would not see a single EU country among the top world economies,\u201d Juncker went on. \u201cBut the EU together? We would still be topping the charts.\u201d</p> <p>To which he might have added: \u201cAnd that is true with or without Britain.\u201d</p>",

Vigil points out the same thing happened during her time as a US senator for New York, when it was mainly local press focusing on her work.<br></p> <p>No one is asking Clinton about napkins these days, but that doesn\u2019t mean the sexism has gone. \u201cWithin the beltway press, the sexism has become more nuanced condescension,\u201d Boehlert said. </p> <p>Presidents have also had much more serious health crises far before Clinton came down with a bout of pneumonia. Franklin D Roosevelt wore leg braces and could barely walk when he accepted the Democratic nomination in 1932, before becoming entirely paralyzed. John F Kennedy had Addison\u2019s disease. Both health issues were rarely covered in the media.<br></p> <p>\u201cYet Hillary Clinton had pneumonia, didn\u2019t share it for two days and it was the biggest crime of the century.

According to court papers, the settlement included a \u201cnon-publicity clause\u201d preventing public discussion of the case.</p> <p>Bornstein, 69, has been a licensed physician since July 1976. He has no record of misconduct charges or disciplinary action being brought against him, according to a database maintained by the <a href=\"http://w3.health.state.ny.us/opmc/factions.nsf\">New York state department of health</a> that monitors cases dating back to 1990. </p> <p>Bornstein became part of the US presidential election campaign in December last year when Trump published a doctor\u2019s letter from him that declared the Republican nominee would be the \u201chealthiest individual elected to the presidency\u201d. </p> <p>Last month he said the letter was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/27/donald-trump-doctor-letter-health-harold-bornstein\">written in five minutes while Trump\u2019s limousine waited on the street outside</a>.</p> <p>He reappeared on Wednesday after conducting a physical examination of Trump. A summary report on the examination, reportedly finding Trump to be overweight, was delivered by Trump to the medic and television presenter Dr Mehmet Oz during a taping of Oz\u2019s show. The program is scheduled to be aired on Thursday. <br></p> <p>The 1999 lawsuit seeking damages from Bornstein was brought in the New York courts by Levin\u2019s husband, Kenneth. It said Levin was treated by Bornstein for an unspecified condition at his Manhattan office from July 1994 until her death in January 1998.<br></p> <p>Bornstein prescribed Levin the drugs Tuinal, morphine and Valium \u201cin amounts that were well above therapeutic levels\u201d and despite the fact Levin had a \u201chistory of drinking\u201d, according to the complaint.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>It said Bornstein was \u201cseeing the patient several times a week without providing medical treatment\u201d and failed to notice her clear signs of \u201chabitual addiction which he created or helped to create\u201d.<br></p> <p>Levin began suffering from severe depression and anxiety disorder, according to the lawsuit, which indicated that she was treated for an overdose in 1997. She eventually ingested \u201cunhealthy amounts of barbiturates\u201d the following January that allegedly left her unstable and \u201cprecipitated her fall and death\u201d.<br></p> <p>An autopsy by New York authorities detected the sedatives diazepam, amobarbital and secobarbital in Levin\u2019s blood. According to Levin\u2019s death certificate, she was found dead at her home on Manhattan\u2019s Upper East Side. The official cause and manner of her death were listed as undetermined.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Levin had been earning $67,000 a year working at the actor Dustin Hoffman\u2019s company Punch Productions.<br></p> <p>Kenneth Levin died earlier this year of heart disease.

Levin\u2019s company falsely promised high-profit locations for buyers of their vending machines and misled buyers about how much money they could expect to make.<br></p> <p>Bornstein did not respond to an email sent to the email address given on his official stationery. The attorney who represented Bornstein in the lawsuit, CaraMia Hart, did not respond to an email and voice message seeking comment on Wednesday.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>A <a href=\"http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMsa1012370#t=article\">study published by the New England Journal of Medicine</a> in 2011 found that most doctors in the US working in high-risk specialisms are sued at least once during their career for alleged malpractice. Patients were successful in 22% of cases, according to the study, while 12% of gastroenterologists such as Bornstein received a malpractice lawsuit annually. </p> <p>Records recovered from New York court archives show that Bornstein has been sued for alleged malpractice on at least two other occasions. </p> <p>In 1994, a settlement was reached after patient Claire Wershil alleged that Bornstein left her with \u201csevere and serious permanent physical, mental and psychological injuries\u201d from unspecified treatment. Wershil has since died and attorneys involved in the case did not respond to requests for comment.</p> <p>Bornstein was sued by another patient, Stanley Grant, in 1986. Grant alleged that he was left unable to work following Bornstein\u2019s treatment, which again was not identified in the case file. The lawsuit was concluded in 1990. Its outcome could not be confirmed and Grant\u2019s attorney did not respond to an email seeking comment.</p> <p>A woman who answered the telephone at Bornstein\u2019s office on Wednesday said: \u201cYou\u2019ll have to refer to the campaign, thank you,\u201d and hung up. Reached for a second time and told that the allegations did not relate to Trump\u2019s campaign, the woman said: \u201cThere\u2019s no wrongdoing \u2013 have a nice day,\u201d and hung up again.<br></p>",

Donald Trump leads Hillary Clinton by five points among likely voters in Ohio in a <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2016-09-14/ohio-poll\">new poll</a> put out by the highly reputable Ann Selzer firm for Bloomberg. </p> <p>Trump has a rally in Canton, Ohio, scheduled today, and he planned to visit Flint, Michigan. Clinton remains at home recuperating from pneumonia but was to return to the trail Thursday with a rally in Greensboro, North Carolina. </p> <p>Trump led Clinton 48-43 in a two-way race <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2016-09-14/ohio-poll\">in the poll</a>, which surveyed 802 likely voters from 8-12 September. Clinton placed half of Trump supporters in a \u201cbasket of deplorables\u201d on 9 September and stumbled upon leaving the World Trade Center on 11 September. Trump led Clinton 44-39 in a four-way race in the poll, with Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson scoring an impressive 10 points.</p> <p>No Republican has ever won the presidency without winning Ohio, which has picked the winner in every presidential election since 1964. HuffPost pollster\u2019s <a href=\"http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/pollster/2016-ohio-president-trump-vs-clinton\">average</a> has Clinton two points ahead of Trump in the state.</p> <p>In the Ohio Senate race, where Democrats once hoped to pick up a seat, incumbent Republican Rob Portman was ahead of former Democratic governor Ted Strickland by 17 points in the poll, 53-36%. </p> <h2>Trump tweets Crimea</h2> <p>Trump raised eyebrows Tuesday night with a strange tweet about Crimea and a disconnected riff on the Lincoln-Douglas debates.

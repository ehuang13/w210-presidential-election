  "<p>Donald Trump may be struggling to capture a majority of voters in the heartland of America, but there is one eastern European precinct he would likely carry in a landslide \u2013 if only they were allowed to vote in US elections. </p> <p>The town of Veles, Macedonia (population 44,000), is the unlikely home for dozens of avowedly pro-Trump political news sites, featuring headlines like Hillary\u2019s Illegal Email Just Killed Its First American Spy and This is How Liberals Destroyed America, This Is Why We Need Trump in the White House.</p> <p>The Guardian has identified more than 150 domains registered to people claiming addresses in Veles, though not all of those are associated with active websites. </p> <p>Some claim to garner millions of page views per month. Most others are relatively obscure. All of them exist primarily for one reason \u2013 to cash in on the seemingly endless appetite for news about Donald Trump. And they\u2019re getting a big boost from Facebook. </p> <h2><strong>Fake names and death threats</strong></h2> <p>The creator of a popular Macedonian site, \u201cAlex\u201d claims that he was one of the first of his countrymen to write about US politics. (Alex is not his real name, and he spoke on condition of anonymity.) He claims his neighbors copied his idea and have capitalized on the Trump wave. According to Alex, his site gets more than 1m visits a month, roughly half of them driven by his Facebook page. </p> <p>\u201cWe are an independent news magazine with [our] primary goal to influence American policy, especially politics,\u201d says Alex, who originally favored Ted Cruz in the Republican primaries. \u201cThen my city fellows saw what I was doing and started to copy my work. They are just looking to earn money from ad networks.\u201d</p> <p>In fact, these foreign sites probably wouldn\u2019t exist without their domestic counterparts, from whom they crib many of their stories. (Alex admits he started out by copying and pasting stories from conservative US news sites but says he\u2019s recently hired a half-dozen US-based writers to produce original content.)</p> <p>There are hundreds of relatively obscure political sites registered on this side of the Atlantic that grab news from mainstream outlets, rewrite the headlines to be click-friendly, and blast them out to their readers using Facebook. </p> <p>Many of these sites are registered privately, and the author names that appear on their pages are often fictitious or nonexistent. Using the search engines provided by <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.domaintools.com/\">Domain Tools</a>, the Guardian was able to comb through historical domain name records and contact the owners of some of these sites. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Writing a clickbaity headline and dashing off 400 words in 15 minutes is not a skill they teach in journalism school</p> <footer> <cite></cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>At <a href=\"http://bipartisanreport.com/\">Bipartisan Report</a>, a left-leaning news site, about two-thirds of the authors use pseudonyms, says publisher Justin Brotman. The reason? Personal safety. </p> <p>\u201cMost of our authors start out saying, \u2018I\u2019ll use my real name, I don\u2019t care\u2019,\u201d he says. \u201cOne week in, after they start getting death threats, they change their minds.\u201d </p> <p>Brotman won\u2019t reveal how much money his site makes, but it\u2019s enough to pay a staff of 15 freelance writers, who get compensated based on how much traffic their stories generate. Bipartisan Report\u2019s Facebook page, which has 825,000 likes, plays a large role in sending traffic his way.</p> <p> \u201cAll social media is of utmost importance,\u201d he says. \u201cIf your goal is straight page views then Facebook is the best investment of your time. It does drive more \u2018clicks\u2019 than posting on other platforms with an equal amount of followers.

The ability to write a clickbaity headline, toss in some user-generated video found on YouTube, and dash off a 400-word post in 15 to 30 minutes is a skill they don\u2019t teach in journalism school, says Wade, who graduated from the University of Tennessee with a degree in advertising. </p> <p>Three months after launching the site, Liberty Writers News gets up to 700,000 visitors a day, a number that has been doubling every month. Again, though, they owe nearly all of that growth to Facebook.</p> <p>\u201cAbout 95% of our traffic is coming from Facebook,\u201d Wade says. The <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/LibertyWritersNews/\">Liberty Writers News page</a> has about 150,000 likes, but by sharing stories with other like-minded Facebook pages, they can extend their reach to as many as 7m or 8m viewers, he adds. </p> <p>They spend around $3,000 a month paying Facebook to promote the page. Once they started doing that, their traffic doubled, says Wade.</p> <p>They also end some stories with enthusiastic cries to \u201c*** Share this right now! Let\u2019s beat the liberal media to it. Share, share, share it all over Facebook.\u201d </p> <p>But what Facebook gives, it also takes away, Goldman adds. If one of their stories gets shared too quickly, Facebook assumes it is spam and throttles it for a period of time, which reduces the number of people who can see it in their news feed. That doesn\u2019t happen to mainstream sites such as the New York Times or Washington Post, he adds.</p> <p>Those sites feature a blue check mark on their Facebook pages, certifying they are authentic brands. That\u2019s one of the reasons the pair are talking to the press \u2013 to establish their credentials as a legitimate news organization so Facebook will stop throttling them. </p> <p>\u201cWe want that blue check mark,\u201d Wade says. </p> <p>The US presidential election will be over in less than three months. Regardless of the outcome, Trump fever is likely to subside, possibly leaving many of these sites without their biggest source of traffic. Goldman and Wade say they\u2019ll just transition to covering other news about politics or celebrities. \u201cPeople love stories about celebrities,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Even Alex the Macedonian publisher is not worried. \u201cI think my traffic will be fine if Trump doesn\u2019t win,\u201d he says. \u201cThere are too many haters on the net, and all of my audience hates Hillary.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Nigel Farage, the anti-EU British politician and former Ukip leader, will appear with Donald Trump at a rally on Wednesday, a week after the US presidential candidate branded himself \u201cMr Brexit\u201d and tapped one of the leading American supporters of Brexit to run his campaign.</p> <p>The Trump campaign confirmed that Farage would appear with Trump at an evening rally in Jackson, Mississippi, to tell US voters \u201cthe Brexit story\u201d of how he triumphed over the electoral odds. Farage will not endorse Trump. </p> <p>Trump hopes to ride to victory a populist wave of nationalist enthusiasm comparable to the movement behind <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/22/brexit-means-brexit-when-is-big-question\">Britain\u2019s June vote to leave the European Union</a>. As leader at the time of Ukip, Farage was a key promoter of the Brexit.</p> <p>Instead, the British politician, who was invited by Mississippi governor Phil Bryant, will draw parallels between what he sees as the inspirational story of Brexit and Trump\u2019s campaign. Farage will describe the Republican\u2019s campaign as a similar crusade by grassroots activists against \u201cbig banks and global political insiders\u201d and how those who feel disaffected and disenfranchised can become involved in populist, rightwing politics. With Trump lagging in the polls, just as Brexit did prior to the vote on the referendum, Farage will also hearten supporters by insisting that they can prove pundits and oddsmakers wrong as well.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/05/how-remain-failed-inside-story-doomed-campaign\">How remain failed: the inside story of a doomed campaign | Rafael Behr</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This message resonates with the Trump campaign\u2019s efforts to reach out to blue collar voters who have become disillusioned with American politics, while also adding a unique flair to Trump\u2019s never staid campaign rallies.</p> <p>The event will mark the first meeting between Farage and Trump.</p> <p>Arron Banks, the businessman who backed Leave.EU, the Brexit campaign group associated with the UK Independence party (Ukip), tweeted that he would be meeting Trump over dinner and was looking forward to Farage\u2019s speech.</p> <p>The appointment last week of Stephen Bannon, former chairman of the Breitbart website, as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/20/steve-bannon-profile-breitbart-trump-campaign-manager\">\u201cCEO\u201d of Trump\u2019s campaign</a> has seen the example of the Brexit vote, which Breitbart enthusiastically advocated, rise to the fore in Trump\u2019s campaign narrative.</p> <p>Speaking to a local radio station before the joint rally, Farage urged Americans to \u201cgo out and fight\u201d against Hillary Clinton. </p> <p>\u201cI am going to say to people in this country that the circumstances, the similarities, the parallels between the people who voted Brexit and the people who could beat Clinton in a few weeks time here in America are uncanny,\u201d Farage told Super Talk Mississippi. \u201cIf they want things to change they have get up out of their chairs and go out and fight for it. It can happen. We\u2019ve just proved it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI am being careful,\u201d he added when asked if he supported Trump. \u201cIt\u2019s not for me as a foreign politician to say who you should vote for ... All I will say is that if you vote for Hillary Clinton, then nothing will change. She represents the very politics that we\u2019ve just broken through the Brexit vote in the United Kingdom.\u201d</p> <p>Asked if he thought this was the biggest factor in the Brexit referendum, Farage said: \u201cIt was the key. It was the absolute key. The reason we won the referendum ... is that we believe immigration should be controlled.\u201d</p> <p>Both Farage and Trump are keen to limit immigration and protect voters against some of the impact of globalisation.<br></p> <p>Farage was condemned during the EU referendum campaign for using anti-immigration rhetoric, including a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/16/nigel-farage-defends-ukip-breaking-point-poster-queue-of-migrants\">poster showing a queue of refugees</a> with the slogan \u201cBreaking Point\u201d; Trump has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/15/donald-trump-immigration-test-isis-islamic-state-foreign-policy\">promised to impose \u201cextreme vetting\u201d</a> on potential immigrants.</p> <p>In a further parallel with Brexit politics, the Trump campaign has argued in recent days that it enjoys support not reflected in the polls, from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/23/donald-trump-campaign-news-polls-kellyanne-conway\">undercover voters</a> who are shy about admitting their support for the controversial nominee.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/766246213079498752\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">They will soon be calling me MR.

  "<p>From my house overlooking Managua, the city at night looks like an amusement park \u2013 more Walt Disney fantasy than the capital of the poorest country in the American continent. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/world/mexico-americas/la-fg-nicaragua-trees-20150524-story.html\">Gigantic metal trees</a>, each studded with hundreds of colored lights have been installed all over town. A few might have been fine, but 130 of them in our small city are overwhelming and kitsch. </p> <p>This makeover is the work of our eccentric first lady and future vice-president, Rosario Murillo: her way of imprinting herself in our lives. </p> <p>Considering what is going on in Nicaragua, I often feel I am immersed in a twisted, magical-realist novel. Everything that was not supposed to happen again in my country is coming back. </p> <p>We are reliving all that I thought had been eradicated when we, the Sandinista rebels, entered Managua on 19 July 1979 and ended 45 years of Somoza dynasty. </p> <p>What hurts the most, is to see the past return in the figure of our old comrade-in-arms, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/daniel-ortega\">Daniel Ortega</a>. He and his wife have carefully woven a sticky web to trap Nicaraguans in a net of illusory progress.</p> <p>Ortega ruled Nicaragua from 1979 to 1990and in 2007, he ran for re-election. </p> <p>I campaigned against him, certain that if he was re-elected, he would stay in power at all costs. </p> <p>Friends tried to convince me Nicaragua was no longer the same. After experiencing 16 years of budding democracy, people would reject his authoritarian tendencies, they said. </p> <p>But Ortega \u2013 aided by his wife \u2013 managed to sell himself to the Nicaraguan people as a democratic revolutionary.</p> <p>Murillo designed a campaign that promised peace and love. She covered the John Lennon song Give Peace a Chance and used it with her own lyrics as a campaign theme. </p> <p>Ortega and Murillo made amends with the Catholic church, and \u2013 after 25 years of living together \u2013 they were married by Managua\u2019s cardinal and former nemesis, Miguel Obando y Bravo. </p> <p>Miraculously, the couple went from dangerous atheists to fervent Christians from one day to the next. The illusion worked. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/nov/08/1\">He got elected</a>. </p> <p>A hard-working, determined woman, with a quasi-superstitious belief in her mission as savior of the people, Murillo has been key in strengthening Ortega\u2019s hold on power. </p> <p>She defended her husband even when her daughter from her first marriage accused Ortega of sexually abusing her. Her loyalty paid off, and she obtained a great deal of power. </p> <p>Meanwhile, Ortega set about exerting absolute control over state institutions such as the electoral council, the supreme court, the national assembly, the army and the police.</p> <p>Then he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/07/nicaragua-daniel-ortega-second-terms\">reformed the constitution</a> to allow for indefinite re-elections. Most recently, in a coup de grace to any semblance of democracy, he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/26/nicaragua-opposition-daniel-ortega-presidential-election\">took away</a> the legal representation of the only opposition force capable of challenging him in the 2016 elections, which he then assigned to sycophants guaranteed to do his bidding. </p> <p> </p> <p>Ortega had already announced in a speech that he would not accept international observers for the 6 November elections. \u201cShameless,\u201d he called them, \u201cthey should observe their governments, not us.\u201d </p> <p>Meanwhile, Murillo began to appear more visibly in their political propaganda. While Ortega has not given one single press conference to the national media since 2007, every day at midday Murillo addresses the people on radio and TV, exalting the Christian, socialist and solidaristic nature of their political model.</p> <p>Earlier this month, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/03/daniel-ortega-nicaraguan-sandinista-president-rosario-murillo\">Ortega named his running mate</a>: Rosario Murillo. </p> <p>The US and the European Union have expressed their concern, but Ortega has his anti-imperialist rhetoric at the ready and seems to relish the prospect of another round of defiance. For him, this is the second coming of the Sandinista revolution. </p> <p>So far, the Nicaraguan people have mostly been passive. Ortega and Murillo have used billions from Venezuela to give bonuses to state employees and farmers, to distribute roofing materials in poor neighborhoods and to finance a variety of social programs. </p> <p>Scared by the possibility of another bloody struggle, Nicaraguans have opted to take what they can and keep their opinions to themselves. </p> <p>Somoza had two sons to continue his dynasty, Ortega and Murillo have five sons and two daughters. </p> <p>Though they might feel very strong, we have seen this before. Nothing is for ever.</p>",
  "<p>So this is what liberation looks like: four armed officers <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/24/french-police-make-woman-remove-burkini-on-nice-beach?CMP=twt_gu\" title=\"\">ordering a woman to undress in public</a>. France\u2019s prime minister, Manuel Valls, has backed the mayors ordering \u201cburkini bans\u201d on their beaches by arguing, among other things, that the garment <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/17/french-pm-supports-local-bans-burkinis\" title=\"\">is part of the enslavement of women</a>. The photos from Nice, in which a Muslim woman removes her tunic under duress, show that claim of upholding women\u2019s rights to be as erroneous as the others advanced in support of the measures \u2013 variously, that covering up for religious reasons while at the seaside or while swimming is unhygienic, or a \u201cprovocation\u201d, or contrary to French values. The images are preposterous as well as ugly, highlighting the profound mismatch between stated ideals and their consequence; and an imagined threat to the national community and the means used to subdue it, with multiple gun-toting policemen required to confront one sunbathing woman. Which French values are being defended is unclear. Not liberation; nor equality; nor fraternity \u2013 since women who wish to wear the burkini (or, it seems, the hijab and loose-fitting clothes) are confronted with a choice between dressing as they feel fit or removing themselves from a public space.</p> <p>The text of the Cannes ban refers to those who wear \u201costentatiously\u201d religious dress as disrespectful of good manners and la\u00efcit\u00e9, the French concept of secularism founded on freedom of conscience, a strict separation between religion and the state, and the freedom to exercise any faith. That reflects <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/13/pork-school-dinners-france-secularism-children-religious-intolerance\" title=\"\">a deepening battle over the true meaning of the philosophy</a> and, in particular, an attempt by the right to clothe its xenophobia and Islamophobia more respectably. France is becoming increasingly politically polarised in the run-up to this November\u2019s rightwing primaries and next year\u2019s presidential election, the electoral calendar meshing alarmingly with the fallout from terrorist atrocities. The rise of Marine Le Pen and her party has encouraged others to buy into her rhetoric. Nicolas Sarkozy\u2019s announcement this week that he would run again for top office came with a message clearly aimed at far-right voters. He promised to extend the ban on the hijab in schools to universities, to restrict access to benefits for women who repeatedly violate the existing burqa ban, and to scrap a law authorising immigrants to be reunited with their families. He has denounced \u201cthe tyranny of minorities\u201d.</p> <p>The Nice ban refers specifically to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/15/lorry-rams-bastille-day-crowd-in-nice-killing-at-least-70\" title=\"\">last month\u2019s Bastille Day attack in the city,</a> without mentioning that several of the 84 victims were Muslim, while the mayor of Cannes has described burkinis as referring to an allegiance to terrorist groups. Others have described them improbably as a provocation by Islamists (as if such groups were likely to urge women to bathe in form-fitting outfits on mixed-sex public beaches). It is hard to see the logical correlation. What can be said is that obsessing about the burkini is a good way to distract attention from the many social and economic reasons why young second and third generation immigrants may feel disenfranchised and harbour grievances against the republic \u2013 making some vulnerable to recruitment by extremists \u2013 and&#xa0;that it is likely to alienate more of them.</p> <p>Some politicians have cited the risk of public disorder and seem concerned primarily that growing distrust between parts of society could lead to violent clashes \u2013 such as a recent brawl in Corsica \u2013 particularly since the head of the domestic intelligence service has <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/cea72c12-685a-11e6-a0b1-d87a9fea034f.html#axzz4IG3YQwNM\" title=\"\">warned that the far right is looking for confrontation</a>. They see the rules, perhaps, as pragmatic; they are, in fact, deeply unfair because they put the onus on Muslim women to prevent other people\u2019s criminality and avoid evoking their prejudice. Tomorrow France\u2019s highest administrative court will consider the legality of the bans. Though the political backdrop is complex, the issue remains simple. Women\u2019s right to dress as they feel comfortable and fitting should be defended against those coercing them into either covering or uncovering. Their bodies are their business.</p>",

There\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.vox.com/2016/8/18/12505078/hillary-clinton-health-stroke-conspiracy-fake\">no evidence</a> these claims are true.</p> <p>I\u2019m a doctor. I don\u2019t play at being a doctor. I don\u2019t diagnose patients in the absence of unbiased, reliable information, such as performing a physical exam or reviewing tests. When I write or am interviewed on television or the radio, I\u2019ll talk about what new research will mean for patients and the science behind the latest guidelines. I\u2019ll explain why we\u2019re seeing increasing rates of certain diseases and whether policies to combat them make sense. I don\u2019t talk about individuals except to say what one might expect more generally with regard to a particular medical illness.</p> <p>But the scientist in me understands that the real issue here isn\u2019t Clinton\u2019s health. Conspiracy theories signal fear; in this case, Trump\u2019s realization that Clinton may well be the next president of the United States.</p> <p>This is not the first time rumors of illness have been deployed to attack a seemingly untouchable political adversary. At a time when Massachusetts governor Michael Dukakis had a 10-point lead over then vice-president George HW Bush in the polls, <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/videos/tv/2016/03/15/exp-rftwh-bush-vs-dukakis-1-1.cnn/video/playlists/race-to-the-white-house--original-series/\">reports circulated</a> that Dukakis suffered severe depression after losing his first re-election campaign. When asked if Dukakis should release his complete medical records, Ronald Reagan did little to dispel those rumors, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1988/08/04/us/dukakis-releases-medical-details-to-stop-rumors-on-mental-health.html\">saying</a>: \u201cLook, I\u2019m not going to pick on an invalid.\u201d</p> <p>Some Trump surrogates are also <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DrMarcSiegel/status/764541927152820225\">calling</a> on Clinton to release her medical records. Trump has not released his, and a <a href=\"https://www.donaldjtrump.com/images/uploads/trump_health_record.pdf\">letter from his physician</a> reads as if Trump had written it himself: little in the way of detail but plenty of superlatives like \u201castonishingly excellent\u201d and \u201cextraordinary\u201d. Meanwhile, in contrast to Clinton and every other presidential candidate in the last 40 years except Gerald R Ford, Trump has yet to release his tax returns.</p> <p>What is different is that Trump gushes conspiracy theories like a fire hose. He was <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/03/us/politics/donald-trump-birther-obama.html\">one of the most vocal birthers</a>, those who claimed Barack Obama was a Kenyan-born Muslim and thus ineligible to hold office (that was untrue). Trump later <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2016/05/06/donald-trumps-ridiculous-claim-that-hillary-clinton-started-the-birther-movement/\">claimed</a> that Clinton started the birther movement, not he. He t<a href=\"https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/265895292191248385?lang=en\">weeted</a>: \u201cThe concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make US manufacturing non-competitive.\u201d He <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8T3uAp2ep3w\">said</a> \u201cthousands and thousands\u201d of people in New Jersey cheered the 9/11 attacks, implying they were Muslims. He <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/nov/23/donald-trump/trump-tweet-blacks-white-homicide-victims/\">tweeted an allegation</a> that 81% of white homicide victims are killed by blacks. And he <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/blogs/xx_factor/2015/09/16/donald_trump_suggested_vaccines_cause_autism_during_the_cnn_gop_debate_he.html\">suggested</a> that vaccines cause autism. The list goes on. None of these assertions are true.</p> <p>It\u2019s almost as if Trump is reading from a textbook on how to invent and disseminate conspiracy theories. First, target those who feel most alienated and disempowered. Then, identify a complex social or political threat to control, which might include stagnant wages, demographic changes or terrorism. Next, identify an outsider group such as China, Latino immigrants, blacks or Muslims who you can blame. Then tell a simple, black-and-white story of conflict between good versus evil, us versus the other. Finally, say the system is \u201c<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/for-trump-a-new-rigged-system-the-election-itself/2016/08/02/d9fb33b0-58c4-11e6-9aee-8075993d73a2_story.html\">rigged</a>\u201d by the mainstream media or the elite.</p> <p>Trump is riding a rising tide of alienation and disempowerment, most notably among working class white men. They\u2019re his strongest supporters because uncertainty, anxiety and powerlessness <a href=\"http://www.michaelshermer.com/the-believing-brain/\">drive the need to reassert control</a>. It\u2019s also perhaps why those with a more <a href=\"http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/usappblog/2016/01/27/donald-trump-is-attracting-authoritarian-primary-voters-and-it-may-help-him-to-gain-the-nomination/\">authoritarian</a> bent tend to favor Trump.</p> <p>Trump shares a certain worldview with his supporters, but he\u2019s also a brilliant psychologist. It should come as no surprise that he \u201c<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpdt7omPoa0\">loves the poorly educated</a>\u201d. They\u2019re most likely to buy into his conspiracy theories, and not because they\u2019re stupid. Researchers have found that <a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ajps.12084/abstract\">having less education</a> \u2013 not sex, race, ideology or knowledge \u2013 is the most reliable predictor of whether someone will believe a conspiracy theory. Education not only arms us with facts but also teaches us how to think <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/265608142_Analytic_thinking_reduces_belief_in_conspiracy_theories\">analytically</a> (methodically and scientifically) not just intuitively (from the gut).</p> <p>The scientist in me knows that attempts to debunk conspiracy theories \u2013 whether they\u2019re about Clinton\u2019s health or the myth that vaccines cause autism \u2013 are at best futile and may in fact <a href=\"http://www.uky.edu/AS/PoliSci/Peffley/pdf/nyhan-reifler%202007%20When%20Predictions%20Fail.pdf\">backfire</a>. We pick and choose those facts that add up to the truth we\u2019ve already chosen to believe. The more someone tries to disprove the reality we\u2019ve constructed, the more we dig in our heels.</p> <p>In 2008, questions about <a href=\"http://www.usnews.com/opinion/blogs/robert-schlesinger/2010/03/24/party-of-nuts-poll-shows-gop-thinks-obama-is-muslim-socialist\">President Obama\u2019s citizenship</a> intensified with his likelihood of clinching the Democratic nomination. So long as the odds of winning the election remain in Clinton\u2019s favor, we can expect to see more conspiracy theories emerge between now and November.</p>",
  "<p>Although thousands of supporters will turn out for Donald Trump\u2019s rally Wednesday in Mississippi, the real purpose for his visit to the state will quietly happen an hour earlier: a $1,000-per-person fundraiser at an undisclosed location.</p> <p>Money is the only explanation for Trump\u2019s continued swing through deep red states, according to operatives on both the left and the right.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/23/donald-trump-campaign-news-polls-kellyanne-conway\">Trump manager says 'undercover voters' will deliver win in US election</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Traditionally, a candidate with just over two months until an election would focus on battleground states, or states with large populations and value in the electoral college: Florida, Iowa, New York, the Rust Belt states and others. Florida boasts 29 electoral votes, for instance, while Mississippi has six.</p> <p>But Trump\u2019s arrival in Mississippi on the heels of a trip to Texas is a quintessential Trump move: splashy, expensive and defying conventional political wisdom. </p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019re running this campaign the way they want to run the campaign, for sure,\u201d said Austin Barbour, a Republican operative and nephew of former Mississippi governor Haley Barbour. \u201cI think it\u2019s habit. The big rallies in supportive states worked well for them in the primary, but it hasn\u2019t worked so well in the general election.\u201d</p> <p>Many of Trump\u2019s critics have accused him of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/sep/09/donald-trump-racism-increase-latinos\">pandering to racists</a>, less dog whistle <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jul/13/donald-trump-dog-whistle-racism\">than piper\u2019s flute</a>. Trump has never, for instance, endorsed David Duke, but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/22/david-duke-kkk-senate-campaign-louisiana\">the Klansman-turned-politician</a> has endorsed him, and in the environment Trump has created \u2013 with its particular political pH levels \u2013 Duke has re-emerged on the southern political scene.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3936eef77e07f2d0586ae88e63b7865edbc0cf93\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3936eef77e07f2d0586ae88e63b7865edbc0cf93/63_0_1800_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A confederate flag was spotted at a Trump rally on 11 August 2016.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A confederate flag was spotted at a Trump rally on 11 August 2016.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: YouTube</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Certainly at previous rallies, whether officially endorsed or not, confederate battle flags have appeared in great numbers. The stars and bars have shown up on supporters\u2019 T-shirts, on hats sold by vendors outside in the parking lot, or waved during the rallies. </p> <p>All of which is doubly problematic in Mississippi. It\u2019s the only state in the country that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/oct/17/mississippi-state-flag-confederate-symbol\">reproduces the confederate flag on its official state flag</a>, still waving over the capitol on High Street despite numerous protests. All politics in Mississippi unfolds in the shadow of the state\u2019s fraught race relations; it\u2019s a fragile and poverty-stricken place, in recovery at best. </p> <p>Trump\u2019s support among black voters has polled <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2016/08/donald-trump-african-american-vote-227218\">as low as 0%</a>. The last time he visited Mississippi, a pastor stood on the statehouse steps and addressed a crowd of black protesters, calling Trump one of the \u201cDukes of Hazzard\u201d, a reference to the television characters who sported a confederate battle flag on their muscle car.</p> <p>Mississippi has a higher percentage of black residents than any other state, at almost 40%. Trump\u2019s audience will be almost entirely white, though. The reason may be as obvious as Trump\u2019s campaign slogan itself: \u201cmake America great again\u201d. For black people in Mississippi, the golden era that sentiment harkens to was a time of strife, oppression and violence.</p> <p>A better move for Trump, Barbour said, would be to meet with black small-business owners while he\u2019s in Mississippi. \u201cWe have lots of great opportunities here,\u201d Barbour said. That is, Trump\u2019s support has nowhere to go but up, if he\u2019s willing to reach out beyond his base.</p> <p>But Barbour\u2019s Democratic counterpart, Bobby Moak, chuckled at the thought. \u201cNo, no, no, there\u2019s been no talk of that,\u201d he said. Moak was the longtime chair of the House Democratic caucus until earlier this year. \u201cThe rally here is something of an afterthought.\u201d</p> <p>The true reason to visit Mississippi, Moak said, is funding. \u201cOur governor told Trump he could raise a lot of money,\u201d Moak said. \u201cIt\u2019s as simple as that.\u201d</p> <p>Mississippi is a small state, Moak said, but the population only has one candidate to give its money to: Trump. </p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sure it\u2019s at least seven figures,\u201d Moak said. \u201cOtherwise he wouldn\u2019t bother.\u201d</p> <p>There\u2019s nothing new about candidates dipping into friendly states to pick up campaign funds. This summer, Hillary Clinton has spent time in California and north-eastern states, raising money in places where she enjoys a comfortable lead. </p> <p>But unlike Clinton, Trump supports his campaign with a self-described <a href=\"http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/presidential-races/280239-trump-claims-net-worth-of-more-than-10-billion-in-new\">$10bn fortune</a>, his campaign has been tumbling in polls for weeks, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/19/paul-manafort-resigns-donald-trump-campaign\">he has</a> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/20/donald-trump-campaign-manager-corey-lewandowski-out\">reshuffled his staff</a> including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/17/donald-trump-stephen-bannon-breitbart-news-kellyanne-conway\">his campaign chair</a>. More specifically, Clinton has used her blue-state visits to drum up money which she then spends in other states. But Trump is spending money as he goes: renting out the 10,000-seat <a href=\"https://www.mdac.ms.gov/bureaus-departments/state-fair-commission/mississippi-coliseum/\">Mississippi coliseum</a> for the rally, for instance.</p> <p>\u201cI think he got some pushback from Republicans here who can\u2019t afford the $1,000 dinner,\u201d Moak said. \u201cThey said: \u2018If he\u2019s coming here, we want to see the Donald.\u2019 So he\u2019s putting on the rally.\u201d</p> <p>There are other costs. Trump\u2019s <a href=\"http://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/us_57bba424e4b03d51368a82b9 \">jet alone</a> burns through $10,000 an hour, adding up to nearly a half-million dollars just in July. All of which means that either Moak\u2019s estimate may be well below the mark, or Trump is managing his campaign funds in a way Barbour, the Republican, called \u201cunconventional\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019d like to see him do the traditional, raise money in Texas then quickly turn around and use it at a rally in Colorado. Or raise money here in Mississippi then jump over to the Florida panhandle,\u201d he said. \u201cBut they\u2019re not interested in the way Reagan did things, or Romney did things.\u201d</p>",

Trump rolls out new immigration look, praises Obama</h2> <p>Speaking on Bill O\u2019Reilly\u2019s program on Fox News, Donald Trump <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2016/aug/22/hillary-clinton-donald-trump-us-election-news-campaign-live?page=with:block-57bb9896e4b047b85f602a9b#block-57bb9896e4b047b85f602a9b\">rolled out a new version of</a> his now-obscure position on immigration, telling the host that \u201cI just want to follow the law\u201d...</p> <p>\u201cI just want to follow the law,\u201d Trump <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2016/aug/22/hillary-clinton-donald-trump-us-election-news-campaign-live?page=with:block-57bb9896e4b047b85f602a9b#block-57bb9896e4b047b85f602a9b\">said</a>. \u201cWhat I\u2019m doing is following the law ... Now the existing laws are very strong. The existing laws, the first thing we are going to do if and when I win, is we are going to get rid of all of the bad ones. ... As far as everybody else, we are going to go through the process. What people don\u2019t know is Obama got tremendous numbers of people out of the country.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/rickklein/status/768035137883873280\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Trump actually said this: &quot;What people don&#39;t know is that Obama got tremendous numbers of people out of the country.&quot;</p>&mdash; Rick Klein (@rickklein) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/rickklein/status/768035137883873280\">August 23, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <h2>2. Trump: \u2018war zones\u2019 safer than inner cities</h2> <p>Donald Trump veered off the teleprompter on Monday night to claim that \u201cinner cities run by the Democrats\u201d were more dangerous than countries such as Iraq and Afghanistan.[...]</p> <p>\u201cYou can go to war zones in countries that we are fighting and it is safer than living in some of our inner cities that are run by the Democrats,\u201d Trump said. The Republican nominee also promised if elected, \u201cwe\u2019ll get rid of the crime. You\u2019ll be able to walk down the street without getting shot. Now, you walk down the street, you get shot.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/22/donald-trump-inner-city-crime-war-zone-hillary-clinton\">Trump: inner cities run by Democrats are more dangerous than war zones</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>3. Trump jacked rent at Trump Tower once donor money flowed</h2> <p>The Trump campaign rents office space in Trump Tower. When Donald Trump was mostly self-financing his campaign, the office space cost one thing. When Trump began accepting more donations from the public, the price quintupled, the Huffington Post <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-campaign-rent_us_57bba424e4b03d51368a82b9\">reports</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Trump nearly quintupled the monthly rent his presidential campaign pays for its headquarters at Trump Tower to $169,758 in July, when he was raising funds from donors, compared with March, when he was self-funding his campaign, according to a Huffington Post review of Federal Election Commission filings. The rent jumped even though he was paying fewer staff in July than he did in March. </p> <p>The Trump campaign paid Trump Tower Commercial LLC $35,458 in March \u2015 the same amount it had been paying since last summer \u2015 and had 197 paid employees and consultants. In July, it paid 172 employees and consultants. </p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/MaxBoot/status/768049003841871872\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Like Trump U, Trump campaign is a scam.

  "<p>Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton blitzed five battleground states between them on Friday, with four days remaining until American voters will choose their next president.</p> <p>Clinton began the day with a rally in Pennsylvania, a state where she holds a consistent lead over Trump, while the Republican nominee made a last-minute push in New Hampshire. Trump has surged in recent days in the Granite State, where he scored his first victory of the Republican primary contest earlier this year.</p> <p>Clinton\u2019s long-held lead in New Hampshire has collapsed in recent days. She was shown trailing Trump or tied with him in four new public polls taken in the wake of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/28/fbi-reopens-hillary-clinton-emails-investigation\">letter from the FBI director, James Comey, informing Congress that it was possible new emails</a> had been discovered related to the investigation into Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/04/voters-experiences-us-2016-election-trump-clinton-campaign\">Pain, anger and fear: US voters deprived of a serious presidential election</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The news has helped ensure that a number of Republicans and libertarians previously skeptical about Trump have now rallied around the nominee. Former New Hampshire governor John Sununu predicted before Trump appeared there on Friday that the margin for the winning candidate could come down to 5,000 votes.</p> <p>Clinton\u2019s campaign announced that she would hold a rally in Manchester on Sunday, in a sign of the state\u2019s renewed competitiveness in the final stretch. Barack Obama will campaign in the state on Clinton\u2019s behalf the day before the election. </p> <p>Although New Hampshire only provides four electoral votes, a win there would greatly aid Trump as he navigates a narrow path to victory. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/08/state-factboxes/?id=NH\" data-alt=\"New Hampshire\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/08/state-factboxes/?id=NH\">New Hampshire</a> </figure>  <p>Trump needs to win Ohio, Florida and North Carolina to keep close to Clinton in the electoral college. Then, he either needs to win Pennsylvania or a political grab bag that includes New Hampshire, as well as Nevada and the one electoral vote of Maine\u2019s second congressional district.</p> <p>Trump faced another bad news cycle on Friday, however, after two close aides of Governor Chris Christie of New Jersey, a vocal Trump surrogate, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/04/bridgegate-chris-christie-allies-convicted-new-jersey-closures\">were convicted in the so-called Bridgegate trial</a> over the closure of several access lanes to the George Washington Bridge in 2013 for political reasons. Christie is leading Trump\u2019s transition team and is scheduled to campaign for the Republican nominee on Saturday.</p> <p>Clinton embarked on a packed itinerary on Friday, with plans to hit three key states in one day. The Democratic nominee held a rally in Pittsburgh, where thousands formed a line that snaked around the stadium of the Pittsburgh Steelers, the city\u2019s football team.</p> <p>She was introduced there by Mark Cuban, the influential businessman and investor who hails from Pittsburgh and has been a prominent backer of Clinton\u2019s. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/31/mark-cuban-insults-trump-before-backing-true-leader-hillary-clinton\">Cuban has repeatedly taunted Trump while stumping for Clinton</a>, and continued to take shots at the Republican nominee in his remarks on Friday.</p> <p>\u201cYou cannot be president of the United States if you don\u2019t know when to shut up,\u201d Cuban said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d783a765b5d9e554c607d0ca45ae06a74788de79\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d783a765b5d9e554c607d0ca45ae06a74788de79/0_0_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Clinton was introduced by Mark Cuban, the influential businessman and investor who hails from Pittsburgh.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hillary Clinton was introduced by Mark Cuban, the influential businessman and investor who hails from Pittsburgh.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gene J Puskar/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He then led a call and response with the crowd, posing questions of Trump that ranged from his trustworthiness to his wealth.</p> <p>\u201cDo you think he cares more about you or his bank account?\u201d Cuban said.</p> <p>\u201cBank account!\u201d they shouted back.</p> <p>Upon taking the stage to a raucous crowd, Clinton sought to contrast her economic agenda with that of Trump. Casting him as someone who neither possessed the leadership to steer the economy nor empathy for the working class, Clinton highlighted Trump\u2019s refusal to release his tax returns as revealing of his character.</p> <p>\u201cHonestly, I don\u2019t know how he lives with himself,\u201d she said. \u201cDoesn\u2019t he see the millions of women and families struggling?\u201d</p> <p>She also struck familiar themes about her opponent stiffing his own workers while touting her plans to introduce 12 weeks of paid family and medical leave, enact equal pay for women, raise the minimum wage and expand access to affordable childcare. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/08/state-factboxes/?id=PA\" data-alt=\"Pennsylvania\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/08/state-factboxes/?id=PA\">Pennsylvania</a> </figure>  <p>Clinton\u2019s closing argument was not simply policy-driven, however, leaning heavily on Trump\u2019s volatile persona and what that would mean for the country under his stewardship.</p> <p>\u201cThink about what it would mean to entrust the nuclear codes to someone with a very thin skin, who lashes out at anyone who challenges him,\u201d Clinton said, prompting audience members to break into shouts of \u201cNo!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cImagine how easily it could be that Donald Trump would feel insulted and start a real war, not just a Twitter war, at 3 o\u2019clock in the morning.\u201d</p> <p>From Pittsburgh, she was scheduled to move on to Detroit and Cleveland, the latter of which was billed as a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/nov/04/jay-z-hillary-clinton-concert-beyonce-anti-trump-songs\">get out the vote concert with rapper Jay Z</a>.

Before takeoff from her home of Westchester, New York, where Clinton typically stays overnight, she chatted toward the front of the plane with digital director Teddy Goff and policy director Maya Harris. Speechwriter Dan Schwerin was also on hand, as were campaign chairman John Podesta and Capricia Marshall, who served as the chief of protocol when Clinton led the state department.</p> <p>Clinton\u2019s campaign underscored the importance of early voting returns in a conference call with reporters on Friday afternoon. </p> <p>They pointed in particular to turnout among Latino voters in the must-win state of Florida, stating it had risen 120% from 2012. Clinton\u2019s campaign manager, Robby Mook, also noted a 90% increase in Asian American voters overall. Turnout among minorities disproportionately benefits Democrats, as such demographics have increasingly been marginalized by Republicans in recent election cycles.</p> <p>In Pittsburgh, Clinton said the country was \u201con track right now to have the biggest turnout in American history\u201d.</p> <p>But she urged her supporters not to take anything for granted.</p> <p>For those who knew someone considering voting for Trump, she warned, \u201cPlease stage an intervention.\u201d</p> <p>After his stop in New Hampshire, Trump was due to hit Wilmington, Ohio, and Hershey, Pennsylvania, later on Friday.</p> <p>On Saturday both candidates will head south to Florida \u2013 the ultimate swing state that Trump at least must win if he wants the keys to the White House. Trump will hit North Carolina and Nevada, too, while Clinton will head back to Philadelphia for another star-studded concert \u2013 this time with Katy Perry in Philadelphia.</p>",
  "<p>Climate change may have been largely ignored during the presidential election but it will be on the ballot on 8 November, with Florida voters deciding on a measure backed by large utilities that could effectively snuff out the solar industry in the state.</p> <p> The measure, known as <a href=\"https://ballotpedia.org/Florida_Solar_Energy_Subsidies_and_Personal_Solar_Use,_Amendment_1_(2016)\">amendment 1</a>, has been criticized as \u201cfundamentally dishonest\u201d for superficially appearing to be pro-solar. However, renewable energy experts warn that it would remove the incentive for homeowners to get rooftop solar panels, devastating the solar industry in America\u2019s sunshine state.</p> <p> The amendment would change Florida\u2019s constitution to give consumers the right to have solar panels installed. But it also <a href=\"https://smartsolarfl.org/the-solar-amendment/\">states</a> that the government should \u201censure that consumers who do not choose to install solar are not required to subsidize the costs of backup power and electric grid access to those who do\u201d.</p> <p> A group called <a href=\"https://smartsolarfl.org/\">Consumers for Smart Solar</a>, backed by more than $20m in campaign funding by Florida\u2019s large energy utilities, has put forward the measure, ostensibly to protect Florida residents from rip-offs. But critics contend that the proposal would lead the way to solar panel owners facing fees or a reduced price for the excess energy they put back into the grid, known as net metering.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/dec/06/debbie-dooley-tea-party-solar-energy-florida-environment\">The Tea Party leader taking a stand for solar energy: 'I will do what's right'</a> </p> </aside>  <p> \u201cThe utilities have been fundamentally dishonest, their behavior is incredibly cynical,\u201d said David Pomerantz, executive director of pro-renewables group Energy and Policy Institute. \u201cIt has confused quite a few voters and that was by design. The large electric utilities in Florida feel extraordinarily threatened by customer-owned solar. Instead of trying to adapt to it, they want to kill rooftop solar in the cradle.\u201d</p> <p> Pomerantz said the measure would be a major blow to a solar industry that is already \u201cstunted\u201d in Florida. Fewer than 20,000 Floridian homes have solar panels, despite its enormous potential for solar energy, compared with Massachusetts, a north-east state with a quarter of the population, which has 163,000 homes with solar panels. </p> <p> The dismantling of net metering, one of the few incentives to get solar in Florida, could have a similar outcome as that seen in Nevada, where increased charges and reduced net metering credits saw leading solar panel installer SolarCity pull out of the state. </p> <p> Environmentalists have rounded on the Florida measure, with former vice-president Al Gore accusing the utilities of \u201ctrying to fool you\u201d into killing off the solar industry. A court challenge to stop the measure was defeated in the Florida supreme court but Justice Barbara Pariente, in dissent, called the amendment a \u201cwolf in sheep\u2019s clothing\u201d and an attempt to \u201cconstitutionalize the status quo\u201d.</p> <p> Polling has shown strong support for amendment 1, although support <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://polls.saintleo.edu/proposed-florida-constitutional-amendment-on-solar-power-facing-a-changed-landscape-among-voters-new-saint-leo-poll-finds/\">has recently plummeted</a> to close to the 60% threshold needed for the proposition to pass. The drop in support followed the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.miamiherald.com/news/politics-government/election/article109017387.html\">Miami Herald\u2019s release in October</a> of an audio recording by Sal Nuzzo, vice-president of free market group James Madison Institute.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5rc3fwJn40\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/t5rc3fwJn40?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Al Gore speaks out against amendment 1 during a Hillary Clinton campaign rally in Florida. </figcaption> </figure>   <p> Nuzzo told an industry conference that amendment 1 was an \u201cincredibly savvy maneuver\u201d and \u201cpolitical jiujitsu\u201d that would \u201ccompletely negate anything (pro-solar groups) would try to do legislatively or constitutionally down the road\u201d.</p> <p> Consumers for Smart Solar, the utilities-backed group, has denied any connection to the Hames Madison Institute and insisted that the amendment would protect consumers from scams and from subsidizing solar companies from outside Florida.</p> <p> \u201cAmendment 1 is good for the environment, it is good for consumers and it is good for Florida,\u201d said Dick Batchelor, co-chair of Consumers for Smart Solar. </p> <p>\u201cHowever, in looking at ways to increase the amount of our energy that comes from the sun, it is essential that we do so in a way that safeguards consumers \u2013 particularly our seniors \u2013 with commonsense consumer protection rules that benefit every consumer, and that we have all come to expect.\u201d</p> <p> The Florida solar measure isn\u2019t the only climate-related item voters will decide on on Tuesday. Voters in Washington will decide whether the state will be the first in the US to introduce a carbon tax on emissions.</p> <p> The measure, called <a href=\"http://yeson732.org/\">I-732</a>, would place a $25-per-ton fee on carbon dioxide emissions from 2018, rising gradually over the course of 40 years to $100. It will aim to be revenue neutral, however, because Washington\u2019s sales tax will be cut by 1% and further tax rebated will be given to manufacturers and low-income households.</p> <p> The vote has split environment groups, some of which supported an alternative that would have raised money to be funneled into clean energy projects. The Sierra Club has said it doesn\u2019t support I-732 because it \u201cdoes not include all that is needed for an equitable climate policy and just transition to a clean energy economy\u201d, in particular by failing to support communities of color and low income.</p> <p>The projections put forward by Carbon Washington, the grassroots group behind the measure, have also been questioned. An analysis by the Washington Office of Financial Management found that the measure will cut the state\u2019s revenue <a href=\"http://www.spokesman.com/stories/2016/oct/03/nations-first-carbon-tax-on-the-ballot-in-washingt/\">by $200m</a> a year.</p> <p>However, the measure does retain <a href=\"http://grist.org/election-2016/james-hansen-vs-naomi-klein-state-carbon-tax-splits-national-climate-hawks/?utm_campaign=daily-static&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=edit-daily\">some notable support</a>, including former Nasa scientist James Hansen, actor Leonardo DiCaprio and Steven Chu, former secretary of energy under Barack Obama. An <a href=\"http://scientistsfor732.blogspot.com/2016/10/open-letter-on-i-732-from-climate.html\">open letter penned by 51 climate scientists</a> also backs I-732.</p> <p>\u201cThis revenue neutral measure offers the most progressive change in our tax code in decades and represents a bipartisan effort that rejects ideology,\u201d the letter states. </p> <p>\u201cWhile many interrelated social and environmental needs demand our attention, complex problems are best solved one step at a time. I-732 is a simple step in the right direction.\u201d</p>",

In June the smart money, including the betting markets, said remain had it in the bag. Burnt by that experience, nothing can soothe us now \u2013 except the right result. Until then, we have to chew our fingernails, hit refresh on the Real Clear Politics <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/latest_polls/elections/\">polling page</a> and wait.</p> <p>Many, especially in the US, will have a ready response: what\u2019s it got to do with you? To which the answer is: plenty. The experience of the last photo-finish election \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2000/dec/22/worlddispatch.martinkettle\">Bush v Gore in 2000</a> \u2013 taught many non-Americans a lesson we could not forget. Americans decide, but their decision affects the entire world. The supreme court\u2019s installation of George W Bush as president had a profound and global impact. Just over a year later, Bush was agitating to invade Iraq, a choice whose consequences we live with still. (In Britain the focus is always on Tony Blair, as it was again this week when John Chilcot faced MPs. But that war would never have happened without Bush.)</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It's the contempt Trump shows for democratic norms that has people fearing they are witness to something akin to fascism</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>So a President Trump will change lives far beyond the US.

Suspicion of migrants, loathing of Muslims, a desire to put up walls and roll back social progress \u2013 these currents exist everywhere. Were Trump to win, they would have the endorsement of the most powerful office in the world. For eight years, Barack Obama has been a cautionary voice, counselling against the global rush towards xenophobia and insularity. If Trump replaces him, white nationalism will have command of the world\u2019s loudest megaphone.

  "<p>\u201cThere\u2019s one other person in town with a Clinton sign,\u201d Link Oberg, 30, said, staring across the main street in Downsville, New York, at a phalanx of yard signs promoting Donald Trump\u2019s presidential campaign and Republican John Faso\u2019s congressional re-election campaign. \u201cDid you talk to her?\u201d</p> <p>I am in Downsville, population 633, where the motto is: \u201cThe best town on a dam site!\u201d and where Trump signs dot the well-kept yards. (One Trump supporter, though, inked out the \u201cT\u201d and the \u201cP\u201d on one of the signs, offering neighbors the slogan \u201cRUM: Make America Great Again\u201d. It stood next to a <a href=\"http://www.dailydot.com/unclick/dont-tread-on-me-snake-parodies/\">Gadsden-inspired flag</a> advocating for gun rights.)</p> <p>Oberg, who answered the door in a throwback Army of Darkness T-shirt, grew up in a liberal household. \u201cThe sign was my mother\u2019s idea,\u201d she said of the family\u2019s Clinton-Kaine yard sign, adding she was of the \u201canyone-but-Trump mindset. But no one\u2019s harassed us about it or anything.\u201d</p> <p>Up the road in the town of Walton, Jody Jamieson\u2019s house had signs both for Clinton and for Faso\u2019s opponent, Zephyr Teachout, in the yard of her house on a corner far from main road. \u201cI\u2019m not particularly a Clinton supporter,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I\u2019m voting against Donald Trump.\u201d</p> <p>Two doors down, her neighbors had a Trump-Pence flag where their American flag used to be; on that main road, Delaware Street, a cash-for-gold business proudly displayed the candidate\u2019s signs out front.</p> <p>Jamieson, who is 60, moved to Walton from Oklahoma with her husband, a native of the town who had moved away to attend college, where they\u2019d met. Like Oberg, she said she was one of two Clinton supporters in her town of 5,484 residents. </p> <p>The other is her son.</p> <p>The Clinton yard sign represents something of a shift for Jamieson, who has been a registered Republican for 30 years. \u201cI can no longer identify myself as a member of the Republican party that nominated Donald Trump,\u201d she said. After the election, she plans to change her party registration to Democrat; under New York state law, one must file notice of intent to change parties 25 days before a general election, and it only goes into effect after election day. \u201cIt took Donald Trump to do that.\u201d</p> <p>East of Walton, there are more Democrats in the village of Delhi (pronounced \u201cdell-high\u201d by locals) than some of the other places in Delaware County.

  "<p>Another day closer to the presidential election, another slew of surveys \u2013 most of them showing that Hillary Clinton is in the lead. But the size of the Democratic candidate\u2019s advantage varies considerably from poll to poll, partly because some questionnaires ask voters to consider the fact that there are more than two presidential nominees. Green party candidate Jill Stein is on the <a href=\"http://www.jill2016.com/ballot_access\">ballot</a> in 45 states and voters in another three states can choose to write her name in. And the Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson is on the ballot in 50 states.</p> <p>Progressives who are feeling turned off by Clinton and/or Donald Trump, the two <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/31/polls-donald-trump-hillary-clinton-unpopularity\">most unpopular</a> candidates in decades, might be considering a protest vote for one of these other parties (\u201cprotest\u201d in the sense that third-party candidates have a <a href=\"http://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2016-election-forecast/\">less than 0.1% chance</a> of winning). With just four days to go until the election, they might be wondering who will be hindered more by a protest vote \u2013 Democrat Clinton or Republican Trump?</p> <p>As with all of the articles I have written so far about polling data, the answer is a very unsexy \u201cit depends\u201d. The impact of protest votes varies throughout the country. </p> <p>In total, 33 states can probably be viewed as \u201csafe\u201d states based on the fact that one of the candidates is leading by at least seven percentage points (the numbers are polling averages collected by <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/latest_polls/elections/\">Real Clear Politics</a>). When analysts talk about the electoral map working in Clinton\u2019s favor, they are referring to the fact that 14 of these states (plus the District of Columbia) look like they\u2019ll vote Democratic and together they\u2019re worth 187 of the 270 electoral college votes needed to win the presidency. Based on the same threshold of \u201csafe\u201d, Trump can only count on 152 college votes. </p> <p>More importantly, there are 17 states in the US that can be viewed as competitive based on the fact that six percentage points or less separate Clinton and Trump. Some of these states are unlikely to swing the entire election, though, because they don\u2019t have many electoral college votes. Alaska is one such example; although Trump has a narrow lead, the state is only worth <a href=\"https://www.archives.gov/federal-register/electoral-college/allocation.html\">three electoral college votes</a> so has little power in changing the national result. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/oct/31/how-does-electoral-college-work-us-election-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/59yvc\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2849673\"            data-video-name=\"How does the US electoral college work? \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"Guardian/Getty Images\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-58136bc4e4b08d944ba4ba7a\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/10/28/161028elect1_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/10/28/161028elect1.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/10/28/161028elect1_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/oct/31/how-does-electoral-college-work-us-election-video\">How does the US electoral college work?</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Here\u2019s a quick guide to where voting for a third party could affect which of the two main candidates wins. It\u2019s based on a close race (ie places where Clinton and Trump are close in the polls) and state influence (ie 10 electoral college votes or more \u2013 but if the race ends up being very close, the reality will be that every electoral college vote will matter to Trump and Clinton, and states like Iowa and New Hampshire will become important). For voters who consider a Trump win their worst-case scenario, these are states where choosing a third-party candidate could help secure a Republican victory.</p> <h2>Florida</h2> <p><strong>Number of electoral college votes</strong>: 29<br><strong>Current polling:</strong> Clinton is ahead by 1.2 percentage points<br><strong>Detail: </strong>Clinton 47.4%, Trump 46.2%, Johnson 2.4%, Stein 1.3%<br><strong>Notes: </strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/01/clinton-trump-polls-election-voter-turnout-suppression\">Early</a> ballots suggest that Hispanic turnout has increased, which is good news for Clinton. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/datablog/2016/jan/25/us-hispanic-latino-voters-us-election-2016\">Nearly one in five</a> eligible voters in Florida is Hispanic and they typically lean heavily Democrat.

  "<p>For four days in September 2013, a \u201ctraffic study\u201d closed lanes and caused rush-hour chaos for thousands of commuters trying to navigate the George Washington Bridge, the busiest road crossing in the US. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/04/bridgegate-chris-christie-allies-convicted-new-jersey-closures\">Bridgegate: former Chris Christie allies convicted for New Jersey lane closures</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The gridlock paralysed the New Jersey town of Fort Lee, which sits just across the Hudson from upper Manhattan. </p> <p>The Democratic mayor of Fort Lee, Mark Sokolich, had declined to support the state\u2019s Republican governor, Chris Christie, in his bid for re-election. </p> <p>Three months later, leaked emails appeared to reveal that three senior aides to the governor had plotted to create the traffic chaos as a way to punish Sokolich.</p> <p>Over the past two months in federal court in Newark, the government\u2019s case against two former Christie aides, chief of staff Bridget Kelly and Bill Baroni, a Christie appointee to the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, has painted a fascinating picture of life inside the governor\u2019s administration. </p> <p>On Friday, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/04/bridgegate-chris-christie-allies-convicted-new-jersey-closures\">Kelly and Baroni were found guilty on all charges</a>, the most serious of which carry up to 20 years in prison. Sentencing was scheduled for 21 February.</p> <p>While Christie was never formally identified by prosecutors, the larger-than-life governor cast a long shadow over proceedings which put his claims to have known nothing about the scheme under scrutiny. Here are 10 things we learned from the trial.</p> <h2>1 Political payback is always apt to backfire</h2> <p>New Jersey politics may be brutal and strange, but even here political payback schemes are apt to backfire. The fallout from Bridgegate derailed both Christie\u2019s presidential ambitions and his chances of joining the Trump ticket. With one year left in office, and term limits preventing him from running for re-election, it\u2019s not clear what he will do next. </p> <h2>2 It can also be costly</h2> <p>With the jury verdict in, Bill Baroni, a suave former state senator who was tapped by Christie to be deputy executive director of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, and co-defendant Kelly, the governor\u2019s former deputy chief of staff, could now face up to 20 years in a federal prison. </p> <h2>3 Wally Edge was on to something</h2> <p>David Wildstein, the government\u2019s key witness and the acknowledged architect of the scheme, once wrote a column for a political website about silly, often-petty actions by New Jersey politicians under the pseudonym \u201cWally Edge\u201d. The column now appears to have offered accurate insight into the motivations of the Christie administration. </p> <h2>4 Don\u2019t email, don\u2019t text</h2> <p>\u201cTime for some traffic problems in Fort Lee,\u201d Kelly wrote to Wildstein a month before the plan was carried out. \u201cGot it,\u201d Wildstein responded. In court, Kelly claimed \u201ctraffic problems\u201d meant \u201ctraffic study\u201d. The jury didn\u2019t buy it. </p> <h2>5 Christie\u2019s allies were intensely loyal</h2> <p>US attorney Les Cortes said Kelly\u2019s description of \u201ctraffic problems\u201d meant precisely that. \u201cThey were not about a traffic study,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are a direct view into [the] minds of the participants.\u201d Cortes argued that Baroni and Kelly shared \u201can intense commitment\u201d to the political success of Christie, and \u201cfelt they could use their political positions to execute a malicious scheme to punish a local mayor\u201d. He added: \u201cIt was a cruel and callous scheme.\u201d <br></p> <h2>6 Christie was a slick political seducer</h2> <p>An email by Wildstein produced in court said the Christie administration considered the $8bn-a-year Port Authority a \u201cgoody bag\u201d to distribute favors, money and jobs. Wildstein testified that he was hired be the \u201cbad cop\u201d to push Christie\u2019s agenda. \u201cIf it was good for Christie, then it was good for us,\u201d he said. In court, Mayor Sokolich described the political seduction mounted by Christie and his aides. He was invited to New York Giants games in the governor\u2019s private box at MetLife Stadium, to lunch at the governor\u2019s mansion, on trips to Ground Zero in Manhattan, to holiday parties. Sokolich also described being offered \u201cVIP\u201d seats for Christie\u2019s budget address.</p> <h2>7 TV apologies need to be convincing</h2> <p>As news of an alleged plot and coverup surfaced in early 2014, Christie offered a meandering, 107-minute televised apology, in which he denied any knowledge of the events and pronounced himself \u201cstunned by the abject stupidity\u201d of his aides. </p> <h2>8 The Donald didn\u2019t buy it, and neither do voters</h2> <p>Even Donald Trump, who named Christie head of his transition team in the event of a presidential election win, thinks the governor knew what was going on. \u201cHe knew about it,\u201d the billionaire said at a campaign rally in South Carolina in December 2015. \u201cHe totally knew about it.\u201d According to a new survey from Fairleigh Dickinson University\u2019s PublicMind, meanwhile, just 21% of registered voters in New Jersey approve of Christie\u2019s performance as governor. What\u2019s more, 52% believe there is ample evidence Christie knew about the lane closures.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jan/11/chris-christie-dealt-blow-plot-far-fetched-sopranos\">New Jersey turns on its tough-guy governor after bridge fiasco threatens his ambitions</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>9 Sopranos references are \u2018a local Jersey thing\u2019</h2> <p>As one Fort Lee resident <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jan/11/chris-christie-dealt-blow-plot-far-fetched-sopranos\">told the Guardian in 2014</a>: \u201cSure there\u2019s a connection. It\u2019s a local Jersey thing. They\u2019re big guys who talk a lot about respect. You could say the fictional Tony Soprano paved the way for Governor Christie.\u201d Another said: \u201cI would have more respect for him if he had said, \u2018OK. I knew about it. It was a vendetta\u2019. But now he just looks like a liar who doesn\u2019t even have control of his own people.\u2019\u201d</p> <h2>10 This is not the end</h2> <p>Despite the convictions of Baroni and Kelly, the legal drama is unlikely to end here. Judge Susan Wigenton instructed jurors that they could find the two defendants guilty of conspiracy without determining if the pair intentionally wanted to punish Sokolich, an instruction that effectively gutted the defendants\u2019 case, lawyers for Baroni and Kelly claimed before the verdict. They also vowed to appeal. </p>",

Since at least 1945, it has been a near article of faith in the west that free trade is an engine of growth. No candidate for either main US party has sought to roll back trade liberalisation. Until now.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/nov/04/us-adds-jobs-october-unemployment-rate-election\">US adds 161,000 new jobs as Americans head to the polls</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Previously in favour of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), a draft of which she once described as <a href=\"http://www.state.gov/secretary/20092013clinton/rm/2012/11/200565.htm\">\u201cthe gold standard in trade agreements\u201d</a>, Hillary Clinton now opposes it. Her reason is that it provides insufficient protection to American workers whose jobs and living standards it might harm.</p> <p>Donald Trump is more strident still, and quite distinctly different from any candidate since 1928. Then, Herbert Hoover won the White House promising farmers that he would <a href=\"http://millercenter.org/president/biography/hoover-campaigns-and-elections\">raise agricultural tariffs to protect them</a>. In 1930, Congress passed the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act, which increased levies on a range of goods, not just farm products. The consequent retaliation of other nations <a href=\"http://www.economist.com/node/12798595\">intensified the Depression-era slump</a> in world trade.</p> <p>On his visits to Pittsburgh, once the crucible of US steel production, <a href=\"http://www.post-gazette.com/local/city/2016/04/14/Trump-says-he-will-revive-Pittsburgh-s-steel-industry/stories/201604140107\">Trump told audiences</a> that the industry\u2019s demise was down to bad trade deals negotiated by incompetent bureaucrats. He promised to conclude good, tough deals and bring back steel. While the likely content of a Trump trade policy is unclear, he has threatened tariffs of <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2016/01/07/donald-trump-says-he-favors-big-tariffs-on-chinese-exports/?_r=0\">45% on China</a> and <a href=\"http://time.com/3923128/donald-trump-announcement-speech/feed\">35% on Mexico</a>. He says <a href=\"http://blogs.wsj.com/favicon.ico\">withdrawing the US from the World Trade Organisation</a> is an option and that he will <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-calls-nafta-a-disaster\">break or renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement</a>.</p> <p>The dogs on the street seem to know that Clinton\u2019s position is an electoral convenience. <a href=\"https://berniesanders.com/press-release/sanders-calls-democratic-party-oppose-trade-deal\">Pushed by Bernie Sanders</a>, she threw TPP overboard in the primaries but will throw it a lifebelt in office, the argument runs. Rhetorically at least, Trump seems set on holing the world trading system below the waterline. If he expects other countries meekly to accept tariff hikes, he will be sorely disappointed.</p> <p>This antipathy to free trade baffles conventionally schooled policymakers who believe, correctly, that it makes us better off on average. While most people win, however, some lose and lose badly. Economists <a href=\"http://economics.mit.edu/files/6613\">David Autor, David Dorn and Gordon Hanson</a> have shown that in parts of the US exposed to competition from China, unemployment has risen, pay has fallen and the number claiming benefits has increased. The winners\u2019 gains are spread thinly and widely. The losers\u2019 losses tend to be deep and are often concentrated in specific areas, around cities such as Pittsburgh. Although the winners could compensate the losers leaving everyone better off, neither in the US nor elsewhere have we found a way to do that. Trade adjustment assistance \u2013 payments to US workers affected by import competition \u2013 has not offset the effects of job losses.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/2016_elections_electoral_college_map.html\">Electoral college maths</a> makes states such as Ohio and Pennsylvania crucial to the outcome of the race. They more than most have lost jobs to import competition. In this context, railing against trade makes sense. Continuing that in office would leave the US, and others, worse off.</p> <p>Even if Clinton wins and, once in office, tacks towards a freer trade position, this issue will not go away. More Americans <a href=\"http://www.people-press.org/2016/05/05/public-uncertain-divided-over-americas-place-in-the-world/\">believe trade lowers wages and costs jobs</a> than the opposite. This is not just an American phenomenon. In <a href=\"http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/01/29/is-europe-on-board-for-a-new-trade-deal-with-the-u-s/feed\">Germany</a>, fewer than two-fifths of people support an EU-US free trade agreement. Among the explanations for the UK\u2019s vote to leave the EU is that the places that voted most for Brexit were those that had <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2016/07/07/the-real-reason-the-u-k-voted-for-brexit-economics-not-identity\">lost most in trade with China</a>.</p> <p>Free trade has been a <a href=\"http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2016/02/pdf/c2.pdf\">source of economic progress</a>. But winning that case in the public square will no longer be achieved though facts, figures and smart debating points. People need to be convinced, through governments\u2019 actions, that trade agreements will be properly enforced and that when jobs are threatened there is genuine compensation for the losers. Fail to do that and we will undermine one of the most effective means of improving living standards.</p> <p><em>Stephen Boyle is chief economist at NatWest</em></p>",

  "<p><strong>New York, NY, November 4, 2016</strong>: The <a href=\"https://medium.com/the-guardian-mobile-innovation-lab\">Guardian US mobile innovation lab</a> today announces the launch of the most dynamic 2016 presidential election results notifications that have ever been available through a news app, uniquely delivered directly to mobile lock screens for Guardian iOS and Android app users. </p> <p>The lab, working with the Guardian\u2019s in-house app development team, will bring real time updates not just to the web or within an app, but to the lock screen for the first time. The updating alert will deliver instantaneous, up-to-the-minute results with the latest Associated Press election data, automatically loaded directly to lock screens for Guardian app users who sign up. Readers will receive the latest information within one continuously updated notification, which will be always visible without additional taps, searches, or further access to a mobile app.<br></p> <p>Users will see the latest number of electoral votes won, how many states have been called, and the breakdown of the popular vote between the top two candidates. The notifications will then allow users to open the alert and access a live data visualization of the results and have the option to tap through to the live blog or the full results pages.<br></p> <p><strong>Sarah Schmalbach, product manager for the Guardian US mobile innovation lab</strong>, comments: \u201cThis will be the quickest and most convenient way to get live election night results on mobile. We\u2019re the first to take advantage of this brand new mobile alert feature, that allows us to update the latest data straight on readers\u2019 lock screens. No news app, or any other mobile app, has said they\u2019ll be doing this on November 8th.\u201d<br></p> <p>The notifications for the presidential election build on the success of live data notifications tested as part of the mobile innovation lab\u2019s experiment during the UK referendum on EU membership in June 2016.<br></p> <p><strong>Sasha Koren, editor of the lab says</strong>: \u201cIn adapting the technology the lab has built, and by applying the lessons we learned during the Brexit experiment, our goal is to bring live results notifications to a larger stage and to serve a wider audience during the biggest news event of the year. By adopting these notifications formats, the Guardian is taking the opportunity both to innovate within news delivery and to bring US election results to mobile users in the most accessible way possible.\u201d<br></p> <p>US app users will be prompted to sign up for live results notification via an opt-in screen starting November 4th and the alerts will be available globally through the Guardian\u2019s app notification settings.

State economists project the corporate tax increase would raise some $3bn a year in revenue, increasing the state\u2019s budget by roughly a third. <br></p> <p>More than most states, the Democratic-dominated Oregon relies on personal income taxes \u2013 which total 75% of the state\u2019s tax collections \u2013 to fund services and programs like education, public safety and prisons. \u201cBecause of our high dependence on the personal income tax, we have more volatility than the typical state,\u201d said economist Paul Warner, of Oregon\u2019s non-partisan Legislative Revenue Office (LRO).<br></p> <p>In an economic upturn \u2013 when Oregonians are making money \u2013 the state budget benefits from increased personal income tax revenue. But when a recession hits, income tax becomes a faulty cash stream, and the state is forced to shortchange programs and services. The ballot measure is intended to make the state less reliant on personal income taxes and more on gross receipts revenue from large businesses.</p> <p>But the debate has opponents and supporters shouting different answers to the same question: who bears the cost in the end?<br></p> <p>While the measure would directly tax only a small pool of the wealthiest corporations \u2013 less than a quarter of 1% of all businesses operating in the state \u2013 opponents claim that Measure 97 is a deceptively disguised sales tax, which Oregonians have continually shot down since the 1930s.<br></p> <p>A coalition of more than 26,000 supporters \u2013 including consumers, family farmers, small and large businesses, and local chambers of commerce \u2013 have come together to defeat it.<br></p> <p>They argue that it will be detrimental to businesses with low margins. Meanwhile, the tax would be levied on all transactions down the line in the retail, wholesale and utility sectors. The result, they warn, would be higher prices for Oregonians on everything from electricity and healthcare to food and medicine.<br></p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s a consensus that there will be some upward pressure on prices. I think the issue is around how much,\u201d said Warner, who estimates that consumer prices would increase by 0.8%.<br></p> <p>Robert Whelan, director of the economic consulting firm ECONorthwest, said the problem is that Measure 97 taxes sales, not profits. \u201cA chain like Safeway or Fred Meyer passes the $25m threshold in the first week of each year,\u201d he said. \u201cThereafter, they have to pay 2.5% of their sales in tax, even if the stores fail to make a profit. And that happens.\u201d<br></p> <p>Portland General Electric (PGE) has contributed $250,000 to the campaign against Measure 97. \u201cVarious suppliers, vendors and contractors we work with would also be subject to the new tax, and can be expected to pass their increased costs along to us,\u201d said Steven Corson, communications director at PGE. He predicts the company\u2019s retail customer base of more than 800,000 would face a price increase of about 2%.<br></p> <p>The Legislative Revenue Office (LRO) has projected that the measure could cost the average Oregonian household an extra $600 per year.<br></p> <p>Higher expenses for residents and the loss of thousands of private sector jobs \u201care huge prices for Oregonians to pay, especially when there is absolutely no guarantee for how the money would be spent\u201d, said Rebecca Tweed, the statewide campaign coordinator for the measure\u2019s opposition. While the language of the measure says it is to fund education, healthcare and senior services, the legislative assembly is not bound by a promise.<br></p> <p>The opposition says voters should not be put in charge of the state\u2019s tax system. \u201cAddressing and resolving Oregon\u2019s budget needs and tax policy is the responsibility of the Oregon legislature and the governor,\u201d said Tweed.<br></p> <p>But supporters say the opposition is using scare tactics \u2013 screaming job loss and price hikes \u2013 to dissuade voters. They argue that competitive pressures will make it difficult for corporations to raise prices. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e7d4a3f417e47da6a004dcc82002d2d10607d28a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e7d4a3f417e47da6a004dcc82002d2d10607d28a/0_108_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Former Clinton rival Bernie Sanders is backing Measure 97, a bill to increase taxes on Oregon\u2019s big businesses\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Former Clinton rival Bernie Sanders is backing Measure 97, a bill to increase taxes on Oregon\u2019s big businesses.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: UPI / Barcroft Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cResearch shows that the large out-of-state corporations generally have national pricing strategies, which means that they charge the same price for the same product in every state. There is no relationship between tax regimes and corporate pricing,\u201d said Martin Hart-Landsberg, proponent of Measure 97 and professor of economics at Lewis and Clark College in Portland.<br></p> <p>Katherine Driessen, a spokeswoman for the Yes on 97 campaign, said big business wouldn\u2019t be sweating it if their customers were going to bear the cost. \u201cThe only reason that corporations like Wells Fargo and Comcast are spending millions is because they know that it\u2019s corporations, not consumers, that are going to pay this tax,\u201d she said.<br></p> <p>In the 2013\u20132014 budget year, businesses in Oregon accounted for an estimated 37.6% of taxes, the fourth lowest of the 50 states and the District of Columbia, according to a study by Ernst &amp; Young for the Council on State Taxation. If passed, Measure 97 would put Oregon\u2019s business share of total state and local taxes at 45.4%, just above the national average at 45%. The measure would also bump Oregon up from 28th to 20th highest in total per capita taxes.<br></p> <p>If Measure 97 fails to pass, supporters fear a continuation of the status quo, which they say is unacceptable.<br></p> <p>While education receives about 40% of the state\u2019s almost $20bn general fund, a large group of educators and parents say resources are stretched. <br></p> <p>\u201cEducators are frontline witnesses to the trauma our students come from,\u201d said Suzanne Cohen, president of the Portland Association of Teachers, adding that a limited staff of nurses and social workers could not meet the demands of impoverished students.<br></p> <p>Educators are having to choose between keeping physical education or electives like art and music, while receiving unfunded mandates from the state, such as requiring career and technical education. \u201cBut without increased revenue, you\u2019re left increasing class size and cutting from other programs,\u201d said Cohen.<br></p> <p>Oregon has the fourth-lowest high school graduation rate and the third-largest class size in the country.<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/16/homeless-school-portland-oregon-community-transitional\">A school that offers a place to learn, even if the kids have nowhere to live</a> </p> </aside>  <p>According to Cohen, every aspect of education \u2013 from transportation to curriculum to cafeteria standards \u2013 has been stripped.

  "<p><strong></strong><strong>There are only days to go before the US presidential election on 8 November. What are the latest polls saying?</strong></p> <p><strong> </strong>For an election that is generating more passion on both sides than any in recent memory, pollsters and pundits are offering scant comfort to those seeking clarity about Tuesday\u2019s result. Most outlets continue to predict victory for Hillary Clinton, but various models differ greatly in the certainty they award that outcome, and various polling averages disagree on the margin. Nate Silver\u2019s <a href=\"http://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2016-election-forecast/?ex_cid=rrpromo\">FiveThirtyEight</a> model gives Clinton a 65% chance of winning to Donald Trump\u2019s 35%, while the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/upshot/presidential-polls-forecast.html?action=click&amp;pgtype=Homepage&amp;clickSource=story-heading&amp;module=c-column-middle-span-region&amp;region=c-column-middle-span-region&amp;WT.nav=c-column-middle-span-region\">New York Times</a> sticks its neck out with an 86% chance of a Clinton presidency to 14% for Trump. RealClearPolitics\u2019 <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/us/general_election_trump_vs_clinton-5491.html\">polling average</a> has Clinton ahead by 1.7 percentage points, while HuffPost Pollster\u2019s <a href=\"http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/pollster/2016-general-election-trump-vs-clinton\">average</a> gives her a 5.5 percentage point lead.</p> <p><strong>How have these indicators changed since James Comey announced the FBI was looking into Clinton\u2019s emails again?</strong></p> <p><strong> </strong>Amid this dense electoral fog, what is clear is that <a href=\"http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/local/2016/11/02/Trump_leads_Clinton_in_new_Ohio_poll.html\">Comey\u2019s bombshell</a> last Friday that the FBI is in a sense reviving its probe into Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server when she was US secretary of state has had a profound impact on the race.

It is not known how many of those emails came to or from Abedin, nor how many might have related to Clinton or might already have been examined by the Bureau. If there are any new Clinton emails, it will take time to work out whether they contain classified material. So the search is unlikely to be completed by Tuesday, leaving this Sword of Damocles dangling over the Democratic presidential candidate as Americans go to the polls. </p> <p><strong>How is early voting looking?</strong></p> <p>More than <a href=\"http://www.electproject.org/early_2016\">34 million</a> Americans have already voted, surpassing the <a href=\"http://www.electproject.org/2012_early_vote\">32 million</a> who cast their ballots early four years ago. Will this benefit Clinton or Trump? There\u2019s no easy answer to that question, given variations both by state and electoral group. But there are clues. The good news for Clinton is that <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/clintons-coalition-hispanic-support-is-up-black-turnout-is-down/\">Latino turnout</a> among early voters has increased dramatically over 2012, suggesting that the \u201csleeping giant\u201d of the Hispanic vote might actually have been awoken this year by Trump\u2019s anti-immigrant rhetoric.

The fall in black turnout could be especially perilous for Clinton in swing states such as North Carolina, which has been identified by both candidates as a key target.</p> <p><strong>Can early voters change their minds, as Trump has urged, and have they been? </strong></p> <p>Trump is trying to use the furor over the FBI\u2019s renewed interest in Clinton\u2019s emails to persuade those early voters feeling buyer\u2019s remorse to switch their preference. \u201cNow that you see that Hillary was a big mistake, change your vote,\u201d he <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/793763567837253633\">said on Twitter</a>, making the same appeal at a campaign stop this week in Wisconsin, one of six states that do actually allow early voters to change their minds (three times, in <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/31/politics/changing-early-vote-cast/\">Wisconsin\u2019s case</a>).

Combine that with the state\u2019s history of squeakily close presidential elections \u2013 Obama won here in 2012 by just 74,000 out of more than 8m votes \u2013 and you have the mother of all swing states. <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/03/politics/donald-trump-path-to-270-scenarios/\">All</a> <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/11/02/4-electoral-maps-where-donald-trump-wins/?tid=sm_tw_pp&amp;wprss=rss_the-fix\">modeling</a> suggests Trump must win Florida or kiss goodbye to the White House, although for Clinton it may not be quite so crucial.

His only return to have been made public, courtesy of a <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/02/us/politics/donald-trump-taxes.html?_r=0\">New York Times</a> leak, suggests he may have avoided paying federal income tax for two decades.

  "<p>With investors continuing to be unnerved by the prospect of Donald Trump winning next week\u2019s US presidential election, leading shares are on the slide again.</p> <p>Pharmaceutical shares are under pressure after US lawmakers called on federal regulators to open a probe on potential price fixing for insulin and diabetes drugs.</p> <p>Although not mentioned, <strong>Hikma</strong> is the biggest faller in the FTSE 100, down 146p at \u00a315.99 after HSBC analysts cut their target price from \u00a325.25 to \u00a319.85 and warned all generic drugmakers could become caught up in a US Department of Justice investigation.</p> <p>But Numis moved from hold to buy ahead of an update from Hikma next week:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Hikma\u2019s shares are down 35% over three months and have significantly under- performed UK Mid-Cap Healthcare (+6%) and Global Specialty Pharma (-2%). The key risk to the investment case following the downgrades in August to 2016 forecasts are margin expectations from Generics that have disappointed since the acquisition of Roxane, which completed in early 2016.</p> <p>A third quarter update is expected next week and in the short term, a reduction to group revenue expectations for 2016 would be a disappointment, but in the absence of competition for Glycopyrrolate, view this as unlikely. A further reduction in margins for generics in 2016 is entirely possible, although we would argue this is now in the price.</p> <p>We take a more cautious stance on Generic margins into 2017, and reduce our earnings per share forecasts by 13% to 136c (consensus 156c). We see third quarter results on 10th November and the \u201cMeet the Management\u201d event on 15th November as the catalysts for a re-rating. The shares trade on 16 times 2017 PE for 23% earnings per share growth on our downgraded assumptions. We reduce our target price to 2,350p, which equates to 21 times 2017. This implies 35% upside on a 12- month view and so move to buy. </p> </blockquote> <p>Overall the <strong>FTSE 100</strong> has fallen 95.11 points to 6695.40, on track for its biggest one day fall since the immediate aftermath of the Brexit vote. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Despite the continued Brexit brouhaha muddying the waters it is hard to see anything challenge the election for market dominance from now until next Wednesday, if Clinton wins, or god knows how long, in the eventuality of a Trump victory.</p> </blockquote> <p>The falls are across the board. British Airways owner <strong>International Airlines Group </strong>is down 16.1p to 434.7p despite telling investors it was sticking to its earnings and margins growth targets for now to 2020 despite the difficult trading environment.</p> <p><strong>Dixons Carphone</strong> is down 12.6p at 328.9p on concerns about a coming squeeze on UK consumer spending, while Randgold Resources has fallen 220p to \u00a368.90.</p> <p>But <strong>Paddy Power Betfair</strong> has bucked the trend, up 285p to \u00a388.65 after it increased its full year profit forecast from \u00a3365m-\u00a3385m to \u00a3390m-\u00a3405m, citing the benefits of a weaker pound on its euro revenues. It reported earnings of \u00a3113m in the three months to the end of September, up 53%.</p> <p>Among the mid-caps <strong>DFS Furniture</strong> has fallen nearly 13% to 230.1p as US private equity firm Advent International sold a 12% stake in the business at 240p a share, cutting its investment in the retailer in half.</p>",
  "<p>The significance of the Paris agreement coming into force today is easy to miss: it may seem like an anti-climax, given the travails that led up to its <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/dec/12/paris-climate-deal-200-nations-sign-finish-fossil-fuel-era\">signing last December</a>.</p> <p>But the moment is of huge importance. This is the first time that a legally-binding agreement, signed by all of the world\u2019s functioning governments, has laid down a commitment to limit the growth of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere with the goal of preventing global warming exceeding 2C above pre-industrial levels. </p> <p>This figure was not plucked out of the increasingly carbon-rich air. It is the limit of what scientists regard as safety, beyond which climate change will run out of control, unstoppable in its damaging effects.</p> <p>There are caveats. The Paris agreement is legally binding in forcing governments to accept and cater for the 2C limit. But the commitments on curbing greenhouse gas emissions in line with that goal are not legally binding. This means incoming governments can renege upon them. There are no sanctions for governments that flout the goals.</p> <p>The outcome of the US presidential election will be key. Donald Trump, the Republican candidate whose polling has improved markedly in recent days, has vowed to cancel the US\u2019s participation in the Paris agreement. Russia has also failed to ratify the agreement, along with several other nations. China has ratified, but if US participation is not forthcoming under a future Trump government, that may be off.</p> <p>So while the agreement should be hailed as a massive and historic step forward in international efforts to avoid dangerous levels of global warming, it is potentially fragile.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the signs of danger are growing increasingly strong. This year is almost certain, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/oct/18/2016-locked-into-being-hottest-year-on-record-nasa-says\">according to Nasa</a>, to be the warmest on record, following last year\u2019s record-setting temperatures. This gives the lie to the claims of warming-dismissers that the upward march of global temperatures has \u201cpaused\u201d.</p> <p>Next year may not set records, but the trend is clear. We are on a trajectory that may lead to warming that is unprecedented and potentially irreversible. While there are other encouraging signs - <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/oct/25/renewables-made-up-half-of-net-electricity-capacity-added-last-year\">the growth in renewable energy use around the world</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/nov/01/global-carbon-intensity-falls-as-coal-use-declines\">small reductions in emissions in some major economies</a> - we should be in no doubt. The real work of Paris remains to be done.</p> <p><em>Fiona Harvey</em></p> <p><em>Environment correspondent, The Guardian</em></p>",

  "<p>South Korean president Park Geun-hye\u2019s has made a tearful apology for her role in a \u201cheartbreaking\u201d political scandal that has engulfed her administration \u2013 but it has failed to mollify opposition parties.<br></p> <p>In a televised address on Friday, Park said she would cooperate with prosecutors in their investigation into allegations that she allowed Choi Soon-sil, a friend of 40 years, to influence government policies on everything from the economy to North Korea.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/30/south-korea-rasputin-like-friend-president-park-geun-hye-returns\">The scandal has rocked South Korean society</a> and sent Park\u2019s approval rating to just 5%, according to a Gallup poll released on Friday - the lowest for any leader in the country\u2019s 68-year history.<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2016/nov/02/south-korea-explainer-park-guen-hye-six-key-points-scandal-choi-soon-sil\">South Korea scandal explained: six key points on the cronyism claims engulfing the president</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But soon after Park\u2019s apology \u2013 her second in 10 days \u2013 the leader of South Korea\u2019s main opposition party accused her of \u201cinsincerity\u201d and of desperately clinging to power.</p> <p>\u201cShe does not seem to understand the gravity of the whole situation,\u201d said Choo Mi-ae, leader of Democratic Party of Korea. \u201cShe is only interested in maintaining her grip on power.</p> <p>\u201cThe president should remove her hands from state affairs.\u201d</p> <p>Earlier, in a brief televised address to journalists, Park said that prosecutors should clarify what happened and that everyone involved, including herself, should be held accountable and take responsibility if found guilty.</p> <p>It is not clear what action could be taken against Park, as South Korea\u2019s constitution does not allow a sitting president to be prosecuted.</p> <p>\u201cThese latest developments are all my fault and were caused by my carelessness,\u201d she said, adding that she had \u201callowed my guard to drop\u201d around Choi.</p> <p>\u201cIt is hard to forgive myself and sleep at night because of the feelings of sorrow,\u201d Park said, her voice trembling.</p> <p>Choi is alleged to have used her closeness to the president to meddle in state affairs, and her lawyer has said he expects prosecutors to look into whether she inappropriately received classified documents. Choi has also been accused of using her ties to Park to benefit unlawfully from two non-profit organisations.</p> <p> \u201cIt is very miserable and regrettable that a particular individual is said to have taken profits and committed several unlawful acts, while we are working on a job in hopes of helping the national economy and people\u2019s lives,\u201d Park said, referring to Choi.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/01/choi-soon-sil-arrested-made-in-south-korean-presidential-cronyism-scandal\"> Choi has been in custody since Monday.</a></p> <p>However, Park denied some of the more lurid rumours surrounding the scandal - including reports that she had fallen into a religious cult and conducted shamanist rituals in the presidential Blue House.</p> <p>The scandal has triggered a media frenzy with fresh reports \u2013 many of them highly speculative and unsubstantiated \u2013 emerging every day, tying Choi and some of her extended family members to more alleged malpractices.</p> <p>Some reports have also suggested that Choi was still involved in marginal religious group created by her father and that Park had fallen under its influence.</p> <p>\u201cThere have been claims that I fell for a religious cult or had (shamanist rituals) performed in the Blue House, but I would like to clarify that those are absolutely not true,\u201d Park said in her address.</p> <p>Opposition parties have stepped up their criticism of Park, who has just over a year of her term to run, but have stopped short of calling for her resignation. That would trigger an early presidential election that they would not be confident of winning.</p> <p>Park has tried to defuse the crisis by firing eight presidential aides and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/02/new-south-korea-pm-appointed-as-cronyism-scandal-widens\">nominating three new top cabinet officials</a>, including the prime minister, in an effort to regain public confidence.</p> <p>But South Korean media reports said that if her choice of prime minister, Kim Byong-joon, is rejected and she is forced to name someone chosen by the opposition, she will effectively become a lame duck president.</p> <p>At best, Park will limp on to the end of her term with her power severely undermined at a time of slowing economic growth, rising unemployment and tensions with North Korea.</p>"

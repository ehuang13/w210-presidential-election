  "<p>The largest single transfer of Guant\u00e1namo Bay detainees of Barack Obama\u2019s presidency was announced on Monday, as 15 long-held men departed the infamous detention center.<br></p> <p>The transfer, officially announced by the Pentagon on Monday evening, brings the Guant\u00e1namo detainee population down to 61. </p> <p>The United Arab Emirates, a close US ally which has accepted former Guant\u00e1namo detainees in the past, took the 12 Yemenis and three Afghan nationals, some of whom the US has held for the 14 years Guant\u00e1namo that has served as a detention facility. The Pentagon thanked the UAE for its \u201chumanitarian gesture\u201d and support for shuttering Guant\u00e1namo.</p> <p>Six of the men had first received clearances for transfer in 2010, after a review early in the Obama administration found them eligible to leave Guant\u00e1namo and unfit for military prosecution. Their names are Abdel Qadir al-Mudafari<strong>, </strong>Muhammad Ahmad Said al-Adahi, Abdul Muhammad Ahmad Nassar al-Muhajari<strong>, </strong>Abd al-Rahman Sulayman,<strong> </strong>Mohammed Nasir Yahi Khussrof Kazaz<strong> </strong>and Abd al-Muhsin Abd al-Rab Salih al-Busi.</p> <p>All are Yemeni, and the administration for years cited instability in Yemen, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/25/we-are-trapped-in-war-no-end-in-sight-for-yemen-civilians\">where civil war continues today</a>, as a reason to halt transfers to the Middle Eastern country.<br></p> <p>Obama established a quasi-parole process to expedite transfers from Guant\u00e1namo, and between 2014 and 2016 the review system determined that the other nine detainees posed a negligible security risk. Those detainees are Mohammed Kamin, Mahmud Abd Al Aziz al-Mujahid, Saeed Ahmed Mohammed Abdullah Sarem Jarabh, Zahar Omar Hamis bin Hamdoun, Majid Mahmud Abdu Ahmed, Ayub Murshid Ali Salih, Obaidullah, Bashir Nasir Ali al-Marwalah and Hamid al-Razak \u2013 also known as Haji Hamidullah, an Afghan in his 50s.</p> <p>In 2008 two of the three Afghans, Obaidullah and Kamin, were <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-guantanamo-charges-idUSN9A45605320080911\">charged</a> <a href=\"http://archive.defense.gov/releases/release.aspx?releaseid=11748\">with crimes </a> related to terrorism, but those charges <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/guantanamo-trials\">were withdrawn</a>. The remaining 13 detainees transferred were held for over a decade without charges of a crime.</p> <p>Administration officials have said for months that they would speed up detainee transfers this summer, as Obama\u2019s time in office winds down with his promise to close Guant\u00e1namo \u2013 made on his second day in the White House \u2013 still unfulfilled.<br></p> <p>The Guardian <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/23/guantanamo-bay-detainees-release-plan-obama\">reported</a> in May that the Obama administration had reached deals with a half-dozen foreign countries to repatriate approximately two dozen detainees. </p> <p>The 15-detainee transfer is the largest Guant\u00e1namo release during Obama\u2019s presidency. While Obama released <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jan/14/guantanamo-bay-yemen-detainees-oman\">10 Yemeni detainees to Oman</a> in January and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/apr/16/guantanamo-bay-prisoners-released-yemen-saudi-arabia\">nine more Yemenis to Saudi Arabia in April</a>, Monday\u2019s transfer eclipsed a December 2009 release of <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/united-states-transfers-12-guantanamo-bay-detainees-afghanistan-yemen-and-somaliland-region\">12 detainees</a> to three countries. </p> <p>Transfers of larger numbers of detainees in a single round was more typical of the Bush administration, which established Guant\u00e1namo as a wartime detention facility in 2002. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/feb/24/obama-guantanamo-bay-closure-republicans\">'No one but himself to blame': how Obama's Guant\u00e1namo plans fell through</a> </p> </aside>  <p>With the detainee population at Guant\u00e1namo now down to 61, 10 of whom are in some phase of the military tribunals process, Obama is closer to what his administration calls an \u201cirreducible minimum\u201d of detainees: those it deems unable to prosecute but too dangerous to release. Obama\u2019s heralded plan to \u201cclose\u201d Guant\u00e1namo involves indefinite detention for that cadre, whose number remains undefined.</p> <p>Yet as he nears the end of his presidency, Obama has shown a willingness to take risks on so-called \u201cforever prisoners\u201d. One of the worst-tortured detainees at Guant\u00e1namo, the Mauritanian Mohamedou Slahi, was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/20/mohamedou-ould-slahi-release-guantanamo-diary\">recently cleared for transfer</a> by the parole-like board.<strong> </strong>Later this week, the board will consider the case of former CIA black-site detainee Hambali, once considered al-Qaida\u2019s chief operative in south-east Asia. Next week it will hear from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/09/cia-torture-9-11-abu-zubaydah-guantanamo-bay\">Abu Zubaydah</a>, another waterboarding survivor, whom the US no longer believes is a member of al-Qaida. </p> <p>While Hillary Clinton, Obama\u2019s former secretary of state and the Democratic presidential nominee, has supported the Guant\u00e1namo closure plan begun by Obama, she has not emphasized it on the campaign trail.</p> <p>In contrast, Donald Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, vowed in a Monday speech to keep Guant\u00e1namo open as a detention center. Trump has pledged to \u201cload\u201d the Guant\u00e1namo population \u201c<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7dmMI3CtKI\">with some bad dudes</a>\u201d.</p> <p>Last week Trump said he was <a href=\"http://www.miamiherald.com/news/politics-government/election/donald-trump/article95144337.html\">comfortable trying Americans</a> accused of terrorism at Guant\u00e1namo\u2019s military tribunals, although <a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/10/948c\">the Military Commissions Act bars</a> trying American citizens in the commissions.</p> <p>Lee Wolosky, the US state department envoy charged with securing deals with willing nations for Guant\u00e1namo transfers, thanked the UAE in a statement. </p> <p> \u201cThe continued operation of the detention facility weakens our national security by draining resources, damaging our relationships with key allies and partners, and emboldening violent extremists,\u201d Wolosky said.</p>",

  "<p>I get nauseous every time I hear the name Ralph Nader. If all those votes cast for him for president in 2000 had gone to Al Gore, we might have been spared the Iraq war, the frat-boy alliance of George W and Tony Blair, and other horrors.</p> <p>So I hate so-called third parties. I prefer to call them \u201cfringe\u201d. I don\u2019t believe that voting has anything to do with the so-called likability of the candidates. Who cares which of them is the one you\u2019d rather meet in the pub? Nor should voting be an act of protest. The Green party zealots who went for Nader because they said there wasn\u2019t a dime of difference between Bush and Gore were tragically wrong.</p> <p>Voting is a sacred duty of US citizenship and as such, the presidential contest is about one central question: in whose hands is the country most likely to prosper, be safe and come closest to the American promise of equal rights for all?</p> <p>Because Trump and Clinton are such disliked and polarizing candidates, I understand why alternatives might appeal. Many voters do want to support someone who most purely mirrors their ideals. They don\u2019t want to vote pragmatically or settle for the lesser of two evils.</p> <p>This is a real dilemma. But 2016 isn\u2019t the year for purity. Casting a vote for any of the alternative party or independent candidates in November could have truly disastrous effects.</p> <p>With Trump on the ballot, the risk of unintentionally helping elect an unstable man who is clearly not prepared for the job is too big. After the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/14/hillary-clinton-polls-convention-trump-election-data\">past two weeks</a>, it\u2019s tempting to conclude that the pugnacious real estate tycoon has spontaneously combusted, like <a href=\"http://mentalfloss.com/article/60468/how-charles-dickens-fueled-world-spontaneous-combustion-truthers\">Old Krook</a> in Dickens\u2019 Bleak House. But by November, as has been true in most recent American elections, the gap between the two candidates will narrow. Even with all the self-inflicted wounds, Trump still starts out with a likely base of 170 electoral votes. Getting the next 100 needed for election will be extremely hard but not impossible. If Clinton is to win the swing states she needs to get to 270, she can\u2019t have too many votes siphoned away by fringe candidates like the Green party\u2019s Jill Stein or Libertarian Gary Johnson.</p> <p>When I combed through their platforms and records, I, too, found a lot to like about Stein and Johnson, especially after I listened to their one hour, <a href=\"http://www.wbur.org/onpoint/2016/08/10/green-party-nominee-dr-jill-stein\">back</a> to <a href=\"http://www.wbur.org/onpoint/2016/08/10/gary-johnson-on-what-it-means-to-be-a-libertarian\">back</a> interviews with Boston radio host Tom Ashbrook. Stein\u2019s sincerity and smarts were evident. Since she twice ran for governor of Massachusetts and once before for president in 2012 (she received 469,000 votes, more than separated JFK and Nixon in 1960), she was more seasoned as a politician than I expected. Her calls for free college tuition and a 15% federal minimum wage mirrored those of Bernie Sanders, some of whose followers are using the Twitter hashtag #jillnothill. As would be expected of a Green candidate, her top issue is protecting \u201cMother Earth\u201d, by dramatically reducing dependence on fossil fuels and banning nuclear power.</p> <p>Her central message is a direct play for disaffected Democrats: \u201cThe [Democratic party] boat is sinking and it\u2019s taking us down with it. This is the time to get off of that boat. We [progressives] have a lifeboat. It\u2019s called the Green party, so let\u2019s not sink together, let\u2019s sail together!\u201d</p> <p>Johnson, the genial former Republican governor of a Democratic state, New Mexico, was popular in office, lowering state taxes, expanding jobs and attracting more businesses. Although he says he\u2019s personally against abortion, he believes it\u2019s the woman\u2019s right to decide. His antipathy to stricter gun laws isn\u2019t surprising for a libertarian, but will turn off liberal voters in urban areas. He\u2019s for legalizing marijuana. His low-tax mantra will appeal to Republicans who think Trump\u2019s economic plan is voodoo, to use an old Geroge HW Bush word. Johnson does seem a viable alternative to Trump for Republicans who just can\u2019t stomach Clinton and perhaps for Sanders Democrats. Maine senator Susan Collins <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2016/08/susan-collins-no-clinton-226822\">suggested recently</a> that she\u2019s considering voting Libertarian.</p> <p>\u201cI hope that people will see that we don\u2019t have to sit by the sidelines and watch as the two major parties limit their choices to slightly different flavors of the status quo. It is, in fact, possible to join the fray, stand up for principles and offer a real alternative,\u201d Johnson has said.</p> <p>I\u2019ve also watched some television appearances by Evan McMullin, a 40-year-old factotum of the Republican party, who is running as an independent candidate. Virtually unknown, he is hardly the GOP\u2019s answer to finding a viable Trump alternative. I do give him credit for having the guts to try to drain Republicans away from Trump, but he just won\u2019t be a factor in November.</p> <p>None of this occasional likability translates into anything meaningful, however. None of these candidates could possibly win. So a casting a protest vote for any one of them is akin to throwing your vote away.</p> <p>The most influence they would hope to wield is if any of them reach 15% in national polls. That way, they could be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/14/third-party-candidates-johnson-stein-mcmullin-debate-polling-percentage\">included in the presidential debates</a>, gaining much wider national exposure. Johnson probably has the best chance to make it in, but Trump opposes anything but a direct one-on-one with Clinton. Some suspect this is a ruse to withdraw from the debates altogether, rather than get creamed by Clinton.</p> <p>This extraordinary election is definitely a two-horse race. But the questions raised by the candidacies of both Sanders and Trump point to an uncertain future.</p> <p>A politically savvy friend of mine, who works for one of the American TV television networks, told me he thinks Trump may be the last GOP presidential nominee. This friend, a Republican, believes the party will never recover from the Trump disaster. It will splinter into various other entities, some of them to sit it out on the fringe.</p> <p>And what of those Democrats alienated by Hillary\u2019s pivot away from the left as she moves into territory vacated by Trump, <a href=\"https://www.thenation.com/article/hillary-clintons-embrace-of-kissinger-is-inexcusable/\">courting</a> Republican establishment figures such as Henry Kissinger?</p> <p>If there is no realignment, no recalibration, then the risk is that the angry voices on both left and right find no meaningful outlet. Third parties will never be a significant feature American politics, but after this election, the future shape of the two main ones is a question that cannot be neglected.</p>",

Each male mosquito released by the US pest control firm Oxitec will carry a gene to prevent his offspring from reaching adulthood. Scientists hope that the genetically modified males will mate with wild females to undercut the population of Aedes aegypti, the type of mosquito that spread Zika. But some residents are angry. \u201cIt\u2019s about human rights \u2013 this can\u2019t be pushed down our throats without consent,\u201d said Mila de Mier, a real estate agent.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/14/florida-keys-zika-virus-genetically-modified-mosquitoes\">Zika virus: Floridians fear \u2018Pandora\u2019s box\u2019 of genetically altered mosquitoes</a><br></p> <h2>Trump takes aim at media</h2> <p>As the Republican presidential nominee struggles in polls and reports of despair within his presidential campaign circulate, Donald Trump has begun to question the role of a free press. At a Saturday night rally, Trump went so far as to say that his race is not against the Democratic nominee, Hillary Clinton, but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/14/donald-trump-crooked-media-campaign-polls-free-press-hillary-clinton\">against journalists</a>. \u201cI\u2019m not running against Crooked Hillary,\u201d he told a crowd. \u201cI\u2019m running against the crooked media.\u201d On Sunday, he went further: \u201cIt is not \u2018freedom of the press\u2019 when newspapers and others are allowed to say and write whatever they want even if it is completely false!\u201d </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/14/donald-trump-crooked-media-campaign-polls-free-press-hillary-clinton\">Donald Trump: I\u2019m running against \u2018crooked media\u2019, not just Hillary Clinton</a></p> <h2>Record flooding in Louisiana</h2> <p>More than 10,000 people are in shelters and more than 20,000 people have been rescued across south Louisiana amid widespread flooding, governor John Bel Edwards has said, as the federal government declared a major disaster in four parishes. Three people were reported dead Sunday and one remains unaccounted for. The governor says water is continuing to rise in some areas even though the sunshine is out. He encouraged people to not go out and \u201csightsee\u201d even as the weather improves.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/14/louisiana-flooding-cuts-off-roads-homes\">Louisiana flooding: 20,000 people rescued as major disaster declared</a></p> <h2>Picnic only for some<br></h2> <p>Scores of \u201cU-pick\u201d farms have sprung up in southern California \u2013 offering recreation, entertainment and do-it-yourself harvesting. But the big, working farms produce much of America\u2019s fruit and vegetables, and the juxtaposition between the mostly white children gambolling in shorts and flip-flops and the mostly latino men and women bent over double, wearing jeans, boots and masks, is striking. They labor in silence for up to 13 hours a day. \u201cYou have to be fast. If you\u2019re not, they scold you. \u2018Move it, hurry up,\u2019\u201d said Veronica Villano, 28, a veteran Ventura county raspberry picker. \u201cYou drink water when you can but they don\u2019t always let you.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/15/california-farms-pick-your-own-fruit-vegetables-working-conditions-jobs\">Fruits of labor: sunny California is no paradise for farm workers</a></p> <h2>A progressive Clinton? Not likely</h2> <p>Come November, Clinton will have won her great victory \u2013 not as a champion of working people\u2019s concerns, but as the greatest moderate of them all, predicts Thomas Frank. \u201cAnd so ends the great populist uprising of our time, fizzling out pathetically in the mud and the bigotry stirred up by a third-rate would-be caudillo named Donald J Trump. So closes an era of populist outrage that began back in 2008 ... The unrest has taken many forms in these eight years \u2013 from idealistic to cynical, from Occupy Wall Street to the Tea Party \u2013 but they all failed to change much of anything.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/13/trump-clinton-election-chances-moderate-policies-economy\">With Trump certain to lose, you can forget about a progressive Clinton</a></p> <p>Meanwhile, Hillary Clinton got a bounce from the Democratic convention. If history is any guide, Clinton\u2019s current lead hinges on her performance in upcoming debates, the ability to avoid (any more) scandals, and bigger-picture issues like the economy and national security, which are beyond either candidate\u2019s direct control.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/14/hillary-clinton-polls-convention-trump-election-data\">Hillary Clinton got a big boost from the convention.

Since the early 2000s, archaeologists have been bringing up treasures. Discovering a single statue is exciting, says Aur\u00e9lia Masson-Berghoff, curator at the British Museum, but \u201cdiscovering a whole city, which was home to thousands and thousands of people over more than a thousand years \u2026 Well, that\u2019s something else\u201d.<br></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/aug/15/lost-cities-6-thonis-heracleion-egypt-sunken-sea\">Lost cities #6: how Thonis-Heracleion resurfaced after 1,000 years under water</a><br></p> <h2>In case you missed it \u2026</h2> <p>Kate Mara was 19 when she passed on admission at the highly respected Tisch School of Performing Arts at New York University and bought a dog. \u201cI knew I would need the company,\u201d she says. \u201cBecause where I was going, I knew literally no one.\u201d That place was Hollywood.

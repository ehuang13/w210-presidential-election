  "<p>The post-disaster politicking got under way in earnest on Friday, as Donald Trump appeared in flood-stricken Louisiana to give his image a presidential burnish, and as the White House announced Barack Obama would tour the area next Tuesday.</p> <p>A day earlier Louisiana\u2019s governor, John Bel Edwards, had warned Trump not to show up in Louisiana \u201cfor a photo op\u201d. Instead, he said, Trump should volunteer and make donations. </p> <p>Edwards also defended the delayed visit by Obama, who has come under heavy criticism locally for not interrupting his vacation to come tour the disaster area. </p> <p>The photo opportunity is a time-honored political maneuver after a natural disaster, and Trump put his own spin on it, traveling with an 18-wheel transfer truck full of supplies to hand out to crowds. </p> <p>Wherever he went, he created his own television-ready crowds. In St Amant, one of the hardest-hit areas between Baton Rouge and New Orleans, Trump\u2019s convoy set up in a parking lot, and droves of people turned out to watch him hand out water bottles and diapers. </p> <p>\u201cIt was really something,\u201d said national guardsman Chris Ealy, who shook Trump\u2019s hand. The 25-year-old seemed dazzled by his encounter with national political machinery. \u201cI could tell they were in a hurry.\u201d</p> <p>Trump stayed about 15 minutes before the motorcade of black SUVs and motorcycles moved on. Within a few minutes the crowd had melted away. </p> <p>The brevity of the spectacle didn\u2019t matter. Trump\u2019s target audience was watching him on television; local people will vote for him regardless. </p> <p>\u201cThis is his stomping grounds,\u201d said Greg Patterson, who was cleaning muck from his store called the Pit Stop. The idea that a billionaire from Manhattan could describe the working-class corner of Louisiana as \u201chis stomping grounds\u201d did not strike Patterson as contradictory.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got 2,000 houses damaged just in this area alone,\u201d he said, stretching his arm out to the south. \u201cThese people are already back in their homes, working to repair them. It\u2019s not like down in the Ninth Ward.\u201d</p> <p>That was a reference to one of the quarters of New Orleans that was worst hit by Katrina a decade ago. That neighborhood is mostly poor, and mostly black. </p> <p>\u201cI mean that\u2019s a bunch of government-owned housing,\u201d Patterson said. \u201cNobody here is looking for handouts or waiting on the government. These are Trump\u2019s people.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/aug/27/new-orleans-bush-clinton-obama-visit-hurricane-katrina-lower-ninth\">Uneven Katrina recovery leaves Lower Ninth Ward with little love for presidents</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It was a bombastic statement, and maybe emotionally satisfying, but it was also untrue: more than 60,000 local people have applied for relief from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema). </p> <p>As Trump left the area, police closed down Interstate 10, which connects Baton Rouge and New Orleans. As his motorcade passed by, drivers in the oncoming lane slammed on their brakes, unsure whether to pull to the side of the road. Some veered off into the grass and mud.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s visit was a savvy one that helped distract attention from the disarray of his campaign just 80 days from the general election. His campaign manager, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/19/paul-manafort-resigns-donald-trump-campaign\">Paul Manafort, resigned on Friday</a> after a series of revelations about his connections to a pro-Russian Ukrainian regime.</p> <p>It also leveraged regional frustration with Obama. The Baton Rouge Advocate published an editorial comparing Obama\u2019s vacation on Martha\u2019s Vineyard to George W Bush\u2019s response to Katrina. \u201cSometimes, presidential visits can get in the way of emergency response, doing more harm than good,\u201d it said. \u201cBut we don\u2019t see that as a factor now that flood waters are subsiding, even if at an agonizing pace. It\u2019s past time for the president to pay a personal visit, showing his solidarity with suffering Americans.\u201d</p> <p>A mile or so from where Trump had stopped to distribute supplies from his 18-wheeler, Joyce Humphries sat in a pickup truck Friday with her chihuahua, Elvis Presley, and looked out over a lake that used to be her home. </p> <p>\u201cEverything is gone,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Humphries said that Trump\u2019s visit was good enough to win her vote. \u201cWe will take any help we can get,\u201d she said.</p>",

And it\u2019s not as straightforward as you might imagine.</p> <p>The first thing you notice when visiting Breitbart is its idiosyncratic presentation. Every headline is in capitals. It implies a sense of significance and dire urgency.</p> <p>It screams at you. \u201cTHIS IS IMPORTANT,\u201d is the effect. \u201cTHIS IS OUTRAGEOUS.\u201d \u201cTHIS IS ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF THIS COUNTRY GOING TO HELL IN A HANDCART.\u201d</p> <p>The last of those points is an example of how well Breitbart knows its audience.</p> <p>This doomsday approach makes it seem like Breitbart readers want to feel that everything is rotten.

They want to feel that disaster is impending \u2013 unless their guys can fix it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Bencjacobs/status/766701818172743680\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">There are actually some jobs that foreigners will do that Americans won&#39;t. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/adamgabbatt\">@adamgabbatt</a> demonstrates for <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GuardianUS\">@GuardianUS</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/RMzSHy2LtN\">https://t.co/RMzSHy2LtN</a></p>&mdash; Ben Jacobs (@Bencjacobs) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Bencjacobs/status/766701818172743680\">August 19, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/johntabin/status/766700215445454848\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-conversation=\"none\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/Bencjacobs\">@Bencjacobs</a> is &quot;soccer&quot; Guardian house style now?

Trump still has to answer serious questions hovering over his campaign given his propensity to parrot Putin\u2019s talking points, the roster of advisers like Carter Page and Mike Flynn with deep ties to Russia, the recent Russian government hacking and disclosure of Democratic Party records, and reports that Breitbart published articles advocating pro-Kremlin positions on Ukraine.

Havelange was in many ways the godfather of modern sporting corporatism in his alliance with the Adidas scion Horst Dassler, which began in 1974.</p> <p>Like several others, most obviously his protege Sepp Blatter, he was both an IOC member and a senior figure within Fifa. More than anyone, he paved the way for the globalisation and commercialisation of the World Cup and the Olympics. His part in smoothing the way for Rio to win the right to host the Olympics in 2009, when the country was riding the crest of an economic wave, should not be overlooked.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"88189972a8d8d41b414fd5a3a668ba83131f0bd2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/88189972a8d8d41b414fd5a3a668ba83131f0bd2/0_35_2300_1380/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Alistair Brownlee\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alistair Brownlee\u2019s stunning triathlon victory was one of the rare times an Olympic event was physically in the heart of the Rio.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Valery Sharifulin/Tass</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There was a more recent reminder in the Olympic stadium \u2013 which has suffered in terms of attendance and atmosphere by dint of its geographical remoteness from the Olympic park \u2013 on Friday night when Issa Hayatou, once reprimanded after he appeared on list detailing $100m (\u00a376m) in bribes and is still an honorary IOC member, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/dec/03/fifa-not-corrupt-acting-president-issa-hayatou\">was among those dishing out the medals</a>.</p> <p>And yet, less than 24 hours after Hickey was led away, fans were out in force to cheer the Brownlee brothers down the seafront. Amid the party atmosphere created by the local families and international flag-wavers packing the course, it was perhaps the first time it felt like the Olympics had come to the city, rather than taking place in two hermetically sealed parks, 20km away.</p> <p>On the same stretch of coast, the finals of the beach volleyball were a riot as full stands partied on Copacabana to a spectacle that was half elite sport, half spring break. When Usain Bolt appeared at the Olympic stadium, the world stopped as the greatest sprinter of all time took their acclaim with a Brazilian flag draped around his shoulders.</p> <p>Yet beneath it all, the doubts that hung over the Games like dark clouds before the opening ceremony, never cleared completely. Even the wonder of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/14/wayde-van-niekerk-olympic-gold-400m-world-record\">Wayde van Niekerk\u2019s breathtaking 400m world record</a> couldn\u2019t help but be followed by questions about doping.</p> <p>It is the likeable young South African\u2019s misfortune to be competing at a time when suspicion comes with the territory, and at a Games tainted perhaps more than any other by the revelations of Russia\u2019s state-sponsored doping. As the IOC no doubt hoped, the issue got somewhat buried once the action began, but there were frequent reminders.</p> <p>Most telling was the juxtaposition of whistleblower Yulia Stepanova\u2019s heart-rending appearance via videolink to remind the world of the danger she and husband, Vitaly, were in and her frustration at being blocked from competing by the IOC, with the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/18/yelena-isinbayeva-ioc-voted-athletes-commision-russia-pole-vault-ban\">election of pole-vaulter Yelena Isinbayeva to the IOC athlete\u2019s commission</a>. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"81b27be4471c6bea89d950d9072ad68c004976c6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/81b27be4471c6bea89d950d9072ad68c004976c6/0_0_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Yulia Stepanova\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Yulia Stepanova.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michael Kooren/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Russia aside, five other countries remain in \u201ccritical care\u201d because their anti-doping systems are not up to scratch according to an international athletics federation that itself was close to collapse less than 12 months ago. </p> <p>Aside from the Hickey ticketing episode, the refusal of the IOC to properly acknowledge the questions raised by boxing\u2019s meltdown a few hundred yards away in Carioca Arena 1 also left a sour taste. On the eve of the Games, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/01/rio-2016-olympics-boxing-corruption-allegations\">the Guardian had warned of well-sourced fears of judging corruption</a>.</p> <p>Then, amid uproar about some highly questionable judging, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/17/international-boxing-association-six-judges-sent-home-rio-2016\">the AIBA executive director was sent home to Lausanne and half a dozen of its most senior referees and judges stood down</a>. And yet the IOC continued to insist this was a \u201cmatter for the federation\u201d and its president Dr CK Wu, an IOC member and former IOC presidential candidate.</p> <p>Michael Conlan, the Irish boxer who believes he was cheated out of an Olympic medal, could have been talking much more widely than for just his sport when he railed against the mandarins who crush the dreams of athletes. Never has the gap between the \u201cordinary people doing extraordinary things\u201d, to use the words of former UK Sport chair Sue Campbell this week, and those overseeing the five-ringed circus felt wider than it did at these Games.</p> <p>For the British, surrendering to the endorphin rush and pleasing statistical permutations of the medal chase was inevitable. Yet while the individual stories of sporting endeavour were as compelling as ever and while athletes deserved their moment, it was hard to shake off the cynicism engendered by those in charge.</p> <p>The IOC, like Fifa, has always relied on sporting spectacle to blind the rest of us to their failings. It is a trick that is becoming increasingly difficult to pull off. A sort of freewheeling chaos tugged at the threads of this Olympics, threatening to unravel the whole patchwork. That it held in place was at times a wonder.</p> <p>Just as the athletes felt further removed than ever from the IOC blazers \u2013 <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/olympics/olympic-executives-cash-in-on-a-movement-that-keeps-athletes-poor/2016/07/30/ed18c206-5346-11e6-88eb-7dda4e2f2aec_story.html\">with their $900 <em tabindex=\"-1\">per diems</em></a> and \u201cOlympic Family\u201d hotel \u2013 so the Games felt further removed from the city in which it was hosted than ever before.

After visits, independents were 5% more likely to vote for Romney, Wood found, and they were the only group affected for longer than two days, leading him to conclude that they might only affect an extremely close election. </p> <p>In the study, published this week in the Annals of the American Academic of Political and Social Science, Wood asked: \u201cIf visits have only a moderate impact on voters, but consume vast amounts of the candidates\u2019 and their staff\u2019s time, attention and resources, why not neglect visits and instead redouble candidates\u2019 attention to fundraising?\u201d</p> <p>Wood said that mundane duties, such as hiring staff, renting office space and paying for yard signs, bumper stickers and office supplies have an outsize effect on voter behavior.</p> <p>\u201cHaving somebody come to your door and give you a Trump yard sign or bumper sticker, it\u2019s expensive. You need to have guys organize who goes where, who\u2019s going to rent the office space, run the headquarters,\u201d he said. \u201cThese things turn out to have small but meaningful effects.\u201d</p> <p>The failed campaigns of Republicans John Kasich and Chris Christie seemed to bear out Wood\u2019s research. Kasich held more than <a href=\"https://www.johnkasich.com/blog-posts/kasich-holds-100th-new-hampshire-town-hall-in-bedford-today/\">100 town hall events</a> in New Hampshire but could not win the state, winning 15.8% of the vote, a distant second to Trump. Christie spent more than 70 days in the state and left in sixth place, with 7.4% of the vote. </p> <p>Lynn Vavreck, a professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, said that Wood\u2019s research fits with similar studies. Vavreck noted Obama\u2019s successful data campaign relied heavily on voter data to target treated field operations \u201clike a field goal unit: if the race is close, you want to have a good one.\u201d</p> <p>She similarly downplayed the importance of local stops, saying: \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone has ever said, and certainly the Obama people never said, that the reason a presidential campaign won an election was because of their field operation.\u201d</p> <p>Wood suggested that Clinton would be better off visiting donors who can give her the cash for her regional offices, though he noted that her campaign is so well financed \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.opensecrets.org/pres16/candidate.php?id=N00000019\">with almost $45m to begin July</a> \u2013 that she may feel secure at the moment.</p> <p>He also said campaign consultants may be more interested in their national image than local votes: a bus tour traps journalists together from one cheesy event to another, and gives campaigns time to grind their message home.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e8bd80c4a408d67e3b0c6a7bc853b551fb7103b5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e8bd80c4a408d67e3b0c6a7bc853b551fb7103b5/0_178_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Hillary at dunklings\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hillary Clinton greets a worker during a visit to a Dunkin\u2019 Donuts in West Palm Beach, Florida, in March.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Justin Sullivan/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In contrast to Clinton\u2019s many detours and pauses, Trump rarely stops to meet and greet with voters. \u201cFor whatever reason Trump does not like buses,\u201d Wood said, \u201cand he\u2019s had about half as many rallies as his Democratic opponent.\u201d </p> <p>Trump has instead hewed for months to the strategy that won him the Republican primary: rallies and a promiscuous approach to television interviews and Twitter.

That is why on Friday, I helped to make public more documents related to Manafort\u2019s dealings with the Party of Regions, which he used to consult for.</p> <p>I remember Manafort clearly during the inauguration of Victor Yanukovych, the former president of Ukraine. On a cold February morning, men and women wearing tailcoats and evening gowns hurried towards the Lenin monument. There was a little bit of commotion at the entrance \u2013 Rinat Akhmetov, the richest Ukrainian man and the right arm of Yanukovych, was trying to make way for an inconspicuous American. It was only me and a few of my colleagues who recognized the mysterious stranger\u2019s face: it was Paul Manafort.</p> <p>Manafort had served as a consultant to the Party of Regions for many years. He had just as much cause for celebration as the newly inaugurated president, since he was the mastermind behind the president\u2019s victory. The two had worked together since 2004. After Yanukovych\u2019s election defeat that year, Manafort was hired by him and they worked on four election campaigns (including one presidential and three parliamentary ones) together.</p> <p>The American consultant was recommended to Yanukovych by his business and political partner Rinat Akhmetov, who in turn was recommended by Oleg Deripaska, his Russian colleague from the circle of fellow oligarchs. That way Manafort passed from one person to another as a relay baton to later become one of the most influential players in the Ukrainian politics. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/16/donald-trump-campaign-paul-manafort-ukraine-yanukovich\">How Trump's campaign chief got a strongman elected president of Ukraine</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The question is now if he ever abused his position. So-called \u201cshadow accounting\u201d documents I have seen <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/ukraine-prosecutor-confirms-paul-manaforts-name-appears-in-secret-cash-ledger/\">show</a> $400,000 in cash payments were made to him, which were intended to be spent on conducting exit polls. The documents show a further $812,000 to be paid to him for engaging international observers. And, these documents, which I <a href=\"http://www.pravda.com.ua/cdn/graphics/2016/05/black-pr/\">reported</a> on and which were the focus of a New York Times <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/15/us/politics/paul-manafort-ukraine-donald-trump.html?_r=0\">article</a> this week, list a total of $12.7m of payments made to Manafort.</p> <p>Ukrainians are concerned about the theft of public money. We want the chain of corruption to end. That is why many are troubled that Manafort\u2019s name has emerged in this investigation.<br></p> <p>It is not just these latest revelations that cast a shadow over Manafort\u2019s name in Ukraine. Manafort was an advisor to President Yanukovych when he pursued a divisive electoral campaign, such as focusing on the alleged infringement of rights of the Russian-speaking population in Ukraine. This wasn\u2019t an issue before, but after years of driving this idea into the heads of voters, the question of the Russian language has really become an important factor in Ukrainian politics. </p> <p>Subsequently, after the escape of Yanukovych in 2014, it was under the guise of protecting the Russian population that Putin invaded Crimea, violating the post-war balance of power in Europe. </p> <p>Manafort worked with Victor Yanukovych \u2013 one of the most notorious European politicians \u2013 for nearly 10 years. This is not a casual relationship between the client and the performer. Such long-term cooperation incorporates a general worldview and values. Now voters in America will have to ask themselves: are these values they want in their country?</p>",

Twenty years ago he was the most loathed prime minister in modern times after his contested pension changes saw two million people take to the streets in 1995. But he is now seen as a calm, elder statesman, pushing pro-business structural reform, and as a moderate who is less divisive on identity issues. </p> <p>He still has a lead over Sarkozy in the primary race, but during the summer the former president began to close the gap. Sarkozy\u2019s rise in support, particularly among Les R\u00e9publicains supporters, follows a fall at the start of this year, when he was damaged by what was seen as a disappointing showing for his party in regional elections. </p> <p>\u201cTerrorism has now become a major concern for French voters and will no doubt be a central theme of the primary race,\u201d said Yves-Marie Cann, political director at the <a href=\"http://elabe.fr \">Elabe</a> polling group in Paris. \u201cQuestions of security and national identity are issues on which Sarkozy has very much built his political career.

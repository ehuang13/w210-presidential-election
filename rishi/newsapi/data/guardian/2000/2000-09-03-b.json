  "There is a higher guiding hand that moves behind the increasingly tense US presidential election, and it is not - as commonly said - Bill Clinton. It is the hand of God. <p>In a country that traditionally, and constitutionally, drives a wedge between the affairs of Church and State, never before have politics and religion been so closely entwined as in this campaign. Both candidates, and their running mates, insist that God is on their side; the Almighty is claimed by the Left, Right and Centre. </p> <p>George W. Bush found himself preaching to a humble, fundamentalist Christian Fellowship meeting in Kansas (where Adam and Eve, rather than Darwin, are taught in science classes) with a mixed message: Praise the Lord and lower taxes. </p> <p>But foremost in this sudden invocation of faith is Al Gore's nomination for Vice-President, Joe Lieberman, who last week broke all the banks separating faith and politics with defiant speeches on 'the need to reaffirm our faith, and renew the dedication of our nation and ourselves to God'. </p> <p>Even as Lieberman made his speech, massive 'pray-in' demonstrations of college students were taking place all across the South in defiance of a Supreme Court ruling that bans formal prayers at sporting events - tens of thousands of students gathering to recite the Lord's Prayer at high volume. Ironically, Jews in Mississippi refused to participate and protested. </p> <p>The result of Lieberman's speeches has been not to unite the faithful - in a country where 86 per cent believe in God. Quite the reverse: the Jewish community is riven by the stance taken by the first of their faith to feature on a presidential ticket, while Christians fragment. </p> <p>God had been a main stream issue in the election before Lieberman's selection. Anxious to court the Christian Right, Bush had spoken much about how his 'heart belonged to Jesus', and when asked who his favourite philosopher was answered simply: 'Jesus Christ.' After his many dalliances with new-age nonsense, Gore - who was born a Southern Baptist - declared to one audience that he was 'a child of the Kingdom and a person of strong faith'. </p> <p>And Gore's selection of Lieberman, an observant Jew, as running mate was widely welcomed as a wholesome breeze through a putrid polity, and an injection of morality into the shaming of the presidency by Bill and Monica. It was hoped he would demystify Orthodox Judaism in America, and bring the faith to its place in the mainstream it more than deserved. </p> <p>With Gore now surging from behind to lead Bush, running-mate Lieberman kicked off the week with one of the strongest drives to infuse American politics with religious faith. The first blast of the trumpet was from a Christian pulpit in Detroit, invoking the Ten Commandments and the 'inspiration of Jesus of Nazareth'. </p> <p>But the speech only highlighted deep reservations among Jews about both his candidacy and what he was doing with it. </p> <p>The Anti-Defamation League, with impeccable credentials in the struggle against anti-Semitism, had already lambasted Bush and Gore for scriptural politics, and now unleashed its strongest criticism so far against Lieberman, accusing him of 'hawking' his faith. 'We do not think that religion belongs in the political arena,' said ADL director Abraham Foxman. </p> <p>Lieberman, for his part, says he is claiming God for the Left - against the traditions of ideology in America. 'I respect the ADL,' he said, 'but I'm going to keep doing what I'm doing.' </p> <p>In California, he spoke again about the inseparability of faith and public life, and even said: 'Isn't Medicare coverage of prescription drugs really about the values of the Fifth Commandment, Honour Your Mother and Father?' Lieberman's aides are quick to draw distinctions between his comments and efforts by Christian conservatives to mingle religion and politics, noting that Lieberman supports abortion rights and opposes organised prayer in schools. </p> <p>The reaction of the enemy camp was simple. Bush headed straight for a fundamentalist fellowship in Kansas to declare that 'our nation is chosen by God'. </p> <p>Meanwhile, Lieberman interprets the Constitution in his own way, insisting the First Amendment guaranteed 'freedom OF religion, not freedom FROM religion'. </p> <p>The interpretation draws fire from the 'fundamentalist liberals' who hold to the origins of the revolution, the People for the American Way group. 'The government has to be neutral with regard to religion,' says director Ralph Neas, 'whether between one religion and another, or whether it's between the religious and the non-religious.' </p> <p>The American Civil Liberties Union invoked the ghost of John F. Kennedy, who pledged that, as a Catholic, he would take no order from the Vatican. 'If John F. Kennedy had said the sort of thing Lieberman is saying,' says the ACLU's Ira Glasser, 'he never would have been elected President. People would have been terrified.' </p> <p>Even the organised Christian community is not sure about Lieberman's stance. The Rev Barry Lynn, director of Americans for the Separation of Church and State, says: 'Lieberman's ability to understand the scriptures may be appropriate in Iran, but it ain't appropriate here.' </p> <p>But the backroom team in the Gore camp remains solidly behind the injection of religiosity into the campaign. 'Why should religion and morality belong to the Right?', asked one.</p>",
  "<p>As the French fishermen's blockade last week left returning British holidaymakers and frustrated lorry drivers with only cheap booze and hypermarch\u00e9s for comfort, the strength of France's fuel price revolt was a stark contrast to the damp squib of the UK's 'dump the pump' campaign. </p> <p>The deal struck with the fishermen - involving reducing social charges and waiving port fees - was really the only positive action the French government could take because its already very low taxes on fuel for fishing boats meant the price was inevitably going to shadow the recent surge in oil prices. In the US, too, the price of gasoline has turned into a hot potato during the final weeks of the presidential election campaign. </p> <p>In the UK, of course, the large tax margin on fuels leaves prices more sheltered from the recent trebling in crude oil costs. But things may get worse before they get any better. </p> <p>Despite stalking the world economy for the past year, the rising price of oil has only now begun to hit home politically, partly because of public restlessness, but also global fears of inflation and recession. Although in the past 18 months the price of a barrel of crude oil has trebled, many analysts thought it had peaked. However, a confluence of political, seasonal, and oil market factors has reinforced this high price and the risks are that it might climb higher still. US oil prices crept above $33 last week and Goldman Sachs suggests it could even hit $50. </p> <p>Unsurprisingly, President Clinton has fired off letters and next week meets Saudi Arabian leaders to encourage them to increase oil production, which will reduce prices. </p> <p>And last week's hand-holding session with President Olusegun Obasanjo of Nigeria appears less peculiar given that the West African country exports around 2 million barrels per day of the high grade 'sweet' oil in demand for compliance with environmental regulations. </p> <p>Last week, the European Central Bank cited oil prices as a strong factor in its decision to raise interest rates. The European Commission announced it would be reviewing the possible economic impact of high prices and has already expressed concern. </p> <p>Just as industrialised nations were busy toasting a future of knowledge economies and network societies, it appears an old foe threatens to gatecrash the new economy party. And it may be the most disruptive of unwanted guests. </p> <p>Last week's price highs followed mixed news from Saudi Arabia, whose wells are running 2 million barrels per day (bpd) below capacity. Analysts had expected the details of a deal to increase Saudi production. All they got was a vague statement about working on a deal to up output with fellow members of Opec (the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries). </p> <p>'Opec are the managers of the oil surplus; the essential truth is that they didn't manage it well,' says Leo Drollas, deputy director and chief economist at the Centre for Global Energy Studies. </p> <p>The cartel is at the heart of cuts in the production of oil of about 2.6 million bpd. On three occasions since 1998 Opec members have worked in concert to lift prices from record lows of below $10. The final cut in March 1999 was the largest and sent prices on their upward spiral. Dwindling inventories in the US and Europe, the approaching winter, and the return of 'oil diplomacy' have contributed to Western fears that there will be no respite in the medium term. </p> <p>Refineries in the US are working flat out and yet 'inventories are standing 8 per cent below last year's levels, which were deemed worrying. </p> <p>'It's far from comfortable,' says Stephen Lewis, an economist at Monument Derivatives. </p> <p>Measures of an equivalent shortage in Europe are difficult to assess, but the fact that tankers are being diverted from the US to Europe is an indication of the tightness of the market. </p> <p>Some industry analysts have claimed that inventories have been reduced voluntarily, a response to internet technologies allowing 'just in time' deliveries to forecourts. 'The gasoline shortages seen earlier in the year [in the US] don't bear this out,' says Lewis. </p> <p>Low inventories in the US coincide with changing pressures upon Saudi Arabia, the one country with sufficient spare capacity to bring the price down, and a traditional American ally. But, says Drollas, 'the Saudis say they can't sell their oil when it is put to market so the high prices are due to greedy market speculators'. </p> <p>Patterns of trade indicate that extra barrels of oil are going east to Japan and Singapore rather than west to where the shortage is most acute. It may reflect the better price paid in Asia-Pacific, and a trebling of tanker costs that has effectively added $2 to the cost of a barrel from the Middle East. </p> <p>It is also the case that Saudi Light oil may not be exactly what the US market is after. It requires refining, but US refineries have been running at full steam, and are scheduled for a maintenance break in October. In this context, the reasons for Clinton's recent wooing of Nigeria and offer of oil industry experts becomes clear. </p> <p>Saudi Arabia is under pressure internally from hawks looking at high oil prices as a means to bring down spiralling government debt, and interna tionally from the return of Seventies-style Opec oil diplomacy instigated by the Venezuelan President, Hugo Chavez. </p> <p>Chavez, a populist strongman, is demanding that rich nations pay a fair price for this 'rare' resource. Last month he toured Opec member countries, including Iraq and Libya, to drum up support for maintaining high prices. </p> <p>'Chavez is harking back to the old Opec line, the principle of its establishment - that the West should pay more for its oil,' says Drollas. '[But] Venezuela couldn't gain from increases in output because it has no excess capacity.' </p> <p>Oil drilling in the South American country requires considerable investment, which was not forthcoming while prices were in the doldrums. Thus Venezuela, along with all other Opec members - excepting Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates - has everything to gain from sustaining prices at the current level. And the need to maintain Opec unity is vital to the Saudis in the run-up to the showpiece fortieth birthday heads-of-state meeting in Caracas at the end of this month. </p> <p>In March 2000, Ali Rodriguez, the Venezuelan oil minister and president of Opec, proposed a price trading band of between $22 and $28. A move above this band for more than 20 days would trigger an automatic increase in production of 0.5 million bpd. </p> <p>The mechanism had calmed markets, but the details were left vague; despite qualifying conditions being easily met, no output increase has occurred, and any decision has been deferred to the Opec ministerial meeting in Vienna next Sunday. Drollas says: 'I see the price staying at this level for a few more months. Any Saudi production increase will take time to come through'. </p> <p>Lewis sees the price increasing further. 'I can't see Opec coming up with measures that will affect the supply shortage in the US, and there's even more of a shortage in Europe. Forty dollars a barrel cannot be ruled out.' </p> <p>Opec rhetoric is hardening, and Chavez revels in his role as the populist hardman standing up for the rights of developing countries. But he knows Opec has to maintain a price balance. Push it much higher and it will drive consumer nations to seek alternative energy sources much more seriously, and open up the possibility of a self- imposed reduction in their consumption, which would see prices fall for good. </p> <p>On the other hand it is clear that members cannot countenance a production increase that will lead to prices tumbling - and it is hard to predict how the market will react to any given upping of output. In the meantime not all G7 economies are entirely unhappy at the upward price trend. </p> <p>The UK is oil self-sufficient so will see no adverse effect on the balance of payments, and, following cautious budgetary accounting on oil prices, the Treasury will land a windfall of some \u00a33 billion - enough to knock a penny off income tax for a year. An enticing prospect for any government approaching an election.</p>"

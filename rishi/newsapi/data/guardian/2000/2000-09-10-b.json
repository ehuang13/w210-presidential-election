  "Al Gore is walking tall into the final eight weeks of the US presidential election safe in the knowledge that America's women are solidly behind him. According to a new poll, the race between Gore and George W. Bush is now polarised along classic lines with men supporting Bush 52 per cent to 38 per cent, while women support Gore by an identical margin. <p>Gore's lead among women is a remarkable turnaround, that has helped place him neck and neck with Bush in the race for the White House. It appears to owe much to the single most powerful image of the campaign so far - that of his 4-second 'lip-lock' with wife Tipper at the Democratic Convention last month. That kiss, described by many commentators as embarrassingly sustained, signalled the retirement of Al Gore, the staid, overly-serious Washington insider and the emergence of the new Al - a passionate family man with the interests of all women at heart. </p> <p>The election itself may now turn on The Kiss. Not only did it signal a man committed to family values without overtones of religious stridency but it helped to distance Gore from the less familial pursuits of his boss, Bill Clinton. </p> <p>And underlying the imagery, of course, is strategy . Until the convention, Gore was struggling to personify issues close to women whose votes will be critical in November. </p> <p>That has now changed. Gore, buffed up and tanned instead of waxy, has emerged more comfortable in his new role as 'political winner'. He has not only closed the 'character gap' but is credited in polls for running a cleaner campaign while Bush, who earlier in the race was comfortably ahead with women, is struggling to appeal to this key constituency with his education and health policies. </p> <p>Last week Bush unleashed a series of tougher TV ads, and swapped his wilting campaign slogan 'A Reformer with Results' for the pithier 'Real Plans for Real People'. Bush too has assumed the mantle Al Gore once called his own. This time last year, at Hallowe'en, Al dressed up as The Underdog for the costume party he and Tipper traditionally throw in Washington. It's a costume George W. has decided is rightfully his. 'I am the underdog - I sure am,' he said last Thursday. 'But I was underdog when I first started. Nothing's changed about underdog status.' It was a statement that could barely conceal its pretence - as one designed to appeal to women. </p> <p>But some observers suggest that despite his firm appeal to women in Texas (he received 67 per cent of their vote when he last ran for governor), the macho image of that state does not play well with women elsewhere. Bush strategist Ray Sullivan counters: 'He has been reaching out to female voters from the start. Gore managed to bring them back into his fold at the convention but the governor will continue to talk about issues important to women.' </p> <p>New polls show that the contenders are locked in a dead heat at 47 per cent each. Of greatest concern to Bush is that the loss of his lead over Gore - as much as 8 per cent in July and into double digits between the conventions - may not be a capricious reaction to his recent gaffes but instead reflects a hardening attitude against him. </p> <p>Only twice since World War Two has the race been tied at this stage: in 1960 between Kennedy and Nixon, and between Carter and Reagan in 1980. But it is Gore's ability to tune into the interests of women that stands as his most radical transformation. Earlier this year he was widely ridiculed for hiring feminist advocate of female sexual power Naomi Wolf to help him become an 'alpha male', a Darwinian role his boss, Bill Clinton, had no trouble assuming even to his political detriment. </p> <p>At the time, the hiring smacked of desperation but nevertheless established Al and Tipper's 27-year-old daughter, Karenna Gore Schiff, as his most important adviser and cheerleader. It is said that while Tipper does not like politics, Karenna is fixated on strategy and tactics. </p> <p>It is Karenna, with blonde good-looks and winning smile who has taken on the public role of humanising her father, encouraging him to offset his intellectualism with displays of emotion. She is an expert at casting a new spin on his political vulnerabilities and has been described by Gore as having 'nearly perfect pitch' when it comes to political advice. Officially, she runs the youth wing of his campaign, Gorenet, but unofficially has her fingerprints all over his campaign and is credited with encouraging him to move his campaign HQ to Tennessee, a move designed to distance Gore from the image of being the political incumbent. </p> <p>Gore-Schiff has also encouraged him to talk about his family life. Last week at a rally in New Orleans, Gore welcomed Dr David Kline, the neurosurgeon who had operated on Gore's son Albert Gore III in 1989 after he was hit by a car in Baltimore and severely injured, and thanked him profusely. </p> <p>Finally it is, perhaps, Tipper who may emerge as Gore's most powerful asset. Her well chronicled weight problems and her bouts of depression make her seem more real with American women than any recent First Ladies. Her lack of overt political aspirations or policy agendas for the White House are also in stark contrast with Hillary Clinton. Tipper's winning move, however, has been to show the women of America that she has achieved one ambition they all share - to keep her husband enchanted after 30 years of marriage.</p>"

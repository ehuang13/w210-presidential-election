  "Today America will begin to say farewell. It will be a long goodbye, one that fits the outsized character of the man. For the United States has three months to let go of a leader who has, by turns, enthralled, appalled and seduced them for eight compelling years. Bill Clinton won't officially become the ex-president till a minute past noon on January 20 2001, but by late tonight he will be yesterday's man. He will lose his throne, either to his appointed heir or to the son of the king he slayed to get there. One of them will be the president-elect and, in a heartbeat, Clinton will slip from emblem of America's present to holdover from America's past. <p>His fellow Americans will miss him - more, perhaps, than they realise. They'll miss the two terms of peace and record prosperity, of course, but they might even miss the psychodrama: an eight-year rollercoaster ride so turbulent that those who followed it become queasy at the recollection. They'll miss the daily triumphs and disasters of a character of Shakespearean complexity, a president who stirred in the American people passions of love and hatred unseen since the days of John F Kennedy and Richard Nixon - and almost never aroused by a single man. Above all, they will miss his signature feature, one which may well have redefined the presidency itself: an almost eerie gift for empathy. </p> <p>I will miss him, too. For the years of Clinton's American journey matched my own. I first came to live and work in the country in 1992, just as he exploded on to the national scene. I watched him run for president, and stayed to see him do the job. From then on, and for several years, I either watched, read or wrote about Clinton nearly every day. Just as future TV documentary makers keen to evoke the 1990s will flash up an image of the president, I suspect that, when I look back on my late 20s or early 30s, I will do the same. And tonight that era will come to a close. </p> <p>The memories come so fast that it's not easy to separate them. That 1992 election alone was so chock-full of scandal and turnarounds, such a vintage campaign, that it's hard to forget any of it - whether it was Gennifer with a G, the Vietnam draft-dodging letter, written by Clinton while a student at Oxford, or Hillary on 60 Minutes insisting she had been no Tammy Wynette standing by her man, and that if you didn't like her husband, then, \"Heck, don't vote for him.\" </p> <p>It was a crazy year, but it was that Clinton gift for empathy which saw him through. I had heard about it before - Republicans had already ridiculed the Arkansas governor's tendency to begin sentences with \"I feel\" rather than \"I think\", a habit that reached its apotheosis in the legendary \"I feel your pain.\" But there was no substitute for seeing it in action. </p> <p>Of course there were the moments widely witnessed, such as those few seconds during one of the televised debates, when the candidates were asked how the recession had affected them personally. Clinton turned the query around, asking the questioner how she had suffered. Meanwhile, his opponent, George Bush Snr, was caught on camera checking his watch. </p> <p>But there were also the tiny episodes, too small to be reported in their own right, which offered a glimpse of Clinton's sheer talent for people. It's perhaps hard, after this year's lacklustre contest, to imagine the excitement Clinton generated that autumn. \"The failed governor of a small southern state,\" the Republicans had called him. But the voters didn't see it that way. I remember two moments from a Clinton-Gore bus tour through the American heartland. It was a swing through southern Georgia and the buzz was palpable. People didn't just attend rallies, they lined the highways in crowds to catch a glimpse of the man who would be president. Some held banners urging the young governor with the gargantuan appetite (he can eat a whole apple in a single bite) to stop awhile and sample the local peaches or peanuts - and he always did. </p> <p>His aides would get enraged, every stop delaying the tour by a few more crucial minutes. By the end of a campaign day, Clinton would be running four or five hours late, but it didn't matter. In the town square at Valdosta a crowd that had gathered for a 9pm rally waited till 2am. Under floodlights on that September night, they cheered themselves hoarse. </p> <p>Earlier that day, we'd been in a small town called Tifton. Clinton had delivered the usual stump speech, his throat sore, when it began to pour with rain. The reporters ran for cover, inside a makeshift press room where there was the usual supply of chicken drumsticks and Diet Coke. Eventually an Israeli journalist tapped me on the shoulder. \"Come outside,\" he said. \"Look at this.\" </p> <p>The candidate was still out there, shaking the hands of fewer than a dozen elderly voters who had stayed out in the rain. He was talking to each one - not just a \"Hi, how are you,\" but a proper conversation - as the rain streamed down his face and theirs. His aides were urging him to hurry out, desperate to whisk him on to the bus and into a new shirt. This was not a pose to show how much he cared about ordinary people: there was not a single camera to record it. Besides me and the Israeli, no one saw it. But Clinton did it all the same. </p> <p>Who knows why? Maybe the legend was right: maybe Clinton believed that so long as he met every single voter in America, they would all vote for him. Maybe his childhood (widowed mother, alcoholic stepfather) had left him with a near-addictive need for human contact, affection and adulation. Maybe he just cared. </p> <p>Either way, it worked and worked. The crowds got bigger, his voice got hoarser and the empathy gift won that election. I returned to London determined to get work in America that would let me see the next chapter of the story: how Clinton the candidate would become Clinton the president. </p> <p>The transition was not easy. A dozen books have recounted the political errors of those first months. Day one saw a promise to let gays into the military, a move which only confirmed the brass's worst suspicions about the new, draft-dodging commander-in-chief. Later Hillary Clinton took control of healthcare reform - a move that would bring the administration's greatest defeat. The first lady presented Congress with an almost comically complicated blueprint for a new system: expressed as a diagram, it looked like a circuit-board for the space shuttle. The fact that the plan had been hatched by a taskforce of wonks meeting with Hillary in secret added to its Soviet-era aura. By 1994 the plan was dead, and the Clinton administration badly wounded. </p> <p> Things were no easier for the president himself. The Washington establishment was not sure what to make of this brash southern newcomer. They were both excited by and disdainful of him. They sniffed at the Arkansans who piled into town, supporting their beloved Razorbacks football team with the uncouth chant \"Oooo pig soo-eeee!\" For the Washington elite, Clinton and his friends were hicks, plain and simple. </p> <p>The greybeards also disdained his way of doing business. They heard that the president would have long \"bull sessions\" more akin to the college seminar room than the Oval Office. They saw the pizza delivery bikes skidding up to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, as the young, novice staff worked through the night. While Bush had been a grown-up, Clinton's White House seemed to lack adult supervision. </p> <p>The word of the hour back then was \"unpresidential\". The Washington snobs disliked Clinton's habit of answering reporters' questions while still out of breath, pale thighs wobbling. They winced when he answered an MTV inquiry about his taste in underwear: \"Boxers or briefs?\" </p> <p>What the scolds did not realise was that all this \"unpresidential\" behaviour was connected to the president's greatest strength: his common touch. He was comfortable with people. So when a little girl, invited to the Oval Office to take part in a candle-lighting ceremony to mark the Jewish festival of Chanukah, yelped as her hair caught fire, guess who put out the flames and calmed her nerves? Not an aide, but the prez himself. </p> <p>Clinton was like that Star Trek character, the empath, who can psychically read the emotions of those before him; he had a mind-reader's ability to see into the hearts of any individual or group he faced. </p> <p>I saw the trick at work in Baltimore, when the president was out selling his healthcare package. He was addressing an outdoor crowd of thousands of hospital staff. I was standing among a group of nurses, who began chatting and whispering. Their minds were wandering. Somehow, from faraway, Clinton sensed it. He suddenly declared that his plan really mattered, that it would affect all of them, nurses especially - and that they all had to listen up. The women around me hushed. </p> <p>The gift did not save him from the failure of the healthcare programme, a defeat that was endorsed by 1994's mid-term elections, which the Republicans won by a landslide. Overnight Newt Gingrich became the hottest politician in America, cheerily explaining that he would be prime minister to Clinton's now largely ceremonial president. Soon Clinton was forced to tell a press conference why he and his office were still \"relevant\". </p> <p>But the mood changed. On April 19 1995 a right-wing extremist detonated a bomb at a government building in Oklahoma City, leaving 168 dead. Suddenly the anti-government bile of Gingrich's revolutionaries left a much harsher taste in the mouth: America had seen where such talk could lead. </p> <p>Clinton stepped forward as the calmer voice, leading the Oklahoma families in mourning. Perhaps for the first time, he looked presidential - a father of the nation at a moment of crisis. Just then, America needed a leader who would feel their pain. </p> <p>In fact, though no official would ever say it out loud, mourning worked well for Clinton: he gave good funeral. He knew how to touch just the right nerve. I remember a ceremony at Arlington National Cemetery, dedicating a memorial to those who had died in the Lockerbie bombing. He spoke well, as always, but it was afterwards that he came into his own. A huddle of relatives gathered around him. He spoke to each of them, but then he extended his big hands to reach the ones who had not pressed forward, the ones too shy to approach the president themselves. He encouraged them and beckoned them closer, his eyes finding the hesitant widow or retiring father who was holding back. Again, I looked around: no cameras. The TV crews had already got their pictures; Clinton was not doing it for appearances' sake. He stayed there a full hour over schedule, maddening his handlers and listening to the stories of bereaved loved ones - and not a word was ever written about it. </p> <p>This talent or knack or psychosis - whatever it was, it secured Clinton's position as president. Groups who had once been suspicious began to like and eventually adore him. </p> <p>Take black Americans. In 1992 they had big doubts about Clinton. He was a white politician from the deep south, a Democrat who had signalled his \"centrist\" credentials by attacking black rapper Sister Souljah and by breaking off from the campaign to return to his home state - to order the execution of a retarded black man convicted of murder. </p> <p> Yet within a few years Clinton would be hailed by Toni Morrison, the African-American Nobel laureate, as \"our first black president\" and by the rapper Ice-T as \"a brother\". What had changed? Clinton had saved affirmative action from the Republican axe, but he'd also signed a welfare reform bill which hit black families hard. No, it wasn't policy which sealed the bond between Clinton and black America. It was a more subtle connection. The president displayed a comfort with black audiences that was unheard of among white politicians. He could deliver an impromptu speech-cum-sermon from the pulpit of a black church that had civil rights activists admitting they had heard nothing so inspiring since the days of Martin Luther King. The result is a white president who enjoys 95% approval ratings among African-Americans to this very day. </p> <p>Jewish voters tell a similar story. They were wary of a southern baptist Democrat in 1992: they feared he might be another Jimmy Carter, too sympathetic to the Palestinians. But Clinton reassured them, using his secret weapon: emotional intelligence. It was his instinct and body language that led to that 1993 handshake on the White House lawn between the PLO's Yasser Arafat and Israel's Yitzhak Rabin. And when Rabin was assassinated two years later, it was Clinton who knew how to massage Israel's wounded spirit. He spoke to them, via TV, in their own language, addressing the dead Rabin with the words \"Shalom chaver\" - goodbye friend. The phrase had not existed in Hebrew before then; now it's common Israeli parlance. And so, in 1996, Jewish Americans turned out - alongside blacks and women and Hispanics and trade unions and every other group who felt understood by Clinton - to give him four more years. </p> <p>I took that as my cue to head back to Britain. I reckoned we'd seen the best of Clinton. The second term would be more of the same, only less so. And for the first year, 1997, I seemed to be vindicated: the economy prospered on auto-pilot and Clinton barely had to break a sweat. But in the first weeks of 1998 the sky fell in. The allegations of a dress-staining affair with a White House intern, Monica Lewinsky, the finger-wagging denial, the talk of perjury and impeachment - it all came so fast. The Washington punditocracy predicted that the Arkansas hick would be sent back to Little Rock by the end of the week. But they forgot who they were dealing with. Clinton was not just the Comeback Kid, the Houdini who had survived a thousand scrapes. He was also the empath-in-chief, and now he got the return on his investment: the American people empathised back. </p> <p>They had already forgiven or ignored the waves of scandal that had broken with every season of the first term: Whitewater, Travelgate, Filegate and all the other gates never really swung. The American people apparently felt the same way about the president as a former Arkansas state senator I once interviewed. He had worked with the then governor throughout the 1980s and had little sympathy for him politically. But he was adamant: \"Bill Clinton doesn't give duck crap about money.\" Americans could see that for themselves: they had a president who had never owned his own house (he had lived in the Arkansas governor's mansion since he was 32, moving from there directly to the White House). He may have been a shameless hustler after votes, but few voters believed Clinton was ever in the business of lining his own pockets. That's why all the stuff about Whitewater never stuck. </p> <p>Zippergate was different: Clinton may not have lusted after cash, but Americans knew he lusted after flesh. They knew, too, that he had an indisciplined, selfish, self-indulgent streak. They knew he could be reckless and self-destructive, taking a risk he must have known could have ended his presidency. </p> <p>But here's where empathy became a two-way street. Despite a year-long hammering from the Republicans, and a press united in its disgust for the president's actions, the public stood by him. Americans told pollsters they hated what Clinton had done but, from the first revelations in January 1998 to the senate trial a year later, they remained consistent, approving his performance as president and insisting that he should not be removed from office. </p> <p>They understood him, just as he had understood them. He had always seemed to cut them a little slack, and now they returned the compliment. In the autumn of 1998 they watched the tapes of a beleaguered president assaulted by excruciatingly personal questions from Kenneth Starr's prosecutors - grainy footage with the visual grammar of a hostage video - and they sided with him. Just like Hillary, they stood by their man. </p> <p>Once, when speaking about his faith, Clinton described the God he believed in as \"the God of second chances\" - and he let out a little smile. That was the Clinton of early 1999: a lucky man, blessed with forgiveness. </p> <p>In the end, he was less Houdini than Rasputin. The Republicans tried and tried to kill him, but they failed, destroying themselves in the attempt. Where are his enemies now? Gingrich was forced out of the Speaker's chair after the impeachment debacle, so was his successor. The rest of the president's persecutors in the House are in tight congressional races today, desperate just to hold on to their seats. </p> <p>And as for Clinton, this is his last day in total command. I can look back now on the last eight years and admit that we, those of us who covered him, were spoiled. We saw a president with towering political skills and a serious intellect - a man who could rattle off the fine-print detail of any policy programme anywhere in America and discuss the domestic politics of most countries in the world, a leader who would think nothing of calling up the great academics and writers of the day, often in the small hours, for a late-night, unarranged t\u00e9-te-\u00e0-t\u00e9te. </p> <p>And there was that gift for people. I admit it, it spoiled me - it even skewed my judgment. I came back from America to cover Britain's 1997 election, and was soon whispering to friends my anxiety that Tony Blair's success was far from assured: he got such little enthusiasm from the crowds. I'd got used to winning candidates getting a Clinton-sized response. Now I can see that I had witnessed a once-in-a-lifetime phenomenon. Like someone who heard Sinatra sing in the 1950s or watched John McEnroe play tennis in the 1980s, I had seen a maestro at the height of his powers. Clinton was the Pele of politics, and we might wait half a century to see his like again. </p> <p>Today America is choosing between two half-Clintons. They can have a version of his smarts, in Al Gore, or a version of his warmth, in George W Bush. Clinton wants the voters to choose Gore, of course, to protect his legacy. But if America picks Bush, that will be a kind of compliment, too. For it will prove that an ability to connect, which Bush has and Gore does not, is now an indispensable part of the job - thanks to Clinton, the king of empathy. </p> <p>Smarts or warmth, one or the other is on offer today. Voters who want both will just have to wait. Or they can take one last look at the man from Hope - and remember.</p>",
  "The US president, Bill Clinton, said today that the arrival of election day may have made him wistful, but it did not make him a \"lame duck\" president. <p>\"I've got another 10 weeks to quack,\" he said, as the political stars of his wife and his vice president threatened to eclipse his. </p> <p>Asked if he would seek office again, Mr Clinton said, \"I don't think I'm going to be running for anything. I'm just going to try to be a good citizen.\" </p> <p>He added: \"I am going to be happy doing whatever I do. I've had a great life. I've been very lucky.\" </p> <p>Mr Clinton flew to New York yesterday night and was among the first voters with his wife, Hillary, and daughter, Chelsea. </p> <p>He said he would begin calling radio stations in hotly contested states sometime after dawn to encourage people to vote, but beyond that, his election day schedule was rather loose.</p> <p>Mr Clinton predicted Al Gore would win the presidential election and the first lady would become the next junior senator from New York, provided that minorities, immigrants and the working poor vote \"in the same percentage they are in the population.\" </p> <p>\"I've just got a good feeling,\" Mr Clinton said about Mr Gore's chances. \"I think he's run a good campaign. I think he's really been good out there the last couple of weeks ... I think he's really been in gear and you also see a lot of our people getting energised.\" </p> <p>As for his own sentiments about not being on the ballot, Mr Clinton said he was a little sad but had come to accept it. \"I've had my time, and it was a good time,\" he said. \"I've loved it.\" </p> <p>He pledged to \"manage the transition well\" for whoever wins the election, but doesn't plan to go gently into being a \"lame-duck\" president.</p> <p>He said he would focus on pursuing peace in the Middle East and improving relations with North Korea. He said he would work on several legislative matters still pending before Congress - an agenda that would keep him busy until he leaves office on January 19 2001.</p> <p>\"Some people thought I was a lame duck in '95,\" Mr Clinton said. \"I'll just keep quacking. I've got another 10 weeks to quack.\" </p> <p>Mr Clinton told reporters he was basing his prediction of a Gore victory on the fact that many Americans are satisfied with the current economic prosperity and would want a steward who would stick closest to the strategy that built that success. </p> <p>\"There is a feeling in the country, that I pick up, that people want to keep the prosperity going. They want to keep moving in a good direction, and I think that rebounds to his favour,\" Mr Clinton said of Mr Gore. </p> <p>\"He's gone out there and made his case to the American people, laid out a program that's different and new, and ... I think he's got a chance to do real well.\" </p> <p>Of the election in general, he disputed assertions that his absence from the campaign trail has hurt Mr Gore. \"I think that's overrated,\" he said. </p> <p>\"The fact that I was out there hard this weekend, and that many of you reported ... the substance of what I was saying, it really didn't matter where I was.\"</p> <p><br><b>Related stories</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/comment/\">Comment: Liberals torn over Nader</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/columnists/\">Columnists: Missing Bill already</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/US_election_race/Story/0,2763,393871,00.html\">Election day</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/US_election_race/graphic/0,5543,393512,00.html\">Map</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/US_election_race/Story/0,2763,394030,00.html\">What the US papers say</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/US_election_race/Story/0,2763,393898,00.html\"> Explainer: How does America choose their next president?</a><br><a href=\"http://talk.guardianunlimited.co.uk/WebX?13@@.ee7931a\">Talk about it</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/US_election_race/Story/0,2763,376827,00.html\">Who would you vote for?</a><br><br><b>Useful links</b><br><a href=\"http://www.algore2000.com/\">Official site: Al Gore 2000</a><br><a href=\"  http://www.bush2000.com/\">Official site: George W Bush 2000</a><br><a href=\"  http://www.votenader.com/\">Official site: Ralph Nader 2000 <br></a><a href=\"http://www.fearthis.com/\">Site of the day - fearthis.com</a><br><a href=\"       http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/US_election_race/Story/0,2763,381260,00.html\">US election links</a><br><a href=\"http://www.hillary2000.org\"> Official site: Hilary Clinton 2000</a></p>",

  "The polling stations have opened on the east coast of the US for today's presidential election that is still too close to call after the tightest race in 40 years. <p>Exhausted by the effort, the candidates, Democrat Al Gore and Republican George W Bush, have now surrendered their fate to the voters. </p> <p>Mr Bush, the governor of Texas and son of former president George Bush, is topping most of the polls, but the outcome is uncertain.</p> <p>Mr Gore, who has been the US vice-president for eight years, put in a final push of campaigning in Florida, a key state to win.</p> <p>The earliest results are already in from the two New Hampshire towns where votes are traditionally first posted. </p> <p>In Dixville Notch, the result was Bush, 21, Gore 5, and the green candidate, Ralph Nader, 1. In nearby Hart's Location, it was Bush 17 and Gore 13, with one vote for a write-in candidate. </p> <p>\"It's not close here, but I believe it will be close in New Hampshire and across the country,\" said Stephen Barba, a Dixville Notch voter. </p> <p>Mr Bush will cast his ballot in Austin, Texas, and has been making calls to west coast radio stations to urge voters to turn out. He also was calling voters in Michigan, Oregon, Florida, Iowa and Wisconsin. </p> <p>After his pre-dawn campaigning in Florida, Mr Gore was voting in Carthage, Tennessee. </p> <p>Voters were choosing between Mr Bush's promise to be a \"uniter not a divider\" and Mr Gore's assertion that he alone has the experience to \"fight for you and win.\" A new Congress was also being decided at the polls. </p> <p>Before that election day ritual in New Hampshire, the candidates had barnstormed the country one last time. </p> <p>Mr Bush hit four states - Tennessee, Wisconsin, Iowa and Arkansas - that voted for Bill Clinton and Mr Gore in 1992 and 1996, but which polls suggest could go Republican. </p> <p>\"If people do what I think they're going to do, you're looking at the next president of the United States,\" the Texas governor told an audience of several hundred supporters after returning to Austin.</p> <p>For his part, Mr Gore engaged in a marathon 30-hour campaigning flurry through crucial Iowa, Missouri, Michigan and Florida. In Florida, he said that the crowd of tens of thousands who greeted him in Miami's fashionable South Beach left him with \"no doubt whatsoever\" he'd finish the day as president-elect. </p> <p>\"Americans are coming together and making a very powerful decision that we are not going to allow ourselves to go back to the policies of the past,\" Mr Gore told the crowd. \"We're going forward with the policies of the future - a bright future that includes all Americans.\" </p> <p>A cast of stars - Glenn Close, Robert De Niro, Stevie Wonder, Billy Dee Williams, Ben Affleck - were there to boost his final campaigning. </p> <p>From Miami, Mr Gore headed to a decidedly more sombre event, holding a pre-dawn meeting with nurses at a Tampa cancer centre, where he sat around a table and talked health care. </p> <p>Mr Gore also was rallying workers on their way to \"get out the vote\" before heading home to cast his own vote at a small school in Carthage. </p> <p>Behind Mr Gore and Mr Bush was the most expensive election in history - $3bn (\u00a32bn) on presidential and congressional races, about $30 for every vote cast - but one that failed to stir much excitement. </p> <p>President Bill Clinton predicted that Mr Gore will emerge victorious on the strength of the economy and a hoped-for large turnout among black people, Latin Americans, immigrants and the working poor. </p> <p>\"He's run a good campaign on his own,\" Mr Clinton said, before taking off from Washington bound for his new home in Chappaqua, New York, where he planned to vote. \"Especially the last couple of weeks, I think he's really been in gear and you also see a lot of our people getting energised.

  "There are two universal threads running through the mass of election coverage: the frantic, frenzied nature of the campaign's final 24 hours, and the utter impossibility of predicting the outcome. <p>As the campaign dust finally settles and Americans set about choosing their new leaders, some of the papers are casting around for entertaining sidebar stories.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/\" target=\"_new\">Los Angeles Times</a>, for example, is already looking ahead to how ex-president Clinton will be filling his time. Apparently he has no shortage of plans.</p> <p>\"... Clinton, while vowing not to tread on official toes - especially if his vice president, Democrat Al Gore, wins the presidency - is thinking on a scale that dwarfs [Jimmy] Carter, or even the elder statesman gambits of Richard Nixon.</p> <p>\"Clinton sounds like a man determined to raise more money, talk with more world leaders and generally plunge deeper into the public fray than any of his modern-day predecessors.</p> <p>\"From education and health care reform to bringing peace to Northern Ireland and the Middle East, Clinton envisions playing a high-profile role that will cheer his admirers and keep his enemies gnashing their teeth for years to come.\"</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.chicagotribune.com/\" target=\"_new\">Chicago Tribune</a> delves into its Illinois hinterland to come up with a delicious little piece about the neighbouring hamlets of Bush and Goreville:</p> <p>\"With town names like these, Bush (pop. 351) and Goreville (pop. 872), might have provided a photo opportunity along the presidential campaign trail for Texas Gov George W Bush and vice president Al Gore.</p> <p>\"Trouble is, the towns'loyalties don' live up to their names. There are precious few Gore supporters in Goreville, and even fewer Bush supporters in Bush.</p> <p>\"Of course, in Bush - where a weed-choked, long-abandoned high school recalls better days - there aren't many people to begin with.\"</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.sfgate.com/chronicle/\" target=\"_new\">San Francisco Chronicle</a>, which backs Gore, presents the closing hours of the campaign as a last-minute dash for the winning tape, with both candidates desperately seeking last minute momentum.</p> <p>\"The airwaves were a blizzard of campaign advertising, with an advantage to Bush. From the start of his run through mid-October, the Texas governor had spent $138 million, including $56 million on radio and TV ads, according to the Campaign Study Group.</p> <p>\"Gore was at $94 million overall, including $41.5 million for broadcast ads.\"</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.herald.com/\" target=\"_new\">Miami Herald</a> looks at another modern campaigning tool: the pre-recorded telephone message.</p> <p>\"Tens of thousands of such messages, recorded by candidates and their celebrity supporters, have hit answering machines across the nation.</p> <p>\"Some voters, like Jason Cottrell, are unimpressed: 'If I got a call from a real person, I would talk to them,' said Cottrell, who also received recordings from gun control advocate Sarah Brady for Gore and former presidential candidate John McCain for Bush.

  "Al Gore was closing the gap on George W Bush as Americans prepared to go to the polls today to elect a successor to Bill Clinton in one of the closest-fought presidential election campaigns in US history. <p>The final daily tracking polls of the campaign showed Mr Gore, the Democrat, narrowing the long-standing lead of his Republican rival to well within the statistical margin of error.</p> <p>One poll even gave Mr Gore a 2% lead on the back of a strong 48 hours of polling.</p> <p>In the final Gallup tracking survey of the campaign, Mr Bush led by 47% to Mr Gore's 45%, compared with a 48%-43% lead at the weekend. In the final Zogby International tracking poll, Mr Bush led by just one point, 47% to 46%. A late tracking poll by Reuters/MSNBC put Mr Gore in the lead at 48% to 46%.</p> <p>Further evidence of a neck- and-neck finish came last night in a Harris poll based on an unusually large sample, which showed Mr Bush leading 47%-46% in the popular vote, but projected Mr Gore as the next president by virtue of a 286-241 victory in the electoral college, with Washington state's 11 votes too close to call.</p> <p>The Harris poll was based on a sample of 134,000 people and was carried out between October 30 and November 4.</p> <p>It also supported the opinion of some experts that Mr Gore might become the first man since 1888 to be elected president without winning a majority of the popular vote.</p> <p>Oozing confidence, Mr Bush took his campaign deep into opposition territory on the last full day on the stump, campaigning in Mr Clinton's Arkansas and Mr Gore's Tennessee before returning to his home in Austin, Texas.</p> <p>\"We've laid the groundwork for victory. Now it's up to us to get people to the polls,\" Mr Bush told supporters in Orlando, Florida yesterday.</p> <p>Mr Gore campaigned in the key states of Iowa, Missouri, Michigan and Florida, all of which he needs to win if he is to fulfil his dream of succeeding Mr Clinton.</p> <p>\"You are the ones who are going to make the difference in this race,\" Mr Gore told Iowa campaign workers in a pre-dawn briefing. \"That's what's going to win this race.\"</p> <p>A new Gallup poll of independent voters showed a sharp swing from Mr Nader to Mr Gore. Last week, 41% of independent voters said they were backing Mr Bush, 36% Mr Gore and 13% Mr Nader. This week, Mr Gore is on 40% and Mr Nader is on 9%, with Mr Bush unchanged.</p> <p>The crucial black vote is also hardening up for Mr Gore in the final hours, polls said. Mr Gore's support among African American voters has risen from 86% last week to 91% on the eve of poll.</p> <p>\"It's one of many hopeful signs,\" said a member of Gore's team in Nashville yesterday. \"It is expected. It's traditional that third-party support slips at the end of a campaign and the base comes back.\"</p> <p>Mr Bush's camp was just as confident, releasing private poll results which they claimed showed the Republican ahead in Florida and Michigan and neck-and-neck in California.</p> <p>As well as a president, a new House of Representatives was being elected today by American voters, along with 34 members of the US Senate. The first projected results, based on exit polls, will come through after 11pm GMT.</p> <p><br><b>Related stories</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/comment/\">Comment: Liberals torn over Nader</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/columnists/\">Columnists: Missing Bill already</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/US_election_race/Story/0,2763,393871,00.html\">Election day</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/US_election_race/graphic/0,5543,393512,00.html\">Map</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/US_election_race/Story/0,2763,393605,00.html\">What the US papers say</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/US_election_race/Story/0,2763,393898,00.html\"> Explainer: How does America choose their next president?</a><br><a href=\"http://talk.guardianunlimited.co.uk/WebX?13@@.ee7931a\">Talk about it</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/US_election_race/Story/0,2763,376827,00.html\">Who would you vote for?</a><br><br><b>Useful links</b><br><a href=\"http://www.algore2000.com/\">Official site: Al Gore 2000</a><br><a href=\"  http://www.bush2000.com/\">Official site: George W Bush 2000</a><br><a href=\"  http://www.votenader.com/\">Official site: Ralph Nader 2000 <br></a><a href=\"http://www.fearthis.com/\">Site of the day - fearthis.com</a><br><a href=\"       http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/US_election_race/Story/0,2763,381260,00.html\">US election links</a></p>",
  "Al Gore, vice-president since 1993, was born to high office. \"We trained him for it\", his father, also Al Gore and a leading Democrat senator, once said. <p>Educated with the nation's elite in Washington - but brought up outside term-time on the family's farm in Carthage, Tennessee - Gore went to Harvard university at a time when student life was in the throes of '60s counter-culture and protests against the Vietnam war. Unlike Bill Clinton, he did inhale.</p> <p>He also volunteered for the draft to Vietnam in 1970, although both he and his father opposed the war. In south-east Asia, he served as a journalist - though rarely under fire, as rivals have pointed out. </p> <p>On his return he worked as a journalist before standing for - and winning - a seat in the House of Representatives. He made a name as a defender of consumer rights and as something of a moral conservative. He voted against allowing abortion and spoke critically about homosexuality.</p> <p>In 1984 he stepped up his career, entering the senate as one of Tennessee's two representatives. He became fascinated by a string of issues then outside the mainstream, including the environment and information technology.</p> <p>After an unsuccessful bid for the Democratic presidential nomination in 1988, he wrote a best-selling book on environmentalism, Earth in the Balance. The book helped make his name - but also trapped him in the public mind as a politician obsessed with detail, and opposed to much that ordinary Americans hold dear - not least, cheap petrol.</p> <p>Nonetheless, Bill Clinton chose him as his running mate in 1992 and Al Gore was sworn in as vice-president a year later. He has had a big stake in the Clinton presidency, with greater access to power than most of his predecessors. </p> <p>That has brought advantages - but also damaged Gore's reputation, not least his refusal to condemn Bill Clinton after the Lewinsky affair. </p> <p>He also became involved in a scandal over fundraising ahead of Bill Clinton's re-election in 1996: rumours about what exactly went on have never gone away. </p> <p>Politically, Al Gore was a liberal reformer, campaigning against big government and supporting Bill Clinton in his decision to support Republican plans to cut taxes.</p> <p>That upset some traditional Democrats, many of whom backed Bill Bradley for the presidential nomination in primary races earlier this year. Gore won though - and has been neck and neck in the polls with his rival George Bush ever since. </p> <p>Even if he wins, the US will not love him as it has Bill Clinton. Republicans have made hay with Gore's leaden public character, and his boastful claims to have helped \"invent\" the internet.</p> <p> In office, he would have to learn how to speak to the nation in a way it can understand and trust.</p> <p><b>Useful links</b><br> <a href=\" http://www.politics1.com/p2000.htm\" target=\"_new\">Full list of candidates standing for president</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.AlGore2000.com/\" target=\"_new\">Gore 2000: official site</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/WH/EOP/OVP/VP.html\" target=\"_new\">Vice-president Al Gore: White House site</a> <br> <a href=\"http://www.publicintegrity.org/reports/bop2000/gore_index.htm\" target=\"_new\">The buying of the president 2000: Al Gore</a> <br> <a href=\"http://www.democrats.org/index.html\" target=\"_new\">Democratic national committee</a><br><a href=\"http://slate.msn.com/Features/goresr/goresr.asp\" target=\"_new\">Was Albert Gore sr. a crook?

  "<b>Who gets to vote?</b> <br> All US citizens aged over 18 have the right to vote - although this is qualified by a range of conditions, including, in some states, the long-term loss of voting rights by anyone sent to prison (a clause which has disqualified many poor, black citizens in the southern states). Most states allow voters to register to vote until 10 days or so before polling day and in recent years, the process has been simplified. Americans can apply to register online and even when they renew driving licences. <p><b>How does polling day work? </b><br> Again, the rules vary from state to state: but almost everywhere, voting is a different experience from the same process in Britain. For a start, only 1.7% of voters use British-style ballot papers. Traditionally, Americans vote using mechanical levers (a bit like adding up on an old-style cash register). About a fifth of US votes are still cast this way, but computer technology is taking over. Whichever system is used, the votes are counted quickly. Since polling stations close early in the evening, the result is often declared surprisingly early. Adding to the complexity, though, are America's multiple time zones. Exit polls from some eastern states are available before voters have finished choosing candidates in the west. This can have a big impact on the result. </p> <p><b>What happens once the polls have closed? </b><br> The votes are counted and results declared state by state. Most international attention will be on the presidential race, but Americans will also vote on a huge range of other jobs, including some state governors, senators, members of the House of Representatives and local officials such as police chiefs. In some states voters also take part in referenda on contentious local issues. </p> <p><b>But how does the presidential vote work?</b><br> American presidents are not elected directly but through an electoral college. In 48 of the 50 states, the candidate who finishes top collects all of that state's votes in the \"electoral college\" (in the two oddballs, Maine and Nebraska, the candidate who comes second is given one of the college votes as well).</p> <p><b>How is the electoral college organised? </b><br> The college has 538 seats. A candidate needs 270 electoral college votes to win. Roughly, college votes are allocated to states by population. As the largest state, California has 54 votes in the electoral college. New York is second with 33. Seven sparsely populated states, plus the District of Columbia, have three votes each, the minimum allowed. </p> <p><b>Which states will decide the election? </b><br> Mr Gore's hopes now rest absolutely on a victory in Florida, a state with 25 electoral college votes. At one time it seemed likely to go to Mr Bush, but as things have turned out, Mr Gore has been in the lead there in most opinion polls this autumn. </p> <p>The other fiercely fought state is Pennsylvania (23 votes), where the polls now put Mr Gore ahead. He also needs to win in Michigan (18 votes), where the race has been neck-and-neck and the survey results contradictory, and in Wisconsin (11 votes). And he must squeeze Ralph Nader's Green support to take Minnesota (10), Oregon (7) and Washington state (11). </p> <p>The most recent electoral college survey by Reuters showed Mr Gore lagging, with 196 votes solid or leaning his way, against Mr Bush's 209. This leaves 133 in states that are too close to call. </p> <p><b>Could there be an upset?</b><br> Al Gore's Democratic camp hopes to upset the odds by winning the electoral college votes of the handful of key states that are too close to predict. Therefore, Mr Gore may become president even though more people nationwide voted for the Republican Mr Bush. </p> <p>If that were to happen - a Gore win in the electoral college despite a Bush victory in the popular vote - it will be the third time in US electoral history. In 1876, Rutherford Hayes defeated Samuel Tilden this way, and Benjamin Harrison pipped Grover Cleveland in 1888.</p> <p><b>Useful links</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.fec.gov/pages/faqs.htm\" target=\"_new\">Federal Election Commission: questions </a> <br> <a href=\"http://www.algore2000.com/\" target=\"_new\">Al Gore 2000</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.bush2000.com/\" target=\"_new\">George Bush 2000</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/US_election_race/Story/0,2763,393605,00.html\" target=\"_new\">Race too close to call</a><br></p>",
  "In Brooklyn's Crown Heights, Sandra Brathwaite stands at the top of her block and delivers an ethnic inventory. \"That side is all Jewish,\" she says, pointing to the right. \"And this side is black... well a mix of African-American and Caribbean really. But the Jews have started moving over.\" As she continues down Eastern Parkway, her vocal audit keeps pace with her stride. \"This house is black, that house is black, that one is Jewish, the next three are black, the one after that is Jewish... I could go on.\" <p>On one side of the street, the African-American flag flies from the black firefighters hall; on the other, inscriptions on an ambulance and posters on lamp-posts are in Yiddish. Geographically close yet culturally distant, politically united yet mutually antagonistic, once economically interdependent, now socially stratified - the story of the relationship between African-Americans and Jews is long and complex. It is a narrative stretching back through the last century and beyond, which has veered from the inspiring to the horrific. They were once great allies during the civil rights era and within the Democratic party, but more recently have been bitter and sometimes bloody foes. </p> <p>But now black-Jewish relations seem to be entering a more optimistic, if uncertain phase. The nomination of Joseph Lieberman, a Jewish senator from Connecticut, as running mate to the Democratic presidential nominee Al Gore, has proved an unlikely catalyst for a desire on both sides for greater understanding, if not reconciliation. Lieberman's nomination received the warm endorsement of the Reverend Jesse Jackson - once reviled in the Jewish community for referring to New York as \"Heimie town\". Lieberman in turn has extended an olive branch to the leader of the Nation of Islam, Louis Farrakhan - the man who branded Judaism \"a gutter religion\" and called Hitler \"a great man\". Farrakhan looks as though he may accept. \"I would welcome a meeting... it could be a bridge between the black community and the Jewish community,\" he said. </p> <p>There has been as much pragmatism in this as principle. African-Americans are the most loyal constituency the Democrats have. Since the second world war the Democratic party has only once won the presidency - with Lyndon Johnson in 1964 - with a majority of the white vote. One of Lieberman's first visits after being officially nominated this summer was to the Congressional black caucus. </p> <p>Meanwhile, Farrakhan's church is struggling to overcome high-level defections, following accusations of adultery and federal lawsuits alleging sexual harassment. Farrakhan, who is suffering from prostate cancer, is in search of a meaningful legacy. His attempt to cement one earlier this month through the Million Family March failed, thanks to a poor turnout. Reinventing himself as a religious and racial healer rather than an anti-semitic firebreather may be his last hope. </p> <p>Embarking on this new route has not been without its obstacles on both sides. Explaining the rationale behind Lieberman's selection, Harlem's black newspaper, the Amsterdam News, wrote in an editorial: \"The reasoning in the Gore camp went out all over the world to Jews of means: 'You've got to show me the money.' The word went out... that the major protector of Jews in this world, the American government, is now available.\" Meanwhile, two major Jewish lobbying organisations, the Anti-Defamation League and the Republican Jewish Coalition, urged Lieberman to stay away from Farrakhan. </p> <p>One reason for this climate of mistrust and antagonism is economic. Pogroms and poverty sent a large number of Jews to America from eastern Europe at the beginning of the last century; roughly the same time that racism and poverty delivered African-Americans from the south to the north. As is the case in Crown Heights today, they often lived cheek by jowl. With access to mortgages, loans or a decent education denied to most African-Americans and granted to Jews - because they were white - an unequal economic relationship soon developed. </p> <p>James Baldwin, in his essay The Harlem Ghetto, wrote of Jews, particularly Jewish landlords, \"They operate in accordance with the American business tradition of exploiting negroes and they are therefore identified with oppression and are hated for it.\" In short, the standard tension between landlords and tenants or employers and employees took on an ethnic dimension. As Jews advanced economically and moved out of black areas, this particular relationship died, but the prejudice continued. </p> <p>This is reflected in polling data. \"There are certain stereotypes that black Americans are more likely to believe about Jews than white Americans,\" says Tom Smith, a social scientist at the university of Chicago. \"Namely, that Jews are 'unscrupulous in business' and 'mean about money'. In all other aspects they are no more negative than white Americans.\" </p> <p>Nor, some are keen to point out, does the fact that both groups endure discrimination mean that they cannot also inflict it. Jews are still white, and African-Americans are still gentiles; the former can still be racist; the latter can still be anti-semitic. Nowhere was this clearer than in Crown Heights almost 10 years ago, after a Hasidic driver ran over a seven-year-old African American boy and was then attacked by a mob. A Hasidic ambulance arrived first and took care of the driver while the boy and his injured cousin had to wait for a city ambulance. The boy died. Hours later black youths killed a rabbinical student in revenge. Riots ensued. </p> <p>Add an organisation like the Nation of Islam to the mix, says David Bositis, a senior political analyst at the joint centre for political and economic studies in Washington, and the possible points of conflict grow. \"Muslims and Jewish people are at odds. Jews are basically white and the NOI's creed is that the devil created white people. On those grounds alone you wouldn't expect them to get on.\" </p> <p>Bositis believes that to concentrate on Farrakhan's anti-semitism is to misunderstand both his function and his importance. \"He's said a lot of things that are anti-semitic, but the question is, does it represent anything significant about black politics? The answer is no. It may be central to his message but not to his meaning.\" </p> <p>None of this makes solidarity between Jews and African-Americans impossible. Far from it. Jews were overrepresented in the struggle for civil rights, partly because they had a keen sense of what it meant to be denied rights. There was an element of self-preservation in it too: the principal target for southern bigotry was blacks, but Jews were not far behind. When legislation came to remove many of the legal barriers to equality, Jews would benefit too. </p> <p>Because Jews have experienced discrimination first hand, Bositis says, \"On balance they are less racist than the typical white person.\" It is facile to trade off the two groups' completely different experiences of oppression, as though the Holocaust and slavery were two chips in a poker game of victimisation. This not only belittles the suffering but insults the sufferer. In 1926, Louis Marshall, a Jewish jurist and supporter of black rights, addressed the convention of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People with tales of massacres of Jews in Europe. \"We were subject to indignities in comparison with which to sit in a Jim Crow car is to occupy a palace,\" he said to a stunned and angry audience. </p> <p>Never were these differences more apparent than in the post-civil rights era of Black Power. \"Black people felt they had to assert control of the movement, and there wasn't much room for any whites, including Jewish people, in that,\" says Smith. </p> <p> The two groups became estranged by class as well as race and religion. Jews, as a community, got wealthier, while blacks, on the whole, remained at the bottom of the pile. \"There are class differences as you would understand them in Europe,\" says Smith, \"in terms of whole culture, education, expectations, rather than just money.\" </p> <p>This created tensions that have been most evident around affirmative action - a matter of great importance to African-Americans. Smith says, \"Jews are more likely to believe that affirmative action might exacerbate differences than assuage them.\" </p> <p>Some say this is because before the war many universities established quotas to restrict Jewish entrants. The quotas were removed, thanks to the struggle for civil rights, but because Jews fought against them on principle then, many still oppose them now. As the commentator Jerome Chanes says: \"For Jews, quotas were a way of keeping people out; for African-Americans, quotas were a way of letting people in.\" </p> <p>Either way, Lieberman's selection was not a subject for intellectual debate but a matter of urgent political significance. He headed straight for the Congressional black caucus because he had made remarks supporting a Californian proposition to outlaw affirmative action in all state programmes. Moreover, for four years he had been chairman of the Democratic leadership council, representing rightwing Democrats, which often found itself in opposition to liberals such as Jesse Jackson. It was vital that Lieberman kept African-Americans on board. </p> <p>\"He said it is one thing to be the leader of a faction, but another to represent the whole organisation,\" says Ron Walker at the University of Maryland. \"He did convince people that whatever he might have said, he had an impressive voting record on these matters.\" </p> <p>Whether this new era of cooperation, if not friendship, will last after the election has yet to be seen. Voltaire said: \"One regards the Jews the same way as one regards the negroes, as a species of inferior humanity.\" Having faced the common enemy of intolerance, there is hope, in some quarters at least, that they may once again find common cause.</p>",
  "Not content with shattering all known spending records at every stage of the 2000 election, America's political parties will today blow another $100m (\u00a369m) on a final orgy of spending to get voters to the polls. <p>With the national opinion polls suggesting a last-minute tightening in the race between Al Gore and George W Bush, and an unusually large number of swing states still considered up for grabs, everything now comes down to which candidate has the superior organisation in the desperate contest for the White House. </p> <p>In a race in which less than half of the eligible electorate is likely to vote today, the winner will be the man who can do what the professionals call mobilising the base - a contest in which polls suggest Republicans are generally more likely to turn out than Democrats. </p> <p>In big battleground states like Florida, Michigan and Pennsylvania, voters are being bombarded with leaflets, telephone calls, emails and old-fashioned knocks on the door. </p> <p>The stakes could hardly be higher or more evenly balanced. The final national polls yesterday continued to show Mr Bush in the lead, but Mr Gore was apparently closing the gap in the final hours, leaving most of the poll findings within the margin of error. </p> <p>The final Gallup daily tracking poll showed Mr Bush leading 47% to 45%, while the Zogby International daily tracking poll had the race even closer, with Mr Bush ahead 47% to 46%. </p> <p>A new poll of likely voters by the Pew Research Centre showed Mr Bush leading 49% to 47%, with the Green Party candidate Ralph Nader on 4%. </p> <p>The tightness of the race ensured that the contest will be decided in the battleground states of the north-west and midwest, as well as Florida, where Mr Gore was due to end his final day of campaigning last night. </p> <p>Mr Bush showed his confidence by choosing to make two of his final four state visits of the campaign in Bill Clinton's Arkansas and in Mr Gore's Tennessee. </p> <p><b> Phone campaigning</b><br> A series of tracking polls by Zogby International in nine of the swing states gave encouragement to both sides, with Mr Bush leading in Ohio, Missouri, Wisconsin and Mr Gore's home state of Tennessee, while Mr Gore had the lead in Florida, Illinois, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Washington. Many of the state findings were inside the margin of error. </p> <p>The biggest development this year has been the proliferation of different new technologies in the \"get out the vote\" effort. The internet is at the heart of both parties' organisational efforts, but the main way to reach voters on polling day remains the telephone. </p> <p>Americans are already well accustomed to tele-marketing by commercial organisations, but cheaper telephone calls, higher campaign fundraising and the shrinking of the numbers of voters prepared to turn out have combined to make the telephone appeal the most effective of all last-minute campaign weapons for both parties. </p> <p>Automated calls from celebrities and leading politicians will begin going out from the early hours this morning, and will continue right up to the close of the polls. </p> <p>President Clinton may not have been very visible on the campaign trail this year, but his phone calls were going into tens of thousands of households yesterday and today, urging a vote for Mr Gore. Younger women voters in swing states can expect to calls from television star Sarah Jessica Parker, who is fronting a huge phone effort by abortion rights groups. </p> <p>On the Republican side, General Nor man Schwarzkopf can be heard in Michigan, Missouri and Florida urging a vote for Mr Bush, while well-resourced lobby groups like the National Rifle Association are backing Mr Bush with their own phone efforts in states like Pennsylvania with calls from the association president Charlton Heston. </p> <p>It is in the telephone call war that both sides and their allies are most likely to resort to the negative campaigning and scare tactics that have mostly been absent from the more public phases of this year's campaigns, such as speeches and even television advertising. </p> <p>In Michigan, some black American voters have complained that they have been receiving calls purporting to come from the National Association for the Advancement of Coloured People advocating a vote for Mr Bush in the presidential contest. The NAACP is spending $10.5m supporting Mr Gore and the Democrats. </p> <p>In the New York senate race, the Republican Party admits that it has financed more than 50,000 calls including some which link Hillary Clinton, Yasser Arafat and the bombing of the USS Cole in Yemen last month and another targeted at Jewish voters which says Mrs Clinton supports the creation of a Palestinian state. </p> <p>\"In the last week, the Marquis of Queensbury rules seem to go out the window,\" says Congressman Tom Davis of Virginia, chairman of the Republican con gressional election campaign. \"Everyone seems to take off the gloves and put on the brass knuckles.\" </p> <p>Party campaigners' tasks have been made even more difficult this time round by the huge growth in postal voting - known here as absentee balloting - and by innovations such as Oregon's decision to abolish all polling stations in favour of votes by mail. Election officials have reported that the demand for absentee ballots has been at an all-time high in key states such as Florida, Illinois and Michigan. </p> <p>States like North Carolina and Mr Bush's Texas allow early voting in person - former president George Bush and his wife Barbara were among those who took advantage of the system last week - making it even harder for party organisations to keep track of who has voted and who has not. </p> <p>In the end, though, the difference between victory and defeat tonight may all come down to shoe leather and person-to-person contacts, as party workers knock on the doors of those who have yet to cast their votes.</p>",
  "George W Bush practically swaggered into today's presidential election with a visit to Tennessee intended to taunt Al Gore in his own home state. <p>Whether or not he is ready for the presidency, it was clear yesterday that the Republican Texas governor has emerged from the 18-month quest for the White House as a ruthlessly effective campaigner. </p> <p>By the time he flew in to Chattanooga - on his final lap before returning to Austin, Texas to await the results - his get-out-the-vote speech had become a composite of all the applause lines from a thousand previous appearances. </p> <p>Most of those lines fed the desire for revenge among the Republican rank and file after eight years of Democratic administration, by ridiculing Mr Gore - born and raised in Washington to a liberal senator on whose Tennessee farm the son spent family holidays and helped with the work - as a standard-bearer for the \"Washington elite\". </p> <p>\"He forgot his roots,\" Mr Bush told cheering supporters mustered at an aircraft hangar at Chattanooga airport. \"He forgot where he's from. He trusts Washington. We trust the people.\" </p> <p>\"It's always important to have a place from which to run from. I, of course, come from Texas and I plan to carry my home state. My opponent vows to win in his home state. Well he might win Washington DC, but he's not going to win Tennessee.\" </p> <p>On the eve of the vote, polls showed Mr Bush ahead by 49% to 45% in the state where Mr Gore has spent much of his adult political life, as a congressman and then as a senator. </p> <p>Tennessee's 11 votes in the US electoral college which ultimately decides the presidency will be important in a race that seemed to be getting even closer in the final hours. </p> <p>But the real purpose of the lightning Bush visit was to convey the opposite impression - that the tide was running against the Democratic vice-president, even among those who supposedly know him best. To that end, Mr Bush also put in an appearance in President Clinton's home state, Arkansas, as well as two other states which voted in for Bill Clinton in 1992 and 1996: Wisconsin and Iowa. </p> <p>Demographically speaking, Mr Gore's troubles in Tennessee are hardly surprising. He got himself elected here as congressman (in 1976) and then senator by campaigning as a rightwing Democrat, a proud tobacco grower who was against gun control and abortion. </p> <p>\"The whole point is that he's not the same person he was back then. He no longer fits the cultural values of this state,\" Robin Smith, a state Republican activist, said. </p> <p>Lewis Weeks, a retired hospital administration worker who had woken up before dawn to catch sight of Mr Gore's Republican rival, put his dislike of the vice-president in blunter terms. \"I absolutely can't stand Al Gore. I hate the ground he walks on.\" </p> <p>Mr Weeks said this was because Mr Gore advocates a strong role for the federal government - a widespread belief, according to the polls, despite Mr Gore's protestations and Mr Bush's record of expanding state government in Texas. Mr Bush seems to have succeeded in getting his message across better. </p> <p>Tennessee is a state in which a substantial majority believes, in the words of one of Mr Bush's warm-up speakers, \"God should write all public policy\", and the Bush campaign has been effective in portraying the Clinton years of sexual embarrassment as a time of darkness. By this means the Texas governor has also been able to depict a country in crisis despite the record economic growth of the Clinton era. </p> <p>Speaker after speaker on the stage in Chattanooga, spoke of the need for national moral redemption, and Lorretta Lyn, a Tennessee country singer, cooed about \"putting America back on its feet\". </p> <p>Another technique, used extensively at the Republican convention and at every campaign stop since, has been to position black Americans directly behind the candidate. The TV cameras recording this a racially inclusive backdrop seldom capture the whiteness of the rank-and-file. In Chattanooga, where racial politics run deep, there were three black Tennesseans on the Bush podium, but none I could see in a 5,000-strong crowd. </p> <p>The only other blacks in the area were on the far side of the airport fence - two members of the local steelworkers' union holding a lonely demonstration. One of them, James Muckle, declared: \"Our vice-president supports the union, and the working man.\" </p> <p>African-Americans swung Tennessee for Bill Clinton in 1996, but some doubt they will do the same for an understudy, who has never had the same rapport with minorities as his mentor.</p>",
  "The cost of electing George W Bush or Al Gore today as president of the United States comes to a record of almost a third of a billion dollars - and that is without taking into account millions more in \"soft-money\" contributions that are unregulated and hard to track. <p>Mr Bush has raised $187m (\u00a3130m) for his Republican campaign, all but $20m of it spent by a fortnight ago. Mr Gore raised $133m (\u00a392m) for his Democratic campaign, and Ralph Nader of the Green Party raised $6m (\u00a34m), according to the latest official figures. </p> <p>The Republican national commitee has raised another $214m on top of that and the Democrats $179m in unregulated \"soft money\" which was spent across a range of campaigns for president, congressional and local state elections. </p> <p>\"The growing role of money in the political system is a growing problem, yes,\" said Douglas Webber of the non-partisan Centre for Responsive Politics, a research group that monitors contributions to candidates. </p> <p>\"There's just been this constant downpour of money running all over the political process this year. This election will go down as the most expensive by far.\" </p> <p>Mr Gore has said that a campaign finance reform bill will be the first thing he signs if he wins and some senior Republicans have said that they, too, will pursue this matter. The most influential of these is John McCain, Mr Bush's defeated opponent for the Republican nomination to run for the presidency. </p> <p>\"The issue has had enough attention in this campaign that it's safe to assume that there will be some attempt for a change, no matter who wins,\" said Mr Webber. \"Several members of Congress will bring this up.\" </p> <p>Combined spending on the presidential and congressional elections is put at $3bn and on the state contests at another $1bn. Taken together this is an increase of nearly 50% on the 1996 elections in America. </p> <p>Mr Bush raised an unprecedented $100m for his primaries campaign alone; in the much more obscure contest for a New Jersey seat in the US Senate, Jon Corzine, a former chief executive of Goldman Sachs, has spent $60m of his own money. </p> <p>Congressional candidates are limited to donations of $1m maximum from individuals and $5,000 from political committees. But the rules are side-stepped by setting up \"soft money\" committees. </p> <p>These shell organisations accept funds from corporations, trade unions and the wealthy and spend it on advertising and canvassing on behalf of candidates. </p> <p>Mr Gore and Mr Bush have each accepted $67.6m in public funding, supposedly in return for refraining from raising money for their campaigns. Unrestricted \"soft money\" now exceeds those sums to such an extent that the parties and outside groups can spend more than the candidates. </p> <p>The Republican party spent $36m on television advertising in support of Mr Bush in five months to the end of October compared with $28m spent by the candidate's campaign, says a study by the Brennan Centre at New York University. </p> <p>The Democratic party spent $31m, and oustide groups $9m, on advertisements backing Mr Gore in that period, against his campaign's $21m. </p> <p>\"The outstanding development this cycle is that this is the first election in which non-candidate spending in close races for the House of Representatives, Senate and presidency will exceed spending by the candidates,\" said Michael Malbin of the Campaign Finance Institute. </p> <p>Trevor Potter, a former chairman of the Federal Election Commission, said: \"We haven't seen an election like this since 1972 in terms of the effectively unlimited amounts of money being spent.\" </p> <p>Corporations have been prevented for almost 100 years from making direct political contributions but devices are used to get around the federal spending limits, a development attributed most recently to President Clinton and the Democratic Party. </p> <p>Fred Wertheimer of another monitoring group, Democracy 21, said: \"All the fig leaves have disappeared in this election. There is such a sense now that anything goes that people aren't even looking for cover in terms of massive use of unlimited, unregulated funds. </p> <p>\"If you look at 2000 in comparison with other years, campaign records are being shattered everywhere. Not broken but shattered.\"</p>",
  "<p>A strange day in the Square Mile. Although the main indices finished higher in brisk trading, the mood among City traders was never bright. </p> <p>Perhaps it had something to do with the difficulties getting to the office after another night of violent storms in the south-east. But a quick glance at the best-performing stocks of the day told a different story. </p> <p>Driving both the FTSE 100 and FTSE 250 higher were the oil and pharmaceutical sectors - classic places to park cash in times of worry or uncertainty. Of course, second-line oil stocks were enlivened by the bid for <strong> Lasmo</strong>, up 34p to 175p, but that had little to do with the performances of <strong> Shell</strong>, 12p higher at 541p, <strong> BP</strong>, up 6.5p to 568p, or drug stocks <strong> AstraZeneca</strong>, 160p better at \u00a333.20, and <strong> Glaxo Wellcome</strong>, up 38p at \u00a320.35. </p> <p>Put simply, the market is worried - or, more accurately, uncertain - about a number of important events this week. Most important is the US presidential election, though Gordon Brown's pre-Budget statement and the meeting of the monetary policy committee are also causing some anxiety. </p> <p>A victory for George Bush is seen by the City as the favoured outcome for equities because his hands-off business policies and tax cuts are likely to keep the US economy ticking along at a fair rate. But until the result is known, traders are not prepared to chase the higher end of the market. </p> <p>So dealers decided to turn their attention either to defensive stocks or altogether less taxing matters. One subject drawing an unusual amount of attention was the prospects of a small dot.com company called <strong> Arthur Shaw</strong>. Many traders sat transfixed as the share price of the engineering company-turned-internet content provider, which boasts the former manager of Pink Floyd as chairman, dived 0.625p, or 13.71%, to 3.775p. </p> <p>According to the market gossips, Arthur Shaw is having problems getting its business - broadcasting live events such as pop concerts over the web - operating. Apparently big City institutions are proving reluctant to back the company because of concerns about the make-up of the board. However, chairman Bryan Morrison insisted that things were going well. \"We have plenty of money in the bank,\" he said yesterday. </p> <p>Away from such sideshows the FTSE 100 finally came to rest 45.6 points ahead at 6,431, with the FTSE 250 adding 77.6 to 6,826.8. </p> <p>With investors plumping for defensive issues, technology and telecom issues were bound to suffer. The TechMark eased 0.87 to 3,498.51, with <strong> Vodafone</strong> having another miserable session, falling 10p to 243p as last week's profit downgrades continued to undermine sentiment. </p> <p> <strong> Energis</strong> was also unloved, falling 13p to 540p. Over in the tech sector, <strong> Sema Group</strong> dropped 32p to 857p and <strong> Misys</strong> shed 18p to 725p. </p> <p> <strong> Marks &amp; Spencer</strong> failed to join in the \"old economy\" buying spree, falling 13p to 185p with investors unsettled by a number of reports suggesting today's figures will make gloomy reading. </p> <p>News that ex-Asda chief Allan Leighton has teamed up with Philip Green at Bhs was also viewed as negative. Far from trying to take over M&amp;S, it seems Mr Green and his dream team are going to tackle the ailing retailer head-on. </p> <p> <strong> British Airways</strong> continued the good work of last week, rising 21p to 351p on the back interim figures which, the market's more clairvoyant players had guessed, were better than expected. </p> <p>In fact, they were almost a carbon copy of last week's figures from KLM, which had started the buying spree. Sentiment was also boosted by news that the group wants to offload Go, its budget airline. </p> <p>Lower down the corporate scale, <strong> Thus </strong> slipped 6p to 84p on talk that Wednesday's results are going to make tough reading, and <strong> Manchester United </strong> added 17p to 249p after securing a \u00a3300m sponsorship deal with Nike. </p> <p>Floor coverings and furnishings group <strong> Headlam</strong>, down 22.5p to 135p, was rocked by the departure of its chief executive.</p>",

  "An angry and embittered woman appeared before a Paris court yesterday armed with enough ammunition to sink President Jacques Chirac's re-election campaign before it gets properly under way. <p>Xavi\u00e8re Tiberi, the wife of the embattled mayor of Paris, Jean Tiberi, went on trial again a year after the case against her was dropped on a technicality. </p> <p>The case arises from a series of potentially explosive criminal investigations into sleaze in President Chirac's conservative Rally for the Republic (RPR) party. </p> <p>There is nothing particularly outrageous about the offence with which Mrs Tiberi is charged.The prosecution alleges that in 1994 she was paid \u00a321,000 by the district council of Essonne, just outside Paris, which was led at the time by Xavier Dugoin, a now-disgraced former RPR senator and close political ally of her husband. </p> <p>Investigating magistrates discovered that the only work she did for the council was to produce a laughable 36-page report, most of it copied from a book and stuffed with elementary mistakes, on the prospects for economic cooperation between Essonne and French-speaking countries. </p> <p>Compared with some of the other alleged dodgy dealings in the Paris town hall while Mr Chirac was mayor from 1987 to 1995 - before he won the presidential elections and passed the mayor's job on to his once - loyal lieutenant Jean Tiberi - this is small beer. </p> <p>Two magistrates are investigating claims that hundreds of RPR activists were given well-paid but non-existent jobs at city hall, others are looking at the increasing evidence that the party's coffers were illegally filled by kickbacks from building companies with Paris council housing contracts. </p> <p>RPR officials have tried before to halt the investigation of Mrs Tiberi's now-infamous report. </p> <p>Late in 1996 the justice ministry chartered a helicopter in the Himalayas and sent the first-secretary of the French embassy in Nepal into the mountains to bring back the holidaying state prosecutor, who might have been able to dismiss the case. </p> <p>This time the stakes are even higher. The French equivalent of Private Eye, Le Canard Enchain\u00e9, has quoted former city hall colleagues of Mr Chirac as saying that the future president was personally responsible for ensuring that Mrs Tiberi was given a fake job by a friendly local council. </p> <p>But the main reason the RPR is worried by Mrs Tiberi's appearance in the dock is that her efficient but uncharismatic husband was kicked out of the party last month, having refused to accept its decision that a more glamorous heavyweight candidate should stand for mayor in next year's municipal elections. </p> <p>A furious Mr Tiberi has already issued a thinly veiled warning that he is not prepared to carry the can for the illicit fundraising and other scams allegedly presided over by his more illustrious predecessor. His wife, who has sworn to \"stand by him till the end\", could prove to be his best weapon. </p> <p>\"She is understandably absolutely livid,\" said a Chirac aide who asked not to be named. </p> <p>\"She was already fed up with her husband taking the corruption flak. This is a couple which has nothing to lose - she could prove very, very dangerous.\" </p> <p>Mrs Tiberi was not called upon to speak in court yesterday, when the opening statements were made. </p> <p>The court is expected to deliver its verdict later this month.</p>"

  "Zimbabwe's opposition leader, Morgan Tsvangirai, has warned of a popular uprising against the man he calls the Milosevic of Africa - President Robert Mugabe - if the government carries out its threat to arrest him for treason on his return home this weekend. <p>Mr Tsvangirai was accused of treason when he called for the violent overthrow of Mr Mugabe if he did not swiftly resign as president. But, speaking in Johannesburg, the leader of the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) said his detention would provoke a revolution. </p> <p>\"The mood of the people is so tense that I will not be responsible for the reactions of the people. We have given Mugabe a warning. It is clear. Listen to the people. The current mood in the country is uncompromising. A similar situation [to Yugoslavia] cannot be avoided,\" he said.</p> <p>\"We must stop Africa's Milosevic. There's no difference between the situation in Yugoslavia and the situation in Zimbabwe. There are parallels. [Mugabe] has committed genocide against a minority, rigged elections, ignored the rule of law and created a state which is internationally isolated.\"</p> <p>Mr Tsvangirai made the threat that earned him the prospect of arrest at a rally a week ago to mark the first anniversary of the MDC, which came within a whisker of defeating Zanu-PF in June's parliamentary elections. </p> <p>\"What we want to tell Mugabe today is to please go peacefully. If you don't want to go, we will remove you violently,\" he said. </p> <p>Mr Mugabe later told a meeting of his party's central committee that the British government was working with the MDC to create unrest in the cities, \"in the hope that a Zanu-PF government will capitulate or fall in violent circumstances\". </p> <p>The day after his speech, Mr Tsvangirai left on a scheduled trip to Europe and South Africa. He was due to fly back to Harare on Tuesday but delayed his return after various government ministers called for his arrest. </p> <p>The speaker of parliament demanded his detention and prosecution for treason. The police described the \"threat of violence\" as unlawful and said they were prepared to act. </p> <p>Mr Tsvangirai said he had not intended to use the word \"violently\" and meant \"unceremoniously\", and that there was no legitimate reason to arrest him for his comments. </p> <p>\"It was undiplomatic, I must say, but it certainly wasn't treason,\" he said. \"The law cannot be applied selectively; one law for the MDC and another for Zanu-PF. There have been instances of people threatening to use weapons of war and they have not been arrested.\" </p> <p>More than 30 people have died in politically related violence in recent months, either during the occupation of white-owned farms or in attacks on MDC supporters. But there have been no arrests. </p> <p>Ominously, one of Mr Mugabe's old-guard supporters, Nathan Shamuyarira, warned that the ruling party would be more than a match for any uprising. </p> <p>\"The area of violence is an area where Zanu-PF has a very strong, long and successful history,\" he said. </p> <p>Mr Tsvangirai said Zimbabwe could not afford another two years of Mr Mugabe until the next presidential election. </p> <p>\"I understand he still thinks he has more to contribute to Zimbabwe. That state of mind is delusionary. What he is involved in is the tactics of survival, not a strategy for the survival of the country.\" </p> <p>But he said that if Zimbabweans wanted change, they should learn from the example of Belgrade and not expect others to do it for them. </p> <p>\"You cannot watch a situation where things collapse in your hands and you expect a miracle to come from somewhere,\" he said. </p> <p>The government remains defiant. On Thursday the police shut down Zimbabwe's first independent radio station, less than a week after it went on air, in defiance of a supreme court ruling. The high court has ordered the chief of police and his deputy to appear in court on Monday to explain why they should not be jailed for contempt. The government accused Britain of \"making threats\" to try to stop the move against the radio station. </p> <p>Mr Tsvangirai said this was further evidence of Mr Mugabe's desperation. </p> <p>\"It is an illustration of a government that's intolerant of opposing views,\" he said. \"It does not want the space for any mouthpiece other than that which supports Zanu-PF views.\"</p>",
  "The most hated man in Europe, Slobodan Milosevic, finally threw in the towel last night and congratulated Vojislav Kostunica on his victory in the September 24 Yugoslav presidential election. But the ousted dictator showed he still has deluded hopes of a political career. <p>Speaking on television after a meeting earlier yesterday with the Russian foreign minster at one of his Belgrade residences, Mr Milosevic said he would spend time with his family before returning later to public life. </p> <p>\"I congratulate Mr Kostunica on his electoral victory and I wish much success to all citizens of Yugoslavia,\" he said in a television address. \"I intend to rest a bit and spend some more time with my family, and especially with my grandson, and after that to help my party gain force and contribute to future prosperity.\" </p> <p>The speech triggered a huge celebration on the streets of the Yugoslav capital. Firecrackers exploded and horns blared throughout the city. </p> <p>Deprived of power by election defeat and the loss of support from the army and police, and of sanctuary in most of the world by his indictment as a war criminal, Mr Milosevic earlier yesterday had put on a brave smile and welcomed Moscow's foreign minister, Igor Ivanov, to tea at his villa in the suburb of Dedinje. </p> <p>Seated on chintzy white sofas behind drawn curtains, Mr Milosevic told his Russian guest that he firmly intended to stay in political life as head of the Socialist party of Serbia. </p> <p>He condemned Thursday's storming by demonstrators of the parliament and the state-run television station, actions that led the police to join the revolt in the streets and hastened his regime's collapse. </p> <p>According to Mr Ivanov, who held a press conference after his talks with Mr Milosevic, the ousted president criticised \"the violence and riots as jeopardising the functioning of the state\". </p> <p>While the rest of Yugoslavia has moved into a new era, Mr Milosevic seems unable to see how far he has fallen. He even risks repudiation by his colleagues. The Socialist party is reported to be in turmoil, with resignations mounting as erstwhile collaborators rush to distance themselves from him. </p> <p>Late last night, Mr Kostunica, said he had spoken to Mr Milosevic and army commanders to try to quell fears that troops and police might intervene in the popular revolution. Mr Kostunica said on television: \"There are guarantees that the shift of power will this time go smoothly.\" </p> <p>No one in the Serbian capital seemed interested last night in hunting Mr Milosevic down or trying to ransack his many homes. People had clearly taken to heart an appeal for calm by Mr Kostunica. </p> <p>Speaking from the balcony of Belgrade's town hall at Thursday night's victory party, the new leader had urged a jubilant audience \"to drive the man away, but not with the violence which he used on us for so many years\". </p> <p>The only target of serious looting was a central Belgrade perfume shop called Scandal, owned by Mr Milosevic's mafioso son, Marko. It was ransacked on Thursday and yesterday crowds queued patiently to file past and peer through the broken windows. </p> <p>Meanwhile, people in the state sphere were changing sides as easily as changing clothes. The constitutional court - which brought things to a head by trying to nullify the September 24 election results and suggesting a rerun - yesterday announced that Mr Kostunica had indeed won. </p> <p>The anger ignited by the court's original decision, which led thousands of Serbs to loot the parliament and set fire to the TV centre, had by yesterday turned into a festival atmosphere. Massive crowds came out to celebrate the triumph of Mr Kostunica, as well as to see the site where what is being called a revolution reached its climax. Drums were beaten and flags waved. </p> <p>Some revolutions are about social equality, others seek to end political dictatorship. The Serbian Autumn was fuelled by a thirst for normality. </p> <p>Under the portico of the parliament, Slobodan Zhuric, 33, a shopkeeper, was acting as a volunteer guard preventing sightseers from going inside. </p> <p>\"We had reason to be angry with Milosevic for Kosovo, but the west had no reason to bomb us,\" he said. \"Milosevic lost all credibility when he surrendered.\" But what he wanted above all, he said, was \"to have a president we can exchange, if we find we don't like him\". </p> <p>Near Mr Milosevic's villa is Beli Dvor, the so-called White Palace, the presidential guards could not disguise their grins yesterday when we asked if they had celebrated on revolution night. \"No comment,\" said one as he gave it all away with a toothy smile.</p>",
  "Still bunkered down in his villa in a leafy Belgrade suburb, despite rumour and counter-rumour about his attempted flight abroad, Slobodan Milosevic yesterday broadcast his defiance of Serbia and the rest of the world. <p>He may be tilting at windmills. The kingdom of fear he has ruled for 13 years has vanished, his world is in tatters. But he spoke as though he were still in charge, denouncing the popular revolution that has overthrown him as \"violence\", and \"destructive riots weakening\" Serbia and playing into the hands of its enemies. </p> <p>On a day that the country found it had more friends than it has had for a decade, the intransigent statement smacked of paranoia. Mr Milosevic has cultivated a siege mentality among Serbs for years to cement his power. It may be that he has begun to believe his own propaganda. </p> <p>The only international government figure to shake hands with the new president of Yugoslavia, Vojislav Kostunica, and to get a chance to gauge Mr Milosevic's temper, was Igor Ivanov, the Russian foreign minister, who sped to Belgrade at dawn yesterday. </p> <p>Borislav Milosevic, the indicted war criminal's elder brother and ambassador in Moscow, insisted that Mr Milosevic remained head of state, at least for the time being. \"There are rules for the transfer of power. These should be followed. There is a set period of time - in America I think it's two months,\" he said. </p> <p>Mr Ivanov spent 45 minutes with Mr Milosevic at his villa at 15 Uzicka Street, in the suburb of Dedinje, accompanied by the hardline Yugoslav army chief of staff, Nebojsa Pavkovic, and other military leaders. The regime's foreign minister, Zivodin Jovanovic, was also there, describing Moscow as \"a friend of Yugoslavia\". </p> <p>The question was whether Moscow was still a friend of Mr Milosevic. The Russian minister said little after the meeting, but Russian sources claimed that loyalist crack units of interior ministry troops and the army were heading towards Belgrade from Nis in the south, and from Montenegro, to defend the fallen despot. </p> <p>In neighbouring Bulgaria, senior officials also predicted that Mr Milosevic could still be a menace. \"It's possible that Milosevic could still have resources for a counter-attack,\" said Ivan Kostov, the Bulgarian prime minister. </p> <p>But Mr Milosevic appeared to have few props left. His last potential international support collapsed when Russia recognised Mr Kostunica as president after a week of sitting on the fence. With Mr Milosevic stripped of his Russian card, the main speculation centred on whether the 59-year-old cigarillo smoker with a penchant for Scotch would seek sanctuary abroad. And if so, where and how. </p> <p>He appears to believe he is entitled to stay put and devote himself to leading his Socialist party of Serbia, which remains the single biggest party. It is as if no one has told him there has been a revolution. </p> <p>Dmitry Rogozin, a senior Russian for eign policy official who has been in close contact with Belgrade throughout the crisis, said Mr Milosevic \"fell into a deep depression\" after losing the presidential election to Mr Kostunica a fortnight ago. A brooding recluse and diabetic, he is known to suffer from periodic bouts of depression. It was not clear yesterday whether Mirjana Markovic, his strong-willed wife who, if anything, is even more hated in Serbia than Mr Milosevic, was still in Belgrade, or whether the couple's son and daughter were still there. </p> <p>His brother dismissed all such talk of depression and of escape plans. \"There are absolutely no reasons to leave the country. These are rumours being spread to give credence to rumours about him being demoralised... Why should he leave the country? Half the population supports him. He is the leader of a major party.\" </p> <p>But reporting to Russia's president, Vladimir Putin, on his talks in Belgrade, Mr Ivanov and his boss \"considered measures needed to maintain peace\" in Yugoslavia. Since Mr Milosevic's continued presence in the country is widely seen as the biggest threat to peace, it appeared likely that his safe haven options were also discussed with the Russians. The German chancellor, Gerhard Schr\u00f6der, and Mr Putin also discussed the dilemmas later yesterday. They are also believed to have discussed Mr Milosevic's exit options in Moscow on September 25, the day after Mr Kostunica's poll victory. </p> <p>Iraq, China, Russia, Kazakhstan and Belarus have all been mentioned as possible boltholes. Mr Milosevic's three lost Balkan wars made refugees of more than 3m people. Now his family may share their fate - displaced and homeless. </p> <p>Along with the indicted Bosnian Serb war criminals Radovan Karadzic and Ratko Mladic, he is the world's most wanted man. The Hague tribunal indicted him for war crimes in Kosovo last year and is seeking to charge him with further war crimes in Bosnia and Croatia. </p> <p>That makes it highly unlikely that the Kremlin would give him a safe haven. The Russian prime minister, Mikhail Kasyanov, said yesterday that the asylum issue \"has not been raised or discussed in that way... We are far from assuming that we have to consider the matter in that light.\" </p> <p>More hopefully for Mr Milosevic, the prime minister of Belarus, Vladimir Yermoshin, said that Minsk would consider approaches for \"political asylum\", but that none had been made. His boss, President Alexander Lukashenko, said that no one from the Belgrade regime had requested sanctuary. </p> <p>\"He has many options,\" said Mr Lukashenko. \"Milosevic simply has no grounds for leaving Yugoslavia.\" </p> <p>Despite the statements from Borislav Milosevic, the ambassador admitted last night that he had not spoken to his younger brother yesterday. </p> <p>Apart from sticking unfailingly and triumphantly to his line that Mr Milosevic had to go, Mr Kostunica has made no threatening noises towards the Milosevic family or the regime. He has repeatedly said he will not hand over Mr Milosevic to the tribunal in the Hague, which he views as an illegitimate political tool of the west. </p> <p>But if Mr Kostunica lacks rancour and vengefulness, it is not clear that will be able to rein in hotter tempers bent on meting out rough justice to the hated Milosevic family and the former regime's retinue of cronies and criminals. </p> <p>It appeared that the Russian mediation in Belgrade yesterday was aimed at preempting any such bloodshed, though it was not clear how. Mr Putin departed for his home town of St Petersburg last night on the eve of his birthday without providing any clues as to what should become of Mr Milosevic.</p>",
  "\"I'd prefer to go fishing, pick mushrooms, or have fun with my wife, rather than this,\" Lech Walesa maintains. He is sitting in an armchair in a pair of blue quilted slippers, answering questions on an internet chatline in his office in Warsaw. <p>An assistant fastens his tie. Now and then a woman comes in with more herbal tea. Then the chatline coordinator announces that the site has only received 400 hits. </p> <p>\"That's not good,\" Mr Walesa says, shaking his head. \"Am I wasting my time?\" </p> <p>It is the last day of campaigning in the Polish presidential election and - despite having secured a hero's place in European history as the leader of the Solidarity movement, which took Poland out of communism and into democracy - Mr Walesa is not satisfied enough to sit back, whatever he may say about fishing. </p> <p>Rather, he hopes the election will restore his past glories by making him president for the second time. </p> <p>But the former Gdansk shipyard electrician is almost certain to go down to a humiliating defeat. </p> <p>Standing under the slogan \"Black is black and white is white\" (black symbolising the ex-communists in power), Mr Walesa, 57, says he is driven by the stubborn belief that he can reshape Polish life. </p> <p>\"I owe a lot to the nation,\" he says. </p> <p>\"When the country is in trouble, as it is now, I must put myself at the people's disposal. Maybe not now, but tomorrow they will come knocking at my door. I will be there and they will not be able to say I have forsaken them. </p> <p>\"If they reject me that's OK, they can do that. But I can't reject them.\" </p> <p>It is the tone of the parental martyr implicitly chastising neglectful children. And there are other characters in the Walesa political repertoire - such as the revolutionary who cannot give up the cause even though it has been won. </p> <p>\"I will continue the fight against communism until they hammer the last nail into my coffin - the grain has to die in order for something new to be reborn,\" he says, banging his fist on the table and adding that if he does not succeed he will stand a third time for the largely a ceremonial post. </p> <p>Having chased away communist rule, Mr Walesa became president in 1990. At the election five years later he lost by just 3.5% to Aleksander Kwasniewski, 46, a younger, slicker figure who was sports minister when the Communist party ruled. </p> <p>Now the narrow vote gap between them has deepened to a chasm. Support for President Kwasniewski - under whom Poland has become central Europe's economic powerhouse and looks likely to join the EU within four years - stands at between 52% and 55%. </p> <p>Mr Walesa sees himself as \"blamed for the pain of transition\": opinion surveys give him a popularity rating of just 2%. He has scarcely been mentioned in the election campaign. </p> <p>He is standing as an independent, having been rejected even by the ruling Solidarity bloc. It, too, faces a humiliating defeat. </p> <p>The campaign has been lacklustre. But it has been peppered with western-style dirty tricks, mainly thanks to Marian Krzaklewski, 50, the candidate from the Solidarity-AWS alliance of trade unions and Catholic parties who is widely considered to be the brains behind the government. </p> <p>Despite Mr Walesa's claim that he is \"still my friend\", Mr Krzaklewski is one of the politicians responsible for squeezing Mr Walesa out of the Solidarity bloc. </p> <p>In August there was brief excitement when they had to defend themselves in a Warsaw court after rivals accused them of having collaborated with the communist secret police. Both were cleared. </p> <p>Last month Mr Kwasniewski suffered a blow which some believed might fell him, when his campaign broadcast showed his national security adviser, Marek Siwiec, parodying the Pope by kissing the soil as he left a helicopter during a 1997 presidential trip. </p> <p>It upset much of the electorate in the predominantly Roman Catholic country and, as Mr Siwiec's boss Mr Kwasniewski suffered a drop of 5-10 percentage points in his popular support. </p> <p>Despite such setbacks, the only unknown in tomorrow's vote is how big tMr Kwasniewski's victory will be over the 11 rightwing and centrist candidates. </p> <p>Much of the success of the communist-turned-social democrat - described by Mr Walesa as a \"well dressed scarecrow who uses Goebbels-style techniques\" - is put down to his ability to epitomise modern Poland. </p> <p>In 1995 image makers from Poland and France were recruited to dress him in designer suits, polish up his communication skills and turn him into one of central Europe's first US-style politicians. </p> <p>Post-communist Poland likes style and aspires to success. </p> <p>\"Kwasniewski is slick, funny and speaks foreign languages, as opposed to Walesa, who wears scuffed shoes and speaks awful Polish,\" says Malgorzata Jatkowska, 30, a film school student at Lodz in central Poland. </p> <p>Respect still attaches to Mr Walesa's past role, but today he is seen as too dogmatic and haphazard. </p> <p>\"Churchill was a good wartime leader, but proved hopeless in peace time, and it's the same with Walesa,\" said a bookseller in Warsaw. </p> <p>But Mr Walesa says he has not yet had a chance to prove what he can do. </p> <p>\"I always expected I'd be elected for a second term,\" he says. \"So I've only realised half my plan and there is still a lot of evil to get rid of.\"</p>",
  "Frank Sinatra's youngest daughter presents the United States tomorrow with a snapshot of an era in which presidential election campaigns took a more relaxed view about where their funds came from than the Gore and Bush teams of today. <p>Tina Sinatra says that her father, one of the most reliable targets each time the world goes looking for a tarnished hero, acted as a facilitator when John F Kennedy's election machine realised it could use a little help from the Mafia 40 years ago. </p> <p>The singer, whose job as a go-between was set up by the Kennedy family patriarch Joseph, asked the Chicago crime overlord Sam Giancana to use the mob's muscle to deliver union votes. </p> <p>It was thought to be \"in Jack Kennedy's best interest if his father did not make the contact directly\", Ms Sinatra, 52, told the CBS current affairs programme 60 Minutes. \"Dad was on an errand.\" </p> <p>Sinatra, who died two years ago at the age of 82, received the call when JFK, then a member of the Senate, was fighting Hubert Humphrey for the Democratic nomination to run as president in 1960. His father believed that Giancana's influence could make the difference in the West Virginia primary. </p> <p>Sinatra was chosen for the task \"because Kennedy knew dad had access to Sam Giancana\", his daughter said. The Mafia boss agreed to help, indicating that it was all in a day's work for him. </p> <p>\"It's a couple of calls,\" he said. </p> <p>But Giancana felt betrayed after Kennedy won the primary and then the the White House, and his brother Robert, the attorney general, turned against organised crime. </p> <p>Ms Sinatra said: \"Sam was saying 'That's not right. You know he owes me' - he meaning Joe Kennedy. And dad, I think, said 'No, I owe you. I asked for the favour'.\" </p> <p>Her father repaid his debt to Giancana by agreeing to play the mobster's Chicago club, the Villa Venice, and made the apology more fulsome by bringing along Sammy Davis Jr and Dean Martin for an eight-night engagement. </p> <p>Subsequently, the president, the performer and the persistent criminal were linked through the late Judith Exner, who had affairs with all three. Sinatra said that contact with underworld elements was all a part of the entertainment industry. </p> <p>\"In theatrical work, in night club work, in concerts,\" he told an interviewer. </p> <p>\"In restaurants you meet all kinds of people, so that there's really not much to be said about that. And I think the less the better.\" </p> <p>Ms Sinatra said her father talked also of acting as a courier for the CIA. \"Because he controlled his own air travel, [the CIA] would ask him and many others with that capacity to courier a body - a living person, you know, not a corpse, but a diplomat - or papers.\" But he never divulged any names. </p> <p>The family begged Sinatra to stop performing in his old age but he could not resist making comebacks because he was convinced that he had to keep on making money, says his daughter, who publishes her autobiography next week. </p> <p>\"The older he got, the more sickly he became, the less he enjoyed his life. None of us thought he would become that frail. It's funny how you delude yourself.\"</p>",
  "<b>Wednesday, 4 October:</b> The court, meeting in emergency session, annulled the results of the 24 September presidential election - although it left the local election results intact. The members of the court are known to be Slobodan Milosevic supporters and the ruling reinforces his position. <p><b>Thursday, 5 October:</b> The court lets it be known that it would expect the new election to be held at the end of the Milosevic mandate, ie June 2001. However, the president of the court is later that day quoted as saying a new presidential poll must be held during Milosevic's mandate. According to Radio Free Europe, Milutin Srdic said a new election could be held but hesitates when asked when. \"I don't know exactly when this mandate of his expires, in a few months,\" the radio's <a href=\" http://www.rferl.org \" target=\"_new\">website</a> quoted him as saying. </p> <p><b>Friday, 6 October:</b> The court rules in favour of the opposition that Vojislav Kostunica had won the election. Efforts to contact the court are unsuccessful as the report is published after the close of business hours. The ruling removes Milosevic's last claim to legality and paves the way for Kostunica to take office. </p>",
  "Over the years, American vice-presidential election debates have often produced the fireworks and the one-liners that the bigger contests between the presidential candidates have sometimes lacked. While the presidential nominees seem compelled to appear, well, presidential, their running-mates have had a limited licence to hit below the belt. Lloyd Bentsen's classic put-down of Dan Quayle a dozen years ago - \"Senator, you are no Jack Kennedy\" - remains one of the most stylish political muggings in American history. <p>Last night in Danville, Kentucky, Dick Cheney and Joe Lieberman got their big chance to get down and dirty too. Did they take it?</p> <p>No chance. Instead they resolutely took the high road. The one and only vice-presidential debate of the 2000 campaign was cautious, gaffe-free and - that word again - more presidential than vice-presidential. It almost certainly changed nothing, and that was probably both men's overriding intention. </p> <p>That was especially the case for Lieberman. Coming into the debate ahead in the polls, Al Gore's running mate had very clearly been trained to play it straight and statesmanlike. Wherever a temptation to shine or to appear distinctive presented itself, Lieberman steadfastly resisted it. His job, it rapidly became clear, was to preserve the hard won poll lead, and he did it by playing his round in immaculate par. No risks; no spectaculars. Above all, create no problems. Just get the round over without a mishap. </p> <p>Lieberman delivered exactly what Al Gore wanted. </p> <p>For the second time this week, an election debate contained not a mention of Bill Clinton. There was barely a hint of Lieberman' Jewishness, either, even in an exchange about the Middle East. Lieberman even soft-pedalled on the religious themes that were so strikingly prominent in his speeches a month ago.</p> <p>Everything about the Democratic candidate was on message, often with the exemplary clarity of style which is one of the Connecticut senator's greatest accomplishments. </p> <p>If the Gore-Lieberman camp had been tempted to attack Cheney for his oil industry connections and for the scale of his personal stake in an industry of both electoral and international sensitivity, then this too was resisted. Admittedly, Cheney's personal oil wealth generated the wittiest exchanges of the evening - a short back-and-forth about the attractions of the private sector - but negative tactics remained strictly out of bounds. This was an evening in which the gloves remained on and the stiletto remained sheathed. </p> <p>For Cheney, underdog rather than attack dog, the debate was something of a rehabilitation in campaign terms. Apart from a relatively aggressive speech two months ago at the Republican convention - and it was aggressive only by the exceptionally decorous standards of this year's campaign - Cheney has barely made any impact on the contest. He has brought few positives, and several negatives, to George W Bush's cause. </p> <p>Last night, however, Cheney gave a wholly competent and generally impressive performance. He voluntarily renounced personal attacks, and instead argued for a series of rational, middle-of-the-road positions on most of the issues that came up. As they circled one another for 90 minutes in the centre-ground it actually fell to Lieberman - the quintessential bipartisan centrist - to have to keep underlining the differences between the two men's positions. </p> <p>What came through in these circumstances was the competence and quality of the two men. Their debate ranged over taxation, Yugoslavia, military readiness, the Middle East, oil exploration and the environment. In contrast to the presidential debate in Boston on Tuesday, there was a question about race and one about gay marriage (further testimony to the decorousness of the event was that no one mentioned Cheney's lesbian daughter). </p> <p>In their different ways, both Cheney and Lieberman are plausible candidates for the weird job in which one of them will spend the next four years. It does not require much effort of imagination to see them succeeding to the presidency should the need arise. After two debates this week, the only candidate who has not seemed quite up to that job is, of course, Bush. </p> <p>Though it is true that nothing much has happened at either of this week's debates, this is not at all the same as saying that the debates do not change anything or are unimportant. Quite clearly, this week's debates have embodied two very different views of the role of government at home and abroad. </p> <p>Try as they did to make it seem otherwise, Cheney and Lieberman disagree fundamentally about far more things than they'd have you believe.</p>",
  "The Yugoslav army today indicated its acceptance of the uprising that overthrew Slobodan Milosevic by saying it will act only if its military facilities, personnel and material goods come under direct threat. <p>The Tanjug news agency, which yesterday abandoned its support for the Milosevic regime, said the top army leadership had met early this morning. Citing sources close to the army leadership, it said: \"The Yugoslav army remains consistent to the stands publicly announced several times that it will act within its constitutional powers.\"</p> <p>Today's meeting, a day after opposition supporters took control of the Yugoslav parliament building and state media, is seen as crucial to the outcome of the popular revolt as it appears that the army and security forces have accepted as a fait accompli the end of Mr Milosevic's reign. </p> <p>The army will take comfort from the fact that Vojislav Kostunica, the opposition leader who has been declared president after last month's presidential election, does not accept the jurisdiction of the Hague tribunal on war crimes and is a fervent Serb nationalist.</p> <p>No movements by military units were reported anywhere in the country today. Momcilo Perisic, a former army chief of staff and now an opposition figure, said he had contacted Yugoslavia's military leaders and that they had promised not to intervene. </p> <p>The whereabouts of Mr Milosevic are unclear, but there are reports that he is in a bunker in Beljanica, some 25 miles west of the town of Bor, which is close to the Romanian and Bulgarian borders. </p> <p>The Russian foreign minister, Igor Ivanov, arrived in Belgrade today, the first foreign official to arrive in Serbia since yesterday's tumultuous events. He is to meet Mr Kostunica and there were suggestions that he would also meet Mr Milosevic. But Russia, one of Yugoslavia's traditional allies, says the question of asylum for the fallen tyrant is not under consideration.</p> <p>Russia's Interfax news agency quoted the Russian prime minister, Mikhail Kasyanov, as saying that the question of asylum \"has not been raised and is not being discussed. We are a long way from looking at the question in that way.\"</p> <p>In Belgrade, jubilant crowds roamed the streets early this morning, celebrating the end of 13 years of Mr Milosevic's rule. Fears persist that there could be counterattacks by remnants of the discredited regime. Through the night, tens of thousands danced and sang in celebration of the seizure of Yugoslavia's parliament and other key symbols of the Milosevic regime.</p> <p>All state-owned media were working normally, broadcasting or publishing apologies for their past support for Mr Milosevic. Serb television occasionally flashed its logo during broadcasts, with the slogan: \"This is the new free Serbian television.\" </p> <p>State-owned or formerly pro-Milosevic dailies issued special editions reflecting the change in their editorial policies. Politika featured a front-page photograph of Mr Kostunica, his arm raised triumphantly in the air over a headline: \"Serbia on the road to democracy\" with a subtitle describing him as president. </p> <p>The only voices of dissent in the overwhelmingly positive international reaction to the popular revolt came from Russian officials. The Interfax news agency quoted the head of Russia's communist party, Gennady Zyuganov, as saying he did not approve of events. \"This is not democracy, it smells of marijuana, vodka and dollars,\" he said. </p> <p>Britain's foreign secretary, Robin Cook, welcomed the overthrow of Mr Milosevic, saying that sanctions against Yugoslavia could be lifted on Monday when the European parliament next meets. He added: \"We can then get down to the task of rebuilding.\"</p>",
  "As convoys of opposition vehicles converged on Belgrade yesterday, a shockwave of protests spread across the countryside. Hesitant riot police stood by, or were swept aside by the popular uprising. <p>In the northern town of Subotica, near the Hungarian border, the arrest of a student activist triggered a rally of 10,000 people in the town square. In the third largest city, Nis, a similar sized demonstration tried to force its way into the local offices of President Milosevic's Socialist party but was persuaded by opposition leaders not to give police a reason to attack them. Water cannon vehicles remained parked. </p> <p>Attempts to block the roads leading to the capital were easily thwarted. Where the police had set up roadblocks they were overwhelmed by the numbers pressing forward. A procession of vehicles carrying 2,000 people was briefly stopped near the town of Smederevska Palanka, 30 miles south of Belgrade, but eventually pushed its way through barricades. </p> <p>Protesters used an excavator to shove aside two lorries laden with sand and parked across the main road from the opposition-held town of Cacak to Belgrade. Police in riot gear did not intervene as a 12-mile-long column of cars and buses, with opposition and Serbian flags fluttering from the windows, ferried 15,000 people into the capital. </p> <p>At other roadblocks, lorries were pushed off the highway while demonstrators negotiated with police commanders to be allowed through. At one blockade, protesters overturned a police car into a ditch. Several thousand people were marching on foot towards Belgrade from the industrial city of Pancevo, six miles to the north. </p> <p>There were more defections to the opposition from the state-controlled media. The Dnevnik newspaper in northern Serbia carried reports on opposition activities and the wave of strikes and blockades. At the strikebound coal mine in Kolubara, where police first gave ground to the crush of opposition demonstrators on Wednesday night, the occupation by miners continued in defiance of the police who had taken over part of the complex in an attempt to prevent widespread power cuts. </p> <p>The strike committee in Kolubara decided to stay put rather than join in the march to Belgrade. \"We are not afraid, we have to keep up,\" a member, Zoran Cvetanovic, said. \"We want to keep our workers in the pits - we do not want them to go to Belgrade because we must persist in our demands and defend ourselves.\" </p> <p>Another strike leader said: \"There should be no confrontation with [the police]. If they know how to make the machines work, then they can make them work. We won't work until the true results of the presidential elections are recognised. Until Vojislav Kostunica is president.\" </p> <p>An opposition leader declared: \"We found the fire in Kolubara, this dynamite that has activated people all around Serbia.\" </p> <p>The 7,500 strikers at Kolubara understood what was at stake. \"I'm not afraid of the police. There's no reason to be afraid,\" said Miljana Ljuba, a 36-year-old who spent 17 years working the pits in a region that until last week solidly supported Mr Milosevic. \"The police are people, just like us. We are fighting for justice.\" </p> <p>\"We are not interested in bloodshed,\" said Milos Maksimovic, 35. \"Milosevic had enough in Bosnia and Croatia. I respect Mr Milosevic. In the past I voted for him. But now we need another man. The opposition is careful - and there will be no bloodshed.\" </p> <p>Under a moonlit night in the wasteland of the massive strip mine, Mr Milosevic's political game of 13 years finally looked to be up. Some strikers even shared a cigarette with police. </p> <p>The machines that dig the coal for the electricity-generating plant were still. The police lurked around the perimeters of the mine like ghosts of the force Mr Milosevic once used to suppress dissent. The miners had simply downed their tools. </p> <p>Ljubisa Petrovic, pensive with slate grey eyes and stubbled beard, worked in the eastern field, one of many mining strips in the complex. </p> <p>\"They called us from D field. They said they had stopped production and decided to strike,\" he said. \"Then everyone who was working stopped working in my field. We just want a confirmation of the opposition win. We know that the votes Milosevic claims were stolen.\" </p> <p>In Serbia's junior federal partner, Montenegro, the presidential adviser Miodrag Vukovic warned: \"Milosevic is still alive politically. He is more dangerous than ever.\" Against a background of fast-moving events, Mr Vukovic also suggested that Montenegro's union with Serbia was essentially dead. </p> <p>\"There is definitely no Yugoslavia,\" he said. \"In Montenegro everything is working perfectly, while Serbia is coming to a standstill. If Yugoslavia still existed we would probably be having anti-Milosevic demonstrations here, but we are not.\" </p> <p>Mr Vukovic said fears Mr Milosevic would stage a coup in this tiny coastal republic to divert attention from the election chaos in Serbia had subsided. \"We are past the worst. The soldiers are now back in their barracks.\" </p> <p>He added that if Mr Kostunica managed to wrest power from Mr Milosevic and wanted to be taken seriously as a democrat, he would need to overhaul all federal institutions and call new parliamentary elections. He said talks would be needed to establish a new union between Serbia and Montenegro. </p> <p>\"This entity need not be called Yugoslavia,\" he said. \"Montenegro is already independent economically and politically.\"</p>",
  "The popular revolt that exploded across Belgrade yesterday afternoon marked the end of Slobodan Milosevic's long rule of fear. After 13 years of lies, assassination, repression, and war-mongering, the Serbian people, bravely marching and striking in their hundreds of thousands, have finally demonstrated, once and for all, that they are no longer afraid of the \"butcher of the Balkans\". <p>The uprising was the culmination of a week of hitherto non-violent civil disobedience that united miners, industrial workers, students and shopkeepers in an unprecedented show of defiance. It reflected in effect a national refusal to accept the gerrymandered results of last month's presidential election. </p> <p>It was an expression of the long-suppressed yearning for change which Vojislav Kostunica, the opposition leader, successfully turned into a tidal wave of votes on September 24. It was, above all, a total, contemptuous and fearless rejection of one man. Mr Milosevic's sole remaining motivation now is his own fear, of retribution, assassination, of the waiting war crimes tribunal in The Hague. The question for him last night was whether to give in or fight back. His Socialist party insisted it would resist to the end by every means. But the outcome appeared to rest, crucially, on the reaction of the Yugoslav army, should it be ordered to send tanks against its own people. </p> <p>The cathartic trigger for this upheaval was the most egregious effort yet by Mr Milosevic to thwart the people's manifest will. Abandoning the charade of an electoral second round this Sunday, which the opposition was in any case determined to boycott, he prevailed on his cronies in the constitutional court to annul last month's result outright. Rather than order a recount, as Mr Kostunica demanded, the court has apparently ruled (although its precise intentions remain unclear) that a completely new election must be held some time between now and next July, when the president's mandate officially ends. This, in theory, could keep Mr Milosevic in power, buy time, could discourage and divide his opponents and may somehow defuse the bomb of popular will that threatens to blow him into oblivion. </p> <p>The court's ruling was immediately condemned by Mr Kostunica, who saw it as the trap it undoubtedly is; by Britain, which described it as an \"unacceptable device\"; and by the EU and the US. But significantly, the reaction in Moscow was quite different. Appearing to welcome the court's ruling, President Vladimir Putin reissued his invitation to Mr Milosevic and Mr Kostunica to go to Russia for trilateral talks. Apparently deaf to the virtually unanimous cry of the Serbian masses, Mr Putin's post-communist spokesmen suggested there would now be time for a calm discussion! </p> <p>Such trimming, such compromising, such appeasement is just as repulsive as the UN Balkan envoy's earlier suggestion that Mr Milosevic be given an amnesty. As the crowds stormed parliament, took over the state TV, and as police joined the protesters, many were convinced that it was just a matter of time, perhaps only hours, before the dictator cut and ran. Perhaps he is still deluded enough to think that he can hang on. Perhaps Mr Putin will at last be persuaded to stop playing politics and definitively pull the plug on Russia's ugliest ally. Last night Mr Kostunica boldly declared himself the new leader of a \"liberated Serbia\". Whether Mr Milosevic yet accepts that verdict is still in doubt. But one thing is certain: his power has gone, as surely as fear of him has fled. He is on his knees at last. He must be given no quarter.</p>"

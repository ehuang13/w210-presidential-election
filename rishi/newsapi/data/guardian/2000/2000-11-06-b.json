  "They may back different candidates or none at all, but the main US papers are as one in believing that the presidential race is simply too close to call. Certainly, the commentators are placing no bets. <p>Michael Tackett, political editor of the <a href=\"http://www.chicagotribune.com/\" target=\"_new\">Chicago Tribune</a>, admits he hasn't a clue about the likely outcome: \"For all the speeches delivered and miles logged, attacks levelled and promises made, the long, costly race for the White House remains in the final weekend as ill-defined as it is close. </p> <p>\"It's a big race about relatively small things. Not war or recession. Not a hostage crisis or long gasoline lines. Not a missile gap or civil rights. Instead, it has been a battle waged largely at the midfield of American politics with the seemingly dominant issues being the cost of seniors' prescriptions and the government's stewardship of Social Security.\"</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/\" target=\"_new\">Los Angeles Times</a> says the presidential contest is now \"down to the wire\" - a phrase much used on the front pages - and offers a vivid account of Al Gore's breakneck progress from state to state: \"With the race closer than any in decades, turnout is crucial for both sides. And it's most important in the tossup states where Gore and Bush appeared just hours apart over the campaign's final weekend. </p> <p>\"In their struggle for the 270 electoral votes needed to win, the campaigns have targeted swing areas of swing states so precisely that Gore stopped Sunday in the same Detroit suburb of Dearborn that Bush visited on Saturday. And here, as at every other stop, Gore told people their state was the one that could push him over the top.\"</p> <p>Rather cruelly, the paper also offers some reflections on losing the presidential contest, by some who have done just that: \"George S. McGovern, who lost resoundingly to Richard Nixon in 1972, recalls the silence, the loneliness. 'Where did all those voters go? Where were those huge crowds on election day?' he asks. 'You have a huge sense that the country deserted you and left you alone.'\" </p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.sfgate.com/chronicle/\" target=\"_new\">San Francisco Chronicle</a> offers hard evidence of the closeness of the race, reporting the latest poll in the vital state of California. It shows Mr Gore ahead of Mr Bush by five points, 46 to 41, with four points for Green Party candidate Ralph Nader, two points for Reform Party candidate Pat Buchanan and others, and seven points going to undecided voters. The poll, with a 3.3 percent margin of error, showed a two point slide for Mr Gore from a similar poll released last Thursday. </p> <p>The paper quotes poll director Mark DiCamillo: \"With each passing day over the past week and a half, Bush has gotten closer and closer in California. Where once California was seen as a safe Gore state...now it's more of a lean for Gore.\" </p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.dallasnews.com/\" target=\"_new\">Dallas Morning News</a> reports the staggering amounts of cash which has been poured into both campaigns: \" Add the sums raised by presidential campaigns, House and Senate candidates and the parties themselves, and the tab this year has already reached about $1.9bn - by far the most ever spent during a campaign and more than double that of 1992. Throw in the money spent by interest groups such as the National Rifle Association, pharmaceutical companies and Planned Parenthood, and the total swells to nearly $3bn, according to estimates.\" </p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.herald.com/\" target=\"_new\">Miami Herald</a> is understandably focused on the surprisingly close race in Florida, where Mr Bush is struggling to maintain his early lead, in spite of his brother Jeb being the popular state governor. \"Bush's trip to Florida in the final days of the closest presidential contest in four decades and Gore's midnight rally in South Beach tonight are a measure of how critical the state and its 25 electoral [college] votes have become to the victory of either candidate on Tuesday. Vice-president Gore has also included Florida in his final 30-hour, seven-state, non-stop frenzy of campaigning.\" </p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/\" target=\"_new\">New York Times</a> reports the other frantic last-gasp campaign on its doorstep, between Hillary Rodham Clinton and Rick Lazio for the US Senate. It has a colourful account of the first lady's Sunday dash round churches to encourage the overwhelmingly Democrat black vote: \"The same striking scene was replayed again and again throughout the day: the wife of the president of the United States sweeping into Baptist churches in some of the most impoverished neighbourhoods of New York, to a rustle of excitement and raised hands and a swell of organ music and gospel song.\" </p> <p>Amid the frenzied claims and counterclaims, there is still space for humour, albeit of a caustic kind. The <a href=\"http://www.freep.com/\" target=\"_new\"> Detroit Free Press</a> features a cartoon in which a television interviewer asks a man on the street which candidate he prefers. He answers: \"Drew Barrymore - she's easily the best of the new Charlie's Angels.\"</p> <p>The paper also conducted a straw poll of 20 people to find how much they knew about the electoral college; the 540-member body which will choose the new president. Only two of the respondents had a clue. A waitress and customer at the nearby Clique restaurant shook their heads in puzzlement. \"I have no idea,\" said the customer, whose first name was Vera. \"Did you try the Yellow Pages?\" </p>",
  "With the presidential contest still neck and neck, less than 24 hours before the United States votes, Al Gore and George W Bush are making a final push through battleground states. <p>The Republican candidate promised \"a sprint to the finish,\" while his Democratic rival told audiences that it was time \"to move your feet.\"</p> <p>Both candidates emphasised the need to energise their core supporters and reach still-undecided voters. \"We've laid the groundwork for victory, now it's up (to us) to get people to the polls,\" said Mr Bush, leaving Florida - a state both candidates are desperate to win - for the last time before the election. </p> <p>A Bush strategist, Karl Rove, said that Republicans had concentrated on get-out-the-vote efforts in the campaign's final days, placing 70m phone calls to voters, sending out 110m items of mail and mobilising 243,000 volunteers in 28 battleground states. </p> <p>While both candidates have full schedules, Mr Gore went a step further, campaigning around the clock. Well past midnight, in a wind-blown cold rain, he hustled across airport tarmac to greet some 700 flag-waving supporters in Iowa.</p> <p>\"I'm going to be brief,\" he promised. \"I want you to save some energy to take your neighbours to the polls and I want you to convince all of the undecided voters you encounter over the next 24 hours and more, because this race is close.\" </p> <p>Mr Gore stood under a black umbrella meeting workers as they reported for work at a tractor plant. He grinned when a red pickup truck slowed in the street and its driver shouted, \"Give George Bush hell tomorrow!\"</p> <p>After appearing on a string of TV talk shows, he flew off to campaign in Missouri, Michigan and Florida. Tomorrow morning he plans to hold a dawn election day gathering in Tampa, Florida. </p> <p>\"The last formal campaign stop of campaign 2000, after my opponent's gone to bed, is going to be in central Florida, because that's where the future is going to be written,\" he insisted. </p> <p>George Bush spent the night in Orlando after a five-city blitz through Florida, the most populous swing state. Earlier, the Texas governor campaigned in Tennessee, Wisconsin, Iowa and Arkansas before returning to his home in Austin, Texas.</p> <p>The Republican presidential nominee drew large, enthusiastic crowds at each of his Florida stops. National polls give him a narrow edge in the presidential race, but Gore's support in large battleground states has led to an unpredictable race to 270 electoral votes and victory.</p> <p><b>Useful links</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.algore2000.com/\" target=\"_new\">Al Gore 2000</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.bush2000.com/\" target=\"_new\">George Bush 2000</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/US_election_race/Story/0,2763,393177,00.html\">A slavish press connives to hide GW's shady side</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/US_election_race/Story/0,2763,393361,00.html\">Gore's last plea to the great undecided</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/US_election_race/Story/0,2763,381260,00.html\">Net election</a></p>",
  "<p>I had been hassling BT Openworld's press office for an ADSL connection since August (allegedly they are so popular with journalists that there's a waiting list stretching up to Christmas). So when, two weeks ago, a phone call came out of the blue from a BT engineer, saying he was round the corner and was ready to fit me up, I didn't even mind that it was 8am and I was still dreaming. After all, I was about to be initiated in the joys of always-on, flat-rate, super-fast broadband access - the internet as God (or Microsoft) had always intended it. </p> <p>In the UK, ADSL (Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line) is supplied by BT, HomeChoice and a few ISPs, although from next year 14 other companies, including Cable and Wireless, Easynet, Telewest, NTL and MCI Worldcom, will begin installing their equipment in BT's local exchanges and rolling out retail services. The central benefits of BT's IPStream include speeds up to 10 times faster than a good modem, with 500 kbps downstream and 250 kbps upstream, and the ability to use the phone simultaneously, as well as enabling the use of rich media such as webcasts and video clips. </p> <p>The jury is still out on whether ADSL is the most suitable connection for small businesses, let alone domestic use. It has major drawbacks, say its detractors: it's clunky for two-way communications such as video-conferencing; it makes systems highly vulnerable to malicious hacking and as yet BT doesn't offer a Firewall protection plan; it suffers frequently from \"Crosstalk\" (when telecom signals interfere with each other) and \"brownouts\" (when there are bandwidth \"log jams\"), although BT claims these problems will disappear this month when it switches all internet connections to a new network. There are even doubts that BT wants ADSL to become mass market since, as the various \"surftime\" packages have proven, it will put an enormous strain on the network. In some central areas, connection speeds have already dropped by 25% because of broadband, which is \"bandwidth competitive\". </p> <p>Since my surfing habits have been doubling my quarterly phone bill, I worked out that even with the \u00a3150 installation fee and the \u00a339.99 a month USB-type subscription, ADSL would be worth it. Conven tional surftime packages just don't work for freelancers who use the net heavily in the day. </p> <p>One week, six hour-long phone calls to Openworld's support line and several technology-induced tantrums later, having still failed to find anyone who could tell me how I could pick up my email from my existing Demon account through my new BTClick ISP (one even suggested there was a software clash), and having enjoyed only 20 minutes of spontaneous, free-flowing access before the connection disappeared altogether, I was starting to feel like a long-suffering rail commuter in the comfort of my own home. </p> <p>Apparently the local area server was down and it took engineers three days to rectify the problem. It was restored on Monday, only to be replaced by another BT recorded message saying it was \"experiencing network connection problems\" and if I was calling about anything else, I should hang on (what for - a chat?) - at which point, I reverted to using my old 56k modem, which at least I knew I could trust. </p> <p>Admittedly, it is early days for BT, which promises to have overcome all teething problems by the time it hard launches early next year. And you can't really blame the poor techies stuck in a low-rent call centre in Aberdeen. One of them confessed that he had never seen an ADSL connection in his life (they are too remote) and wasn't allowed to surf at work any more since the Orange- gate staff porn scandal - he had nothing but a manual to work from! I am still hugely grateful to Jamie who taught me handy PC-rage tips such as wrapping it in bubble wrap before punching the life out of it and putting a rope around the base of the terminal before throttling it. </p> <p>Technical grouches aside, how did broadband actually enhance my experience of the internet? Ironically, one of the first rich media delights I got to sample (once the servers were up again, and I had downloaded RealPlayer Plus) was a Reuters video news broadcast about how Openworld would \"dramatically influence the way people work\", with secure environments for online transactions, video conferencing, and so on. BT is marketing the business package hard at \u00a399.99 a month. </p> <p>The first noticeable improvement is speed. I am connected at 576,000 bps (10 times faster than usual, although it can drop to 56,000 at certain times of day), and have been for seven hours and 30 minutes. I am listening to an ABC news broadcast about the US election as I type, and simultaneously searching the archives of newspapers. Which is pretty cool. My email problem now resolved, messages flow in and out as easily as water from a tap. There's another one now - probably more spam from sites such as Shockwave, AtomFilms and MP3, to which I now feel obliged to subscribe. </p> <p>The problem with most UK media sites is that they are still stuck in the 20th century - functional, html-based and pretty shallow. I can now listen to any BBC radio channel as I work, which is great, except that ADSL can be disabled by interference from AM signals. I tried in vain to find the promised broadband offerings from the likes of Channel 4, Carlton Interactive and Granada Broadband, but they appear to be months behind schedule. Virtual newscaster Ananova, however, is a total switch-off - like listening to the synthetic female voice of the speaking clock reading a bedtime story, and her green hair and relentless bulletins about the Beckhams make one feel quite queasy. Reuters video news and <a href=\"http://www.ITN.com\">www.ITN.com</a> were exciting for live-action breaking news, with storm reports from around the country, but it has more impact when you watch it on TV. </p> <p> Yet again, you have to look to American sites for a more satisfying streaming media experience. The US has had broadband for a couple of years and there is already a good range of channels such as CNN and ABC news, the Discovery Channel (with live coverage of the Ebola crisis in Africa) and Space.com (the latest transmissions from Mars) and, best of all, Comedy Central, where you can get South Park on tap and Jon Stewart's Daily Show, satirical coverage of the presidential election which has become cult viewing. Download times are 15 times faster - quick enough for you to hang on rather than give up, making the whole experience dangerously addictive. </p> <p>Street.TV, a style and culture channel, is one of the UK's first tentative broadband offerings. But with low-grade live interviews with the likes of singer Sophie Ellis- Bextor and Sadie Frost (yet again) on how great it is being married to Jude, and some non-event fashion show coverage, it's hardly the kind of must-see viewing that would drag you away from Jerry Springer even. Lack of quality control will continue to be a problem with internet media. </p> <p>What the net now does really well is comedy, underground film and satire, as evidenced by the rash of online film and media clubs. There are hours of fun to be had checking out the spoof trailers in <a href=\"http://www.trailervision.com,\">www.trailervision.com,</a> such as American Booty (Man Falls Madly in Love with Fat Ass), the Hollywood spoofs on <a href=\"http://www.Ifilm.com\">www.Ifilm.com</a> (the Oz Witch Project, in which DVD-toting Dorothy gets Toto, Tinman, Lion and Scarecrow into a spot of bother in the woods, is a brilliant foil to Blair Witch 2), and <a href=\"http://www.Shockwave.com\">www.Shockwave.com</a> and <a href=\"http://www.MediaTrip.com\">www.MediaTrip.com</a> are great for pop video spoofs and new animation. There is no doubt that the new South Park is out there somewhere. </p> <p>Good British sites such as <a href=\"http://www.thejunkies.com\">www.thejunkies.com</a> and <a href=\"http://www.madcowTV.com\">www.madcowTV.com</a> are beginning to sprout, but it will be another six months before broadband content is good enough to justify an ADSL connection in the home (and before the prices become competitive). In the short term, the most obvious consumer benefit would be multi- terminal connections for libraries and schools, but at the current price it is unlikely to happen.</p>",
  "If this is Sunday, it must be Philadelphia. Or Michigan. Or Iowa. His eyes almost closed from exhaustion, his voice sometimes cracking and his trademark plea of \"I need your help\" sounding more and more heart-felt, Al Gore is squeezing every last moment from the day and the night as he swings one last time through the states that could go either way. <p>It falls to the Rev Albert Campbell, pastor of the Mount Carmel Baptist church in the black area of West Philadelphia, to make the early morning introduction of the vice-president after invoking an even higher authority. </p> <p>\"Work your will, Lord, this election time,\" Mr Campbell implores as he stands before one of the city's finest gospel choirs, \"because what we do, dear God, has impact on all the world\". </p> <p>Al Gore, looking just like a man who has had to exist on between two and five hours' sleep a night and big doses of coffee and political adrenaline, takes up the religious theme in the packed church by telling the congregation that \"the day and is drawing nigh, the one day every four years when the people have the power\". He reminds them of the words of St Paul to the Galatians: \"Be not weary in well doing.\" </p> <p>Weary in every other respect, the Democratic party's presidential candidate has subjected himself to this desperately punishing schedule buoyed by a late feeling in his team that victory is still within his grasp if he can but claim the \"toss-up states\". </p> <p>Nowhere is closer than Pennsylvania, where the latest local opinion survey shows Mr Gore at 43% compared to 42% for his Republican opponent, George W Bush, and 8% for the Green party standard-bearer, Ralph Nader. </p> <p>With its 23 votes in the electoral college - the body reflecting the popular vote in each state which then elects the president - Pennsylvania could even swing the result. That is why its biggest city is playing host this Sunday to three Gorerallies. </p> <p>This last weekend started in Aimes, Iowa, on Friday. By the time Air Force II touched down in the early evening drought-breaking rain at Memphis airport that night, Mr Gore had already delivered his standard speech in three states. The visit to his home state of Tennessee should not have been necessary, but the polls have put Mr Bush just ahead there. </p> <p>The vice-president has become more expansive with the travelling press since the summer, but his message now is very much over the heads of the media and towards the great undecided. </p> <p>The crowd of around 2,000 in Court Square in downtown Memphis has been serenaded by no less then the Rev Al Green, Preston Shannon and Ruby Wilson, the cream of soul and rhythm and blues here. </p> <p>Wilson refers to Al Gore as our \"homeboy\" although homeboy may not be the first - or even the 101st - description that springs to mind when the vice-president bounds on stage with his wife Tipper and his daughter Kristin, a comedy script writer in Los Angeles. </p> <p>Memphis is a predominantly black town and that is reflected in the crowd. The rally has been arranged at speed - campaign headquarters in every swing state have been put on alert for a visit. </p> <p>The Team Tennessee youngsters working for Mr Gore and his running mate Joseph Lieberman have to make sure that the placards - tonight they say \"Tipper Rocks\", whatever that means - are handed out to willing hands to wave when the camera lights hit them. </p> <p>Mr Gore's voice has started to go - it cracks a couple of times during a speech delivered jacketless despite the damp. He finishes with the standard: \"I may not be the most exciting politician in the world - like Willie Herenton [the dashing local mayor] - but I will work for you each day and I will fight for you with all my heart.\" </p> <p>The Gore team is deliberately making no comment on the drink-driving story that has emerged from Mr Bush's distant past, but privately there is much glee, not least because of the Bush TV commercial beaming out in Tennessee tonight, which has him saying: \"I believe we need to encourage personal responsibility so people are accountable for their own actions.\" </p> <p>There's not much sleep in these final hours. Mr Gore will get between the sheets too late even to see Madonna endorsing him on Dave Letterman's Late Show: \"I'm a chick so who [else] would I vote for?\" </p> <p>Grey dawn Saturday, and a prayer meeting at the Peabody Hotel, Memphis. Then the motorcade takes Mr Gore out of his home state, his campaign here possibly concluded. He may not returns until he casts his vote in Carthage tomorrow. </p> <p>The motorcade blue-lights its way to the airport for a flight to Huntington, West Virginia. Here a small rally has supporters arranged strategically behind the vice-president nodding and smiling like loyal bankbenchers during televised question time in the House of Commons. </p> <p>Then there is the private trip to watch Al Junior playing football for his high school team in Washington, and finally on to chilly Pittsburgh. \"It ain't really cold, it just acts that way,\" the bearded airport employee tells the shivering arrivals. \"You've all been down in the South too long.\" </p> <p>The Wesley Centre African Methodist Episcopalian Zion church is the first stop here and has honoured Mr Gore with another stellar gospel choir singing Blessed Lord and O Happy Day as he arrives almost dead on time. </p> <p>If this race was decided on who has the best musical accompaniment Mr Gore would win by a landslide. Mr Bush's best shot so far seems to have been Hank Williams Jr: those heirs to famous names must stick together. </p> <p>The clear strategy in these last few days is no longer just to deliver the message, for everyone in these churches is converted, but to get people to persuade everyone they know to vote. Mr Gore presses the buttons again: affirmative action, Martin Luther King, Gandhi, the tragedy of Africa's Tutsis and the Hutus, the need for hate-crime legislation, his boyhood horror at seeing rings for tying up slaves in a mansion on the hill in Carthage, the threat to civil rights if Mr Bush is elected and appoints conservative judges to the supreme court. </p> <p>The last rally of Saturday is with another solid Democratic sector, the unions. They have organised a bash in Pittsburgh's Hot Metal Street. Here the audience is much whiter, big men from this old steel city in baseball caps and jackets, promising to get out the vote on the day. </p> <p>This is not so much a marathon as a steeplechase, vaulting the time and weather zones and plunging through the cold water of public scepticism. The finishing post is in sight. But first it's off to Fairmount park in the heart of the city of Brotherly Love on this glorious autumn day. </p> <p>On the whole, WC Fields said in his famous epitaph, I'd rather be in Philadelphia. On the whole, Al Gore would rather be anywhere than buried by George W Bush.So, one more time, the voice cracking: \"I will fight for you! I need your help!\" as Air Force II prepares to take off for the last destination of the day, a place in Iowa called Waterloo.</p>",
  "Two weeks ago the singer Paul Weller, once of the Jam, was arrested in connection with the rape of a 36-year-old woman, four years ago. It made the front pages of some of the tabloids. Last week the police announced that he would not face any charges. Needless to say, that decision didn't get the same coverage. <p>Weller, understandably miffed, has called for the law to grant male rape suspects the same anonymity as that given to their alleged victims. His case is all the stronger because he was not even charged. There is nothing new in his demand, of course. Celebrities (such as Craig Charles of Red Dwarf) and non-celebrities (Austen Donnellan, accused of the date rape of a fellow student) who have gone through the ordeal of a highly publicised trial before being acquitted, have made similar points. Why should the name of the accused be, as it is always put, dragged through the mud when he is innocent, while the woman complainant who has told a pack of lies keeps her name secret? </p> <p>There is a superficial attraction in the equality argument: either do not reveal the rapist's name unless and until he is convicted (which is the practice in some countries) or, if his name is public, disclose the woman's identity if he is acquitted. </p> <p>It is a flawed argument. First, the fact that the man is acquitted does not necessarily mean that the woman is lying. It could be that the jury thought he had probably done it, but there was not enough evidence to be sure, beyond a reasonable doubt. Second, the reason for allowing rape complainants anonymity is to persuade women to report rapes; without that concession the reporting rate would be even lower than it is now. But if women knew their names would be revealed if their attackers were - perhaps wrongly - acquitted, they would surely think twice before reporting sexual attacks. </p> <p>This leaves one argument: why not keep an alleged rapist's identity secret until his conviction? We have a system of open justice in this country which, we rightly believe, is one of the hallmarks of a democratic society. Open justice means that the identities of those accused of crime are publicly known. Many of them will be innocent. Having their names bandied about will be embarrassing and sometimes devastating, whether they are charged with theft, murder, fraud or rape. But there is no reason for treating the alleged rapist more favourably than the alleged thief or fraudster. Unwelcome publicity is the price we pay for democracy. </p> <p> I'm impressed by a robust House of Lords ruling the other day on the freedom of the press. If this is a portent of the future attitude of the law lords, and of their leader, Lord Bingham, it is good news indeed. </p> <p>The case was about whether or not a journalist could be successfully sued for libel for his report of a press conference at which defamatory comments were made about the Belfast solicitors' firm that had represented the paratrooper Lee Clegg. The Northern Ireland appeal court had ruled that the press conference was not a \"public meeting\" and therefore reporting it didn't attract the \"qualified privilege\" that protects the reporter from a libel claim. The five law lords unanimously decided otherwise - it was a public meeting, with the reporters acting as \"the eyes and ears of the public\"; they therefore couldn't be sued for providing a fair and accurate account of it. </p> <p>Lord Bingham stressed the \"cardinal importance of press freedom\" and added: \"The proper functioning of a modern partici- patory democracy requires that the media be free, active, professional and inquiring.\" We're not accustomed to such talk from our judges. </p> <p> The result of the American presidential election could have a profound effect on future decisions of the US supreme court. The president appoints the judges and he chooses people likely to support his own agenda. And because the judges take decisions over such a wide range of issues with social consequences - the right to abortion is just one - it is no exaggeration to say that the make-up of the supreme court can influence the very fabric of American life. </p> <p>The astonishing thing about the court is that its judges are appointed for life (it used to be so here, but now law lords have to retire at 70) so that a new appointment can only be made when a judge decides to retire or dies. Two judges may be close to going, the 80-year-old Justice Stevens and the 76-year-old Chief Justice Rehnquist. At the moment, the nine-person court (including two women) is - just - weighted towards a \"liberal\" stance. </p> <p>But if Bush gets in and the liberal Stevens leaves, he will almost certainly be replaced by a \"conservative\", which would immediately tilt the balance. One of the consequences will be an attempt to claw back the abortion rights given to women by the momentous decision in Roe versus Wade. If Bush does win, the liberal (usually Democrat), hope will be that the conservative Rehnquist goes first. If he is replaced by a like-minded judge, it won't alter the balance. I look forward to the day when I'll be writing such analytical items about our judges in their new UK supreme court identities. It won't be long. </p> <p> Just a gentle reminder to the many thousands of broadcasters, journalists, politicians, famous people and members of the public who have, in the past few weeks, informed me, through the various media and on a variety of subjects, that the \"law is an ass\" - Charles Dickens wrote no such thing. \"If the law supposes that,\" said Mr Bumble in Oliver Twist, \"the law is a ass, a idiot.\"</p>"

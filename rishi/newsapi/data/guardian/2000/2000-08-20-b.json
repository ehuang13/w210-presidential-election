  "Al Gore, now installed as Democratic candidate for the US presidency, has more to worry about than just George W Bush. There is also a potential threat from a third-party candidate. Not from the Reform party, founded by Ross Perot but now hopelessly split, with two rival factions claiming its candidacy, but from Ralph Nader, the veteran consumer crusader, running now on a green ticket. <p>Some analysts warn that Nader could do serious damage to Gore, especially by bleeding off votes he needs to take California. </p> <p> Nader could have that kind of effect without coming anywhere near the success of Perot, who in 1992 took 19% of the popular vote - the largest share for any third-party candidate in the 20th century. Yet Perot failed even then to break the two-party mould, as he had hoped.</p> <p> The last third force to do that was the Republican party. In the exceptional crisis of the 1850s over slavery, the existing parties collapsed, allowing Abraham Lincoln to take the presidency in 1860 with only 39% of the popular vote and no support at all in 10 of the 33 states which then existed. </p> <p>After that, the system evolved precisely to make it hard for such disintegration to happen again. In the 20th century no third party - populist, progressive, socialist or communist - succeeded in mounting a serious challenge to the major parties. </p> <p>Nader - articulate, experienced and above all honest - hopes to equal or even surpass Perot's performance eight years ago. But to have that kind of popular effect he would need to win a majority of the popular vote in a populous state, such as California, Texas or New York, or even a middle-size state, such as Illinois or Ohio. He would also have to do it in a close-fought election. </p> <p>The American constitution stipulates that when the polls close on November 7, 540 members of an electoral college must meet to choose the president. This is usually a formality. But, as in any first-past-the-post election, if more than two candidates are contending, it is possible that no one will win more than half the vote. Only by custom and practice, not by law, do college members follow the popular vote in their states, since the whole idea of the electoral college was to modify the tyranny of majorities. </p> <p>Were Bush and Gore to win states with a roughly equal number of college votes, third-party intervention could be decisive. If a third-party candidate were to win states which gave him or her 40 votes in the electoral college, with Bush and Gore winning 250 each, the college could not elect a new president. </p> <p>In such a case, the House of Representatives would decide, with each Congress-person free to choose between the top two candidates in the college - in this case, Bush and Gore. That has only happened once - in 1824, when there were five major candidates - although the 1876 presidential election was finally decided only by a special federal commission. </p> <p>Fringe third parties always run candidates for president, but only two have made any national impact. In 1948, Governor Strom Thurmond of South Carolina, running as an insurgent Democrat against Harry Truman, carried his own state plus Alabama, Louisiana and Mississippi. Though Truman narrowly won that election, Thurmond's intervention revealed the strength of white southern resistance to affirmative action on civil rights and helped slow the pace of racial integration during the 1950s. </p> <p>Mindful of Thurmond's example, in 1968 Governor George Wallace of Alabama ran as an insurgent southern Democrat. He won the same states as Thurmond 20 years earlier and took 13% of the popular vote nationally. Wallace's support in southern cities was impressive, including more than a third of the vote in towns in Arkansas, Florida, North Carolina and Tennessee. Nixon just scraped into the White House, however. In 1972, Wallace did well in Democratic primaries in Maryland, Florida and Michigan, this last state revealing working-class support in the industrial north. He looked poised to surpass his 1968 performance until a madman shot him and ended his political career. </p> <p>Wallace was a dangerous racist demagogue who articulated the hopes, fears and grievances of millions of white Americans, the working poor in every community and state who felt excluded from conventional politics. These \"forgotten Americans\", lacking secure employment, health care and opportunity, resent the fact that they do not share in the abundance of American life and hate paying taxes for welfare they do not receive. Wallace paved the way for those \"Democrats for Reagan\" who, in the 1980s, finally brought to an end the Democratic coalition that had elected Franklin Roosevelt, Harry Truman, John Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson. </p> <p>What chance does Nader have in November of breaking the present political mould? Though history is a poor guide to political prediction, it would be very surprising if Nader made much impact. He is not speaking for \"forgotten Americans\" but for a minority of middle-class voters fed up with meaningless domestic politics. </p> <p>Perot's share of the vote in 1992 failed to carry a single state, and, by taking more votes from the older George Bush than from his then largely unknown opponent Bill Clinton, Perot helped Clinton's clever and eventually victorious campaign. Eight years later much depends on whether Nader can get himself on the ballot in every state. Even so, American protest voters look more likely to reveal themselves by failing to vote than by casting a protest vote for a third-party activist like Nader. </p> <p>\u0095 Patrick Renshaw is reader in American history at Sheffield University </p> <p> <a href=\"mailto:comment@theguardian.com\"> comment@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "Al Gore has surged into an opinion poll lead over George W Bush in the American presidential election race following his successful performance at the Democratic convention in Los Angeles last week. <p>Mr Gore leads his Republican rival by 48% to 42% according to a poll of registered voters for Newsweek magazine, with the Green candidate, Ralph Nader, on 3% and Pat Buchanan of the Reform party on 1%. </p> <p>In a second poll released yesterday, this time of likely voters, a new Gallup/CNN survey has Mr Gore leading by one point. Mr Gore is on 47% with Mr Bush on 46%, Mr Nader on 3% and Mr Buchanan on 2%. </p> <p>While such a post-convention poll \"bounce\" is normal, the finding is nevertheless a major relief to the Gore camp, which has trailed behind Mr Bush in all but a handful of polls for most of the past year. </p> <p>\"Obviously we're encouraged by the polls,\" Gore campaign manager William Daley said , \"but the only poll that matters is on November 7.\" </p> <p>In a straight contest with Mr Bush, Mr Gore leads by 52% to 44%. The Democratic candidate's ratings on likeability and honesty have also enjoyed a big boost. </p> <p>Mr Gore spent the weekend campaigning down the Mississippi river, visiting states likely to be crucial in determining the election outcome. Mr Bush visited Tennessee. </p> <p>The locations underlined the way both candidates intend to campaign. Mr Gore and Mr Bush will spend a disproportionate amount of time in the block of swing states from Wisconsin to New Jersey. </p> <p>The camps also have a list of states on which they have not given up, even though they are leaning towards their opponent. For Mr Gore, this category includes Florida, Georgia and North Carolina, while Mr Bush will target Oregon, Arkansas, West Virginia and even California. The decision to campaign in these states is motivated as much by a need to force the other man to spend funds on advertising as by the likelihood of victory. </p> <p>Aides are discussing the number and format of televised debates between the candidates. The federal election commission has proposed three debates in October, with one vice-presidential match-up. The Democrats have accepted Mr Bush's proposal for a second debate between the two running-mates.</p>",
  "They simply can't resist it, can they? Tony Blair and Cherie, walking hand in hand the day after Labour won the general election in 1997; Al Gore and Tipper, snogging on the podium at the Democratic convention in Los Angeles last week. In the latter case, the subtext was so loud it might as well have been broadcast over loudspeakers: I am a happily married family man. I am not, repeat not, Bill Clinton. Thus was another hostage given to fortune, another politician publicly committed to family values - territory already staked out by Gore's choice of Joe Lieberman, a socially conservative Orthodox Jew, as his running mate. But these values are quite at odds with how most people actually conduct their lives. <p>Few of us have perfect marriages. Americans are as prone as the rest of us to serial relationships, although their apparently innate, can-do optimism means they just keep on getting married, sometimes four or five times. But it is not only marriage that fails to conform to the happy families model so beloved of politicians in search of votes - including, although it is scarcely credible with hindsight, William Jefferson Clinton, on the stump with Hillary back in 1992. Many voters are parents of teenage children who stay out late, occasionally drink too much and wake up the neighbours when they finally arrive home. </p> <p>This is normal behaviour, even in a politician's family. It is awkward and embarrassing only if the politician in question is given to delivering homilies about parental responsibility and the evils of drink. It is hard to avoid the conclusion that this unfortunate conjunction, as much as concern over media intrusion, lay behind Downing Street's stern denials at the weekend that the prime minister's eldest son had annoyed other guests at an Italian hotel when he returned in the early hours from a nightclub. Blair's spin machine could easily have shrugged off the whole thing, pointing out that the boy is 16 and on holiday. </p> <p>Instead, reports in the Italian press of rowdy behaviour were categorically denied by Downing Street and the family friends who were entertaining Euan on the island of Ponza. They were contradicted in turn by staff at the hotel where the incident occurred; one of them said that the prime minister's son had been \"horsing around\", and another guest had complained about being woken up at 5am. Result: prime minister with more egg on face, and the story about a troubled teenager in the Blair household, which the couple are desperate to conceal, is starting to shape up nicely. </p> <p>This is unpleasant for Euan, but it is his parents' habitual over-reaction that has created a quite possibly erroneous impression. Blair's recent behaviour suggests that he is quite happy to interfere in our private lives, but does not like it when the press returns the compliment. Downing Street's initial reaction last month, when Euan was found drunk in Leicester Square while his mother was on holiday and his father burned the midnight oil over a speech he was due to deliver next day to an audience of evangelical Christians - a particularly exquisite touch, that - was to bluster and threaten. </p> <p>Downing Street performed a volte face only when advisers realised that the event had taken place in public and involved the police, which meant there was an official record. Moreover, any attempt to warn off journalists would look like a frantic cover-up, coming so soon after the prime minister's preposterous suggestion that drunks should be marched to the nearest cash machine and forced to reveal their PIN numbers. It is unusual for a politician's foray into contemporary morality to backfire quite so speedily, but one of the things even Labour voters dislike about this government is its preachy tone. (No drugs! No squeegee merchants! Don't drink too much! Do you know where your children are?) </p> <p>You would imagine, by now, that even the most uxorious politician, blessed with grown-up offspring who were currently working as volunteers in an inaccessible region of Cambodia, would steer clear of the elephant traps their predecessors have fallen into. Every government, every administration, has a David Mellor or a Dick Morris lurking in its ranks, waiting for an inquisitive journalist to reveal assignations with an actress or, in Morris's case, with a prostitute. Sometimes, as in Clinton's case, it is the top man himself who is a sexual predator and perjurer, but then access to women has long been regarded as a secret perk of American presidents. I am thinking not just of the priapic John F Kennedy but Thomas Jefferson, co-author of the Declaration of Independence, who covertly fathered several children with a mixed-race slave, Sally Hemings. </p> <p> When it comes to blurring the boundary between public and private, it is almost always politicians who are first out of the starting gate. Before he even got within sniffing distance of the White House, Richard Nixon, then a vice-presidential candidate, went on TV in 1952 to make his famous \"Checkers\" speech, a mawkish attempt to quash rumours of a private slush fund. Nixon admitted that the family had received a gift, a cocker spaniel that his six-year-old daughter had named Checkers, and declared defiantly that \"the kids love the dog and we're gonna keep it\". What he failed to mention, in a touching account of his family's straitened circumstances, was accepting a $100,000 bribe from a Romanian industrialist. </p> <p>It is not that every politician has skeletons on this scale lurking in the family closet. Some just have embarrassing relations, like Jimmy Carter's feckless brother or Margaret Thatcher's son, Mark, who famously reduced her to tears when he got lost in a desert. Thatcher, not usually regarded as a maternal figure, even won sympathy for this rare show of emotion in public. </p> <p>But the lessons from history are clear. In the past, politicians could rely on a compliant press to accept their skilful manipulations of family life at face value. This is no longer the case, nor should it be. If presidents and prime ministers parade their wives and children when it suits them, they cannot expect the media to look away when it transpires that they are not quite perfect husbands or parents. </p> <p>All Euan Blair has done, this summer, is behave like a teenager who has recently finished his exams. Like many adolescents, he is occasionally thoughtless and, judging by what happened last month, not yet accustomed to alcohol. The problem Downing Street is currently trying to handle, badly, is not Euan but his father. If the prime minister would like to remove himself and his government from our private lives, I'm sure most of us would be very happy to get out of his. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:comment@theguardian.com\">comment@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "Without fanfare Britain and the United States have resumed their bombing of Iraq. Whether or not the official Iraqi reports that the latest attacks killed civilians are true, the bombing is unnecessary and reckless. <p>After long debate the United Nations passed a resolution many months ago setting up a new inspection system designed mainly to check Iraqi progress in dismantling its weapons of mass destruction and the potential to re-create them. The inspectors have recruited their team and will soon be ready to visit Baghdad. Although Iraq has not yet said it will accept them, for some weeks it has not repeated its statements rejecting the resolution that set up the inspection team. There is therefore an opportunity that could make it easier for the team to start work. </p> <p>Air attacks on Iraq at this moment cannot help the climate. To claim, as the United States and Britain do, that they contain no political message and are merely a technically triggered reaction to the fact that Iraqi defences have locked on to the planes is disingenuous. The aircraft that patrol the two no-fly zones over Iraq are under political control and Washington and London could easily reduce the number of flights. </p> <p>Britain and the United States should also take more seriously the questions which the Iraqis have raised about the new inspectors. When the council authorised the team, the aim was to find a quicker way of achieving compliance and ending the international sanctions, which have dragged on for almost 10 years. It is true that the sanctions have been eased but they are still in force and doing serious harm to ordinary people, though very little to the regime. Iraq wants to know whether there is a finite term in sight if it cooperates with the inspectors or whether it is entering another tunnel in which objections will constantly be raised. </p> <p>The American presidential election complicates the matter since neither candidate wants to appear weak. But the Iraqi bogy has fortunately lost much of its resonance in American politics and there is no reason why sensitive diplomacy at the United Nations should suddenly explode into a campaign issue. Rather than sending warplanes over Iraq the United States and Britain should be sending signals to their UN missions to urge the secretary-general to answer Iraq's legitimate questions.</p>",
  "<p><strong> Are American interest rates likely to rise again this week?</strong><br> America's central bank, the Federal Reserve, meets tomorrow, and under normal circumstances with inflation running at 3.5%, an interest rate increase would be on the cards. But circumstances are not normal; there is a presidential election in just over two months and many analysts think the Federal Reserve will hold fire until after polling day. </p> <p><strong> Isn't the Federal Reserve supposed to be completely independent from political pressure?</strong></p> <p>Alan Greenspan didn't get to be one of the world's oldest central bankers by being politically naive; the Democrats would not thank him if he spoiled their best campaigning line - the strength of the US economy - by hinting that it was time for the party to wind down a little. As well as being bad political timing, a rate rise now might well be unnecessary, according to the optimists on the Federal Reserve's open markets committee, which argues that the economy is heading for a soft landing. </p> <p><strong> What is a soft landing?</strong><br> The scenario in which the economy slows down of its own accord without the Federal Reserve needing to rein it in with higher borrowing costs. Most economists agree that the US cannot go on growing at this pace - last quarter the economy expanded at an annual rate of more than 5% - without some inflationary strains starting to emerge. </p> <p><strong> Are there any signs of a slowdown?</strong><br> The second-quarter figures, even though they show torrid growth, appear to suggest that household spending is slowing down - which is good news for optimists. Job creation appears to be slowing down, too. Other economists argue that the economy may have slowed down, but it is operating way above the speed limit. </p> <p><strong> What speed limit?</strong><br> The level of growth consistent with stable inflation. Most economists believe that if an economy grows too fast it will overheat. Pessimists argue that the US has passed that point, and it's time for the Federal Reserve to apply the brakes. It has raised rates six times in the last year, to 6.5%, and they believe at least one more increase is necessary to achieve a slow-down. </p> <p><strong> What do the optimists say?</strong><br> That the IT revolution has brought about a step change in economic efficiency, with the result that the economy can expand at a faster rate without generating inflation. </p> <p><strong> Is there any evidence to back this up?</strong><br> US productivity levels are at their highest in 17 years. Some sceptics say, however, that the apparent productivity miracle is a mirage which will dissolve when the economy slows down. Productivity tends to accelerate at the peak of an economic cycle because, with all available workers sucked into employment, firms drive their existing workforce harder for longer hours in order to increase output. </p> <p><strong> So what's the betting for the outcome of tomorrow's meeting?</strong><br> Almost certainly no change. One thing is for sure though, if Wim Duisenburg and his colleagues at the European Central Bank were to do a job swap with Mr Greenspan and his chums on the Rederal Reserve's rate-setting committee, the Europeans would not hesitate to pull the interest rate trigger. The European Central Bank is almost certain to raise rates next week - and at 2.4%, inflation in Europe is well below American levels.</p>"

  "Supporters of Serbian leader Slobodan Milosevic and his main rival Vojislav Kostunica each say their man has secured an overall majority in the Yugoslav presidential elections. <p>The official result is not yet known but a senior official in Mr Milosevic's ruling socialist party hinted that the poll had not gone the president's way: \"Top people were debating all night,\" he said. \"We don't exactly know what we'll do.\"</p> <p>However, Mr Milosevic is unlikely to concede defeat. He claimed victory with a 5% majority shortly after the polls closed and is widely accused of rigging the vote to give him the result he requires. </p> <p>The 18-party opposition alliance backing the challenger claims to be in the lead with 55% against Milosevic's 34% after votes from more than half of the polling stations had been counted. </p> <p>The winner needs an absolute majority to avoid a runoff election in October but Mr Milosevic's challengers are sure their candidate has won. \"Votes can be rigged when there is a slim difference between two groups, but when the difference is this big there is no way anyone can falsify the results,\" said Vladan Batic of the opposition alliance.</p> <p>Western states and organisations today backed the opposition's victory claims. The European Union said that any claim to a win by the president would be open fraud and the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) described pro-Milosevic forces' claims of victory as \"not credible\". </p> <p>\"These elections were far from democratic, but despite reports of widespread fraud and intimidation, the will of the people for change has been overwhelming,\" said OSCE chairman, Austrian foreign minister Benita Ferrero-Waldner. </p> <p>Many did not take part in the election. The pro-western government of Montenegro, the junior partner in the Yugoslav federation, called for a boycott of the vote. Kosovo Albanians also stayed away but initial reports from the province suggest that the remaining Serbs voted solidly for Mr Milosevic.</p> <p>Observers and analysts fear that if Mr Milosevic loses the vote he may plunge Serbia and Montenegro into a civil war to maintain his position at the head of the federation.</p>",
  "Any claim from Yugoslav President Sloboban Milosevic that he had won the country's elections would be a fraud, the European Union said today. <p>While the final result is not yet known, the vote has been plagued with accusations of ballot rigging and intimidation, and the joint statement from the 15-nation union made it clear that any attempt Mr Milosevic made to claim a victory would be viewed as false.</p> <p>It said: \"According to all available information, it is clear that any attempt by Milosevic to declare himself the victor would be fraudulent\" and in a reference to the large turnout, which the union said showed the people of Serbia wanted change, it added, \"they wanted to speak up, regardless of intimidation, manoeuvring, pressure and all sorts of manipulation by the Belgrade regime leading up to this ballot.\"</p> <p>The EU statement came on the day the British foreign secretary, Robin Cook, called for Mr Milosevic to stand down after new figures showed he had in fact lost the country's presidential elections.</p> <p>Mr Cook, in Brighton for the Labour Party Conference, told delegates \"all the reliable evidence\" available showed Mr Milosevic would be voted out \"by a massive majority\" and he urged the leader to \"get out of the way\" and allow his opponent to take up the mantle.</p> <p>The results on a third of the polling stations around Serbia suggested opposition candidate Vojislav Kostunica had polled 57% of the votes and Mr Milosevic only 33%. Mr Milosevic and his supporters, however, claim he has a lead and his 13-year rule would continue.</p> <p>Mr Milosevic was a \"beaten, broken-backed\" president, Mr Cook told reporters, adding: \"My message to him today is be honest with your people, don't cheat them, get out of the way and let Serbia get out of the prison into which you have turned it.\" </p> <p>But Mr Milosevic showed no signs of conceding defeat after an election marked by a huge turnout - and allegations of fraud and ballot-rigging. </p> <p>His spokesman in Belgrade, Nikola Sainovic, said he doubted there would even be a need for a run-off vote - required if no candidate gets more than 50% - because \"our candidate is leading\". </p> <p>Voting was yesterday plagued by reports of blatant irregularities by Mr Milosevic backers, including ballot box stuffing, according to the few domestic monitors watching the polls. </p> <p>But Kostunica said after the voting: \"According to our count, the first-round victory is certain. Dawn is coming to Serbia. I'm excited.\" </p> <p>There were 7,861,327 eligible voters in Yugoslavia, of whom 444,130 were in Montenegro, Serbia's smaller sister republic. There were around 10,000 polling stations in all. </p> <p>A candidate needs more than 50 percent of the vote to win outright without having to contest a second round.</p>",
  "The local elementary school in Pozarevac, the home town of President Slobodan Milosevic in north-eastern Yugoslavia, was spotlessly turned out for its day in the limelight as a polling centre in Yugoslavia's elections. <p>From behind two long desks in the freshly painted classroom - hung with the Yugoslav flag, the Serbian coat of arms and children's watercolours - Mr Milosevic's monitors and opposition scrutineers watched. </p> <p>The president's wayward son, Marko - a racing driver and black marketeer - had closed the bakery, pizza shop and internet cafe he owns but there was no sign of him as the town came out to vote. </p> <p>The voters made their way laboriously through candidates for both houses of parliament and local councils, but the only vote that mattered to most of them was who would be their new president. </p> <p>The first to turn up at the polls were mostly Milosevic loyalists. Old women with stiff limbs clambered out of the town's favoured red Yugos. </p> <p>On a bench in the town square, Milos Obranovic, a retired army captain, sat with his friends. He was slowly draining a cola bottle filled with plum brandy. \"I am an orthodox communist, a hard boiled communist, and I will vote for Milosevic,\" he said. </p> <p>But as the day wore on the voters got younger. Mira Veljkovic, 30, a beautician, looked surprised when asked about her voting intentions. \"I will support [Vojislav] Kostu nica of course,\" she said, referring to the main opposition candidate. </p> <p>The elections are, for now, an entirely civilised affair but the enormous importance of this vote can be felt everywhere, despite the calm. </p> <p>At 7am there were queues outside Belgrade polling stations. This is the heartland of Mr Kostunica, the 56-year-old lawyer who threatens to end the painful 13-year reign of Mr Milosevic. </p> <p>\"I feel like I did before my final exams,\" said Davor Matic, 41, an engineer. His wife, Mira, said she had bags under her eyes: \"I only slept for two hours last night I'm so nervous.\" </p> <p>All day, on the government-controlled local news and television stations, the people of Belgrade were warned that the opposition was getting ready to link up with their wayward neighbour, Montenegro, and betray Serbia. </p> <p>Both the Milosevic and opposition camps plan to proclaim victory. Mr Kostunica is 10 points ahead in public-opinion surveys and says that the only way Mr Milosevic will win is by fraud. Mr Milosevic insists victory will be his. </p> <p>There is little faith that the election results, due tomorrow, will really reflect the view of ordinary Serbs so, for now, the candidates are fighting a propaganda war. </p> <p>President Milosevic, the master of propaganda, is being accused by the local Centre for Free Elections and Democracy (Cesid) of rigging the polls but its evidence is thin. The group presents itself as an independent, non-partisan, non-governmental organisation but is staffed by students, trade unionists and academics opposed to Mr Milosevic. </p> <p>Its claims of corruption were eagerly reported yesterday by the few foreign journalists remaining in the country - 30 were expelled from Yugoslavia on the eve of the vote amid claims that they did not have the correct work permits. </p> <p>At yesterday's 1pm press conference, Cesid announced that the elections were a \"mess\" and rife with irregularities. But the most serious development, it said, was that a polling station in the town of Grocka, 30 miles from Belgrade, had been smashed up by radicals. </p> <p>When I visited Grocka yesterday afternoon it turned out that the \"radicals\" were drunks who were much more upset over claims that an election monitor had crashed into one of their cars than they were about the fate of either of the two presidential candidates. </p> <p>These breathless, vague press conferences give some idea of how terrified the opposition is that Mr Milosevic will again steal the votes of his own people to keep himself in power - as he did in the winter of 1996. </p> <p>The threat to their democratic rights is not from drunken townsfolk on the rampage, it is whatever Mr Milosevic is planning to do with almost 1m votes he controls in Kosovo and Montenegro. It will be another 24 hours before that is clear.</p>"

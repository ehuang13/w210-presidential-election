  "In a scruffy radio studio full of old cigarette smoke, Tamara Skroza is pumping the air with her fists beside a full ashtray. She is singing along with the first disc of her show - a song from Sarajevo about an old football player who is finally saying goodbye. <p>Ms Skroza, 27, is one of the stars of Radio Index, a young and irreverent student station that has somehow survived Slobodan Milosevic's censorship police and caught the heartbeat of Belgrade. </p> <p>Dozens of callers, filled with rage, hurt and humour have gone on air in the last two days to call on Mr Milosevic to stand down after he polled well behind his rival in the elections. </p> <p>Among these callers is an elderly woman who says: \"I have to admit I voted for Slobodan Milosevic - but now that he has lost he has to respect the will of the people.\" </p> <p>Radio Index having become the voice of the election, Ms Skroza is talking to almost a million people in the capital. </p> <p>Her show starts - as always - with a recording of the tired hoarse voice of the president telling a party rally to beware the oppostion of \"rats, hyenas and foxes that want our nation to crawl like poodles to the west\". </p> <p>Today, her show is about the Yugoslav president's attempt to survive by staging a second round in the presidential election that the opposition contends he has already lost. </p> <p>\"We expected the worst possible elections,\" she says. \"Instead of that, hope was born and Serbia was laughing. Then somebody made the decision that Serbia mustn't laugh and mustn't hope. Is that someone afraid now that our spiritually destroyed nation has somehow come back to life?\" </p> <p>Mr Milosevic and his wife and political partner, Mira Markovic, are not, for now, going anywhere, though thousand were expected on the streets of Belgrade last night for a concert calling on him to step down. There are no pictures of the growing protest concerts on state TV or radio, and no mention of street demonstrations. </p> <p>Several stations have been shut in recent weeks, and others forced to move. Those still operating have been told to play only music. Policemen camp in their offices. </p> <p>Ms Skroza had told her listeners that she would shave her head and pierce her nose if Mr Milosevic won. So far, she has only dyed her hair. \"I feel so happy, so full of energy. I week ago I felt 100 years old. A lot of people have that new energy and he can't beat that out of us.\" </p> <p>Ms Skroza got distracted from a fine-art degree and joined Radio Index. Until recently the station was so short of funds that when the heating broke, listeners came in to donate heaters. </p> <p>The station's equivalent of traffic news is to give information on where the police have cordoned off streets and which junctions to avoid because of the risk of confrontation with the police. </p> <p>\"I got into this radio business because I needed to speak. I never voted for him [Milosevic] but he has made my last 13 years an indescribable hell. My mother was hypnotised by him and I can probably never forgive her for that.\" </p> <p>Ms Skroza travelled 250 miles to her mother's home town on Sunday to be able to vote, and one of her friends flew back from Hamburg for one night so that he could cast his ballot. </p> <p>\"Many people are voting for the first time. I was 14 when he came to power. I don't feel responsible for what he did\". </p> <p>She flicks another cigarette into the ashtray and closes her show with a song from the 1997 winter of protest, Step by Step. </p> <p>Its chorus goes: \"We are united by the same motive now. I am looking for a new time. My new self.\"</p>",
  "Thousands of opposition supporters brandishing leaflets that proclaimed the Yugoslav president, Slobodan Milosevic, was \"broken like a baby's rattle\" poured into Belgrade city centre last night in a trial of strength over Sunday's disputed election. <p>On the fourth consecutive night of burgeoning demonstrations, protesters were ordered by police to dismantle a stage outside the headquarters of the Federal Election Commission, but immediately regrouped nearby. </p> <p>Final results in the presidential race are expected to be announced tonight. But since Mr Milosevic controls the Federal Electoral Commission, they are widely expected to be fixed. </p> <p>Mr Milosevic's camp has claimed that the main opposition candidate, Vojislav Kostunica, won the first round of the election but failed to gain 50% needed for outright victory. </p> <p>As people began coming on to the streets shortly after 5pm yesterday in preparation for a rally at 8pm, no one appeared to be contemplating the option of participating in a second round. The proposal put forward by Mr Milosevic was rejected by Mr Kostunica, a 56-year-old lawyer. </p> <p>For three days, domestic and international pleas for Mr Milosevic to step down have been ignored. </p> <p>President Bill Clinton yesterday accused him of trying to steal the election from the opposition and said the United States would support the people of Serbia. </p> <p>\"It certainly appears from a distance that they had a free election and somebody is trying to take it away from them,\" he said. </p> <p>Mr Milosevic was indicted by the International War Crimes Tribunal in the Hague and has few options if he is forced to step down. There is also a $5m (\u00a33m) bounty on offer from the US government for his capture leading to prosecution by the Hague. </p> <p>There were concerns that Mr Milosevic would try to use the paramilitary police to break up the rally last night. Before the rally began, a few dozen policemen were wandering around the city centre with their hands in their pockets. </p> <p>The opposition leaders are concerned to avoid any violence and fear provocations by the regime. \"Our stand is to avoid any conflict; we are the winners and we do not need conflicts,\" said Zoran Djindjic, an opposition leader. </p> <p>Student activists warned that government provocateurs dressed in protesters' T-shirts might stir up trouble at the rally. They said police had confiscated 4,000 T-shirts - marked with a clenched fist, the symbol of the Otpor movement. Otpor means resistance in Serbian. </p> <p>\"We wish to warn that we are not responsible for that because our methods are non-violent,\" Otpor activist Vukasin Petrovic said. </p> <p>\"We're just ignoring him now. It's a new psychological phenomenon that I have never seen before,\" said Mr Petrovic, a 32-year-old architect. </p> <p>\"He can do whatever he wants. He can say he's king of the earth - but nobody cares.\" </p> <p>Meanwhile, former allies of Mr Milosevic are preparing to jump ship, and threatening to abandon their coalition with him in the Serbian parliament. Vojislav Seselj, leader of the extremist Radical Party, is considering the move that would mean the fall of the Milosevic government. </p> <p>Scenting blood, Mr Seselj's nationalist extremists, whose men provided some of shock troops for Mr Milosevic's \"ethnic cleansing\" campaigns in Bosnia and Kosovo, are abandoning him. </p> <p>Another former ally, Vuk Draskovic, is also paying the price for refusing the join the united front against Milosevic. After a devastating defeat for his party, the Serbian Renewal Movement - he went public two days ago and said that he was wrong not to back opposition leader Vojislav Kostunica's bid to become president. </p> <p>Mr Milosevic's government is still in denial. The media he controls does not know how to react. </p> <p>On the front page of Politika, the only picture at this momentous crossroads in Serbia's history was one of the designer, Karl Lagerfeld, who is involved in a tax scandal in France. </p> <p>The front page, is still insisting that Mr Milosevic's party, the Socialist Party of Serbia, and his wife's party, Yugoslav Left, are going to form the next federal government. </p> <p>But two government television stations, BK television and Studio B yesterday surprised viewers with extensive reports from the opposition press conference, where it was announced that Mr Milosevic had lost the election. For the first time, it appears that Mr Milosevic is even beginning to lose control of one of his most powerful weapons.</p>",
  "Serbian opposition representatives were rebuffed yesterday when they tried to see the ballot records on which federal election commission officials based their claim that Vojislav Kostunica failed to win enough votes for a first-round victory over President Slobodan Milosevic in Sunday's poll. <p>\"As I had expected, they did not ... allow us, and nor will they, to look into the election material,\" Nebojsa Bakarec said after speaking to officials inside the parliament building where the commission works. </p> <p>\"There is great fear among the commission,\" he added. He was the only member of the 40-strong team allowed in. He later appealed to commission members to \"publish the real results and act according to their conscience, without creating tensions\". </p> <p>The commission's rebuff only served to add conviction to the opposition's belief that it won the election outright. Cedomir Jovanovic, the spokesman for the 18-party Democratic Opposition of Serbia (DOS) said that, with 97% of the votes counted, Mr Kostunica had won 52%. </p> <p>The credibility of its figures was reinforced by the ultra-right Radical party, which had its own presidential candidate and is still nominally part of Mr Milosevic's government. Its figures tally. </p> <p>The opposition's confidence in rejecting a runoff is based on several factors, analysts in Belgrade said. They range from a determination to retain the initiative in the battle of wills with an increasingly desperate Mr Milosevic, to a sense that the federal election commission will soon \"crack\" and be forced to give new figures showing that the opposition did indeed win. </p> <p>There are also signs that the police will not dare to beat peaceful protesters; that the army is uncertain of its conscripts' loyalty; that Mr Milosevic has lost the support of his best ally, Russia; and that his more pragmatic advisers are saying that he still could have a political future in Serbia as an ex-president. </p> <p>\"They may well be telling him that Vojislav Kostunica is a nationalist who has repeatedly said that he does not accept the international war crimes tribunal in the Hague. They could also remind him that he can stay on as leader of the Socialist party of Serbia,\" said Sasha Nenadovic, former editor of a leading Belgrade newspaper. </p> <p>The most optimistic scenario canvassed by Belgrade observers was that the election commission would give different results when it releases the final count this evening. It is known to have held back about 500,000 votes which have allegedly not yet been counted. This could allow it to declare that Mr Kostunica did get more than 50% of the vote, thereby making him president without a runoff. </p> <p>The very fact that the commission has already conceded an eight-point lead to Mr Kostunica was being seen as historic in Belgrade. </p> <p>Mr Milosevic has frequently turned to force to try to handle problems. His record of bloodshed is strewn across the Balkans. But he has also retreated when the odds were overwhelming. </p> <p>Nato's intervention last year ended after 78 days when Mr Milosevic finally found too many factors were building up against him. </p> <p>Similar realism could prevail again, the DOS leadership hopes. Strengthening the argument that the commission may have to concede victory for Mr Kostunica are its own official figures for the elections to councils in Serbia as well as the federal parliament. </p> <p>These show that the DOS had an almost clean sweep of the poll at the local level. It won a staggering 105 of the 110 seats on the Belgrade city council, virtually wiping out Mr Milosevic's Socialist party, which won only four seats, as well as the Radical party of Vojislav Seselj, which took one. </p> <p>Vuk Draskovic's Serbian Renewal Movement, which once ran Belgrade's city government, failed to win a seat. Several ministers from Mr Milosevic's socialists lost their council seats. </p> <p>The overwhelming switch to the opposition was repeated across Serbia. DOS won councils in almost every major town. Mr Seselj lost his seat in his home suburb. </p> <p>The only good news for Mr Milosevic came as a result of the boycott of the election in Montenegro, organised by the government of Milo Djukanovic. This allowed the pro-Milosevic party to win almost all the seats from Montenegro, leaving the embattled Yugoslav president in control of both houses of the federal parliament. </p> <p>DOS says it also defeated Mr Milosevic in many army bar racks where conscripts voted. The message will not be lost on officers who will have to think hard before ordering the army to break up street protests. </p> <p>Mr Milosevic's continuing control over the federal parliament still leaves him with a few cards. He also controls the government and presidency of Serbia through committed loyalists. </p> <p>These two factors might allow him to negotiate his future with Mr Kostunica, getting a guarantee of his personal security as head of the Socialist party in return for working with the new president.</p>",
  "Ohio lies at the heart of a nation still wavering over who it wants to be president. In fact, if there was a meridian of indecision running through the country, it would bisect this swing state, through Montgomery, its most evenly balanced county, down the middle of Dayton and under the feet of Felix Garfunkel. <p>Mr Garfunkel's vote, like the state of Ohio, is up for grabs. And with 40 days until the US goes to the polls, his opinions - and those of his fellow floating Daytonians - could prove decisive. Historically, the candidate who wins Montgomery county usually wins Ohio, and the winner in Ohio almost always wins the presidency. </p> <p>Mr Garfunkel, out shopping in the aptly named Dayton suburb of Centerville, is having a hard time deciding. </p> <p>\"I'm waiting for the debates to make up my mind,\" he says. \"I will see what the positions of the two are. Gore has promised a lot, but those things have yet to be proved. But Bush hasn't given details of what he thinks either.\" </p> <p>Mr Bush's lead in the state has narrowed to 4%, which is virtually insignificant, statistically speaking. In Dayton and the surrounding Montgomery county, the two candidates are running neck and neck with the support of 49% of likely voters apiece. Dayton's decision could be critical in determining the allocation of Ohio's precious 21 votes in the electoral college, which formally decides the presidency. </p> <p>Mr Garfunkel is 69 years old and shares the concerns of his fellow pensioners about the ballooning cost of prescription medicines and the fate of the state-funded Medicare system. But he admits he does not have a clear idea of either candidate's plans. </p> <p>Mark Taylor, 45, a respiratory therapist at a Dayton hospital is in the same boat. \"To be honest, there's not an easy answer,\" he says. \"I'm not real happy with either side. I'm not happy with the whole concept of politics. I think as far as the economy is concerned it's going a little bit easier on us. But I'm not sure if that has anything to do with Mr Gore.\" </p> <p>Ralph Nader, the environmentalist contender, is a man of real integrity, the Centerville voter believes, but as he is not going to win, what is the point? </p> <p>Other shoppers have more concrete views. Most of the white, middle-class residents are long-term Republicans who say they are still sickened by the Monica Lewinsky sex scandal, and angry with the vice-president for not resigning in disgust. Most of the black Daytonians are traditional Democrats whose party loyalty was set in stone 40 years ago, in the civil rights struggle. </p> <p>There is no reason to believe that the range of views in Centerville is very different from anywhere else in the great undecided heartland. It certainly looks like a thousand other quietly prosperous suburbs around the country. Regional unemployment - at 4% - is at a post-war low. The shopping malls are full and most of the cars parked along the shaded streets seem to have been bought in the last five years. </p> <p>In Dayton, a city of about 180,000, the scars of de-industrialisation are visible - empty sites where cars were once assembled for General Motors, whose jobs have gone to cheaper labour in Mexico and Asia. But those scars are being quickly smoothed over. The sleek offices of hi-tech companies have transformed the outskirts of town. </p> <p>\"There is a sense of contentment and a general lack of commitment,\" Jim Walker, a politics professor at Dayton's Wright State University, says. \"You will normally get a third partisan Republicans, a third Democrats and a third who just don't pay any attention. Ohio perhaps has more of those. I've found about 42 or 43% who just don't identify. That mostly means they don't pay attention.\" </p> <p>Prof Walker argues that the usual neat profile of a swing voter - someone carefully weighing their interests and options in the light of the party platforms - is a false one. Confusion, ignorance of the issues and disinterest are far more common. </p> <p>Certainly, the opinions expressed in Centerville appeared to be based on gut feeling rather than careful calculation. \"With many people\", Prof Walker says, \"the last good idea they hear will be the one they go for.\" </p> <p>The candidates have visited Ohio about a dozen times since the August conventions, and will visit another dozen times before the election, in the hope of providing that decisive \"good idea\". </p> <p>During a visit last week, the Democratic vice-presidential candidate, Joe Lieberman, told a crowd of supporters: \"If the Gore-Lieberman ticket carries Ohio, that's it folks - the other side doesn't have a chance. </p> <p>\"I'm not trying to put pressure on you but the future of America is on your shoulders.\"</p>",
  "President Jacques Chirac was under heavy pressure yesterday to call a truce in a potentially catastrophic feud with Lionel Jospin, his socialist prime minister, by coming clean about past covert funding operations. <p>Amid growing calls for snap presidential and general elections, Patrick Devedjian, a close adviser to the president and spokesman for Mr Chirac's conservative RPR party, said the president should admit publicly that all political parties used to have illegal slush funds. This ended after the early 1990s, he maintained. </p> <p>Mr Devedjian hopes to shut the door on a cupboard positively stuffed with skeletons, and his words were echoed yesterday by those of another leading conservative, Philippe S\u00e9guin. \"We have to stop the games we're playing,\" he said. </p> <p>The president has consistently referred to all the accusations as \"utterly without foundation\", but even in his own party few now seem to believe he can maintain this approach. </p> <p>Mr Devedjian's call for openness came after several days of mudslinging prompted by the videotaped confession of an RPR official, now dead, directly implicating Mr Chirac in a vast party financing scam while he was mayor of Paris from 1977-95. </p> <p>MPs and commentators were already referring to the Chirac scandal as worthy of a banana republic when it expanded to embroil the socialists earlier this week. It emerged that their former finance minister, the disgraced Dominique Strauss-Kahn, had a copy of the video - but had not told Mr Jospin or magistrates investigating the RPR's financing. </p> <p>The RPR immediately accused the socialists of political manipulation, or even fabrication. Mr Strauss-Kahn, it was alleged, got the tape from a lawyer for granting a massive tax break to the couturier Karl Lagerfeld. The former minister, now under investigation, strenuously denies this. </p> <p>\"If the president were to close the chapter on the past it would be a healthy step for everyone, for our democracy, for a country of our standing,\" Mr Devedjian said. He said Mr Chirac should \"state publicly that everybody, including the RPR of course, raised funds illegally\", so that French politics could finally move on. </p> <p>\"We are the fourth largest power in the world and we are reduced to holding debates that are totally humiliating and degrading for all politicians and for our democracy,\" Mr Devedjian declared. </p> <p>The public Chirac-Jospin struggle comes at a time when France is in charge of complex talks on the future of the EU. After three years of polite if strained \"cohabitation\", the two leaders have every interest in abandoning a battle that would ruin them on the domestic and international stages </p> <p>Mr Jospin has already sought to calm his more virulent supporters, including the head of the socialist group in the national assembly, Jean-Marc Ayrault, who accused Mr Chirac of being a \"demagogic populist\" who was dragging French politics down and would be facing prosecution were he not covered by presidential immunity. </p> <p>\"My conception of public life has led me not to make use of scandals in political debate,\" the prime minister said on Tuesday night, before adding: \"But that does not mean we should allow ourselves to be intimidated, or to be accused collectively of crimes we have not committed.\" </p> <p>Newspaper editorials have started to call for presidential and general elections to be called much earlier than when they fall due in 2002. And an opinion poll shows that 70% of respondents want Mr Chirac to volunteer for questioning by investigators. </p> <p>\"Only a presidential election and the resignation of the government would relieve our disgust,\" said the L'Express weekly, while Ouest France said that \"everything, whether we like it or not, is happening as if we had started to plan for an early election once the French presidency of the European Union is over [at the end of December.]\" </p> <p>Allegations of underhand financial dealings at the Paris town hall when Mr Chirac was mayor are now so commonplace that most voters are readily prepared to believe the videotape. </p> <p>The investigators have also found letters that seem to corroborate the tape, adding to suspicions that the president is not telling the truth. </p> <p><b>Wages of power</b></p> <p><b> Kickbacks </b><br> Under investigation are some 60 politicians and businessmen - the Paris mayor, Jean Tiberi, among them - suspected of involvement in kickbacks from building firms seeking council contracts in the capital, run for 18 years by Jacques Chirac of the centre-right RPR </p> <p><b> Payroll scams</b><br> The former RPR prime minister, Alain Jupp\u00e9, and three former RPR treasurers are being investigation on suspicion that as many as 300 party activists were given fictitious jobs at the town hall or with friendly construction firms </p> <p><b> Influence peddling</b><br> Xavier Dugoin, a former RPR official, has been sentenced to 18 months in prison for paying \u00a320,000 to Mr Tiberi's wife Xavi\u00e8re for a 36-page report largely copied from a textbook. Mrs Tiberi's case was annulled on technicalities but will be retried in November </p> <p><b> Election fraud </b><br> The Tiberi clan under investigation is suspected of filling electoral rolls in Tiberi's Paris constituency with thousands of non-resident pro-RPR voters </p> <p><b> Elf scandal</b><br> Twenty people are under judicial investigation on suspicion of bribery and embezzlement - dating back to Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand's socialist presidency in the early 90s - involving the oil company Elf. The suspects include ex-foreign minister Roland Dumas, his mistress Christine Deviers-Joncours, Elf's former president Loik Le Floch-Prigent and a number of senior executives</p>",
  "The Serbian opposition's decision to boycott next month's second round of presidential elections may prove to be a mistake of historic proportions. That Vojislav Kostunica won last Sunday's ballot is now officially confirmed. <p>Even Slobodan Milosevic's lickspittle gerrymanderers gave him an eight-point lead. It seems equally certain that Mr Kostunica did indeed poll more than the 51% required for outright victory, and that this stunning result has been suppressed by systematic fraud. Without question Mr Milosevic has suffered an extraordinary reverse that he did not anticipate and is struggling to survive. And it may very well be that the end of the Milosevic era is close; for the cloud of violence now overshadowing Belgrade's streets symbolises his desperation, his utter political and moral bankruptcy. So why, when he is finally tottering on the brink, throw him a lifeline that can save him from the chasm? </p> <p>For this is what a boycott would effectively do. It should be plain even to his most over-heated opponents that an uncontested second round would hand him the election on a plate. To be sure, it is doubtless true that in calling for a second round, Mr Milosevic is playing for time, is planning further subversion, and hopes to divide or buy off opponents currently exhibiting an unusual unity of purpose. Yet without an opposition challenge, Mr Milosevic will win by default and will claim, gallingly, that he has done so by the book, according to the constitution, and by democratic means. </p> <p>By noisily insisting that Mr Milosevic is beaten and that a second round is, in Robin Cook's words, a \"waste of time\", the west encourages Mr Kostunica in his misconceived course and repeats past mistakes. It is all very well for Bill Clinton, Tony Blair and a veritable chorus line of western leaders to pronounce that it is all over. But what will they actually do for the opposition when Mr Milosevic wins a boycotted poll? Deeply flawed though the election clearly is (and nobody can pretend the fraud was unexpected), it is the only one Serbia has - but the west, having long decried the lack of democracy and urged the opposition to take part, now appears to override the process. By hinting, however obliquely, at a renewed Nato involvement, western leaders also reduce the chances that Russia, a key player now as during Kosovo, will help pull the political plug. </p> <p>No, no, no, excited opposition leaders exclaim, all that is irrelevant for it will be different this time. The coming, daily mass demonstrations will now bring \"people's power\" to bear. The rightness of the cause is undeniable; the dictator and his cronies must inevitably fall. But in this, once more, history may repeat itself. In Belgrade, such predictions have been made again and again. And again and again, Mr Milosevic has ridden out the storm. If the police and army turn against him, if he is betrayed from within, if an assassin or a suicide pill strike ... As always, it is all terribly iffy. </p> <p>To be rid of this tyrant, to bring this perpetrator of war crimes and genocide to justice, to give Yugoslavia the chance to join the European community of democratic nations, the surest, safest, legitimate way is for Serbs and Montenegrins to go to the polls on October 8 and consign him, undeniably, irredeemably, and beyond the shadow of even the most egregious fraud, to oblivion. If last Sunday showed anything, it was that a truly massive popular vote cannot ultimately be fiddled away. By all means demonstrate, by all means agitate. But above all, participate. Keep faith that even in the most adverse circumstances, democracy can triumph. And kick the bastard out.</p>"

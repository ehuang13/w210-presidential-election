  "The Ivory Coast's opposition leader, Laurent Gbagbo, today swept to power after a people's revolt ousted military ruler General Robert Guei. <p>Tens of thousands of people took the streets to protest after Gen Guei proclaimed himself the winner of Sunday's presidential election following his dissolution of the national electoral commission which organised the vote.</p> <p>Several potential candidates, including former prime minister Alassane Ouattara, were barred from standing in the poll by the supreme court. Today Mr Ouattara's supporters marched through the Ivory Coast's capital, Abidjan, calling for a new election.</p> <p>Gen Guei has fled Abidjan for Cotonou in nearby Benin, his former information minister, Henri Cesar Sama, said. Mr Sama was among the soldiers who turned against the dictator. </p> <p>Mr Sama said that pro-Gbagbo soldiers were trying to convince the remaining junta forces to put down their arms. He said another senior junta member, Captain Saint Cyr Djikalou, had also defected. </p> <p>The general came to power in a December coup, the first military takeover in Ivory Coast. Instability since has battered the economy and frightened the people. Gen Guei had promised that the elections would mark a return to civilian rule. </p> <p>Violent clashes erupted yesterday after Mr Gbagbo called on his supporters to take to the streets. Opposition leaders claimed nine people were killed.</p> <p>Before dawn today, mutinous soldiers were defeated by loyalist comrades in an Abidjan military base. Hours later, thousands of Mr Gbagbo's supporters swarmed through the streets of Abidjan, erecting barricades, lighting fires and screaming for Gen Guei's resignation. </p> <p>Soldiers loyal to Gen Guei fired shots in the air as they attempted to disperse unarmed demonstrators gathering outside the dictator's residence, in an exclusive suburb of the capital. </p> <p>But by midday, more members of the security forces had joined the ranks of the protesters. Demonstrators had overrun broadcast facilities for state radio and television, and thousands more were outside the broadcast offices in central Abidjan. At least two people were killed and four were injured in the clashes, witnesses said. </p> <p>Mr Gbagbo was introduced as \"president; in an address broadcast on state television and said he would be forming a cabinet shortly. He praised his supporters for opposing what he called Gen Guei's \"electoral coup d'etat\". </p> <p>\"I pay particular homage to those who died in the cause of this,\" he said. \"We will give them a funeral befitting their courage,\" he said. The speech was recorded at his campaign headquarters, where it was played on loudspeakers to hundreds of cheering supporters standing outside. </p> <p>The announcement triggered celebrations on the streets of Abidjan and of the western city of Gagnoa, a Gbagbo stronghold. Some protesters beat on drums while others sang and danced in the streets.</p> <p><br><b>Useful Links</b><br><a href=\"http://allafrica.com/stories/200010250035.html\">Analysis - allAfrica.com</a> <br><a href=\"http://allafrica.com/stories/200010250032.html\">Related story - allAfrica.com</a><br><a href=\"http://web.amnesty.org/ai.nsf/Index/AFR310032000?OpenDocument&amp;of=COUNTRIESCOTE+D'IVOIRE\">Background - Amnesty International</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.georgetown.edu/kokora/political/gbagbo10.htm\">Speech: Gbagbo - Georgetown University</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/international/story/0,3604,387599,00.html\"> Previous events: 'rigged' vote - Guardian</a><br><a href=\"  http://news6.thdo.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/world/africa/newsid%5F930000/930254.stm\"> Profile: Robert Guei - BBC</a></p>",
  "It is a measure of Al Gore's increasing desperation that he is spending his time this week not in the big \"swing\" states which deliver dozens of votes in the electoral college, but rather in small states hitherto regarded as unswervingly for the Democrat cause. <p>One such is West Virginia, which has voted for Republican candidates only twice since 1960. Gore will hold a huge rally in the state on Friday. At least he hopes it will be huge - several of the papers are pointing out that there are plenty of free tickets still going spare. </p> <p>West Virginia has twice as many registered Democrats as Republicans. But that may not count for much, in a viscerally conservative part of the US, where the papers display little enthusiasm, let alone passion, for the contest. </p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.com/\" target=\"_new\">Charleston Daily Mail</a> - an afternoon paper with a masthead identical to our own dear Mail - is teasingly still on the fence, though it has published endorsements for Republican and Democrat candidates in the slew of elections for state legislators and judges. </p> <p>The Mail's sister morning title, the <a href=\"http://www.wvgazette.com/\" target=\"_new\">Charleston Gazette</a>, is clearly sympathetic to Gore. Last week it printed a leader indignantly attacking the Republican gibe that the vice-president is given to telling fibs. The paper rebutted each of the detailed accusations in turn, then sadly observed: \"But these facts probably won't dampen the sneer-and-smear campaign against Gore. After a ridicule movement is launched, it takes on a life of its own, even if it's untrue. That's sad.\" </p> <p>In Clarksburg, the splendidly named <a href=\"http://www.cpubco.com/\" target=\"_new\">Exponent-Telegram</a> is braced for tomorrow's visit by Tipper Gore, the Democrat candidate's indefatigable wife. The paper offers not a whiff of partisan interest in the election, but its interesting page of local opinion surveys indicates a strongly conservative readership which rejects stricter gun controls, is strongly anti-abortion, and would happily abolish affirmative action programmes to aid ethnic minorities. </p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.dominionpost.com/\" target=\"_new\">Dominion Post</a> of Morgantown is primly declining to endorse candidates. But it has started an exhaustive 14-day presentation of candidates' views in the state and national elections. It laments: \"Voter turnout here and across the country has dwindled, often leaving a minority of citizens making decisions that affect all citizens. Voter participation is key to making our democracy work. We hope you read the daily profiles and the candidates' stands on issues. We hope they prove helpful to you in learning more about them and where they stand. But most of all, we hope you vote.\" </p> <p>The Dominion Post is fairly clearly of a conservative bent. Last week it advised its readers not to trust the tax and spending promises of either presidential candidate: \" Voters should remember two important factors before they rush to judgment in supporting either candidate's economic promises. First, their promises are based on projections -- estimates that are based on continued economic growth and prosperity and peace around the world. In short, they're betting the bank on more than doubling the length of the longest economic expansion in history, predicting a recession-proof economy for an entire decade.\" </p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.newstribune.townnews.com/\" target=\"_new\">Daily News-Tribune</a> of Keyser is determinedly keeping its eyes lowered from the race for the White House, though it does devote some space to the plea by incumbent Lois Kesner to be reelected as magistrate for Mineral County. </p> <p>The Bluefield (pop 12,361) <a href=\"http://www.bdtonline.com/\" target=\"_new\"> Daily Telegraph</a> at least offers agency reports on the national election, but nothing by way of opinion. The <a href=\"http://www.register-herald.com/\" target=\"_new\">Register-Herald</a> of Beckley lengthily reports a barnstorming visit to the town by four Republican state governers, stumping up support for West Virginia incumbent Cecil Underwood.</p>",
  "<p>Running as an ill-tempered sideshow to the presidential election, the rumble between Washington and Hollywood shows little sign of dying down. </p> <p>Chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, Senator John McCain, is this week expected to demand quarterly reports to monitor how the big studios are honouring their pledge to stop targeting R-rated films at an underage audience. </p> <p>McCain will square Hollywood's actions with the twelve-point plan agreed as a result of last month's damning Federal Trade Commission report which concluded that Hollywood knowingly markets violent films to younger audiences.</p> <p>In contrast to the knife-edge presidential contest, early indications suggest that the federal government currently has the movie industry running scared. <a href=\"http://www.variety.com/body.asp?HbkId=8642111&amp;subcat=-1&amp;ArticleId=\" 1117788261\"\">Variety</a> reports that there is an unspoken sense within Hollywood that concessions must be made, even in a year which has seen the film industry playing the role of whipping boy.</p> <p>This newer, purer Hollywood can already be seen in the prominent signs in cinemas warning punters to have their IDs ready and print advertisements that list a movie's content like a shopping list. Take the Nora Ephron lottery comedy <a href=\"http://guardian.imdb.com/Title?0219952\">Lucky Numbers</a> (pictured), starring John Travolta and Friends star Lisa Kudrow. Sounds harmless enough, doesn't it? Except that, according to the cautionary Paramount print ad, the film contains \"language, sex, some drug use and brief violence\". </p> <p>But if such warnings are meant to scare off the adolescent market, the reverse effect may prove be the case. With such alluring subject matter on offer, cosy Aunt Nora looks set to attract a hip younger demographic.</p>",
  "While surveys of public opinion about the presidential campaign may throw up widely conflicting messages from the voters, the hard-nosed futures market is pointing forcefully towards a victory for George W Bush. <p>The University of Iowa has run a \"winner-takes-all\" futures market for the presidential election since 1988, and its predictions have been right every time. Speculators assess the two candidates as though they were commodities and invest in one of them. </p> <p>Last week the value of the Gore contract was 51.6 cents, but at the beginning of this week it had slipped to 37.5 cents. Mr Bush, who had been trailing in the preceding weeks, was seen by Monday as suitable investment: the value of his contract jumped on Monday from 48 cents to 62 cents. </p> <p>This effectively means that speculators believed that he had a better than 62% chance of victory in the November 7 election and have been putting their money behind it. </p> <p>The system is seen as giving a better picture of the chances of the two candidates, since people stand to lose money if they are wrong. Those giving opinions to pollsters are notoriously fickle, and uncertain whether they will turn up to vote. </p> <p>This week's valuations show a big shift from the golden days of the Gore campaign: after the Democrats' convention in Los Angeles in August, his speech and the smacking kiss he gave his wife made him worth 71 cents. </p> <p>But as his campaign has stumbled, and with his failure to deliver a knock-out blow in any of the three presidential debates, his valuation has tumbled. </p> <p>Speculators can also bet on the popular vote, and here they still agree that the final outcome will be very close. Mr Bush is valued here at 49.7 to Mr Gore's 48.6 cents. </p> <p>The futures market apart, gamblers who fancy a flutter on the result have a problem: it is illegal in the US to bet on the outcome of a presidential race. </p> <p>Anthony Curtis of the Huntington Press, a Nevada-based gambling newsletter, said: \"I've heard of it being offered illegally but most bookies don't want to fool around with that sort of thing.\" </p> <p>In traditional surveys the Green party candidate, Ralph Nader, who is causing concern to Mr Gore in key western states, is polling between 3% and 5%.</p>",
  "I have spent most of the last week watching Al Gore do his best to lose an election. And make no mistake, this was Gore's to lose. He started out as the incumbent at a time of American dominance abroad and record-breaking prosperity at home - running against a graduate from the Dan Quayle school of political gravitas. It should have been a walk in the park. But Gore has succeeded in making it a slog in the mire. <p>Of course, in a race this close everything could change between now and November 7. But the evidence so far is not encouraging. It's not just the bald poll numbers, which have George W Bush narrowly ahead. It's the state-by-state polls, crucial in a system where winning the right combination of states matters more than the total number of votes nationwide. Here's where Gore is in trouble. Places he should be able to call his own - Minnesota, Oregon, his native Tennessee - are suddenly in play, with Bush inching out front. </p> <p>But more important than any poll is the feel and atmosphere, the smell of the campaign - and that's what's turning against Gore. He's beginning to look like a loser. If that impression solidifies, he's done for: Americans like to back a winner and, if Bush is deemed the man, Gore's support will haemorrhage away. </p> <p>How has this happened? How has a candidate who should have coasted to the White House come to see it slip into the distance? The answer says lots about Al Gore, a fair bit about America - and much about the way our own politics could soon be heading. </p> <p>Here's a Gore soundbite I heard repeated perhaps a dozen times: \"This election is not about the past, it's about the future.\" Put that down as Gore mistake number one: he is not running on the record of the last eight years, he's running from it. Sure, he mentions the phenomenal prosperity Americans enjoy now, which they did not in 1992, but only in order to discuss how he might build on it. </p> <p>That may be honourable, but it is dumb politics. For it takes the current budget surplus as a given, an inevitable fact of nature which both Presidents Gore or Bush would enjoy. In an instant, the playing field is level - and Americans are not asked who deserves credit for this success, but to choose between rival plans on how to spend it. Gore's entire advantage is eroded. </p> <p>The flesh-and-blood embodiment of Gore's refusal to run on the recent record is, of course, Bill Clinton. The vice president never refers to the Clinton-Gore administration, even though it still enjoys sky-high approval ratings; nor does he refer to his boss by name; nor does he want to be seen with him in public. Score that as Gore mistake number two. </p> <p>The strategists say Clinton is still a turn-off to the crucial undecided voters in swing states, America's Worcestor Women, who regard the Prez as a sleaze. But by bowing to that tiny sliver of voters, Gore has robbed himself of the nuclear weapon of American politics: the best campaigner in the world. He could have had Clinton working below radar, energising the core Democratic vote, firing up black communities (where Clinton is still adored), doing radio ads, motivating workers in blue-collar states like Michigan. Instead, Gore has kept the big dog chained up, pining to be set free. </p> <p>How could Gore do this to himself? The answer probably has less to do with electoral calculation than egotism and petulance. The vice president is sick of being in the big guy's shadow; he desperately wants to win this one on his own, as \"my own man\". There is a horrible precedent here. In 1996, Israeli Labour party aides begged Shimon Peres to use TV ads centred on his much-loved (and slain) predecessor Yitzhak Rabin. But Peres was too proud. Like Gore, he wanted to win the election on his own. Instead, he lost it all by himself. </p> <p>Which brings us to the central problem of the Gore candidacy: his personality. The simple fact, repeated ad nauseam, is that the vice president does not connect. I'd read it before, but now I've seen it. I watched him address a trade union rally in downtown Manhattan, a hotel ballroom packed with activists and loyal Democrats. They were rooting for Al, desperate for him to do well. They lifted their heads and waved their banners, straining to make a connection with the candidate. And he spoke fluently and well. But the moment of connection - that near-telepathic moment of emotional docking that happens every time Bill Clinton steps into a room - just refused to happen. Gore's words seemed to skim over the audience, not one of them sinking in. At the rally's end the room drained instantly, a sure-sign of an ailing candidacy: when it's a good one, the punters can't tear themselves away. </p> <p>Part of the trouble is linguistic. Gore uses complex, Latinate vocabulary while his opponent prefers plain, Anglo-Saxon English. Asked about the Middle East, Gore urged the Palestinians to \"cease and desist\"; Bush said, \"Put down your rocks, put down your stones.\" Which message would you remember? </p> <p>This is why the three TV debates were all bad news for Gore. Technically he may have won, by being smarter than Bush, but that was not the problem. By sighing audibly in the first debate and marching over to Bush and, in Americanese, \"invading his personal space\" in the third, Gore came off as arrogant and obnoxious, a combination of school swot and playground bully. Bush, meanwhile, sounded sufficiently plausible on the issues to scrape across the threshold required of a presidential candidate - and was a whole lot more charming. One poll afterward found Bush beating Gore on the likeability index by 60 points to 31. </p> <p>Why does this matter? Because this is where this elections is being fought. Compulsory campaign stops these days are not the factory gates or county fair, but Regis Live and the Rosie O'Donnell Show: the Richard and Judy hour of American TV. Presidential candidates have to go on these shows, alongside Hollywood wannabes and breast cancer survivors, and be warm, open and friendly. Gore struggles. Bush is a natural. </p> <p>\"This is not a popularity contest,\" says the Gore team. But that's mistake number three. For that's exactly what this election has become. We are in the era of Big Brother democracy, with politics a national soap opera. Election day is like that Friday night moment on Channel 4, with the viewers deciding who to cast in America's lead role. Voters are not so much choosing the leader of the free world, as deciding which guy they want to see on their TV sets day in, day out for the next four years: Gore's voice droning on, or W - a guy who knows how to party? </p> <p>Clinton's to blame, of course. He turned the Oval Office into the Big Brother house, a voyeurs' den of sex and psychodrama. He survived each week, but the deputy enjoys none of his luck. Unless he changes pretty fast, Al is about to be kicked off the show. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:jonathan.freedland@theguardian.com\">jonathan.freedland@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "During the American election campaign of 1992, President Bush delivered a scathing verdict on Messrs Clinton and Gore: \"My dog Millie knows more about foreign affairs than these two bozos.\" Now the United States may be about to elect an even bigger bozo - George W Bush. <p>\"Dubya\" could certainly use some expert advice from Millie. Last November, a TV interviewer asked him to name the leaders of a few countries that were in the news. \"The new Pakistani general,\" Bush replied, having already failed with India and Chechnya, \"he's just been elected - not elected, this guy took over ...\" \"And can you name him?\" \"General, I can name the general.\" \"And it's ...?\" \"General.\" </p> <p>Liberal Washingtonian sophisticates were vastly amused. The online magazine Slate began compiling an archive of Bushisms (\"updated daily\") which now runs to 11 long pages. Some of these are essentially malapropisms - \"hostile\" for \"hostage\", \"anecdote\" for \"antidote\", \"cufflink\" for \"handcuff\", \"preservation\" for \"perseverance\", or (my favourite) \"terrier\" for \"tariff barrier\". Others are expressions of plain ignorance, such as his admission that he thought Slovakia was the same place as Slovenia. </p> <p>A few, rather like Dan Quayle's best lines, have their own surreal splendour: \"I know the human being and the fish can coexist peacefully\"; \"families is where wings take dream\"; \"I am a person who recognises the fallacy of humans\"; \"it is clear our nation is reliant upon big foreign oil: more and more of our imports come from overseas\"; \"you can't take the high horse and then claim the low road\"; \"will the highways on the internet become more few?\" </p> <p>At the start of this year, the American punditocracy seemed to assume that Bush's dunderheadedness would guarantee his eventual defeat. Yet he has now overtaken the studiously cerebral Al Gore, the self-proclaimed creator of the internet, who can probably identify the capital of Slovenia or the president of Pakistan in his sleep. Why? </p> <p>One reason is that many voters apparently don't want a president who makes them feel stupid. Bush himself is clearly aware of this, and now cracks self-mocking jokes about his linguistic incompetence at every opportunity. He was also quick to deny a suggestion in this month's Vanity Fair magazine that he has severe dyslexia, even though it might have won him some sympathy and disarmed his tormentors. (Musn't mock the afflicted, must we?) The implication of his rebuttal seemed to be: I ain't ill or disabled, I'm just a good old American dimwit - an amiable chump, a genial goof, a second Ronnie Reagan. </p> <p>But there is another message, albeit largely subliminal (or \"subliminable\", as Bush would say): You can trust me, cos I'm not smart enough to be devious and dishonest. Even when he is caught telling a whopper - as in last week's presidential debate, when he boasted of pushing through a patients' bill of rights which he had in fact vetoed - people seem willing to blame it on his feeble, faulty memory rather than wilful deceit. </p> <p>Al Gore, by contrast, is not only a smart-alec whose head bulges with hard-disk capacity but also a liar. Last month he told the Teamsters union that when he was a baby his mum lulled him to sleep by singing Look for the Union Label - a song which was written when Gore was 27 years old and had presumably outgrown his cradle. The story is about as plausible as Tony Blair's recollection of watching Jackie Milburn play football for Newcastle. </p> <p>As with Blair, however, Gore's inventiveness isn't limited to harmless and endearing childhood anecdotes. Blair has repeatedly claimed, falsely, that he voted for Mike Foster's anti-hunting bill; Gore says that he was \"the author\" of the earned income tax credit, even though it was passed by Congress in 1975, two years before he entered the house. According to Andrew Rawnsley's book, Tony Blair lied about Bernie Ecclestone's \u00a31m gift to the Labour party; Al Gore's mendacity about his own fund-raising activities is eerily similar. </p> <p>Three years ago, Gore flatly denied that he had ever attended meetings at the White House to discuss illegal \"hard-money\" donations. When documents later surfaced showing that the vice-president had indeed been present, he told the FBI that he \"drank a lot of iced tea during meetings, which could have necessitated a rest-room break\". (This ingenious alibi was promptly exploded by Harold Ickes, the former deputy chief of staff, who testified that he had always stopped the meetings when the vice-president left the room.) Under interrogation by the justice department in April this year, Gore was asked about more than 30 fund-raising \"coffee mornings\" which he had hosted at the White House before the last presidential campaign. He said he had \"no concrete recollection\" of any such events. Perhaps all those cups of coffee had kept him almost permanently in the lavatory. </p> <p>Since the fall of the Berlin Wall, various wiseacres have asserted that we are now at the End of History: that American-style democracy is the unimprovable culmination of human achievement, a universal model which all countries will henceforth copy. A glance at this year's contest between Dumbo and Pinocchio might make even Francis Fukuyama wonder if he spoke too soon. </p> <p>The one serious and substantial candidate, Ralph Nader, has been excluded from the televised debates and largely ignored by the mainstream media, perhaps for fear that he'll show up his rivals as a couple of bozos. Potential Nader supporters are being warned by liberal Democrats that unless they vote for Gore as \"the lesser of two evils\" they will be responsible for letting Bush into the Oval Office. This is a counsel of despair and desperation - \"like a man on a raft facing the decision of whether to drink seawater or his own urine\", in the words of Alexander Cockburn. </p> <p>Yet the American media is still gamely and patriotically pretending that the election confirms the sublime superiority of their version of democracy, and that the electorate should thank Gore and Bush for forcing it to decide between piss and the deep blue sea. A Washington Post editorial this week argued that although many aspects of the campaign were \"squalid\" and \"corrupt\", and although neither candidate had any obvious principles or \"inner conviction\", nevertheless both Gore and Bush were decent, admirable fellows: \"The nation this year is fortunate in its choice.\" The latest issue of Time magazine piles on the flattery: \"The Lover vs The Fighter ... With just two weeks to go, the campaigns have made the choice clear: Do you want Bush's pledges of civility or Gore's crusading punch?\" </p> <p>The lover versus the fighter! Oh brave new world, that has such titans in it. The real \"choice\", alas, is rather less alluring: will it be the flubber or the fibber? </p> <p><b>Playing to the crowd</b></p> <p>I have been rebuked by the Rev Douglas Alexander, who conducted Donald Dewar's obsequies, for the \"tastelessness and insensitivity\" of my comments last week. </p> <p>For the benefit of the Rev and anyone else who missed the point, let me try again: the object of my mockery was not Donald Dewar, whom I liked, but the eccentric Blairite notion that the theme of the bloodthirsty book of Isaiah is \"social inclusion\". (I'm reminded of the prime minister's claim a few years ago that New Labour owed its philosophy to \"the ancient prophets of the Old Testament\".) </p> <p>Meanwhile, if Douglas Alexander wishes to pursue his campaign against tasteless and insensitive behaviour, he should have a word with his friend Tony Blair - who strode into Dewar's funeral, as he had done at Cardinal Hume's, grinning and waving to the crowd like a Spice Girl at a royal film premiere.</p>",
  "The prospect of US-style leaders' television debates in the run-up to the general election came a step closer yesterday when the Tories agreed Liberal Democrat leader, Charles Kennedy, should be involved. <p>In a letter to the three main broadcasting companies, the Conservative chairman, Michael Ancram, yesterday formally tabled proposals involving all three parties. </p> <p>Mr Ancram suggested debates between William Hague and Tony Blair; Charles Kennedy and Mr Blair; and Mr Hague and Mr Kennedy. Separate arrangements would be made for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. </p> <p>The Tory proposals were welcomed as constructive by Sky TV news political editor, Adam Boulton, who said it was the job of the TV companies to come up with an offer the parties could not refuse. </p> <p>Divisions between the TV companies, indecision over the participation of the Liberal Democrats, and Labour reluctance to throw away a big poll lead all led to the collapse of protracted negotiations before the 1997 election. </p> <p>The Liberal Democrats' cam paign chairman, Lord Razzell, yesterday welcomed the idea of debates, saying: \"At a time when interest in the democratic process is in decline, leaders' debates would be a valuable way of reviving it\". </p> <p>But Lord Razzell also tabled some detailed objections, saying: \"We believe that three-way debates between the leaders of the three main parties would be far preferable to a series of one-to-one gladiatorial contests on the lines which the Conservatives have proposed.\" </p> <p>The Conservatives want the debates believing that Mr Hague will reproduce his sparkling debating form seen frequently at prime ministers' questions. However, the Conservatives fear that if all three party leaders debate at the same time, Mr Kennedy and Mr Blair, with their similar policy platforms will , in effect, unite against an isolated and extreme-appearing Hague. </p> <p>The debates would be shown on BBC, ITV and Sky News, as well as broadcast on radio and the internet. </p> <p>The Tories reignited the issue of set piece TV debates such as those seen over the past few weeks in the US presidential election, at the Conservative party conference. </p> <p>None of the three parties will want to be seen to be the cause of the breakdown of any negotiations over the debates. However, if Mr Blair is ahead in the polls during the campaign, the Labour leader will be strongly advised not to take part in any debate from which he can only suffer. Mr Ancram said yesterday: \"We do not believe that there should be three-way debates there are only two party leaders who are in a position to lead the next government.But we believe the proposal is more than fair in that Mr Kennedy receives equality of time, which the Liberal Democrats would not normally merit.\"</p>",
  "South Africa yesterday attempted to end the row over President Thabo Mbeki's controversial views on the causes of Aids by launching a nationwide health campaign which implicitly repudiates the presidential opinion. <p>The minister of health, Manto Tshabalala-Msimang, told reporters in Soweto yesterday that the new guidelines for healthcare workers were intended to help implement the government's five-year plan released earlier this year. </p> <p>She insisted the government operated on the premise that HIV caused Aids - earlier this year Mr Mbeki attracted withering international criticism for associating with dissident theorists who doubt whether HIV is the sole cause of the disease. </p> <p>The ANC government's new campaign, launched in full-page newspaper advertisements, emphasises the benefits of safe sex and the use of condoms and faithfulness between partners. </p> <p>But criticisms remained last night that despite the new campaign, the Mbeki government was still failing to issue anti-retroviral drugs to an estimated 4.2m citizens already carrying the virus. </p> <p>The charge has been exploited by the opposition Democratic Alliance. With a eye to local government elections on December 5 - the first test of the Mbeki presidency since the general election - they have promised to distribute the medicines free of charge in municipalities which fall under their control. </p> <p>The opposition leader, Tony Leon, is expected in Europe this week for negotiations with the pharmaceutical companies on the supply of anti-retroviral drugs at reduced prices. </p> <p>The ANC hit back angrily by claiming that the opposition offer mounted to an attempt to use black people as guinea pigs in drug experiments. </p> <p>Evoking parallels with experiments with poisons carried out on blacks during apartheid, the ANC's chief spokesman, Smuts Ngonyama, said: \"We find it quite outrageous that this issue, which is at the core of survival of humanity, can be exploited for political grandstanding. </p> <p>\"[South Africans] are being used as guinea pigs and conned into using dangerous and toxic drugs that are detrimental to their own health.\" </p> <p>There are indications that support for Mr Mbeki is declining as a result of his stand. Recent polls indicate that his personal popularity has fallen from 71% in May to 52.2%. </p> <p>In spite of the ministry of health claim that the government accepts the causal link between HIV and Aids, political insiders close to the presidency report that Mr Mbeki, if anything, is becoming more emphatic in his contrary stand. </p> <p>Earlier this month a leaked account of an ANC parliamentary caucus meeting had him not only reasserting his denial of a causal link between HIV and Aids but claiming that the truth was being covered up by a conspiracy among the drugs companies, backed by the CIA. </p> <p>He claimed that the international conspiracy to undermine him and South Africa had been mounted because the country was seen as an emerging leader of the developing nations in its challenge to the world economic order. </p> <p>He also said there was a campaign to brand him as being deranged and the government was investigating those responsible.</p>",
  "At least one person was killed when supporters of the Ivory Coast's civilian opposition leader, Laurent Gbagbo, took to the streets of the capital, Abidjan, yesterday after the commander of the country's ruling junta, General Robert Guei, declared himself the winner in Sunday's presidential election. <p>A crowd of at least 2,000 repeatedly regrouped near the presidential offices after being dispersed by soldiers and military police using machine guns and firing tear gas. </p> <p>The body of one demonstrator lay in the street after a burst of gunfire. Witnesses said at least four others were injured. </p> <p>The election was effectively decided when Gen Guei, who seized control of the west African country in an army coup last December, dissolved the independent commission over-seeing the election yesterday. On Monday the National Electoral Commission reported that Mr Gbagbo, of the Ivorian Popular Front (IPF), had taken a commanding lead in the contest. </p> <p>Mr Gbagbo implored the country's residents to take to the streets last night after Gen Guei's victory was announced. </p> <p>Daniel Bamba Sheik, director-general of the interior ministry's territorial administration department, said Gen Guei took almost 53% of the vote, against 41% for Mr Gbagbo. </p> <p>He blamed the decision to disband the commission on massive fraud and the inability of its officials. </p> <p>\"This commission, visibly lacking in experience, instituted operational procedures for tabulating results that made the results unacceptable, causing, as was observed, mistakes and confusion,\" he said. </p> <p>He went on to accuse several parties, including the IPF, of bussing voters from Abidjan to villages in the interior to vote twice. </p> <p>Members of the electoral commission were accompanied by armed guards yesterday and were not allowed to speak to journalists. </p> <p>The country's two largest political parties boycotted the ballot after their leaders were barred from running by the supreme court, leaving only Mr Gbagbo to run against the junta leader. The EC withdrew its election funding in protest.</p>",
  "President Vojislav Kostunica inched forward yesterday in his effort to take more power from his defeated opponent Slobodan Milosevic when the Serbian parliament appointed a transitional government to run the republic until elections are held in December. <p>Nearly three weeks after he was declared the winner of Yugoslavia's presidential election, Mr Kostunica's allies won the right to oversee the Serbian premiership and the key ministries of police, information, justice, and finance. </p> <p>As Yugoslav president, Mr Kostunica's main power is in appointing the foreign and defence ministers and the army chief of staff. </p> <p>He has kept on the defence minister appointed by Mr Milosevic, even though he is an indicted war criminal, on the grounds that it takes time to consolidate democracy. </p> <p>The other key powers are with the Serbian government, which was controlled by Mr Milosevic's Socialist party. A Socialist, Milomir Minic, will be the new prime minister of Serbia, but he will have to act in agreement with his two deputies, one an ally of Mr Kostunica and the other a representative of the opposition Serbian Renewal Movement. Three-party troikas will be in charge of the main ministries. </p> <p>This unusual division of power will at least allow Mr Kostunica's allies to escape some of the blame for what looks like being a tough winter for most Serbs, with looming shortages of fuel. </p> <p>But he will get credit for the huge programme of food and energy aid from the European Union and the United States which his election victory has unleashed. </p> <p>Mr Kostunica is hoping that the alliance of 18 parties which won him the presidential election will get the majority of seats in the Serbian parliament in the polling booths on December 23. </p> <p>\"The time of this government is limited and so are its tasks,\" Mr Minic told parliament. \"Its two main missions are to stabilise economic policy and urgently address the economic needs of the citizens.\" </p> <p>The new president is planning to visit Moscow on Friday to thank his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, for the important role he played in the transfer of power. </p> <p>The Russians were the last major state to recognise Mr Kostunica's victory. Although this was derided by many western officials as a sign that Moscow was out of touch, the timing of the Russian declaration was significant. </p> <p>It came a few hours before Igor Ivanov, the Russian foreign minister, arrived in Belgrade to see Mr Milosevic and the new president the day after crowds stormed the parliament building and the main state-owned television station. The announcement that Mr Putin accepted Mr Kostunica's victory was a bitter blow to Mr Milosevic. </p> <p>Mr Milosevic was still wondering about using the army to reverse the result and restore his rule, but at their meeting Mr Ivanov warned him not to try. </p> <p>In some ways the Russians' action paralleled their contribution during Nato's air strikes, when their special envoy, Viktor Chernomyrdin, joined forces with western governments in urging Mr Milosevic to accept defeat in the military duel. This too was highly significant. </p> <p>Mr Ivanov also persuaded Mr Kostunica to visit the defeated president at his villa and mollify him with assurances that he would not be extradited to the Hague. </p> <p>According to Yugoslav intelligence sources, Mr Kostunica promised Mr Milosevic that he would resist western pressures for extradition, however strong they became. </p> <p>He also promised to maintain stability in the army, which was interpreted to mean that he would not replace the defence minister and army chief of staff. </p> <p>Some Yugoslavs wonder whether Mr Kostunica needed to take such a conciliatory approach. But the fact that Mr Milosevic still retained considerable power through the Serbian government apparently convinced the new president that he had to move slowly and gradually. </p> <p>The fact that he took nearly three weeks to get agreement on a new Serbian government, which is still a hybrid of pro- and anti-Milosevic forces, may also justify his caution.</p>"

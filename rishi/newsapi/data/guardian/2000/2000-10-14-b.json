  "<p>Rt Hon Tony Blair MP Prime Minister; Leader of the Labour Party (1). <br> </p> <p> Rt Hon Gordon Brown MP Chancellor of the Exchequer (3).<br> </p> <p> Alan Greenspan Chairman, American Federal Bank Reserve (7).</p> <p> The man revered as the architect of the unprecedented economic boom in the US is facing his biggest test. His every pout, strut, and subtle change in syntax or vocabulary is analysed and counter-analysed by global markets. His greatest test may come after next month's Presidential elections. The Fed, although politically independent, has held off from changing interest rates in the run-up to the polls. Greenspan, originally appointed by Ronald Reagan, was accused of losing George Bush Sr the 1992 election after interest rate hikes just before the poll. With the US trade deficit spiralling out of control and growth still stellar, Greenspan will be responsible for 'the soft landing' of the economy. Despite all the adulation he has received in the past, it is this job which will prove the ultimate test of his mythical abilities, and may prove the difference between global boom or global slump.<br> </p> <p> <br> Steve Case Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, AOL; chairman designate, AOL-Time Warner (59). </p> <p> If, in 10 years' time, the impact of the internet amounts to a fraction of the wild claims made for it now, then much of the credit will go to Steve Case. The proposed \u00a3128 billion merger of his company, America Online with Time Warner, itself trying to merge with UK music group, EMI, represents the first conjuncture of old and new media. He barely registered on last year's list but this year he was the star of the show at the Davos World Economic Forum, eclipsing even Bill Gates, and he was proclaimed king of the new establishment by the US glossies. The creation of AOL-Time Warner is the practical manifestation of digital convergence. Television, movies, music and computer games will be available on demand in homes over high-speed data links. Case was in a position to broker the deal because AOL was among that rarest of breeds: the profit-making internet company.<br> </p> <p> Alastair Campbell Press Secretary to the Prime Minister (5).<br> </p> <p> Sir Eddie George Governor, Bank of England (8). <br> </p> <p> 'Steady but ready' Eddie's influence over interest rates has strengthened over the past year. He has made the casting vote in the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee on at least two occasions, keeping mortgage costs constant since February. Sir Edward became Governor of the Bank of England in 1993. His term was renewed for a further five years in 1998, his powers then greatly enhanced by Labour's granting of operational independence to the Bank in 1997, but weakened by the removal of regulatory powers over the financial sector. Last month he helped coordinate an international effort to prop up the ailing euro. But he is a noted eurosceptic, and as the Chancellor has tempered his euro-enthusiasm, and the economy prospered, so the relationship between the two men has improved. They now get on well. </p> <p> Bill Clinton President of United States of America (4). <br> </p> <p> Clinton's foreign policy often lays the foundation for the UK's. Labour modelled its election campaign on the 1992 Clinton victory; Blair used Clinton to promote peace in Northern Ireland. The United States dominated Nato policy over Kosovo, refusing to deploy US ground troops. Refused to assist Blair to forge a republican compromise on the RUC issue, which Clinton thinks should be addressed as outlined in the Patten report. Recently his influence in the Mid-East has been questioned. Such is the ephemeral nature of political power that Clinton - whose term ends in January- is unlikely to figure in this list next year.<br> </p> <p> Bill Gates Chairman, Microsoft (2).<br> </p> <p> The past 12 months have not been a great year for the world's richest man. The software guru has suffered the ignominy of having his company branded a monopoly by the US government which is now examining ways of breaking the firm up. Nevertheless Gates, 44, is still worth more than $60bn and it is far from certain that Microsoft will do the splits. Slow to realise the importance of the internet, Gates is now refocusing Microsoft into a company which aims to write the code for the next generation of internet-compatible devices. Disliked by some for the way his company has dominated the industry, Gates, married with two children, does not outwardly give the impression of being a bully. Quiet and reserved Gates has pledged to give away 95 per cent of his wealth to civic and philanthropic causes when he dies.</p> <p> Rupert Murdoch Chairman and Chief Executive, News Corporation (6).<br> </p> <p> Four million daily Sun readers and the 700,000 Times readers. His Sunday Times and News of the World are formidable money-making machines. In BSkyB Murdoch has 40 per cent and effective control of Western Europe's most profitable broadcaster. Was diagnosed with low grade prostate cancer recently, so speculation mounts that he is grooming a successor. His son Lachlan was last week appointed deputy at News Corp and seems the sibling most likely. As the election nears there will again be speculation as to the influence Murdoch wields over his editors.<br> </p> <p> <br> Sir John Browne Chief executive, BP Amoco; Trustee of the British Museum (23).</p> <p> It has often been said of Sir John Browne that he wields more power and has more influence over our lives than the aver age minister. After September's fuel crisis demonstrated Government impotence in guaranteeing petrol supplies, and its inability to force oil companies to ensure them, the Prime Minister may himself ruefully reflect on the truth of this remark. Browne has built BP from an important, but second tier oil company, to a global 'supermajor' capable of competing with the likes of Exxon. Two significant deals - the purchase of US oil company Amoco for pounds 30bn in 1998 and its subsequent acquisition of Arco pounds 18bn - have propelled the company to a market value of nearly pounds 138 bn and to the second slot in the FTSE 100 index. </p> <p>Highest new entry<br> John Chambers President and CEO, Cisco Systems Inc. </p> <p> Chambers, 51, is the man who wired the world. His company, Cisco, makes the hardware and software which powers the internet. It does all the back-end, boring stuff which means that it is set to benefit massively from the demand for e-business solutions. 'Are you ready?' runs the company's ads heralding the internet revolution. Cisco certainly was and its share price soared 50,000 per cent in a decade. Chambers is the internet revolution's biggest cheerleader and is the biggest critic. Cisco became the most valuable firm in the US earlier this year when it temporarily overtook Microsoft. </p> <p> <br> Chris Gent Chief Executive, Vodafone (31).</p> <p> UK's market leader in mobile phones, Vodafone's coup de grace was the takeover of German telecom company Mannesmann, valuing it at more than \u00a382 billion. Has become the world's biggest mobile phone operator.</p> <p> Rt Hon Peter Mandelson MP Northern Ireland Secretary (25).</p> <p> Returned to Cabinet after only 10 months in wilderness. After initial success, the peace process now seems precariously balanced in the face of Unionist opposition and republican refusal to compromise.</p> <p> Jonathan Powell Downing Street Chief of Staff (9).</p> <p> Became Tony Blair's chief of staff in 1995. Acts as the PM's fixer, liaising with civil servants, and behind-the-scenes Northern Ireland envoy. Refuted allegations that he masterminded whispering campaigns against Mo Mowlam and Frank Dobson. </p> <p> Nobuyuki Idei President and CEO, Sony Corporation (154).</p> <p> Leader of the world's largest corporation since 1995. Sony pioneered the video recorder, Walkman and Mini-Disc. His are the slogans 'Digital Dream Kids' and 'ReGeneration'. </p> <p> Greg Dyke Director General, BBC (11).</p> <p> His appointment provoked William Hague to spend \u00a3100,000 on media analysts to monitor BBC output. Drastic shake-up is already under way, with rout of middle management. He has even banned croissants at morning meetings to save costs.</p> <p> Marjorie Scardino CEO, Pearson (48).</p> <p> First female executive of a FTSE 100 company. Former Chief Executive of the Economist, her influence as head of a company that owns the FT, Economist, Penguin Books, Baywatch and Madame Tussaud's secured her number eight slot in Fortune 's list of most powerful women. Shares have doubled in two years.</p> <p> Rt Hon David Blunkett MP Education and Employment Secretary (27).</p> <p> Has direct responsibility for two of the government's key policies: raising school standards and New Deal.

Joined Brown behind the 'forces of privilege' campaign. Offered somewhat too eagerly to take reins in running the country so Blair could take paternity leave.</p> <p> Gerry Robinson Chairman, Granada Group; Chairman, Arts Council (39).</p> <p> Granada own a third of the ITV network. At the Arts Council Robinson is in charge of pounds 384 million of government and lottery money. Sits on the Creative Industries taskforce. </p> <p> Rt Hon Jack Straw MP Home Secretary (28).</p> <p> Remains a figure of calm as storms rage over Labour but...criticised over watering down of Freedom of Information Bill; under pressure to introduce race reforms in the wake of the Lawrence report; criticised over Asylum Bill and voucher system for refugees. </p> <p> Rt Hon Robin Cook MP Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs Secretary (44).</p> <p> Has been kept busy with Zimbabwe, Sierra Leone and Chechnya, and has frozen military exports to Zimbabwe. Has been pressing Blair to enter the European single currency at an earlier date.</p> <p> Paul Dacre Editor, Daily Mail (19).</p> <p> The Mail outstripped the Daily Mirror's circulation for the first time in 1998, selling 2,421,319, the second highest among UK dailies.

In May 1999 was named Business Leader of the Year. Paid pounds 3.63m last year.</p> <p> <br> Sir Richard Branson Founder &amp; Chairman, Virgin (32).</p> <p> Recently sold extracts of his autobiography Losing My Virginity to the Sun while a rival paper extracted Tom Bower's less flattering and unauthorised biography.

Now looking at judicial appointments after objections to his own choices. </p> <p> Wim Duisenburg President, European Central Bank (35).</p> <p> Dutch ex-banker now dubbed Mr Euro. Low value of the currency has adverse effect on UK exports to Euroland. The ECB faces allegations of lack of transparency in terms of policy and interest-rate decisions.</p> <p> Gerhard Schroder Chancellor, Germany (12).</p> <p> Glossy election campaign won him power and tag of 'Herr Blair', he took over a delicate role in European politics and an economy with 10.6% unemployment - 5m people. Hit early on by the departure of finance minister, Oskar Lafontaine, due to policy divisions. </p> <p> Ed Balls Chief Economic Adviser to Gordon Brown (45).</p> <p> One of a handful of people the Chancellor will listen to, Balls is a prime mover behind the Americanisation of Labour economic policy. Regarded as 'deputy chancellor', he sees every key Treasury paper and is an advocate of welfare-to-work and promoting individual opportunity.</p> <p> Philip Gould Strategic Adviser (60).</p> <p> One of the architects of New Labour, key adviser to Tony Blair; married to Gail Rebuck of Random House. Gould is one of the most important people in Blair's inner circle.</p> <p> <br> Mark Moody-Stuart Group Chairman, Royal Dutch Shell (77).</p> <p> His reforms have upturned Shell's fortunes. Despite efforts to repair relations with the Ogoni people of Nigeria over the past two years ending in violence, with Ken Saro-Wiwa's successor being charged with murder and arson, Moody-Stuart has been hailed as succeeding in shaking up the Anglo-Dutch group and making it perform.</p> <p> Terry Leahy Chief Executive, Tesco (15).</p> <p> With a p\u00a3500m investment programme that will see 22 new stores and 10,000 new jobs, Leahy looks set to ensure Tesco retains its number one slot with 15% of the grocery market.

System took pounds 1.25bn worth of business from Microsoft's Windows last year.</p>"

  "Down in the mosh pit, while Al Gore was midway through his coming-out speech, two of his aides slapped a high five; his young and idealistic speechwriter, Eli Attie, and seasoned, cynical 'message guru', Carter Eskew. <p>'I stand here tonight,' Gore had just told the electrified crowd, 'as my own man'. It was the moment of the passing of the torch, the handover of the leadership of the Democrat Party - and maybe the White House - by the President who had stolen the show on Monday night. His deputy and political 'son' was now delivering the most important speech of his life. </p> <p>To the delight of Gore's audience and the surprise of many, he rose to the occasion with a declaration of war in a time of peace; with impatience at a time of prosperity and content. Naomi Wolf's 'Alpha Male' had broken free. </p> <p>The speech was unabashedly populist, a class-conscious battle-cry crafted to forge an abyss between himself and his opponent, George W. Bush, who next day accused Gore of 'class warfare'. Gore cast Bush as a defender of 'powerful interests', while he would champion the 'working families of America'. </p> <p>It is a high-risk strategy, which enlivens the struggle against Bush. This now becomes - issue for issue, brick by brick - the most politically polarised election since Ronald Reagan's. </p> <p>'The presidency,' said Gore, 'is more than a popularity contest' - a dig at Bush and, in its way, at Clinton too - 'it is a day-to-day fight for people. There are big choices ahead and a shopping list of reforms in education, health-care, social security, law and order, and our whole future is at stake ... We have got to win this election.' This was not a 'new' Al Gore, but it was - as one of his close aides said - 'as good as he gets', when it mattered most. </p> <p>Gore took a big gamble last week in Los Angeles. He was forced into it not so much by his own convictions as by the most contorted and complex heredity ever bestowed on a politician - a miasma of personal and political relationships. </p> <p>Talking to The Observer after the speech, one of Gore's closest aides said: 'It's been so incredibly complicated - like a family fraught with relationships and loyalties pulling and pushing him in all directions. Clinton, Hillary, Monica, the whole White House thing.' </p> <p>Foremost among those relationships is that with the President, out of whose long shadow Gore had to emerge if he was to live up to the declaration of independence that Attie and Eskew (among others) enjoyed so much. </p> <p>Last week Clinton cast two contradictory shadows over his prot\u00e9g\u00e9: his lambent valediction on Monday night, and the news, leaked on the day of Gore's speech that Special Prosecutor Kenneth Starr's successor is considering re-opening the Monica Lewinsky wound. </p> <p>The President had promised not to step into Gore's spotlight, but he could hardly help being himself. Everyone agreed that Clinton's farewell address was a star performance. </p> <p>Far from setting the stage for Gore, Clinton staked his own personal claim of credit for America's good times. This is something Clinton has always felt he was due, but not granted, as his obsession with his legacy swings between three moods: contrition, whimsical melancholia and Monday's charismatic self-satisfaction. The mood swings are fast and frequent. Last week Clinton went before the cameras to clutch the hand of a tele-evangelist, describe his embarkation upon a 'new life', beg forgiveness for his 'terrible mistakes' and implore the public not to blame Al Gore. </p> <p>Meanwhile, staff in the West Wing talk about Clinton's 'dark moods', which often permeate his speeches in lines that resemble those of an emperor who has seen through his own game of power play - such as, 'in 200 years' time, all of us will have been forgotten'. </p> <p>Then came Monday: Clinton's contrived but effective gladiatorial walk down a tunnel leading to the stage, his shining smile and defiant response to what he took to be a personal affront from George Bush - the notion that he had somehow 'squandered' economic opportunities. It takes that kind of wound - coupled with a sense of occasion - to bring out the magic in Bill Clinton. </p> <p>All three moods in the Clinton bequest created different and complex challenges for Gore last week. Gore had to maintain his distance from the Lewinsky scandal, but needed also to claim some reward for his part in Clinton's roll-call of achievement. On the other hand, he had to do this in a way that enables him to appear as a leader, not a perennial number two. </p> <p>He also needed to find his own manifesto - it would not be enough to promise more of the same - especially because Bush thinks that is his line. </p> <p>There were other pressures too, not least from an even longer shadow across American politics than that of Clinton, and an even more illustrious name - Kennedy. The note sounded by that name was a loud one in Los Angeles last week: it was exactly 40 years ago in LA that John F. Kennedy was nominated by the Democratic convention, announcing the 'New Frontier' in an epic speech which defined the politics and aspirations of a generation. </p> <p>In the year 2000, the bridge between Clinton's big night and that of Gore's began with the remarkable appearance of four Kennedys during Tuesday, notably the secretive Caroline - sole survivor of JFK's immediate family. Her rare, elegant address was a high water mark of the convention, recalling her father's life and death, and saying: 'Now we are the New Frontier, and now that many of us are doing so well, it is time once again to ask more of ourselves. Much as we need a prosperous economy, we also need a prosperity of kindness and decency.' </p> <p>The leader of the clan, Senator Ted, followed with a coded manifesto for everything that he - as guardian of the party's left wing - believes the Clinton administration should have done but did not, mainly in healthcare and social security. </p> <p>In an interview with The Observer , the heir to Camelot - Patrick Kennedy, son of Bobby - said he found it 'surreal' to have his relatives take the stage in this way. 'This is not the real world here,' he said. Now in charge of the Democrats' fundraising, Congressman Kennedy added that 'politics is not about the kind of charisma that my father and uncle had; it is about hard work, everyday hard work'. </p> <p>But all these Kennedy conversations and addresses had one striking feature in common: Clinton was not mentioned. Four decades on, the name Kennedy represented the liberal ideals that Clinton is thought, by the party's left, to have abandoned, or at least sidelined, and which now lodged their claim - from among the party base, at least - with his successor. </p> <p>The challenge to Gore was to balance this claim - and the need to secure his own, still not conquered, party base - against the battle for the centre-ground votes and the 'undecideds', among whom he trails Bush. </p> <p>Faced with this labyrinth of complex and contradictory challenges, the stakes were higher than the expectations when Gore took the podium on Thursday to take President Clinton's baton. In the event, Gore took a gamble. </p> <p>He forged what may emerge as his own brand of unashamed populism, which combined some of Clinton's centrism with a decisive step to the left of the President he has served. </p> <p>At a time when a largely contented electorate shows little taste for political confrontation, Gore laced Clinton's 'New Democrat' vision with more than a touch of the 'Old'. He blasted big oil, big insurance, big tobacco and big everything in bellicose language that belonged more to Franklin Roosevelt's party of the Thirties than that which Clinton returned to the presidential office eight years ago. </p> <p>Gore focused not on what the Clinton administration has done, but what it left undone in the lives of those whom pundits call the 'K-Mart voter', whom Gore promised to champion and characterised as 'people trying to make house payments and car payments, working overtime to pay for college and do right by their kids'. Out of the 5,100 words in his speech, only one of them was 'Clinton'. Twenty were 'fight'. </p> <p>At times, Gore's description of the political landscape even felt like a speech from opposition, rather than from the deputy leader who had painted it. </p> <p>Indeed, George Bush was quick to spot this on Friday, saying that the 'laundry list' of Gore's proposed reforms 'seems like a reflection on past failures'. </p> <p>In his best lines, Gore conceded that he appears 'a bit of a policy wonk' and 'won't always be the most exciting politician', but offered a stark contrast to Clinton with a pledge that: 'I will never let you down.' </p> <p>The list of commitments on children, health insurance, education, guns, abortion and crime was a strident and often ambitious one, and, echoing Caroline Kennedy, Gore promised to 'challenge a culture with too much meanness and not enough meaning'. </p> <p>In the aftermath of the speech, those around Gore were happy, but wary of the electoral task to which this rhetoric now commits them, and those on the left were pleasantly surprised. </p> <p>Harold Ickes is the Democrats' left-wing Svengali figure and a long-time foe of Gore (he privately believes Gore cost him the post of Chief of Staff). He conceded to The Observer: 'It was good. The last quarter, very good.' </p> <p>George Stephanopoulos, a key strategist in both Clinton presidential campaigns, who left Clinton's White House disappointed, told The Observer he thought 'Gore did a good job. Great speech. It's what we've been waiting to hear from him'. </p> <p>The early polls suggest that America broadly agrees, but the test will come over the next few days. One source close to Gore said that the team felt the 'springboard effect of the convention has to bring Gore within three points of Bush, otherwise we're in big trouble'. </p> <p> <b>The style file: Gore and Clinton</b><br></p> <p> <b> William Jefferson Blythe Clinton IV </b></p> <p><b>Born: </b> 19 August, 1946, three months after his father died.

  "<p>If leopards really can change their spots, perhaps it is now time to take a fresh look at SR Pharma, the AIM- listed drugs outfit. </p> <p>Three years ago, SR had a rocky ride under its old name, Stanford Rook. Then the shares slumped from a 540p high to just 150p when the firm's much-hyped drug treatment for tuberculosis was abandoned as a lost cause. </p> <p>It was, however, a crash widely foretold: the firm's managing director quit before its 1995 flotation, refusing to sign up to the extravagant claims made for the drug. </p> <p>From a low of 60p, SR has since climbed back, with most of the gains coming after the change of name in May last year. SR is now pinning its hopes on its SRL172 treatment for asthma and lung cancer, with phase III trial results due next year on the cancer front.And last week US partner Corixa signed a deal to commercialise SR's PVAC treatment for psoriasis, under which SR will receive licence fees, royalties and milestone payments. </p> <p>The shares regained their old heights in May after positive phase II results for SRL172. They have since drifted back, however, and barely moved on last week's deal. Clearly the shares are risky, but SR followers believe the lull offers a buying opportunity. Broker Lehman thinks the shares, now at 335p, could go to \u00a314 if SR finally realises its potential. </p> <p><strong> Laporte revival</strong><br> Laporte, the chemicals group, has enjoyed a renaissance of sorts following a solid set of interim results. First-half profits may have come in only fractionally ahead, but in the face of the high pound and rising raw material costs, that in itself was quite an achievement. </p> <p>The management is strongly rated and a bid is likely. Swiss rival Clariant made an approach last year, and Laporte will not be short of suitors next time round. </p> <p>At 497p, the shares are way below broker Schroder Salomon Smith Barney's target 700p take-out price. </p> <p><strong> Winners' curse</strong><br> The telecoms sector breathed a sigh of relief on Thursday with the end of the German auction for six new mobile licences. After 173 rounds of bidding, the \u00a330 billion of cash flowing into German coffers topped the \u00a322.5bn raised by Gordon Brown. More good news then for the Chancellors, but bad news for the likes of Vodafone Airtouch, which now has to fork out \u00a35bn for its winning bid. With more auctions to come, broker Charles Stanley reckons Vodafone is likely to spend \u00a318.5bn on third-generation mobile licences around the world. And that's before a capital expenditure bill that could top \u00a320bn by 2010. </p> <p>Vodafone shares have dropped from a high of \u00a34 to 268p now following the UK's groundbreaking auction. Given that it is unlikely to show any real return on its investment until 2007, Charles Stanley's team thinks the shares are still too high compared with its 231p benchmark valuation. </p> <p>Also, the impending reflotation of Orange by France Telecom and other mobile offerings are likely to put pressure on Vodafone in the near term. </p> <p><strong> BAT's Bush telegraph</strong><br> BAT, the world's number two tobacco group, has held its ground following the latest assault on the industry in the US courts last month. The jury may have awarded $18bn in damages against BAT, but broker Merrill Lynch believes the verdict will fall apart on appeal. </p> <p>The broker remains upbeat on the European tobacco sector in general, with lots of positive news likely for BAT. Also, if the Republicans look likely to win the US Presidential election, tobacco shares may well gain on anticipation that Bush will influence the Justice Department lawsuit. At 449p, BAT shares are still worth a look.</p>",
  "Two images stand out from the protests taking place outside the Democrats' convention in Los Angeles this week. The first was of battalions of riot police, equipped as if for an invasion, standing guard outside the downtown temples of corporate America as demonstrators marched past. The second was of the mainly Latino workers in the Broadway sweatshops leaning out of windows to cheer on the marchers protesting against \"corporate greed\" and globalisation. <p>The images symbolise both what is missing from conventional American politics, what divides the haves and have-nots of the world's richest country and what is fuelling the still unspecific but growing international movement that started in Seattle last year and will be seeking another platform in Prague next month. </p> <p>Only half of the American electorate vote for the president and the events of the past week in LA have partly served to explain why. The financial clout of the corporations now gives the appearance of having permeated every aspect of policy-making so that it is no longer clear to many people whether their elected representatives are acting in the voters' interests or their backers' interests. </p> <p>Do politicians shy away from real gun reform because of the gun manufacturers' lobby? Do they back a judicial system that jails more than 2m Americans because the prison-industrial complex now carries such weight? Are they helping the Colombian government in a civil war because they want to protect the interests of American oil and because it suits the military-industrial complex? For many politicians the answer may be no, but the suspicion will remain as long as the race is to the richest. The news this week that George W Bush had now raised $100m for his campaign and his running mate, Dick Cheney, had received a corporate pay-off of $20m further emphasised the great gulf between those inside the safe convention walls and those outside on the streets. And it is this gut feeling that the corporations and the international financial bodies are now controlling decisions on wages, the environment or immigration, that has helped to mobilise this still loosely-knit confederation of protest. </p> <p>What fuels it, too, in the United States, is the feeling that neither of the two main parties offer alternatives on what are to some people the most important issues of the day. One of the angriest demonstrations of the week focused on those on death row and in jail for drugs offences. Both Democrats and Republicans back the death penalty and both support the \"war on drugs\" that has led to the incarceration of so many. Indeed one of Al Gore's pledges during his acceptance speech was for a further 50,000 police officers. Not a further 50,000 teachers for a country with the illiteracy levels similar to those of many third world countries; not a further 50,000 medical workers for a country where 40m are not entitled to healthcare. No wonder some of the placards outside carried the slogan: \"Don't incarcerate, educate\". </p> <p>The ghost at the feast this week has been Ralph Nader, the Green party's candidate and now the repository of the hopes of the liberal left outside the Democratic party. His name was written in the heavens by a sky-writing plane on Wednesday and has been on the lips of many throughout the week. Is a vote for Nader a vote for Bush is the question that will be asked many times between now and November, but increasingly the evidence is that the uncommitted, the independents and the disillusioned Democrats will be heading his way. If these votes do indeed lose Gore the election, the next big question will be whether it leads to a larger, more focused movement and whether the Greens are the party best equipped to lead it. </p> <p>Al Gore and George W Bush may bask in the warm glow of their respective conventions, but outside the air-conditioned halls it is clear that the old order is no longer trusted by the very people - the young, the poor, the Latinos, the blacks - they are claiming to want to help. Somehow, it seems unlikely that many hands would be waving from sweatshop windows if either of the two presidential parties had ventured down Broadway in their limos this week. </p> <p> duncan.campbell@theguardian.com</p>",
  "Al Gore offered Americans a continuation of Bill Clinton's centrist policies dressed in more class-conscious language in his acceptance speech to the Democratic convention in Los Angeles, and then set off at once for the battleground states where the US election will be won and lost in November. <p>Mr Gore's speech was universally seen as the most important 51 minutes of his political life, because he had to calm the worries of a party that feared he was a loser and persuade the general public that he has what it takes to set his stamp on the post-Clinton era. </p> <p>Early assessments were that Mr Gore did what he had to do, energising his supporters and reaching out to uncommitted voters in a more conversational style than he has achieved in the past. </p> <p>Thursday's news that a new grand jury had been empanelled in Washington to examine Mr Clinton's conduct in the Monica Lewinsky affair failed to derail either Mr Gore's big moment in Los Angeles or the politically crucial American media coverage of it yesterday. None of the US television networks featured the Clinton story on breakfast time bulletins, while the Los Angeles Times relegated the story to an inside page. </p> <p>The now officially nominated Democratic presidential candidate and his running mate, Joe Lieberman, lost no time in taking their message to middle America. Only hours after wrapping up the conven tion in California, they boarded a river boat in La Crosse, Wisconsin, to begin a campaign trip down the Mississippi under the banner \"Setting Course for America's Future\". </p> <p>In what many see as the crucial line of his speech Mr Gore told the 4,000 delegates: \"I stand here tonight as my own man, and I want you to know me for who I truly am.\" Those words marked a climactic moment in the vice-president's long and sometimes laboured struggle to define his political personality in terms with which both he and the voters can be at ease. </p> <p>Mr Gore's speech reflected what may be an irreconcilable problem facing not just the Democrats but all third way political strategies. Mr Gore needs to stop the centrist voters, whom Bill Clinton successfully courted, from reverting to Mr Bush, but at the same time he needs to mobilise his own core support to turn out on November 7 and to prevent the left from defecting to the Green candidate, Ralph Nader. </p> <p>Mr Gore's policy prescriptions were generally Clintonite: fiscal discipline (he promised to balance the budget every year he is in office), guaranteed health care for children, prescription drug benefits for the elderly, universal pre-school education, and a continued expansion of community policing (Mr Gore also promised to bring the crime figures down each year). </p> <p>As in Mr Bush's speech to the Republican convention two weeks earlier, there was only a brief discussion of American foreign policy. Mr Gore said nothing about national missile defence. </p> <p>Throughout his speech Mr Gore used a language which Mr Clinton generally avoids. He presented himself as a \"fighter\" - the term was used repeatedly both by and about Mr Gore all week. \"I've taken on the powerful forces. And as president I'll stand up to them and I'll stand up for you,\" he said. </p> <p>He also appeared to go some way towards tightening the US stance on global free trade policy, pledging standards on child labour, workers' rights and the environment. Free trade must \"lift everyone up, not bring anyone down\", Mr Gore said. </p> <p>Early in his remarks, he paid tribute to Mr Clinton. \"Millions of Americans will live better lives for a long time to come because of the job that's been done by President Bill Clinton,\" he said. But that was the one and only mention of the leader whom Mr Gore has served with for eight years. \"This election is not an award for past performance,\" Mr Gore said. </p> <p>Towards the end of his speech Mr Gore addressed some of his perceived failings head-on. \"I know my imperfections. I know that sometimes people say I'm too serious, that I talk too much substance and policy. Maybe I've done that tonight.\" </p> <p>The crowd roared back that he had done no such thing, even though Mr Gore's address was full of detailed pledges on domestic issues with middle American voters in mind - \"working families\" as Mr Gore repeatedly calls them. </p> <p>Mr Gore went on: \"If you entrust me with the presidency, I know I won't always be the most exciting politician. But I pledge to you tonight: I will work for you every day and I will never let you down.\" </p> <p><b>The final reckoning</b></p> <p><b> Gone but not forgotten</b> </p> <p>The 21 plane trees removed from the area before the convention because police believed they could be used as weapons by protesters. They are now due to be replaced. </p> <p><b> Al Gore</b> \"If you entrust me with the presidency, I know I won't always be the most exciting politician but I pledge to you tonight: I will work for you every day and I will never let you down\" </p> <p><b> Slogan on T-shirt for sale near the convention</b> </p> <p>Let's lick Bush and Dick </p> <p><b> Back to reality</b> The convention stages were kept intact for an extra day so that they could be used for the filming of The West Wing, a series about the White House </p> <p><b> Award for dance</b> Tipper Gore for an impromptu boogie on stage before her husband was introduced </p> <p><b> Number of times Gore mentioned the word \"fight\" in his speech</b> 20 </p> <p><b> One of the biggest cheers of the night</b> Gore's stated support for a woman's right to choose </p> <p><b> Money raised for the Gore campaign at a party hosted by Barbra Streisand</b> $5.2m</p>"

  "Mexico's beleaguered Institutional Revolutionary party has lost the election for governor in the southern state of Chiapas, six weeks after defeat in the presidential election signalled the end of its seven-decade monopoly of national government. <p>The defeat in Sunday's election came at the hands of Pablo Salazar, a charismatic maverick who trounced the PRI candidate, Sami David, to romp to victory at the head of the eight-party Alliance for Chiapas. With 71% of the votes counted yesterday, Mr Salazar had 54% and Mr David 45%. </p> <p>\"This day will be inscribed in our memory as the day the people of Chiapas decided to change our personal and collective destiny,\" Mr Salazar said in a victory speech that underlined his commitment to find a peaceful solution to the six-year Zapatista conflict over indigenous rights. </p> <p>\"Go on and cry, go on and cry,\" his supporters chanted as they flooded into the streets of the state capital, Tuxtla Gutierrez, to revel in the failure of the PRI's legendary party machine to deliver in its first major test since Vicente Fox of the National Action party (PAN) won the presidency on July 2. </p> <p>Chiapas was one of the minority of states where the PRI came out on top in the presidential poll, and the party was desperate to hold onto the governorship to show it could keep total collapse at bay. </p> <p>As a result, there had been fears of violence from PRI-linked paramilitary groups which emerged after the Zapatista uprising in 1994. </p> <p>There were also predictions of widespread dirty tricks. A 4,000-strong army of observers spread out across the mainly rural state on polling day, but there were few major incidents. A low turnout was blamed on intimidation. </p> <p>Acknowledging defeat, the incumbent PRI governor, Roberto Albores, said: \"I plead with all the Chiapanecos who did not vote for the winner to accept the decision of the majority. It is an order that we must follow for the good and the calm of Chiapas and Mexico,\" he said. </p> <p>Chiapas was always considered a PRI stronghold, largely because of local strongmen who kept the rank and file in line. The opposition was divided, and Zapatista communities have tended to view electoral politics as a waste of time. </p> <p>But Mr Salazar's campaign gathered steam in the wake of Mr Fox's victory, and he managed to bring together the right of centre PAN and its long-running leftwing rival, the Democratic Revolution party ( PRD) within his alliance. </p> <p>A political analyst, Alfonso Zarate, said the Chiapas poll was \"the dispute between the new democratic political order that has been strengthened by July 2 elections and the vestiges of the ancien regime seeking to resist the changes\". </p> <p>The poll has been seen as a possible turning point in the Zapatista conflict. Mr Fox has expressed his wish to push for a negotiated solution. \"As president-elect my commitment and my obligation is to work together with Pablo Salazar with the aim of achieving peace,\" he said in a statement in which he promised to dust off a 1996 peace agreement on indigenous rights, known as the San Andres Accords. </p> <p>The accords were shelved by the outgoing administration of President Ernesto Zedillo, prompting the rebels led by the masked sub-comandante Marcos to break off all dialogue and withdraw to jungle hide-outs. </p> <p>Marcos himself has been notably silent about the country's new political situation. But most analysts believe the rebels, whose support has been waned over the years, could not afford to remain aloof from a Fox peace offensive supported by Governor Salazar. </p> <p>But in the highland Zapatista community of Polho, the election was viewed with ambiguity. Sitting in front of a large handpainted sign adorned with pictures of masked fighters and indigenous peasants and announcing \"Welcome to the autonomous municipality of Polho in rebellion,\" Filomeno Hernandez said the new president and governor would have to prove their openness to Zapatista demands before the negotiations could restart. </p> <p>\"We will wait to see what happens. If the army was withdrawn then sure, we would think about negotiating.\"</p>"

  "Russia is set to clash with the US and Britain at the UN security council this week after confirming it is to revive its scheduled flights to Iraq. <p>Britain and the US regard the Russian move as breaching the sanctions regime imposed against the Iraqi president, Saddam Hussein, for trying to take over Kuwait and starting the 1990-91 Gulf war. </p> <p>A Russian spokesman tried a different interpretation yesterday, claiming commercial flights were not covered by UN resolutions against Iraq. </p> <p>Scheduled passenger flights between Moscow and Baghdad would drive a hole through the crumbling sanctions regime and encourage President Saddam to continue to defy the west. </p> <p>There have been individual flights from Russia and France in the last month, but scheduled flights would be a big change. </p> <p>Iraq's minister for transport, Ahmed Murtada Ahmed Khalil, on a visit to Iran yesterday, disclosed that Aeroflot, would be resuming commercial flights in a fortnight. </p> <p>He asked the Iranian government to allow the Russians to use its airspace, according to the Iranian news agency, Irna. </p> <p>An Aeroflot spokeswoman had said in Moscow earlier in the day that the 51% state-owned carrier intended to resume flights to Iraq. It had signed a memorandum of understanding with Iraqi Airways, she said, but gave no indication at that point of when the service would start. </p> <p>In London, a Foreign Office source said last night: \"The resumption of scheduled flights amounts to a resumption of trading relations, and that would be a breach of sanctions.\" </p> <p>As well as trying to shore up the sanctions regime, the US and Britain also send their warplanes over northern and southern Iraq, denying air space to Iraqi fighters. </p> <p>The resumption of Russian commercial flights would complicate an already tense and dangerous situation. </p> <p>Both Russia and France - eager to do business with Iraq - have tried at the UN to persuade the US and Britain to end the no-fly zones, set up after Baghdad cracked down on northern Iraq's Kurds and southern Iraq's Shi'ites following the Gulf war. </p> <p>A Russian spokesman in London defended the decision to resume flights: \"According to our point of view, nothing in the resolution of the security council forbids it.\" </p> <p>A British-inspired resolution was passed at the UN security council last December holding out the possibility of a compromise over sanctions but Baghdad has rejected it. The new move by Russia, the country's London spokesman said, should be taken as a signal that the world community must act to overcome this impasse: \"We have to do something.\" </p> <p>The US and Britain have become increasingly isolated this year. While the international community feels repugnance towards President Saddam, there is also a growing sense that sanctions and the no-fly zone are hurting civilians rather than the regime. </p> <p>Britain has shown signs of wilting but the US, especially in a presidential election year, has remained resolute. </p> <p>Opponents of sanctions claimed that the US secretary of state, Madeleine Albright, who was in Paris yesterday, threatened France that any country flying to Iraq would be denied the right to fly to the US. A Russian source said he had heard of such a threat but dismissed it as \"rhetoric\". </p> <p>In Cairo, the Syrian president, Bashar Assad, and the Egyptian president, Hosni Mubarak, were asked whether they were considering resuming flights to Iraq, following the lead of France, Russia, Yemen and Jordan in challenging the UN sanctions by sending individual flights styled as humanitarian. Mr Mubarak said that if there was private sector interest, his government would not object.</p>",
  "President Slobodan Milosevic issued a defiant challenge to his political enemies yesterday, dubbing the Serb opposition attempting to topple him from power as western lackeys who would lead the country into war and poverty. <p>In his first televised address to the nation since the disputed presidential election on September 24, Mr Milosevic insisted that he had no intention of admitting defeat. Yugoslav officials have called a run-off vote for Sunday, which the opposition says it will boycott because his challenger Vojislav Kostunica won outright in the first round. </p> <p>In his 15-minute address, Mr Milosevic warned that if the opposition took office Yugoslavia \"would inevitably break up\". All opposition plans, he declared, were initiated by Nato and western countries. </p> <p>\"Our policy guarantees peace,\" he said, while the opposition promoted \"clashes and hostility\". Without him Yugoslavia would be \"occupied by foreign forces\". </p> <p>The robust statement came on the day the opposition tried to bring the country to a halt by launching a general strike designed to force him from office. Mr Milosevic will have gained renewed confidence by the fact that the strike failed to take hold, with opposition leaders conceding that the turnout was disappointing. </p> <p>The Yugoslav president accused his opponents of resorting to \"bribing, blackmailing with money from the west\" to bring the country to a standstill. But he said that Yugoslavia's laws would be applied to prevent a \"western invasion\". </p> <p>The defiance from Belgrade ran counter to attempts by the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, to solve the crisis by calling on Mr Milosevic and Vojislav Kostunica, his main rival, to travel to Moscow this week for talks. </p> <p>Mr Putin's attempt at a negotiated settlement followed a meeting of key Kremlin officials on Yugoslavia yesterday after which the Russian president said the mounting tension in Serbia was turning into a threat to European stability. </p> <p>It was not clear whether Mr Milosevic, in particular, would agree to the Russian offer of mediation. His brother Borislav, the Yugoslav ambassador in Moscow, dismissed all talk of mediation in Belgrade which also reacted negatively at the weekend to a Kremlin offer to send the Russian foreign minister, Igor Ivanov, to Yugoslavia. </p> <p>But with Moscow shifting from being Mr Milosevic's traditional backer to a more even-handed role in the current stand-off while seeking to be the peace broker, Mr Putin is gambling that he can mediate a peaceful handover of power in Belgrade in what would be a triumphant first big foray into international diplomacy and crisis management. </p> <p>While Mr Putin has recognised that Mr Kostunica won last week's election, according to the German government following a telephone conversation between Mr Putin and Gerhard Schr\u00f6der, yesterday's Putin statement, issued while he was en route to India for a four-day visit, also made a nod to the Milosevic camp by talking of a second round. </p> <p>But in the latest of several signals that the Kremlin is distancing itself from Milosevic and discreetly backing Mr Kostunica, one of Mr Putin's closest aides, Sergei Ivanov, the head of the Kremlin's security council, said Yugoslavia needed a legitimate president recognised by \"the world community\". </p> <p>Greece, an Orthodox country like Russia and Serbia, said it was discussing the possibility of helping to organise a recount of the first-round vote with Russia and France, currently in the European Union chair. The renewed Balkan crisis also featured at talks in Paris yesterday between the French government, Madeleine Albright, the US secretary of state, and top EU foreign policy officials.</p>",
  "As the US presidential election enters its final five weeks, the race is again proving that the winner will not necessarily be the man who gives the people what they want. <p>The candidate who is drawing the largest and most enthusiastic crowds is lagging far behind in the polls; the only man with a black running mate is the least popular with black voters; and the one promising what most Americans want is barely registering. All are third-party candidates. </p> <p>Ralph Nader, the Green party contender and veteran consumer-rights campaigner, drew a crowd of 10,000 on Sunday to hear him speak in Boston, following hard on the heels of gatherings of 10,000 in Seattle, 12,000 in Minnesota and 10,500 in Portland, Oregon. </p> <p>Not only are these higher figures mustered by either Al Gore of the Democrats or George W Bush of the Republicans, but they are paying customers, shelling out up to $10 (\u00a36.75) a time to hear the Nader message. </p> <p>Despite the enthusiasm with which he is greeted, despite high-profile support from actors Paul Newman and Susan Sarandon, filmmaker Michael Moore, chatshow host Phil Donahue and some union leaders, Mr Nader is still stalled at around 5% in surveys of public opinion. </p> <p>The Gore team's efforts to persuade liberal America that \"a vote for Nader is a vote for Bush\", the decision by groups such as Friends of the Earth to back Mr Gore for the same reasons, and the lack of a chance to debate with the two main candidates on television are seen as some of the reasons for Mr Nader's low profile. </p> <p>But his team says that the big rallies are bringing in thousands of extra activists, most of them from the 51% of the electorate who usually do not vote. </p> <p>Their fund-raising efforts, often through house parties, have yielded $4m (\u00a32.7m), just enough to run some provocative commercials, but a fraction of what the Gore and Bush camps are spending. </p> <p>\"We get lots of people who say, 'thank God Ralph's running',\" said Peter Stair of Nader 2000. \"You could say that to get 5% of the vote would be one of our benchmarks, but this is part of a continuing movement which will go on far beyond the election.\" </p> <p>Paradoxically, the better Mr Gore does, the bigger chance Mr Nader has of winning votes: if the race between the frontrunners is not seen as not close, Mr Nader's natural supporters may feel more free to back him. </p> <p>Explaining why there were no jokes about Mr Nader, the chatshow host and comedian Jay Leno said: \"Here's a guy, he comes out and tells it like it is. My job's over!\" </p> <p>Mr Nader has reacted to criticism of his lack of past involvement in equality issues by delivering speeches that refer to \"slavery and the genocide of the Native Americans ... the two worst crimes committed in North America\". His running mate, Winona LaDuke, is a Native American academic. </p> <p>His relatively strong standing in key marginal states such as Oregon, Washington and New Mexico have kept him firmly in the Gore camp's sights. </p> <p>The president of Friends of the Earth, Brent Blackwelder, is touring these states on the Democrats' behalf to persuade environmentalists to back Mr Gore, something that has pained the Nader camp deeply. Mr Blackwelder has justified the move by saying: \"We're looking at the reality here. Third-party candidates do not get elected to the presidency.\" </p> <p>Michael Moore, the maverick documentary filmmaker who has been a chief Nader cheerleader, rebutted this argument at the Minnesota rally by asking what would have happened if Martin Luther King and Rosa Parks had also decided to accept the status quo in case things got worse. </p> <p>\"A vote for Nader is a political Molotov - throw it into the voting booth,\" said Moore. </p> <p>But if Mr Nader is having problems capturing the magical double-digit support level, his nearest third-party rivals are floundering in his wake. </p> <p>Pat Buchanan, the renegade rightwing Republican who won the Reform party nomination in a messy battle at its Long Beach convention in August, is barely registering 1% in the polls. </p> <p>The adoption of a black vice-presidential running-mate, Ezola Foster - a supporter, bizarrely, of the far-right John Birch Society, has done little to win Mr Buchanan credibility. His platform is essentially anti-UN, anti-immigration, anti-world trade, anti-abortion and anti-\"Republicrats\", as he now calls the two main parties. </p> <p>Overtaking Mr Buchanan now in states such as Georgia, Illinois and Colorado, is the Libertarian party's Harry Browne, a 67-year-old Tennessee-based investment analyst who also ran in 1996. His message is straightforward and, superficially, extremely appealing to most voters: no more income tax. </p> <p>He also reaches other constituencies with a promise of an end to the \"war on drugs\", believing in a person's right to do what they like in their own home. Mr Browne backs the repeal of all gun-control legislation and the removal of all American troops from foreign countries. </p> <p>But, Mr Nader, Mr Buchanan, Mr Browne and the two other better-known alternative candidates - John Hagelin of the Natural Law party - and Howard Phillips of the Constitutional party - all know their chances of having their voices heard above the sound of the multi-million dollar Gore-Bush battle are slim.</p>",
  "Further claims of illegal practices in Yugoslavia's elections emerged yesterday after a lorry driver alleged that he found ballots for opposition politicians among a load of paper he was transporting for recycling. <p>The driver, who asked not to be named, took a sample of the voting papers to Velimir Ilic, the mayor of Cacak - the town where the pulping factory is based. Last night several of those completed polling slips were shown to the Guardian. They were all genuine. </p> <p>The papers included a white presidential ballot with a vote marked for Vojislav Kostunica, the opposition challenger for the presidency which Slobodan Milosevic is clinging to, despite faring badly in last week's vote. </p> <p>There were also two ballot papers, blue for the House of Citizens and yellow for the House of Republics in the federal parliament; both of these were marked for Mr Kostunica's coalition, the Democratic Opposition of Serbia. </p> <p>The batch included several local election ballot slips, too. One of these contained a vote for the rightwing Radical party. None of the ballots was marked with a vote for Mr Milosevic or his federal coalition. </p> <p>There was also a formal document authorising the bearer to carry ballot papers from a prison to the president of the election committee. This bore two blue original stamps. </p> <p>The material for destruction contained several empty envelopes that would have contained votes from the Yugoslav army. There were large pink envelopes and smaller blue ones. The pink bore the address of the federal or local election committee, depending on what kind of vote was inside. The blue one had three stamps on the back to prove that the envelope had been sealed securely. </p> <p>The date on one envelope was September 23; members of the military often vote before polling day, as the ballots go to the constituencies where the soldier's family is based. </p> <p>For this material to be in the public domain at all at this stage in the election process is illegal: it should still be under lock and key and transported only under escort. Even the used envelopes should be kept and when disposed of later, should be destroyed according to strict rules and procedures. </p> <p>Mr Ilic handed the ballot papers to the television station in Cacak. Its editor-in-chief, Svetlana Kojanovic, then contacted the managers at the Diva recycling plant. </p> <p>\"I spoke to the general manager, Milovan Jovanovic, and two workers and one other manager,\" Ms Kojanovic said. \"The lorry involved was a big truck and they destroyed the contents. But all of them admitted that they had seen ballot papers.\" </p> <p>Mr Ilic, who received the ballot papers from the haulier said yesterday: \"It's stealing votes. It is proven that there has been a lot of stealing.\" </p> <p>Cacak has a reputation as a strongly anti-Milosevic town. The discovery of ballots supporting opposition candidates on their way for recycling quickly added fuel to the anger of people there. Many took to the streets yesterday. </p> <p>\"People do not want to accept cheating and deceit. We have chaos here. We have 30,000 to 40,000 people on the street and an emotional revolt because of the stealing,\" Mr Ilic said. </p> <p>He said some people had gathered outside the tax office and were threatening to destroy it.</p>",
  "A general strike to force Yugoslavia's president, Slododan Milosevic, to concede electoral defeat failed to bring the Serbian republic to a complete standstill yesterday. <p>Opposition strongholds in the provinces lived up to their record of radicalism, but in Belgrade and other major cities workers failed to heed opposition pleas for a boycott. </p> <p>The opposition had urged a countrywide general strike to force Mr Milosevic to concede that his challenger, Vojislav Kostunica, had won an outright victory in the first round of the presidential election on September 24. </p> <p>The state electoral committee ruled last week that Mr Kostunica's share of the vote fell just short of 50% and ordered a runoff next Sunday. </p> <p>In activist towns such as Cacak, Kraljevo, and Kragujevac, roads were blocked, shops shut and businesses closed. But an opposition spokesman conceded that the day's showing was a disappointment. </p> <p>\"Today we particularly failed with this general strike...People in Serbia are not ready yet to boycott everything,\" the spokesman said. </p> <p>Major roads leading to the centre of the capital were blocked during the first few hours after the strike's 5am start. But later they grew busy with buses and trams taking workers to offices and businesses. Staff arrived late, but many went to work. </p> <p>In the afternoon, students disrupted major streets in the heart of the capital. Tens of thousands rallied outside the federal parliament. A crucial intersection was blocked at various times by the students, who blew whistles and horns and waved flags. One group handed in a letter at the army general staff building, calling on the army to stay neutral. </p> <p>Olivera Obradovic, 23, said that she and her fellow students planned to occupy a university building overnight.\"We are trying to inject some enthusiasm and to encourage people to hold on and get this finished - to end this destruction of the country,\" she said. </p> <p>The patchy support in Belgrade was in contrast to the commitment shown by several towns in Serbia's hinterland. The strikers at the Kolubera coal mine complex said they were under enormous pressure, but that they had rebuffed police on Sunday night. </p> <p>\"Everyone is 100% ready to continue the strike,\" a union member, Milovan Jankovic, said. </p> <p>Around 4,500 miners also downed tools at the Kostolac mine in eastern Serbia. They blocked off the mine and power plant but agreed to maintain minimum output. </p> <p>In the opposition-held town of Kraljevo, a journalist, Ljudmila Svetkovic, said that key roads were blocked. Restaurants, shops, buses, state companies - even the local Socialist party television station - were on strike, she said. </p> <p>In nearby Kragulevac, more than 30,000 people took to the streets, including car workers and labourers from the armaments factory. And in Cacak an angry crowd threatened to demolish the tax office. </p> <p>In Mr Milosevic's hometown of Pozarevac, until recently firmly controlled by his allies, farmers blocked roads and the schools were closed.</p>"

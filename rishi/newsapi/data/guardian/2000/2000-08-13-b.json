  "The consensus among political junkies and talking heads on this side of the Atlantic is that Al Gore's pick of Joe Lieberman as his running mate saved Gore's tush. But the new Gore-Lieberman brand has yet to be tested. And the first big test is whether it will fall into the trap the Republicans have set for it this week in Los Angeles. <p>Gore's choice of Lieberman was smart on three grounds. First, the chutzpah of picking an orthodox Jew grabbed the political momentum away from George W. Bush right after Bush's perfectly-scripted Republican convention, thereby checking Bush's convention 'bounce' in the polls. Second, given Lieberman's concern about moral values in America and his outspoken criticism of President Clinton's liaison with Monica Lewinsky, the pick gives Gore some protection against Republican attempts to tar him with Clinton's turpitude. Finally, Lieberman is a conservative Democrat, which helps Gore with the same moderate swing-voters Bush is trying to court. </p> <p>But these advantages won't carry Gore far. Lieberman may be 'the conscience of the Senate', as one enthusiastic Democrat put it, but until last week most Americans had never heard of him. Senators are little known outside the states they represent and Lieberman is no exception. </p> <p>There's also the question of latent anti-Semitism in America. Quite simply, no one knows how extensive it may be. People rarely tell pollsters they're bigots. The proof will come on election day in the privacy of voting booths. And Lieberman's conservatism is a mixed blessing. It may rankle liberal Democrats who comprise the core of the party, many of whom weren't wild about Gore to begin with. A small number will shift their allegiance to Ralph Nader. Others may not vote. </p> <p>Democrats are holding their breath. They hope their convention in Los Angeles this week will be at least as successful a stage show for introducing the new Gore-Lieberman brand as was the Republican convention for introducing Bush-Cheney. But many things could go wrong in LA. </p> <p>Democrats have never had a reputation for being particularly disciplined. The Democratic party is a larger tent than the Republican one - including labour unions, environmentalists, libertarians, African-Americans, Jews, old lefties, so-called New Democrats, trial lawyers, and civil servants - and not all these groups get on with the others. After eight years of the Clinton administration, moreover, some of them are outright disappointed. Rank-and-file union members are upset with Gore on his pro-trade stance, for example, and some of them will be on the convention floor talking to reporters. </p> <p>Plus, there's the complication of two other national Democratic campaigns competing with Gore's - Hillary Clinton's, for the US Senate from New York, which is drawing off donations and media attention; and Bill Clinton's for his place in history, which also needs money (for a presidential library and related accoutrements) and attention (to what he has accomplished in office). Also, count on bigger and more disruptive demonstrations outside the convention hall than occurred in Philadelphia. Los Angeles is easier to get to than Philadelphia, California is flakier than Pennsylvania and Democrats always attract more demonstrators. </p> <p>But the biggest trap has been laid by the Republicans, whose own convention embodied all the traditional images of a Democratic one - a kaleidoscope of ethnic groups; an address by the sole avowedly gay Republican member of Congress; the gentle rhetoric of tolerance and inclusion; the suggestion of policies that will help children become better educated, help working families afford health insurance and ensure that social security will be saved. </p> <p>Democrats are eager to reveal the hypocrisy at the heart of the Republican strategy. Who are these Republicans to adopt Democratic images and themes when for the last eight years the Republicans have gone out of their way to thwart Democratic goals? How dare they speak as if they're responsible for the good times when the Clinton-Gore administration inherited a $300 billion deficit? How can they talk inclusion when they remain the exclusive province of relatively wealthy whites, and when the policies they are advocating even today in Congress - policies that their vice-presidential nominee, Dick Cheney, advocated when he was a member - consistently help the rich and powerful, while burdening the poor and powerless? </p> <p>Hence the trap. Republicans would like nothing better than for Al Gore and Joe Lieberman to become attack dogs this coming week, and for the Democratic convention to wallow in harsh partisanship. </p> <p>Republicans know that Americans have come to hate partisan bickering. After witnessing eight long years of bitter wrangling in Washington, including Newt Gingrich's shock troops, a government shut-down, independent counsel Ken Starr's witch hunt, Bill Clinton's recklessness, the character assassinations and press leaks, and a truly bizarre impeachment, they're fed up with politics. They're also bored to tears with it. Thanks to the new system of early, front-loaded primaries, they've known for five months who the two major candidates will be, and there are three long months to go, including a baseball World Series, the Olympics and the TV networks' autumn premieres. </p> <p>Americans don't even want to think about politics. It's a time of peace and relative prosperity in America, the summer of our content, in an era of great social rest. Smugness has settled over the land like thick yellow smog. The nation is enjoying the longest economic expansion on record, so long, in fact, that most people don't quite remember exactly when the economy was bad, or who was in charge then, and who should get credit for the good times. And, frankly, they don't much care. </p> <p>Not all Americans are sharing in the prosperous times, of course, and not everywhere in the world is peaceful. But Americans feel no common peril, no sense that the nation faces a crucial choice about anything. </p> <p>Aware of all this, the Republicans who gathered in Philadelphia gave America exactly what it wanted - the least political convention in American history, filled with cotton-candy images of tolerance and prosperity, patriotic drivel and sentimental fluff. Even the Republicans' attacks on Gore and the Democrats were done with a light touch. Dick Cheney looked like a gentle grandfather. George W.'s zingers were packaged in some humorous lines and vacuous homilies about restoring dignity to the White House. </p> <p>If, this week, Gore and Lieberman hurl accusations of hypocrisy at the Republicans, as they will want to do, America will hear only strident voices. If they are indignant and self-righteous, as they have every reason to be, America will hear only sanctimony. If they try to take credit for the economy and blame the Republicans for blocking progress on social security, good schools and the rest, as is perfectly fair, America will hear only partisan posturing. </p> <p>That's exactly what the Republicans want. They've adopted Democratic imagery in order to make the Republican ticket seem far less frightening than it would if the right-wing social conservatives were let loose. And they want to lure the Democrats into attacking them for doing so, which makes the Democrats sound shrill and partisan while the Republicans stay above the fray. Their goal is to keep this up until October, when Americans finally begin to focus on the election. By then, if the Republican plan works, the new Gore-Lieberman brand will seem like the old brand of American politics, while Bush-Cheney will seem brand new. </p> <p>\u0095 Robert B.

  "The appliers of political science had no doubt about it. At universities across America, they fed all the relevant data about the economy, wealth, jobs and crime into their computers - and produced an overwhelming verdict. Hail President Gore! An open-and-shut case. But now the computers themselves are shutting down. <p>The presidential race rates as high summer horror. The nation is on heatwave holiday, drifting between barbecue and beach, manifestly uninterested in politics. TV viewing figures for the Republicans in Philadelphia were sharply down on 1996: the big turn-off proceeds exponentially over decades. </p> <p>Yet modern history also says that the candidate who leads the polls on Labour Day weekend at the start of September is the candidate who wins in November. Only Ronald Reagan, 20 years ago, bucked that law - and whatever else Al Gore is, he ain't no Ronald Reagan. </p> <p>The Vice-President comes to Los Angeles this week trailing a cautiously triumphant George W. Bush on every one of those polls, usually by more than 10 points. The convention is his only realistic chance of getting back into contention. Either he begins to transform the way America sees him - warm, not chilly; interesting, not boring; human, not policy wonkish; Al, not Bill - or he will be the pre-ordained loser. </p> <p>No easy brief. I have, as it happens, met Gore twice. One time (an interview) he couldn't have been more superciliously brusque. Southern charm? Forget it. He could hardly bother to move his lips. And the other time (in Boston this spring) he kept an international conference waiting for half an hour while he slotted in unscheduled TV appearances in the back lobby. His record for failing to win friends is richly deserved. </p> <p>Is Clinton-Gore the problem, as the Republicans would have us believe? Are 'dignity' and 'honour' the buzz words for success? The funniest thing of all in the polls is the way that the supposedly reviled Clinton, now peddling New Penitence like a stomach powder, still coasts along with 60 per cent approval ratings, while the man who didn't touch Monica Lewinsky - or fib about it - is 20 or so points behind that. Gore has an effusively loving wife, an adoring family, and Southern morality to spare: but, for the moment, he is also the issue. His policy platform isn't popular: but he is less popular still. </p> <p>So to the Los Angeles personality transplant ward. Al has been taking the pre-med tablets already, voyaging relentlessly to hometown meetings in Carthage, Tennessee, with his new friend Joe Lieberman and three dozen camera crews to meet grey-haired women who remember him as a lovable guy. His collar is ritually unbuttoned these days, jacket cast aside. He's regular and relaxed and (not for the first time) re-made. </p> <p>How will it play in LA? The selection of Senator Lieberman as his running mate may not be enthusing the big donors of Hollywood, but otherwise it went down well. Lieberman arrives on the main screen as a 'moderate' beloved on both sides of the Senate (a word reserved for Mr Conservative in-betweens). Most of the attention may have concentrated on his Orthodox Jewry - and the blonde second wife whose parents escaped a Nazi concentration camp - but he has one attribute beyond mere history. He's a politician who answers the question: a pearl beyond media price. </p> <p>Ask Senator Joey (as his wife calls him, to winces off) why he doesn't follow the Gore line on education vouchers - or, more difficult - whether he intends to run for the Senate as well as the vice-presidency, and he'll give you a straightforward, thoughtfully clear response. The human being bit comes naturally. </p> <p>This is not altogether good news for Gore. Lieberman is on the ticket because his was the first sombre voice to speak out against sex in the Oval Office. He's a formal break with the sleaze of the past. But he also possesses the vital attribute his master lacks. He couldn't be wooden if he tried. </p> <p>It is one of the great curiosities of this election that both main candidates now have putative Vice-Presidents who, on any normal count, are better - more knowledgeable, more sentient, less mechanical - than they are themselves. The Veeps look better than the Prezzas. And neither of them, disasters aside, has any real chance of being President themselves. Time and age are against them. </p> <p>Gore is the Democratic contender now because he wasn't as good as Bill Clinton then. He inherited rather than won the nomination. He has, thus far, lacked any clear strategy - trapped between attacking the Republicans and defending a dying administration. </p> <p>Now he has to stand in his own right. He has to deliver the assets the computers have stored. Now he has to win a few hearts - or, at the least, show that he has one.</p>",
  "<p>Expect to be deafened tomorrow by the sound of champagne corks popping when WPP, the world's biggest advertising group after its acquisition of US agency Young &amp; Rubicam, posts its first-half results. </p> <p>These are heady days for our dear, creative friends in adland. Against a backdrop of a sustained economic boom, dotcom businesses with more money than sense are filling the agencies' coffers.

  "<p>Although he presents himself as an environmentalist guru, Al Gore has always been enthusiastic about genetically modified 'Frankenfoods' - and for many good reasons. One might be that he himself is a GM product. No man in the history of American politics can have been so carefully and deliberately groomed, moulded, deconstructed and reconstructed for the Presidential race for which Al 'GM' Gore presents himself at the Democrat convention, opening in Los Angeles tomorrow. </p> <p>When Gore arrived for his first day as a journalist on the Nashville Tennessean newspaper in the autumn of 1971, most staff knew he was no regular cub reporter. Gore was being packaged to them as the young man who had just returned from his stint in Vietnam - wearing his country's uniform although he bitterly criticised its war - now making his way in the world free from the overbearing family tradition of politics. In contrast to the cynical realpolitik practiced by his father, Senator Albert Gore I, Al Gore II had studied esoteric spiritualism. He was a decent enough reporter too - he pursued a local corruption case all the way to a court hearing (although the target was acquitted). </p> <p>But the package was a deceptive one. Had he really wanted to go into journalism, the Harvard-educated Gore could have walked into other, more prestigious newsrooms than that which happened to have been in his father's political back-pocket in Nashville. The editor of the Nashville Tennessean was John Siegenthaler, who employed celebrity interns who would enhance his own contacts in Washington. </p> <p>In Vietnam, Gore's father had been able to pull a few strings (although without such sordid efficiency as George Bush's) and secured Gore a job as an army reporter. Accordingly, he had been mollycoddled around, a safe distance from the action which he reported in vivid detail from second-hand accounts. 'Gore was not the journalist type,' recalls his former colleague on the desk, Phil Sullivan. 'It didn't seem like that was what he was setting out to do. Siegenthaler saw him as someone who was going into politics.' </p> <p>But although his colleagues knew exactly what he was up to, Gore himself could have had no idea that the more relaxed and apparently self-confident summer intern sitting at the next desk would, in two decades time, be the man to whom he would turn for yet another in the long series of makeovers that would define his career: Carter Eskew, 'message guru' of the current campaign, laboratory technician of the present-day GM Gore and Svengali of the LA convention. </p> <p>It is hard to know which aspects of Al Gore's life are fact and which are fanciful, or indeed whether there is any difference between the two. Gore himself plays along with the entwinement, turning even the rawest and most intimate moments of his life - such as his own son's scrape with death in a car accident - into theatrics, part of the electoral strategy. </p> <p>The packaging of Al Gore as President of the United States began when he was still in utero. On the day Gore was born, the Nashville Tennessean hailed the birth on page one: 'Well, Mr Gore, Here He Is', with the Knoxville News Sentinel adding only a year or two later: 'There may be another Gore on his way to the political pinnacle.' </p> <p>Gore grew up not in Tennessee but in what is now the Ritz Carlton Hotel on Embassy Row in Washington DC, attending an \u00e9lite prep school and spending summers on the tobacco farm in his father's home state. He played with a toy submarine in the Senate swimming-pool and bounced on President Nixon's lap. Albert Snr was a rags-to-riches, Scots-Irish politician, a New Dealer unafraid of unpopular positing and ultimately defeated after an 18-year career only when Nixon unleashed a slush of illegal finance against him, as revealed by the Watergate papers. Like his son, he enjoyed taking the ethical high ground and like his son he betrayed it. But it was Gore's mother, Pauline, who claimed the initial packaging of her son - 'I trained them both,' she said of Alberts I and II, 'and I did a better job on my son than I did on my husband.' </p> <p>The most striking thing about packaging Al Gore is the regularity with which it happens and the extent of the metamorphoses. The most dramatic was the apparent conversion from new-age eco-catastrophist to Vice-President in 1992 and, more recently, from a woodentop with as much political razzmatazz as a traffic jam to something from Sopranos central casting. </p> <p>The task in 1992 was particularly daunting and almost effective. Gore pre sented a curious figure at the time, as expressed in his book, Earth in the Balance . It was published at a time when politicians were full of foreboding about the various apocalypses of global warming, over-population and ozone-depletion and making routine pilgrimages to the Amazon rainforest. </p> <p>Gore had been understandably affected by his son's narrow scrape with death after a car hit the child as the family was leaving a Baltimore Orioles baseball game. He had immersed himself in alternative psychotherapy, new-age thought and the fad philosophy of Gaia, popular among right-wing eco-catastrophists, suggesting that the human race is merely part of a single, natural organism. </p> <p>'It cannot be accidental,' wrote Gore in one of his more wayward passages, 'that the percentage of salt in our bloodstreams is the same as the percentage in the oceans of the world.' Gore laments mankind's alienation from this natural order, putting the blame squarely on Ren\u00e9 Descartes. Quite apart from its intellectual absurdity, Gore's position had two curiosities: the fact that it did not put off the embryonic Clinton administration and its brazen disingenuousness. </p> <p>On his 1998 tax return, Al Gore lists a $20,000 royalty payment from the Union Zinc Company for the right to mine zinc on his farm in Tennessee. The income, which has netted Gore $450,000 over the years, is the legacy of Gore Snr's lucrative relationship and joint ventures with fraudulent tycoon and Soviet agent, Armand Hammer, also chief executive of the environmentally controversial Occidental Petroleum Company. Among other ironies, Hammer was caught making illegal contributions to Nixon, used to topple Gore Snr. Hammer and Gore Snr enjoyed a two-way deal: Hammer boasted that he had Gore in his 'back-pocket'; he found protection from anti-communist investigations and open doors in Washington; Gore Snr secured campaign funds, a six-figure directorship upon retirement and donations for his son's Congressional campaigns. </p> <p>After hosting Gore and Tipper at innumerable parties, and being Al's guest at Ronald Reagan's inauguration in 1987, Hammer died in 1990. But the $20,000 a year was a handsome supplement to what Gore complained were 'slave wages' on the Tennessean , and still listed in 1992 as his most important source of income after his salary, now eclipsed by the $1.1 million in royalties from Earth in the Balance . </p> <p>The relationship between Gore and Occidental has remained a mutually advantageous one. Occidental loaned $100,000 to the Clinton-Gore inaugural committee in 1992, and has donated some $500,000 in 'soft money' to the Democratic Party since Gore made it on to the ticket. </p> <p>This was the administration-in-waiting that decided it needed Al Gore on the ticket. When he took the initial call from scout Warren Christopher, Gore was attending the Rio Earth Summit in 1991, waving his copy of Earth in the Balance . Baby-boomer Clinton liked the generational chemistry with Gore, and the Vietnam 'record' which, on paper, contrasted with his own. Gore appealed to the 'new Democrat' right wing for a number of reasons. He had been recruited by the party as an attack dog to see off Jesse Jackson's candidacy in 1988 and had done a good enough job. Even then, Clinton also needed someone with a stable marriage to offset his embarrassment over Gennifer Flowers. </p> <p>Gore was duly put through the mill, drilled into shape even by people who disliked him at the political core of Clinton's campaign: Hillary, James Carville and George Stephanopoulos. He was worked over by speech coaches and a ballet choreographer, who counselled him on his awkward movements. The wrathful impatience with conventional politics sketched in Earth in the Balance was silenced as the book became the first ever bestseller that a publisher refrained from pushing. Clinton liked the volume, but Carville, Harold Ickes and the realists on the party's Left, trying to win an election, found it insane at best, scary at worst. Gore the Rainbow Warrior duly became Gore the Vice-President. </p> <p>But what kind of packaging was it? The nadir of Gore's life-as-theatre came at the party convention in New York that year, Gore's 'coming-out' event. He told the delegates and viewing millions how he had watched Albert Gore III 'fly 30 feet through the air and scrape along the pavement... I ran to his side and held him and called his name... his eyes were open with the nothingness state of death'. Gore was reading every word off the autocue. </p> <p>The history of Vice-Presidents assuming the top office is a patchy one, as Pauline Gore must have realised when she expressed coded disapproval of her son's supporting role to the 'provincial' Bill Clinton. It was a concept in promotion pioneered by the shock of Truman's takeover from Franklin Roosevelt and L.B.J.'s even more dramatic succession of J.F. Kennedy, but these were without preparation. It worked differently in the more ambitious cases of Nixon, first of the 'modern' Vice-Presidents, and George Bush. </p> <p>A year ago, a lifetime of grooming 'Veep' Al Gore for the presidency seemed doomed to failure. A bumper sticker appeared: 'Stuck in Traffic? Blame Al Gore'. Gore had creased the nation's sides by telling CNN's Wolf Blitzer he had 'taken the initiative in creating the internet'. Hillary Clinton's candidacy in New York created a Medusan triangle inside the White House with resentments in all directions. Most importantly, Gore was making instantly and utterly forgettable speeches: 'Gore' was spelled with a 'B'. </p> <p>A Wagnerian family psychodrama was playing out between Clinton and Gore - 'father' and 'son' - which was, with hindsight, crucial to Gore's selection of running mate last week. Throughout the Lewinsky scandal, Gore had walked a high wire between loyalty and disgust. Apart from Hillary, he was the most senior victim of the President's deceit but also had the highest honour under Clinton's patronage to betray if he abandoned him. </p> <p>Gore's political father (Clinton) finally blessed Gore's ambition to become President in 1998, the year that his actual father died, thereby turning Clinton's political paternity into something more complex. Gore always knew that his success lay in the passing of power by both to him, as George Bush Snr has done to his son. But there was a problem - the motives of both Gore's father figures were entirely narcissistic. One wanted a President Gore who would bear the family name in the White House, the other a President Gore to rescue his legacy from the stains on Monica's dress. </p> <p>In his hour of need, Gore was shunned by the surrogate father in a way he never was by Albert Snr. Out of the blue, Clinton made an unsolicited call to the New York Times, making clear his displeasure at the way Gore was conducting his campaign. On the morning his remarks were published, the atmosphere in Gore's White House office was one of 'stunned disbelief'. Meanwhile, down the corridor, Gore had been shut out of the huddle that gathered around the President to discuss the advisability and fallout of the Times interview. Gore's retort came sharp enough. He told Diane Sawyer he thought Clinton's behaviour during the Lewinsky scandal had been 'inexcusable... especially as a father'. </p> <p>Gore assembled a team with specific instructions - to repackage him again, almost from scratch. One source told The Observer that Gore himself even admitted privately that 'I would not vote for the Al Gore I read about'. A war council was convened by the new campaign director, Tony Coelho, a former Congressman dogged by allegations of embezzlement and scandal, to do just that. With Coelho was Bob Shrum, former wordsmith for Teddy Kennedy who will have written Gore's sink-or-swim Los Angeles speech; Gore's daughter, Karenna Gore Schriff, and wife, Tipper; Eskew and stringent political director Donna Brazile, who acted as pastor and conscience to the otherwise devious bunch. </p> <p>According to one present at the meeting, the message was to 'free Gore from his office and from the White House' - to declare UDI from Bill and Hillary. Gore moved his campaign headquarters from Washington to his supposed 'roots' in Tennessee. The move was also a good way to cull a troubled, squabbling staff, to sort out the wheat prepared to sacrifice everything to follow him from the chaff who preferred to stay around their DC dinner tables. Brazile added a trial by salary, cutting everybody's by two-thirds. Gore and his senior staff remained in the comfort of Washington. </p> <p>Diane Sawyer conducted the first TV interview in Tennessee with Gore and Tipper on his late father's tobacco farm. Gore wore jeans and cowboy boots. Sawyer threw the first pitch, a fastball. Her grandmother, she said, who was in tobacco farming, wanted to ask: how many strains of tobacco are there in the US? Gore stared back blankly, a look of wounded hatred in his eyes. The second question was about the maintenance of fencing between two properties; Gore was equally clueless. </p> <p>Addressing the crowds at his launch rally in Tennessee, Gore pledged to 'take my own values of faith and family to the Presidency' and promised: 'If you entrust me with the Presidency, I will marshal its authority, its resources and its moral leadership to fight for America's family.' It was a brazen slap in Clinton's face. Gore's campaign hit the road with speeches luxuriating in the strong economy, but barely mentioning Clinton. He needed to share in the President's public successes (and stubborn popularity among Americans) while denouncing his private failings. </p> <p>Winter came, and the packaging team devised a new, folksy Al Gore who stopped talking about 'livability' and held town meetings and his audience to raise their hands until he had identified who had the most grandchildren. As the jester of American politician-watching, Professor Todd Gitlin at New York University, puts it: 'The difference between Bush and Gore now is that Bush is fake trying to be real, while Gore is real trying to be fake.' </p> <p>But even the 'fake' package had trouble selling himself. Gore was tainted by the Russian money-laundering scandal. A photo opportunity in a canoe backfired when it emerged that 170 million gallons of water had been released to stage it, during a drought. Bill Bradley was making headway he simply didn't deserve. Coelho's tyrannical style was driving the team to distraction to no effect; he was hardly the Carville figure the campaign so obviously needed. There was bitter internal strife between one-time partners Eskew and the (now late) Bob Squier, policy adviser. The two men had once run a consultancy together but their combined presence on the Gore campaign was, said old White House hand Dick Morris 'like asking the Albanians and Serbs to work together'. Then came a final split from Bill, a bit of the sex appeal and the final makeover. </p> <p>The Gores had decided that marital bliss was the key to the post-Monica era, but now they added a bit of libido to their version. On stage, Tipper would summon him with a wave of her hand, saying: 'He's so sexy', and he would respond: 'I love it when she beckons me with her finger like that.' The chic feminist Naomi Wolf was recruited to refurbish Gore's wardrobe and promote his sexual chem istry from what she labelled 'Beta to Alpha' grade. </p> <p>It seemed to work. Brazile's puritanism played counterpoint to this flippancy. Gore became almost a control freak over his campaign, designing his own logos and websites. The result appeared on television during the New Hampshire primary opposite Bill Bradley. To the nation's amazement, Gore suddenly looked hunky, like a football quarterback dressed as a small-time Mafiosi. He was confident yet relaxed. </p> <p>Gore has since applied the new style to new crusades, none more virulently than that against America's drugs and medicines industry. Gore lambasts the pharmaceutical companies for 'gouging the consumer unfairly' and claims credit for a recent industry retreat in agreeing to allow South Africa and other countries to manufacture cheaper generic drugs to counter the Aids pandemic. But even this genetic modification is flawed because, as ever with Gore, it is disingenuous. Gore's claim that he pushed for the generic production of Aids medicines in South Africa is especially unconvincing. Last December, The Observer revealed the web of consultancies and lobbying that connected Gore to the major drug producers suing the South African government for trying to produce generics. </p> <p>This campaign is the final act in Gore's lifelong White House drama. The first scene has already been successfully played out: the overdue shedding of Coelho and his replacement by William Daley, a rough-cut professional and one of America's fourth dynasty after the Kennedys, Bushes, Gores, that of the past and present mayors of Chicago, Richard Daley Snr and Jr. If anyone can save Gore, it is Daley, as Gore must have known when he called him shortly after midnight to offer him the job. A groggy Daley said he'd like to think about it over a cup of coffee. 'OK,' replied Gore, 'go get your coffee and I'll hold.' </p> <p>The second scene was concluded last week with Lieberman's appointment. But this only complicates the third scene, which opens in Los Angeles tomorrow - that which is supposed to star President Al Gore, but in which President Bill Clinton will inevitably play centre stage. That was always the problem in packaging Al Gore - fathers. </p> <p>If this was Wagner, the aged, flawed Wotan would be standing at the foot of the mountain, spear in hand. Young Siegfried would slice it in half and Wotan would say: 'Pass on, for I cannot stop you.' But Al Gore Snr never taught his son how to use the sword, and neither did Bill Clinton. In the end, it was they who did the packaging, and neither was prepared, in the final hour, to be outshone by Al Gore.</p>"

  "Escalating Yugoslavia's political crisis, Slobodan Milosevic has defied international calls for him to step down and called a runoff election against the dour law professor who the opposition claims defeated him. <p>The state election commission announced today that opposition presidential candidate Vojislav Kostunica finished first in the weekend presidential elections but without enough votes to avoid a runoff with Milosevic. </p> <p>The commission said Kostunica won 48.22 percent of the vote in Sunday's ballot to 40.23 for Milosevic. </p> <p>\"In short, in the presidential elections there will be a second round,\" TV said. The announcement could escalate the Yugoslav political crisis. The opposition claims Kostunica won outright and has refused to join the runoff, scheduled for 8 October. </p> <p>Yugoslav opposition leaders had given the commission until tomorrow to release the final election results.</p> <p>By midday today, the commission had not reconvened after a brief meeting Sunday night, according to Sinisa Nikolic, a commission member from the ranks of the opposition alliance. </p> <p>But the chairman of the commission, Borivoje Vukicevic, told several dozen foreign observes from \"friendly\" countries - such as Russia, China and some African countries which had monitored the balloting - that the commission was working \"efficiently and in accordance with the law.\" </p> <p>More than 40,000 people turned out for a second night yesterday in Belgrade to celebrate what the opposition and much of the international community has said was a stunning victory. The mood was jubilant, with people celebrating what they thought was the final end of Milosevic's 13-year autocratic rule. Opposition supporters also flooded streets in other towns across Serbia, cheering long into the night. </p> <p>Frustrated by the delay, opposition spokesman Cedomir Jovanovic said Monday that Mr Kostunica's supporters would give the commission two days - until tomorrow - to announce results or they would \"proclaim official results no matter what the government thinks.\" </p> <p>Mr Jovanovic said it was becoming clear that Milosevic could not accept defeat. </p> <p>The United States and dozens of European countries issued stern calls for Mr Milosevic to recognise the opposition tally and step down. </p> <p>The United States has pledged to lift sanctions against Yugoslavia - including blocking international bank loans, an oil embargo and denying visas to Yugoslav officials - once Mr Milosevic accepts defeat. </p> <p>The foreign secretary, Robin Cook, today renewed his call for Mr Milosevic, to stand down. Speaking at the Labour party conference in Brighton, he revealed that results from more than half the polling stations in Serbia showed that Mr Kostunica had won \"convincingly\". </p> <p>The foreign secretary argued that Mr Milosovic could not legitimately continue in power with \"any credibility or any authority\". He said that the only thing that would keep Mr Milosovic in control now was the use of naked power, which would be disastrous for the people of Serbia. </p> <p>Mr Cook said that the west was eager to make a new start with a new government in Belgrade. \"The European Union and other countries have made it abundantly clear that we want a new relationship with the Serb people. We want to end the sanctions. We want to bring Serbia into integration with the European institutions.\"</p>",
  "If the opposition to President Milosevic took a gamble in confronting him in Sunday's election, it faces an even more daunting task in the next few days. While the prospect of victory is real, it can be chilling and the embattled dictator will try hard to scare his opponents or buy off their leaders. <p>He may well be testing them to see if he can get away with claiming a first round victory, or whether he has to concede a second round. </p> <p>Opposition leaders were at least standing firm yesterday. \"There will be no bargaining,\" Zoran Djindjic, the leader of the Democratic party, said. \"Milosevic should better avoid tormenting the people since he would be wiped out in the runoff.\" The opposition challenger, Vojislav Kostunica, broke from Mr Djindjic's party in the early 1990s so the two men have a history of disagreement. </p> <p>More question marks hang over the two parties whose candidates will be eliminated if there is a second round. Vojislav Seselj's ultra-nationalist Radical party is still officially part of Mr Milosevic's ruling coalition, even though it fielded a separate candidate on Sunday. Before the first round Mr Seselj also repeatedly said his party would vote against Mr Milosevic in any second round. </p> <p>But Mr Seselj is a notorious opportunist as well as being fiercely ambitious. He was widely considered to have won the last presidential elections in Serbia but was defrauded of the result - whether through blackmail, death threats or the offer of a lucrative post is unknown. Now he is in a strong bargaining position with both Mr Milosevic and the opposition even though his party may have won less than 5% of the vote. </p> <p>Equally intriguing will be the conduct of the Serbian Renewal party, which used to be the strongest opposition group. Its vain and volatile leader, Vuk Draskovic, refused to join the 18-party coalition of Mr Kostunica, gravely weakening Mr Draskovic's already fragile authority and making him appear unprincipled. </p> <p>Mr Draskovic was formerly a deputy prime minister in Mr Milosevic's government and commands little trust among many liberal Serbs. He seemed yesterday to be trying to recoup his position within the opposition ranks by congratulating Mr Kostunica from his beach home in Montenegro where he has been in self-imposed exile after assassination attempts. \"I'd like to express my hope that Mr Milosevic will recognise the election and the will of the people,\" he added. </p> <p>He even expressed regret that his party had not joined the Democratic Opposition of Serbia bloc, which launched Mr Kostunica's can didacy in July. \"The results are a consequence of an ill-advised decision by the party leadership, including myself, to run in the elections on our own,\" he said. </p> <p>Ideologically, the opposition contains a mixture of political ideas, from monarchists, conservatives and nationalists to social democrats and liberals. The only common factor is a desire to see Mr Milosevic removed from power.</p>",
  "Relief spread through the pro-western government of Montenegro yesterday, its leaders apparently convinced that Slobodan Milosevic would have less chance of provoking violence after faring badly in Yugoslavia's elections. <p>Montenegro's deputy prime minister, Dragisa Burzan, said he believed that the main opposition candidate, Vojislav Kostunica, had won an outright victory in the presidential poll, and predicted that Mr Milosevic would soon be forced from power. </p> <p>\"I'd expect quite a quick removal of Milosevic. It cannot be more than at most a month of manoeuvring,\" he said in Podgorica. </p> <p>Mr Burzan said the president was growing desperate as his support ebbed and claimed that the atmosphere in Mr Milosevic's inner circle was \"like a funeral\". </p> <p>He was confident, he said, that the Yugoslav army and police would not support Mr Milosevic after seeing that he had such narrow backing. </p> <p>He felt that low levels of support for Mr Milosevic also helped to cut the chances of armed intervention in Montenegro which has very mixed feelings about its federation with Serbia; together they make up Yugoslavia. \"Tension is less _ I think he will be focused only on Serbia at the moment. I think he cannot now undertake anything in Montenegro.\" </p> <p>As rumours grew of disarray among the Serbian ruling elite in Belgrade, there were reports that the Yugoslav prime minister, Momir Bulatovic, a Montenegrin and a Milosevic loyalist, had resigned. </p> <p>But the main pro-Belgrade party in Montenegro dismissed the reports. \"I wouldn't pay much attention to this. It's not true,\" Zoran Zizic, the deputy leader of the Socialist Peoples' party, said in Podgorica. He went on to accuse the Montena-Fax news agency of spreading wrong information. </p> <p>Earlier, quoting a senior source in the Socialist Peoples' party, the agency had said that Mr Bulatovic had resigned after failing to meet a demand from President Milosevic to provide him with \"an extra 100,000 votes\". </p> <p>\"Having realised the election result was disastrous, Milosevic issued an ultimatum to Bulatovic to allocate another 100,000 votes through the military leadership and [army chief of staff] General Nebojsa Pavkovic,\" the agency said. </p> <p>It quoted the party source as saying that \"forged election material was to be transported to Podgorica by a military plane under General Pavkovic's orders, to be passed on to the election commission for 'verification'\". </p> <p>Mr Zizic called the report \"media lies\". He said that turnout in Montenegro, which has barely 5% of the Yugoslav electorate, was slightly below the 130,000 originally estimated, but reiterated that his party had won 90% of votes counted so far. </p> <p>The Montenegrin government boycotted the vote and denounced it as an unconstitutional farce. It left pro-Belgrade parties to organise their own elections in makeshift polling stations. </p> <p>Meanwhile, as the first results emerged in the province of Kosovo in Serbia, a mixture of apathy and resignation set in among Serbs there. </p> <p>In spite of numerous allegations of electoral fraud, both Mr Milosevic's ruling Serbian Socialist party (SPS) and the opposition alliance of parties trying to oust him agreed he got the majority of votes. </p> <p>In the divided town of Mitrovice, Mr Milosevic had claimed his party had won with 3,500 votes, compared with 800 for Mr Kostunica. In other towns the SPS claimed three-quarters of the vote. </p> <p>The leader of the Serbian Democratic party in Mitrovice, Dragisa Djokovic, put the large margin down to the fact that many opposition supporters were not on the voting lists. But he admitted that many of the 100,000 Serbs in Kosovo had voted for Mr Milosevic in the hope that Yugoslav troops would one day return to the province. Kosovo's Albanian community boycotted Sunday's vote. </p> <p>Mr Djokovic said: \"There are a lot of reasons, one of them is people's disappointment in the international community.\" </p> <p>For the most part, Kosovo's interest in the election results has been muted. TVs and radios in Mitrovice's cafes and shops could be heard announcing the results, but few people seemed pay attention. </p> <p>Most roadside stallholders were reluctant to say who they had voted for. But one woman selling clothing said with a smile: \"I have always voted for him. I don't know why, it's just a sort of tradition.\" </p> <p>Nearby a man selling wires and batteries implied he had voted for Mr Kostunica. \"People are afraid to vote for change, they think change is something terrible.\" </p> <p>Back at the opposition's headquarters Mr Djokovic said the key to the next few days would lie in Serbia. </p> <p>\"Belgrade decides what happens here. Our primary concern here is to have peace and avoid any incident.\"</p>",
  "Western leaders tried to bounce President Slobodan Milosevic from office yesterday in the wake of Yugoslavia's chaotic election. <p>Even though not a single ballot result had been announced, west European countries insisted that the Belgrade leader had lost overwhelmingly and should admit defeat. </p> <p>Foreign ministries throughout Europe and the US talked to eachother throughout Sunday night and agreed to act in concert. They organised a strong coalition for what they see as one of the best chances yet to oust him from office after an election turnout that exceeded their expectations. </p> <p>They moved quickly to try to exploit the disarray by claiming he had lost overwhelmingly and should stand down. </p> <p>The west has little sway over Mr Milosevic but it can influence public opinion in Serbia by discrediting any attempt by the president to hang on. </p> <p>Germany's chancellor, Gerhard Schr\u00f6der, also met the Russian president, Vladimir Putin - the one leader who may have some influence over Mr Milosevic. He urged Mr Putin to encourage Mr Milosevic to give way. </p> <p>Mr Schr\u00f6der, speaking at a press conference with Mr Putin in Moscow, said: \"We agreed _ that it looks as though Serbia and Yugoslavia have decided in favour of democratic change.\" Mr Putin did not dissent. </p> <p>Although the west European governments know that Mr Milosevic will not capitulate easily, given that he faces the prospect of trial at the Hague for war crimes, they will do everything possible to undermine him in the hope that the Serbian population will finallyinsist that he goes. </p> <p>Nato is building up its forces in the region. British defence and diplomatic sources said this was in case Mr Milosevic tried to divert attention by creating trouble in Kosovo or Montenegro, but a conflagration was not expected. </p> <p>The sources insisted Nato would not go to war over Montenegro. </p> <p>The foreign secretary, Robin Cook, said: \"Today Milosevic is a beaten, broken-backed president. The margin of defeat appears too great to fix through electoral fraud. My message to him today is to be honest with your people, do not cheat them. Get out of the way and let Serbia out of the prison into which you have turned it.\" </p> <p>The White House national security adviser, PJ Crowley, said it would be hard for Mr Milosevic to make a \"credible claim of victory\" because of strong opposition support and reported voting irregularities. </p> <p>Mr Crowley said: \"They haven't announced any election results at this point but the reliable information coming out of Yugoslavia suggests that the opposition has done very well.\" </p> <p>In Brussels, the EU insisted that Mr Milosevic could not declare himself the winner. \"It is clear that any attempt by Milosevic to declare himself the victor would be fraudulent,\" the EU said in a joint statement released by France, which holds the rotating presidency. </p> <p>The statement said the high turnout showed that the people of Serbia wanted change. </p> <p>\"They wanted to speak up, regardless of intimidation, manoeuvring, pressure and all sorts of manipulation by the Belgrade regime leading up to this ballot,\" said the statement. </p> <p>Javier Solana, the EU's foreign policy supremo, and Nato secretary-general during last year's Kosovo war, said Yugoslavia had to respect the will of its people. </p> <p>\"The people of Serbia have delivered an overwhelming vote for change. The turnout is remarkable by any standards. The clearly expressed will of the voters must now be translated into reality. The people of Serbia deserve nothing less,\" he said. </p> <p>Before the presidential and parliamentary elections on Sunday, the EU had pleaded with the Serbian people to turn out and vote to remove Mr Milosevic. Last week it repeated its promise to lift sanctions and offered reconstruction aid and help the country out of its international isolation. Nato made no comment yesterday, insisting that the election was a political, not a military matter. </p> <p>The party of the Western-backed Bosnian Serb prime minister, Milorad Dodik, saluted what it said was electoral defeat for Mr Milosevic. </p> <p>\"The defeat of Slobodan Milosevic is the defeat of the forces of the past, the defeat of the politics of conflict and isolation,\" the Party of Independent Social Democrats said. </p> <p>The Croatian president, Stipe Mesic, predicted that Mr Milosevic would do anything to stay in power in Yugoslavia, no matter how much blood had to be shed. </p> <p>\"Remaining in power is the only guarantee for him to stay alive, not politically but literally alive,\" Mr Mesic said in a state radio interview </p> <p>The British shadow foreign secretary, Francis Maude, said Serbs were tired of Mr Milosevic's \"gross misrule\". </p> <p>Mr Maude said: \"He must now step down. Whatever the election results, Kosovo's Albanians are clear that they do not wish to be governed from Belgrade. The international community now needs to take urgent steps to address this.\" </p> <p><b>Useful links</b></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.serbia-info.com\" target=\"_NEW\"> Serbian ministry of information</a> <br> <a href=\"http://www.dos.org.yu\" target=\"_NEW\">Serbian Democratic Opposition</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.state.gov/www/regions/eur/990527_kosovo_indictment.html\" target=\"_NEW\">International Criminal Tribunal indictment of Milosevic</a></p>",
  "There is nothing like an oil crisis to spread feelings of empowerment around the Middle East. Last week even Palestinians - whose only oil comes from olives - were suggesting that here was a weapon their friends could use to further the struggle with Israel. <p>Suddenly everyone in the region is aware of how much the world depends on them. The Middle East holds two-thirds of the world's proven oil reserves and, at current rates of production, it will last for 87 years, compared with 14 years for North American oil and eight years for European. And our dependence on the Middle East is increasing. The US Department of Energy predicts that 10 years from now the region will be called upon to produce about 30% more oil. </p> <p>Given the political uncertainties in the region, the risks are obvious. Among the Middle Eastern producers, Saudi Arabia is way ahead of the rest, providing 12% of the world's oil and holding more than a quarter of the known reserves. It is the only country capable of influencing prices single-handed, by turning the taps on and off - or it was until recently. </p> <p>In return for exercising this power responsibly, the west guarantees Saudi Arabia's security and doesn't complain too loudly about its record on human rights. </p> <p>But now this arrangement faces a challenge from Iraq. Following the recent Opec production increases, Iraqi production - currently just over 3m barrels a day - exceeds the world's readily available spare capacity. If supplies from Iraq were interrupted, by accident or design, havoc would ensue. </p> <p>On its own, that makes Iraq no different from other producers of similar size - Iran, Norway and Venezuela, for example - though it's worth noting that Iraq is one of the six largest suppliers to the United States. But in combination with Iraq's pariah status and the unpredictability of Saddam Hussein, it is potentially devastating. </p> <p>\"Five years ago, the Iraqi president, in his most fantastic dreams, never thought he would find himself in the position he is in today,\" says Jareer Elass of the Washington-based Oil Navigator consultancy. \"Tight oil markets, a world weary of sanctions, and an American presidential election - there's no way Saddam is going to let this pass.\" </p> <p>Chance has delivered Saddam a powerful weapon, and it is easy to see how he might use it: to end sanctions (on Iraq's terms), roll back the no-fly zones, and get out of paying several hundred billion dollars in Gulf war compensation. \"The Iraqis are trying to bargain with the UN and oil companies to keep oil production going in exchange for a pledge to remove sanctions,\" a Kuwaiti official said last week. </p> <p>But Iraq may be in less of a mood for bargaining than for testing UN-imposed restrictions to destruction in the belief that a world desperate for Iraqi oil, and suffering from sanctions fatigue, will be powerless to resist. </p> <p>The re-opening of Baghdad airport and the arrival of the first Russian and French flights is one crack that Iraq hopes to widen while the oil crisis lasts. \"Once we have regular civilian flights from Moscow, Amman and Paris, sanctions will be at an end,\" an Iraqi spokesman said. </p> <p>There are several other chinks. Earlier this month an Iraqi military plane infringed Saudi airspace for the first time in more than a decade, and there have been Iraqi incursions into the demilitarised sea zone off Kuwait. </p> <p>The success or otherwise of Saddam's strategy will depend on whether he can convince the world that he really would turn off the taps if it came to the crunch. Western analysts generally dismiss the idea on the grounds that he would be punishing himself by cutting off his only significant source of income. </p> <p>But it might not be so costly for Saddam. The high oil prices of the last few months, plus recent production increases, have given him a cash windfall. Estimates vary, but it could be enough to see Iraq through several weeks - possibly even a couple of months - of zero oil revenue. </p> <p>A second factor to bear in mind is that Iraq stands to lose less from cutting off its oil than other producers. The regime receives only half the total revenue from its oil production; the UN deducts the rest to pay compensation to Gulf war victims, feed Kurdish areas of Iraq, and to meet administration costs of the oil-for-food programme. </p> <p>If Iraq did decide to cut off supplies, the time of maximum impact would probably be at the end of October - just before the US presidential election. But there are problems with that. Under the current phase of the oil-for-food programme, Iraq is contracted to supply oil until December 4. Saddam might not be unduly worried by the legalities, but he does have to consider his long-term business relationships with the oil companies. </p> <p>It would be easier to turn off the taps in December, but by then the impact might be less because increased Opec production would have begun to replenish stockpiles. </p> <p>In either case, Iraq would need a plausible reason and, even if it found one, would risk losing the goodwill which it has carefully built up with countries such as France over the past 10 years. </p> <p>Psychologically, the oil weapon is very similar to a nuclear bomb because it tends to harm the user as well as the victim: its effectiveness lies in threatening to use it but not actually doing so. </p> <p>That requires subtle and precisely calculated tactics, which may be beyond Saddam's capability. The risks are certainly high and he may eventually back off. But, given the region's dominance of the oil markets, he will probably not be the last person to try. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:analysis@theguardian.com\">analysis@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "Vice President Al Gore mounted a campaign offensive on health care yesterday in an attempt to recapture wavering women voters, after his poll lead evaporated over his Republican opponent, George W Bush. <p>Campaigning in Florida, Mr Gore unveiled a 74-page booklet explaining how he proposes to deal with the crisis facing Medicare, the state-funded health system for pensioners, which is emerging as one of the key policy battlegrounds of the presidential elections. </p> <p>A Gallup poll published yesterday showed Mr Bush ahead of the vice president by 47 per cent to 46 per cent. The lead is statistically insignificant, but a psychological blow to the Gore camp which had amassed a 10 per cent lead since the beginning of the month and believed its campaign was gathering momentum. </p> <p>A breakdown of yesterday's polling figures showed that most of the swing was accounted for by radical shifts among women. A week ago, Mr Gore was leading by 17 per cent among women voters. In yesterday's poll that margin had been reduced to four per cent, perhaps a sign of success of Mr Bush's appearance last week on the Oprah Winfrey television chat-show which has an overwhelmingly female audience. </p> <p>The problems of Medicare are also believed to be a particular important issue among swing women voters, possibly because women live longer and because it is more often daughters than sons who look after ailing elderly parents. </p> <p>The burning health issue in the election has become the crippling cost of medicines. The amount Americans spend on prescription drugs has almost doubled since 1995 from $65 billion to $125 billion, and with a huge phalanx of baby-boomers approaching 60, that bill is expected to rise to $243 billion. Medicare provides no coverage for drug costs. Fifty million Americans have no private insurance coverage either and have to pay for medicines out of their own pocket. </p> <p>The proposals Mr Gore unveiled yesterday involve an injection of $338 billion of government spending over the next ten years to provide prescription drug coverage within Medicare for a $25 monthly premium. The government would cover all medicine costs if they passed an annual threshold of $ 4,000. He also proposed greater financial penalties for private health insurance companies which opt out of the Medicare programme because it is not sufficiently profitably </p> <p>\"Medicare faces insolvency unless we act now,\" the Vice President said yesterday. \"I want to make a rock-solid commitment to Medicare.\" </p> <p>Mr Bush portrayed the Gore health plan as a bureaucratic nightmare in the making. Instead he is offering to spend $158 billion over the next decade to provide subsidies to the elderly covering 25 per cent of their prescription coverage insurance, leaving it to them to chose an insurance plan. </p> <p>Buoyed by the apparent recovery in the polls, the Bush camp yesterday maintained an offensive on Mr Gore's integrity. Mr Bush's spokesman, Ari Fleischer accused the Democratic candidate of planting a spy at the Bush headquarters in Austin, Texas. </p> <p>A junior Gore aide was suspended last week after boasting he knew of a Democratic \"mole\" in the Bush camp. The aide, Michael Doyne, said he had been making the story up, but Mr Fleischer dismissed the claim and said \"it defies credibility\" that Mr Doyne was the only Gore campaign official who would know about an infiltration attempt. </p> <p>The possibility of a covert Democratic sympathiser was working in Austin was raised when a videotape of Mr Bush preparing for next months presidential debates was delivered to one of Mr Gore's aides earlier this month. The aide turned the tape over to investigators immediately, and the FBI began an investigation over the weekend. </p>"

  "<b>The Prime Minister: The Office and Its Holders since 1945 by Peter Hennessy. </b>Allen Lane, 686 pp., \u00a325, 5 October, 0 713 99340 5 <br> <a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,501839233,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a> <p> Peter Hennessy's new book hasn't persuaded me that its central preoccupation, the current dispute over prime ministerial power and its extent, is not sterile and, indeed, rather boring - yet it is a splendid read. The truth is that the Westminster system is quite inadequately democratic and transparent, and Hennessy is, if anything, too respectful and conventional in his proposals about how the office might be reformed. Party discipline, a weak parliament, quasi-presidential power, great secrecy and the fact that the PM, invariably gifted with a safe seat, is insulated from direct electoral pressure all mean that the system is just not accountable enough. The most disappointing part of Blair's constitutional reforms is that he hasn't faced up to the problems of the central edifice itself. There is no separation of powers, there are far too many MPs, secrecy makes it much too easy to hoodwink parliament and the public, the second chamber remains a patronage-based absurdity and so on. </p> <p> What makes the book so riveting to read is, on the one hand, the thoroughness of Hennessy's examination of the documents now open on pre-1970 administrations, combined with a great many interviews and inquiries of his own, and, on the other, his investigation of the PM's role in military and intelligence affairs. There is, however, a sharp cut-off point. What he has to say about administrations up to 1964 is fresh and fascinating; Wilson's administration of 1964-70 was so voluminously covered by press leaks at the time and by endless diaries and memoirs soon afterwards that the official documents have nothing new to tell us, and the Public Record Office is still closed for the administrations after that, so the quality and interest of the coverage fall sharply away. You read the chapters dealing with the period up to 1964 with bated breath and the ones thereafter with a yawn that becomes progressively harder to stifle as you reach the age of Major and Blair. </p> <p> The prime minister alone, as Hennessy reminds us, can activate the codes for a nuclear strike. The only one to authorise such a strike was Churchill: the 1943 Quebec Agreement meant that he had to give the go-ahead for Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Repeated attempts were made to get him to take the decision to cabinet, whose combined policy committee supported him, but still he refused. The framework for everything that followed was set by Attlee: he was the one who had to face the cold war, who authorised the building of a British atom bomb and drew up detailed preparations for world war three. The chiefs of staff, fearing an imminent Soviet attack, threatened their collective resignation in order to force him to keep open mediterranean and Middle East bases from which the RAF could bomb the USSR. But Major Attlee had fought at Gallipoli and was correspondingly sceptical about what generals had to say, favouring the MI6 view that the Soviet Union would not risk a major war until at least the mid-1950s. Yet by 1949 Attlee's inner group of ministers had launched a programme of subversive activities behind the iron curtain and approved war plans that included censorship, civil defence and internment camps on the Isle of Man. </p> <p> Even at this distance one trembles at the description of Churchill's return to office in 1951. It was a bizarre scene: he would take a late breakfast in bed with cold grouse or partridge and a whisky and soda. Lunch would follow with \"enough champagne and brandy... to incapacitate any lesser man\", as his private secretary John Colville put it. He would talk to ministers with Toby, his budgie, alighting (and sometimes doing more than that) on their heads. He had frequent sleeps. His method of dealing with crises, he explained, was to \"turn out the light, say 'bugger everyone,' and go to sleep\". He thought he could run the cabinet as if the war were still on, had a stroke (which was hushed up), and became increasingly senile. \"Churchill is now often speechless in Cabinet; alternatively, he rambles about nothing,\" Macmillan wrote in 1954. \"Sometimes he looks as if he is going to have another stroke... He was always an egoist, but a magnanimous one. Now he has become almost a monomaniac.\" It was into these unreliable hands that the first British atomic bomb was delivered in November 1953 - \"an extraordinary thing\", as Hennessy points out, \"for a man who had fought at Omdurman in 1898\". When, in July 1954, he revealed to the Cabinet that a mere committee had, several months before, taken the decision to build an H-bomb, the angry ministers walked out. </p> <p> Above all, Churchill clung to office. He despised Anthony Eden, his heir apparent, who, he said, had \"gone native\" among the \"shuffling scuttlers\" at the foreign office. The last of the Yalta Big Three, he was determined to end the cold war by personal diplomacy. The cabinet was horrified to discover that, returning from the US by ship, he had shot off a sheaf of telegrams to the new (post-Stalin) Soviet leadership, causing Lord Salisbury to threaten resignation for the umpteenth time. But it was all foolish and in vain. When he heard he'd won the Nobel Prize (in 1953, for his war memoirs) he became tremendously excited until told that it was for literature: \"His face fell. He'd wanted the Nobel Peace Prize.\" He ran the government in a wholly self-indulgent manner, and had little idea about peacetime problems, saying, for example, of his time as chancellor under Baldwin: \"I was chancellor of the exchequer... for five years and... I never understood it.\" Not long before leaving office he suggested to the cabinet that, in the face of increasing \"coloured immigration\", a good campaign slogan would be 'Keep England White'. Somehow he staggered through four years in this way, confiding to Colville on his last night at No 10: \"I don't believe Anthony can do it.\" </p> <p> Given that Churchill's opinion was quite widely shared, it seems surprising now that Eden was allowed to succeed. Lord Swinton had already told Churchill that \"anybody would be better than Anthony\" - who \"would make the worst prime minister since Lord North\". \"But,\" Swinton added, \"you announced him as your successor more than ten years ago.\"''I think it was a great mistake,' Churchill conceded. Within a short time of Eden's accession, the Russians were threatening to bombard the country with rockets as a result of a crisis he had insisted on provoking. </p> <p> Eden was an impossible fusser, pestering ministers with as many as twenty notes a day and ringing them up at every turn: Selwyn Lloyd had to endure thirty calls over the Christmas weekend of 1955. On top of this he had a violent temper. Civil servants were scared of taking issues to him: \"they knew it would worry him and cause an explosion. Always at the back of everything was the fear that he would lose his temper and we should be sworn at.\" He raged against his ministers, against journalists, against the Americans and against \"the Communists in the BBC\". Anthony Nutting, a junior minister at the Foreign Office, told Hennessy how, on the eve of Suez, Eden called him: </p> <p> \"The telephone rang and a voice down the other end said: 'It's me.' I didn't quite realise who 'me' was for a moment. However, he gave the show away very quickly by starting to scream at me. 'What is all this poppycock you've sent me about isolating Nasser and neutralising Nasser? Why can't you get it into your head I want the man destroyed?' I said: 'OK. You get rid of Nasser, what are you going to put in his place?' 'I don't want anybody,' he said. I said: 'Well, there'll be anarchy and chaos in Egypt.' 'I don't care if there's anarchy and chaos in Egypt. Let there be anarchy and chaos in Egypt. I just want to get rid of Nasser.'\" </p> <p> Everything that followed - the crazy invasion, ignoring Eisenhower's strong warnings against it, deceiving the cabinet, lying to parliament and the ultimate d*nouement - was inevitable: the Government was in the hands of a demented narcissist. The greatest criticism of the cabinet system in the entire period under review is that no one acted to stop a man who was clearly out of control, completely lacking in judgment - and in charge of a nuclear arsenal. </p> <p> Britain being Britain, there was a closing of ranks. Selwyn Lloyd lied like a trooper throughout the rest of his political life about his collusion with the French and Israelis, which didn't prevent him being hailed as a great statesman; and for years on end ministers stoutly denied that US pressure or the run on sterling had anything to do with the retreat from Suez. Hennessy did well to get Douglas-Home - many years later - to give the game away: </p> <p> \"What really turned the scale and made the chancellor... so terribly anxious was the American action in putting the Sixth Fleet alongside us in the mediterranean, for all the world to see, and therefore announcing in effect that America was totally against us. And the effect on sterling as a result of that was catastrophic. It was the actual effect on sterling [that did it].\" </p> <p> The dramas that Hennessy reveals peak with Macmillan. It is nice to be reminded of the Supermac style. The Archbishop of Canterbury, Geoffrey Fisher, called on Macmillan to tell him that whatever he did, he must not appoint Michael Ramsey as his successor, adding that he knew Ramsey well, had indeed been his headmaster at Repton. \"Thank you, Your Grace, for your kind advice,\" Macmillan replied. \"You may have been Dr Ramsey's headmaster, but you were not mine.\" Some years later, of the Kentish boy, Ted Heath: \"Hengist and Horsa were very dull people. Now, as you know, they colonised Kent; consequently the people of Kent have ever since been very slightly - well, you know . . . Ted was an excellent chief whip . . . a first class staff officer, but no army commander.\" Mac pushed Concorde through by regaling his ministers with the story of his great-aunt's Daimler, which had travelled \"at the sensible speed of thirty miles an hour . . . Nowadays, alas, people had a mania for dashing around. But that being so Britain ought to cater for this profitable modern eccentricity.\" Everyone was charmed, laughed, agreed, it was over in minutes. But Macmillan could also be morose, telling Woodrow Wyatt that his son Maurice \"was much nicer than me. I was always a shit. Maurice wouldn't be one so that's why he didn't get on in politics like me.\" </p> <p> The great drama of Macmillan's premiership - he was the first to have thermonuclear weapons at his disposal - was the Cuban missile crisis. The previous year the V-bomber force (the Victors, Vulcans and Valiants) had received a new set of procedures, counting down from Condition 5 (peace) to 1 (placing 25 per cent of the bomber force at five minutes' readiness). As the tension increased in October 1962 the force was moved to Condition 3. The plan was to annihilate thirty to forty Soviet cities with an assumed 16 million casualties: big cities like Moscow and Leningrad would get two or three H-bombs each. Nearly half the V-bombers were loaded with bombs and made ready, as were 59 Thor missiles, all with nuclear warheads. It seems likely that Air Marshal Cross took the initiative to increase the bombers' readiness to a mere 15 minutes from take-off. The pilots and crews slept on camp-beds next to the planes and all switches were set to allow a rapid engine start; they believed they would be able to take off in under 8 minutes. The weekend of 27-28 October - the worst of Macmillan's life - was \"the defining moment of the postwar period in nuclear terms\". </p> <p> It is intriguing to read of the great nuclear shelter for VIPs under the Cotswolds, to learn that the royal yacht Britannia was a fully fledged command and control centre with washdown facilities to deal with nuclear fallout, but the most striking thing is that neither the public nor parliament was ever told how close the country was to nuclear war. We didn't know that American action in the Caribbean would automatically lead to the V-bombers being fitted with Yellow Sun Mk IIs (as the H-bombs were called, though we weren't even told that at the time) and dispersed round the country ready to attack - and therefore didn't know how very close we came to the nightmare of Dr Strangelove. And, of course, there would have been no nonsense about alerting the public about what was up by declaring war. As Hennessy points out, the last time Britain declared war was against Siam in 1942: every war since - Korea, the Falklands, endless colonial conflicts, the Gulf, Kosovo - has been fought without parliament getting a chance to agree to it. </p> <p> Fast forward to April 1982: Macmillan \"doing his old man act\" visits Mrs Thatcher as the Falklands War escalates. She had cleared all the furniture away ready to receive a big deputation of backbenchers that evening. Mac, seeing the empty space, jumped to conclusions about the family silver. \"You've sold it all off, I suppose.\" He had just one question about the Argentinians: \"Have they got the Bomb?\" Assured they didn't, he talked of administrative matters and left with a mixture of admiration for her backbone mixed with disdain for her lack of background: \"she should have had more... knowledge - at least 150 years, perhaps 500 years, of the history of the country concerned.\" The idea of Mrs Thatcher having a deep appreciation of Argentinian history is almost comic and says more about the scholarly Macmillan than it does about her. Mrs Thatcher recalled how, as a young MP, she had heard Macmillan say that, not having a department of their own to run, prime ministers had a lot of time for reading. He recommended Disraeli and Trollope: indeed, he liked to talk of \"going to bed with a Trollope\". Mrs Thatcher \"sometimes wondered if he was joking\". </p> <p> Douglas-Home's premiership still has some old world charm. He described his time as prime minister as \"a terrible intrusion into one's private life\". His friend Lord Boyd-Carpenter told how Home believed government would be best carried out by 12 upper class families, of which nine should be Scottish. Douglas-Home told Dominic Harrod that he'd had a letter from Harrod's father, the economist, \"about inflation... or deflation - or something\". The most intriguing revelation here is that, had he won the 1964 election, he would have recalled Enoch Powell to the cabinet with a brief to reform Whitehall. This would doubtless have produced a historic slaughter, the Tiber foaming with much blood, but it's unlikely that even Powell would have won that one. Almost all ministers, and prime ministers especially, become great admirers of the civil service over time - the exception being, as usual, Macmillan. \"Civil servants are really more dangerous when they are good,\" he once said. \"They are against the aristocracy; the successful businessman; and the adventurer... They are like the clergy in pre-Reformation times. It was against them rather than against any theological doctrine that our ancestors revolted.\" </p> <p> It isn't just the absence of documents that makes it so dispiriting to move from the incumbents of the early postwar period to Wilson and Callaghan, Major and Blair. Hennessy, while admitting that many of the early premiers often broke the rules of cabinet government, is almost at a loss confronted by Thatcher and has an even worse time with Blair. His notion that the system was somehow vindicated by the fact that Thatcher got her come-uppance in the end is not convincing: it took 11 years to happen, after all, and allowed a degree of monomania which, if the system worked, would have been checked long before. In fact, if it really worked it would not have accepted a drunken and senile Churchill for so long or allowed an unstable personality like Eden to take office. It is comforting to believe in the inevitability - and thus security - of collective responsibility and, ultimately, collective action, but more often than not it's a fiction. </p> <p> An American president is constrained, above all, by a written constitution and the separation of powers. The truth is that, lacking a formal set of restraints, a premier like Thatcher could and did play fast and loose with the system. She could, for example, declare that she intended \"to go on and on and on\", something no American president could do. Blair has carried presidentialism even further but there is something embarrassing and hollow about the whole business: at least Thatcher was using all that power to make huge changes. Why does Blair need to concentrate such power around him? The country is not at war, he's not ramming through Attlee-scale reforms and his majority is large enough for him to allow parliament a strong say and still know he'll win. At the end of the day, a great deal of this presidentialism is quite obviously smoke and mirrors, PR without content. Can academics like Anthony Giddens, who took \"the Third Way\" seriously, now refrain from blushing? British premiers are usually frauds when they philosophise. Attlee and Thatcher stand out as premiers because they inaugurated an age in their image and changed the terms of debate, but neither was a philosopher - Thatcher's pretensions in that regard were simply embarrassing. </p> <p> One is driven, ineluctably, to wonder about the sadly inverse nature of political leadership. When the American republic was young and the population still tiny, the Presidency produced Washington, Hamilton, Jackson, Jefferson and Lincoln. Two hundred years and two hundred million people further on, with everyone far better educated, richer and more sophisticated, it could only produce the likes of Nixon and Ford, Reagan and Clinton. </p> <p> Britain is the same: when the population was under five million it produced Walpole and the two Pitts. Later, still with a poorly educated population under thirty million, it produced Palmerston, Peel, Disraeli and Gladstone. After it reached fifty million - of far better educated people - it produced the likes of Wilson, Callaghan, Major and Blair. Some strange law of historical diminution is at work here. Even the monstres sacr\u00e9s like Churchill look wonderful by contrast. He might have helped France at one time, De Gaulle said of Churchill, but in truth he would always be France's opponent because \"within him breathes the soul of Pitt.\" As we look at our modern crop of leaders it is difficult to imagine that within them breathe even the souls of Ramsay MacDonald or Stanley Baldwin. </p> <p>\u0095 To read more online essays from the current edition of the London Review of Books visit the <a href=\"http://www.lrb.co.uk/\" target=\"_new\">LRB</a>.

  "Army general staffs fight each new war on the basis of the lessons they learned in the last conflict. Politicians fight each new election according to the lessons they learned in the previous campaign. And, last night in North Carolina, Al Gore and George W Bush applied the same lesson, holding the presidential debate they failed to have in Boston a week ago. <p>This second debate of the presidential election season - there is one more in St Louis next week - was an altogether different contest to the one in Boston. Boston, especially in retrospect, was nervous, aggressive and riddled with tactical errors, particularly on Gore's part.</p> <p>Last night's debate in Winston-Salem - the heart of tobacco country, though the issue never came up - was far more cautious and far more courteous. In many ways, it was a replica of the impeccably civilised vice-presidential debate in Kentucky last Thursday. Overall, like the veep debate, last night was a no-score draw. </p> <p>Last week, the phrases that lingered in the mind were Bush's charge of \"fuzzy math\" and Gore's condemnation of tax cuts for \"the wealthiest one per cent\". Both phrases sat out the whole 90 minutes in Winston-Salem, although Gore twice talked about tax cuts for \"the wealthiest of the wealthy\". Last night, though, the most commonly repeated phrase from both men was the one the voters liked most in the Cheney-Lieberman vice-presidential contest - \"I agree with you.\" </p> <p>Coming into last night's debate, all the talk was about how Gore had blown it in Boston with his \"sighs and lies\" - audibly huffing and puffing in exasperation at Bush's answers and then embellishing the facts on a number of his own replies. By yesterday, most opinion polls had registered a small but significant shift to Bush as a result. </p> <p>From the off, Gore made clear by his demeanour that he was not going to commit the same mistakes in Winston-Salem. When Bush was answering, Gore looked down at the table, disciplined and expressionless. In most of his answers Gore was more succinct and less rambling than before. The porkies - if there were any - were small ones, and the vice-president went out of his way to apologise for getting his facts wrong in Boston. </p> <p>There were new themes last night that got no airing in the first debate. Race, a much criticised omission in the Boston debate, was prominent this time, with Gore trying to put some clear water between himself and Bush on issues like banning racial profiling by police, supporting affirmative action programmes and passing hate crimes legislation. </p> <p>Most Republican congressmen are opposed to these ideas, but you would never have guessed so from Bush's tactics - to agree as much as possible and to avoid getting dragged into disagreements on the issues. </p> <p>Fully 40 minutes of the debate concentrated on foreign affairs - even though the issue never comes up on the candidates' campaign stops. There was a substantial exchange on guns, too, another mostly silent issue on the campaign trail. But the most dramatic exchanges came when Gore tried to hammer Bush's record as Texas governor, charging that Texas was 49th out of 50 US states in the proportion of children and mothers with medical insurance, and 50th for families. For the only time in the evening, Bush looked a bit rattled. </p> <p>At the end, the two men shook hands and sent their lieutenants out of the hall to try to persuade the media that each of them had won the debate. That task was probably easier for Bush, who emerged from the second debate looking relaxed and unscathed. When you are in the lead and have a lot of money in the bank, a draw will do quite nicely. </p> <p>By that same token, a draw probably wasn't quite good enough for Gore, even though it will have steadied his side's nerves after Bush's post-Boston surge. Gore seemed to give few hostages to fortune, but at the same time he failed to make the kind of impact on Bush's record that his team were looking for. Gore desperately needs a good week on the campaign trail. Possibly, the Texas record will be his deliverance. </p> <p>The great lesson of the 2000 presidential campaign, though, is never to underestimate the set piece moments. After years of being told how the party conventions and the presidential debates had now become purely ritual, without any political substance, this year has proved the know-alls wrong time after time. The conventions were both turning points, and so was the Boston debate.</p> <p>Winston-Salem seemed to be a stand-off. But this means that there is all to play for. The final debate in St Louis next week now looks even more pivotal than it did before.</p>",
  "Allies of Yugoslavia's former president, Slobodan Milosevic, issued a dangerous challenge to the country's new rulers yesterday by insisting they still run the police and ordering units to take control of offices and enterprises which workers had seized in recent days. <p>Scores of cronies appointed to lucrative jobs by the former president have been forced to resign. The order is designed to lift the morale of those resisting the handover and give others a chance for a comeback. It is the most dramatic act of defiance since Mr Milosevic was forced by street protests last week to end his effort to steal September's election. </p> <p>The army also issued an ominous statement rejecting purges of the high command after senior generals met Vojislav Kostunica, the new president. They warned against \"possible negative consequences of increased attacks and attempts to discredit certain individual of the Yugoslav army\". </p> <p>Opposition leaders are threatening to call protesters back on to the streets if plans for new elections for a Serbian parliament are thwarted. They feel confident of winning them and breaking Mr Milosevic's resistance. They have no doubt the former president is co-ordinating the effort to use his Socialist party's control over Serbia's government against the more limited constitutional rights which Mr Kostunica has as Yugoslav president. </p> <p>Symbolising the half-way na ture of the transition, Mr Milosevic is still protected by the presidential guard, an elite unit of the army. \"He is a private citizen, but is protected by the presidential guard. He is not under arrest,\" Zoran Djindjic, the new rulers' chief strategist, told the Guardian yesterday. </p> <p>The ex-president is in his home in the well-to-do suburb of Dedinje behind a high metal fence. A lone police car is parked across the road but TV cameras watch the front, and the guard is inside. A few times a day the gates swing open and cars speed through with visitors for Mr Milosevic. According to Mr Djindjic, they are mainly from JUL, Yugoslav Left, the party founded by his wife Mira Markovic. JUL members were appointed to run many of the country's most important enterprises. Many have been sacked over the last few days as workers demand they go. </p> <p>The army high command is not fully reconciled to the changes at the top and the security police are getting back into action. \"They have four places in Belgrade from which they monitor phones. They listen to everybody. It's more than it used to be. They give the reports to Milosevic,\" Mr Djindjic said. </p> <p>Rade Markovic, the security police chief and a strong Milosevic loyalist, is still in office. President Kostunica has no power to sack him. </p> <p>While holding the weapon of street demonstrations in reserve, Mr Djindjic offered a compromise last night if the socialists accepted early elections. The ministries of police, justice, finance, and information would each have \"collective management\" without ex tensive changes of personnel. The socialists could also have the prime ministership, provided Mirko Marjanovic, one of Mr Milosevic's closest allies, stepped down. </p> <p>Still celebrating Mr Milosevic's formal concession of power, the Kostunica camp had felt triumphant on Monday when leaders of his Socialist party seemed to agree to hold early elections for the Serbian parliament in December. They were also delighted when the police minister resigned. </p> <p>Things later went sour. The socialists stalled talks on forming an interim government and refused to dissolve parliament, pending the elections. They went further yesterday by saying the Serbian government remained in power and Mr Marjanovic would take charge of the police. </p> <p>A statement issued after a meeting of the republic's government yesterday described the purges of company directors as illegal.</p>",
  "George W Bush has picked himself up off the floor and reopened a narrow poll and credibility lead over Al Gore in the US presidential election. <p>Mr Bush went into last night's second televised debate with Mr Gore oozing with fresh confidence after a damaging week for the Democratic nominee. Since opening up a lead over Mr Bush in mid-August, Mr Gore has struggled to rebut damaging claims that he bent the facts during last week's first televised debate. </p> <p>As the two men arrived in North Carolina for yesterday's debate - the second of three this month - a range of opinion polls showed Mr Bush recapturing a narrow lead nationally, recovering in key battleground states and even threatening to carry Mr Gore's home state, Tennessee. </p> <p>A Washington Post/ABC News poll showed Mr Bush reversing the vice-president's lead from the start of the month, establishing a 48% to 45% lead over Mr Gore, with Ralph Nader, the Green candidate a distant third on 3% and Pat Buchanan of the Reform party on 1%. </p> <p>Two daily tracking polls - based on a three-day rolling sample in which one third of the total sample is changed daily - also confirmed Mr Bush's lead. A Gallup poll for CNN and USA Today put him ahead by 47% to 44%, while a Zogby poll for Reuters put him ahead by 43% to 42%. The Pew Research Centre also gave him a one-point lead. </p> <p>There was some more good news for Mr Bush in the most important state of all, California, where a statewide Zogby poll had the Republican narrowing Mr Gore's recent double-figure lead to six points: Mr Gore led Mr Bush by 45% to 39%. The vice-president still leads in the most recent polls in the battleground states. </p> <p>Although Mr Gore was at first widely perceived to have \"won\" last week's first debate, the polls have steadily swung towards Mr Bush in recent days. Dissatisfaction with Mr Gore's performance at first focused on his audible sighs of exasperation about Mr Bush's answers during the Boston debate, but has now focused on the vice-president's questionable embellishments in his own responses. </p> <p>In last week's debate, Mr Gore told three anecdotes - about his own role in disaster relief, about Florida school overcrowding and about an Iowa pensioner's struggle to pay for medicines - aspects of which were untrue. </p> <p>Voters' exasperation with him is reflected in the Pew survey that shows only 48% of Democrats view themselves as \"strong backers\" of Mr Gore, compared with 63% of Republicans who identify themselves as strong backers of Mr Bush. </p> <p>The bad publicity for Mr Gore's self-inflicted \"sighs and lies\" at the Boston debate showed little sign of abating yesterday as Republicans pounced on a February 1988 memo to Mr Gore by his then press secretary which stated: \"Your main political pitfall is exaggeration. Be careful not to overstate your accomplishments.\" </p> <p>Republican researchers also unearthed a 1979 statement by Mr Gore in a congressional committee hearing that he had \"raised 10,000 chickens\" as a farmer in Tennessee, a claim which has not otherwise featured on his curriculum vitae for the White House. </p> <p>\"Ever since the debate, which he won by a small margin, the news about Gore has been dominated by his embellishments and exaggerations and that has been more dominant in the news than anything,\" said the pollster John Zogby yesterday. </p> <p>Mr Gore pledged to \"do my best to get the details right\" in last night's debate. </p> <p>With less than four weeks to go before the November 7 election, the two final debates - in Winston-Salem and next week in St Louis - have taken on an even greater significance amid the apparent voter volatility. Mr Gore still leads comfortably on most of the issues which voters tell the pollsters are important to them, but Mr Bush is profiting from the vice-president's slippage on questions of character.</p>",
  "Unexpectedly stubborn resistance by Slobodan Milosevic and his Socialist party allies to the loss of the Yugoslav presidency has pushed Serbia to the brink of new street protests and created a dangerous struggle for power. <p>The Socialists have walked out of talks on forming an interim government to rule Serbia until the elections in December, and they insist that they still run the republic's police force. </p> <p>In response, President Vojislav Kostunica and his colleagues are planning to bring back the popular anger which turned the federal parliament and the state television headquarters into smoking ruins last week. </p> <p>\"If they delay [Serbian] elections we will bring the demonstrators out again in three days,\" said Zoran Djindjic, the chief strategist behind the movement which brought Mr Kostunica to victory. </p> <p>Mr Djindjic's driver and the bodyguard of another party leader were detained by eight men in plain clothes as they sat in their car outside his office late on Tuesday night. Although they were freed two-and-a-half hours later it was a reminder of the power that the old regime still has to harass Mr Kostunica's team. </p> <p>A week after the popular uprising which forced Mr Milosevic out of office, Serbia has entered a limbo in which Mr Milosevic is mounting a rearguard action by mobile phone while the new rulers find it hard to sideline him completely and achieve a full transfer of power. The contra diction is well illustrated by Mr Djindjic. \"He [Milosevic] is a private citizen who's protected by the presidential guard, which is an elite unit of the army,\" Mr Djindjic said. </p> <p>A dissident philosopher who was persecuted under Tito and lived in Germany for 12 years, Mr Djindjic leads the Democratic party, the largest member of the 19-party alliance known as the Democratic Opposition of Serbia. As Mr Kostunica's campaign manager, he is widely seen as the mastermind behind the successful strategy of strikes and protests which was launched when Mr Milosevic tried to force a runoff. </p> <p>One reason why the new rulers cannot act more decisively is that they have only won power over federal institutions. The Serbian presidency, parliament and government are still controlled by the Socialist party. </p> <p>Another reason is that Mr Kostunica does not want to be too radical. \"We could make a revolution but it wouldn't be good. It would create too much instability,\" Mr Djindjic said. \"Our problem is that we want to change as much as possible without overstepping the boundary of legality. To some extent the crisis which the Socialists have provoked by refusing to discuss the formation of a new government is one of posturing. The Kostunica camp controls the street, and most of Mr Milosevic's allies cannot go outside their houses without bodyguards. </p> <p>\"The Socialist party has no structures anymore,\" he said. \"Milosevic can give orders by phone but there are no instruments to carry them out.\" </p> <p>The Yugoslav army chief of staff, General Nebojsa Pavkovic, cannot send army units against protesters. But he can block changes. </p> <p>Similarly, police at the grassroots level would not dare tp act against crowds although sections of them - such as security service operators who still tap telephones - are an irritant, Mr Djindjic said. </p> <p>The media is completely in the hands of the Kostunica team, with many analysts claiming that Mr Milosevic made a major blunder by not conceding defeat after the first round. Then he would have avoided the muscle-flexing street protests and the loss of Serbian state television. </p> <p>With the television still in his hands, Mr Milosevic would have been in a much stronger position to resist the changes today. Mr Djindjic is not surprised that people have not so far tried to storm Mr Milosevic's mansion. </p> <p>\"We kept things under control last week, going after him was not part of the plan. We didn't want to risk lives.\" </p> <p>But he admitted that the events of last Thursday, when protesters set fire to the parliament and the TV headquarters, were not planned. </p> <p>When Mr Milosevic tried to push the election into a second round, the opposition developed its strategy of civil disobedience. There were to be five days of street blockades in every major city in Serbia to show that people were not ready to accept the fraud. Next would come a coal miners' strike to show the opposition's industrial muscle. Finally, protesters would converge on Belgrade from all over the country in convoys of buses. </p> <p>\"We planned to occupy buildings in Belgrade and then use them as a base from which to negotiate Mr Milosevic's departure. But more happened than we thought,\" Mr Djindjic said. </p> <p>Parliament and the television offices were burned, and the police switched sides. The constitutional court went into reverse and declared Mr Kostunica the election winner.</p>"

  "President Alberto Fujimori's surprise announcement last weekend that he would step down and call fresh elections followed signs that he was losing the support of the powerful military in the fallout from two major corruption scandals involving Peru's notorious intelligence service. <p>Mr Fujimori's decision, announced in a national address, stunned the country and left Peru's opposition scrambling to build a united front. Officials said the election was likely to be held within six months, and Vice-President Francisco Tudela said that Mr Fujimori \"has the full intention of staying in power during that time\". For their part, opposition leaders demanded that Mr Fujimori step down immediately in favour of a transition government. </p> <p>Last Saturday's announcement was a breathtaking reversal for Mr Fujimori, Latin America's longest-serving elected leader, who had weathered severe criticism since winning an unprecedented third five-year term in May elections widely described as unfair. </p> <p>International pressure had been mounting on him to agree to democratic reforms, including firing Vladimiro Montesinos, the architect of Peru's ruthless intelligence service, who has been Mr Fujimori's most important aide since his rise from obscure academic to president in 1990. </p> <p>Demands to deal decisively with Mr Montesinos reached a climax after a videotape was made public last week showing the intelligence chief handing a $15,000 bribe to an opposition congressman to back Mr Fujimori. </p> <p>With pressure growing on Mr Fujimori to act, several key regional leaders of Peru's military refused to attend a meeting called by the president last Saturday to gauge his support within the armed forces, but it was unclear whether the military chiefs withdrew their support for Mr Fujimori out of loyalty to Mr Montesinos or in an effort to hasten his, and Mr Fujimori's, departure. </p> <p>In a sign that elements of the military were opposed to Mr Montesinos, Fernando Olivera - head of the opposition Independent Moralising Front - who obtained the damaging videotape, said that it had \"come from a civilian source with links to a discontented segment of the military\". </p> <p>Mr Olivera said he has obtained other tapes from intelligence sources that show footage of Mr Montesinos bribing businessmen, journalists, politicians and even some military officers to support Mr Fujimori. </p> <p>On Tuesday Mr Montesinos was reported to be holed up at a Peruvian military base as opposition politicians demanded his arrest. </p> <p>\"The military obviously played a key role,\" said Francisco Loayza, an intelligence adviser to Mr Fujimori in the early days of his first administration. \"As far as I can tell... they began withdrawing support as the scandal around Mr Montesinos grew. Mr Fujimori saw what he built begin to come apart, and decided it was not possible to continue governing.\" </p> <p>In his address Mr Fujimori said that he was dismantling the National Intelligence Service. The organisation had been instrumental in destroying the leadership of two leftist guerrilla groups during the early 1990s - by means that human rights groups said included torture, executions, and intimidation and persecution of many innocent Peruvians. </p> <p>Mr Fujimori's announcement set off spontaneous celebrations across Peru, including in the capital's main plaza opposite the presidential palace, where flag-waving revelers converged. </p> <p>Mr Fujimori's decision was hailed by the United States, which has had an uneasy relationship with the president, supporting his hard line on drug traffickers, but opposing his moves against democracy. </p> <p>A White House statement said: \"We welcome the bold step taken by President Fujimori. The actions announced... are clearly aimed at resolving the political polarisation facing Peru [and]... represent a good beginning to such an endeavour.\" </p> <p>Mr Fujimori's decision was an unexpected windfall for Alejandro Toledo, who pulled out of the second round of balloting for the presidency in May. He said he still does not believe Mr Fujimori will give up power so easily, but he called the decision \"a great step toward democracy for Peru\". </p> <p>Mr Toledo also officially declared his candidacy to succeed Mr Fujimori. \"I plan to be president; I am ready to be president; I will be president,\" he said.</p>",
  "The Yugoslav president, Slobodan Milosevic, flew to an army base in Montenegro yesterday to denounce his opponents as \"rabbits, rats and even hyenas\" and warn the west not to interfere in elections on Sunday, which the opinion polls indicate that he cannot win. <p>Scores of Mr Milosevic's critics have been detained and with tension rising the chief opposition candidate, Vojislav Kostunica, has warned that the president could use fraud to stay in power. Western governments fear he will use the army to crush protests if he is declared the winner. A US aircraft carrier is being sent to the Adriatic. </p> <p>It was Mr Milosevic's first visit to Montenegro - which with Serbia makes up Yugoslavia - since he became federal president three years ago. His helicopter brought him to the rally near the town of Berane, within 15 miles of Kosovo, where Nato-led troops could have arrested him on war crimes charges brought by the Hague tribunal last year. </p> <p>The republic of Montenegro is deeply divided and its pro-western government, led by Milo Djukanovic, is boycotting the Yugoslav election. A former Serbian information minister, Aleksandar Tijanic, warned that Mr Milosevic was preparing to arrest the Montenegrin president. </p> <p>Mr Djukanovic said last night that Montenegro would defend itself if Mr Milosevic provoked a military clash. Speaking to Russian television, he said: \"If Milosevic decides to provoke a military conflict with Montenegro, we would have no choice but to defend our freedom.\" </p> <p>A US navy spokeswoman confirmed yesterday that the aircraft carrier George Washington would arrive in the Adriatic from the Persian Gulf on about September 30. \"This is much the normal tour of duty,\" the spokeswoman said. \"There hasn't been a carrier in the Adriatic for about three or four months and the George Washington is on its way back to the Atlantic.\" </p> <p>Mr Milosevic yesterday told a crowd of 10,000 supporters bussed in from nearby towns: \"Our country is the focus of much attention from the world's strongest nations, as if mankind has no other worries but how ... Serbs and Montenegrins will govern their joint state.\" Many in the crowd shouted \"Slobo, Slobo\" and \"We are all Yugoslavia\". </p> <p>He has clamped down on the independent media and ordered police to confiscate computers and other material from Serbian election monitoring groups. Under the law, independent observers have no right to enter polling stations or attend the count. </p> <p>Despite the pressures, the opposition has done remarkably well by uniting behind Mr Kostunica, a Belgrade lawyer, Only the maverick Serbian Renewal Movement is running a separate candidate. An opinion poll by the Belgrade-based Strategic Marketing agency gave Mr Kostunica 32.5% of the vote to Mr Milosevic's 26.6%. The Centre for Policy Studies gave Mr Kostunica 41% to Mr Milosevic's 20%. </p> <p>Mr Milosevic has support in rural areas and has manipulated the campaign through control of state television. State controls on the price of staple goods have also cushioned the realities of a weak economy. But years of war and corruption at the top have disillusioned many urban voters. </p> <p>Warning of vote rigging, Mr Kostunica told a rally at the weekend: \"They are bullies, liars and thieves and have stolen years of our lives and dignity. Now they are preparing to steal the elections\". </p> <p>Mr Milosevic could cheat by falsifying votes from Kosovo. The UN has allowed the poll to go ahead there but will not be running or supervising it. In the last Serbian presidential elections as many as 200,000 Albanians supposedly voted for Mr Milosevic's right-hand man. Because of the boycott in Montenegro, Mr Milosevic can also steal votes which are cast in army camps and town halls run by the pro-Belgrade party. </p> <p>The EU has offered to lift sanctions if the election \"leads to democratic change\". The wording was chosen with care as the Yugoslav constitution is so ambiguous it could allow Mr Milosevic to serve out his term until next July, even if the opposition wins. But most observers believe he is more likely simply to declare victory and hope to ride out - or shoot out - any protests.</p>"

  "Russian President Vladimir Putin today offered to host talks between Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic and opposition leader Vojislav Kostunica to resolve Belgrade's election crisis. <p>A Kremlin statement issued while Mr Putin was flying to India on a visit referred to both men as candidates in the second round of the Yugoslav presidential election - an implicit recognition of the official first round results. </p> <p>\"As president of Russia I am prepared to receive in the next few days in Moscow both candidates who have gone through to the second round...to discuss means of finding a way out of the current situation,\" the statement said. </p> <p>But Yugoslav ambassador Borislav Milosevic, Mr Milosevic's brother, was quoted by Interfax news agency as saying no Russian mediation was needed to resolve the impasse.</p> <p>Mr Putin has taken an active role to broker a deal that would ease Mr Milosevic out of power to enhance the Russian leader's image as a statesman. The Russian president launched his diplomatic gambit after intensive talks over the weekend with US President Bill Clinton and European leaders. </p> <p>Russia has conceded that Mr Kostunica won the poll in the first round. </p> <p>Moscow played a key role in persuading Mr Milosevic to pull Serbian forces out of Kosovo last year, bringing an end to Nato's air campaign against Belgrade and the Serb province, and Russia can expect to win the west's gratitude if it can persuade Mr Milosevic to step down peacefully.</p> <p>Less than a week remains before Sunday's scheduled run-off elections. Mr Milosevic says Mr Kostunica failed to achieve an outright victory in the September 24 elections and a second round is needed. The opposition, backed by the West, insists Milosevic rigged the voting. </p> <p>\"It's up to the people...whether they are going to stand for this or not,\" said retired General Wesley Clark, who led Nato's 78-day air war against Yugoslavia last year. </p> <p>In the current campaign of protests, road blockades temporarily blocked traffic on one bridge in the capital, Belgrade, while city transit workers staged a two-hour walkout. The blockade appeared stronger in cities and towns outside Belgrade, bringing life to a virtual standstill in the central and southern industrial heartland towns like Cacak, Pancevo and Uzice. </p> <p>Mr Milosevic has so far held the military and police in check. He may be running out of options as some vital industries, such as coal mines, join the opposition ranks. The independent Beta news agency reported that 500 policemen entered the Kolubara mine, the nation's largest, late Sunday. </p> <p>The action could be an attempt to thwart sabotage at the mine, about 25 miles south of Belgrade, where thousands of workers have walked out. Already, thousands of workers have left key industries in a nation battered by international sanctions.</p> <p>Only essential public services were operating in several cities. \"They are sending a strong message to Milosevic: 'Your time in office is over,\"' said the US national security council spokesman PJ Crowley in Washington. </p>",
  "<p>There are two nets - divided only by the Atlantic. And never has that ocean seemed as wide as during the party conference season, ending with the Tories in Bournemouth this week. </p> <p>Firstly, there was the net of legend. A forum for democratic Athenian debate, where information would be widely available to everyone. In secretive countries such as Britain, it would herald a new age of glasnost. Information would really be free and government would not be able to hide from unflattering stories. </p> <p>Then, there's the net of fact: difficult to work your way around, confusing and bamboozling - in the same manner that the Sir Humphrey Applebys of this world pile official documents onto the desks of ministers. </p> <p>At first glance, Britain is overrun with online political coverage. There's sites such as YouGov (<a href=\"http://www.yougov.com\">www.yougov.com</a>) and at the Labour party conference last week, delegates roamed the halls wearing the neck lanyards of conference sponsors ePolitix (<a href=\"http://www.epolitix.com\">www.epolitix.com</a>) which describes itself grandly as \"Britain's leading political and parliamentary website\" and is run by the publishers of the House Magazine. Seasoned correspondent Robin Oakley, the former BBC political editor now at CNN.com's European operation, could be seen at work - and both ourselves and BBC Online had a presence. </p> <p>But while these sites are, well, great, there's something missing. If you really want to be inspired by the way online journalism covers politics, you have to point your mouse to the US. There, democracy online really does have a meaning. </p> <p>The first thing I have to say is that we have an interest ourselves - Guardian Unlimited is presently planning its own political site. But all UK political sites have lessons to learn from the US. </p> <p>It's not just because technology is bound up with US politics now (Microsoft has spent more than $15m lobbying and contributing to the Republican and Democrats since 1997, according to a report from US campaigning group Common Cause published last week). It's also that the web has been turned into a well-oiled machine for covering big and little politics in a way users can understand and relate to. </p> <p>While the next election will be Britain's first e-election, with online reporters competing for user share as hard as their print counterparts, the election for US president in November will be the first where the net may actually influence the result. </p> <p>For the candidates, the net is an essential marketing and fundraising tool. Millions of dollars have been raised online for them, and the US TV networks compete wildly for online coverage of the party conventions. </p> <p>What's striking besides the sheer amount of space devoted to politics is that there's a voice and attitude to US political websites. By and large - and bizarrely, considering the combative nature of British papers - UK online political coverage tends towards the respectful. In the US, if a site is not taking the mickey out of a candidate it is pressing hard for answers to difficult questions. </p> <p>Subverting the po-faced official sites, well-designed spoof sites have become the bane of high-profile politicians - to the extent that the Bush campaign tried to buy up unflattering site addresses to reduce the options for opponents. He had good reason: one of the strongest spoof sites in the US is <a href=\"http://www.gwbush.com\">www.gwbush.com</a>, which has twisted rap star Eminem's The Real Slim Shady into a game where the Republican vice-presidential nomination jives to The Real Dick Cheney. </p> <p> The candidates themselves are not averse to getting down and dirty online. The Republicans have set up <a href=\"http://www.Gorewillsayanything.com\">Gorewillsayanything.com</a>, a comprehensive list of negative attacks on the vice-president. The Republican National Committee produces the Goreinventionconvention.com and <a href=\"http://www.Gorepollution.com\">Gorepollution.com</a> sites, which are pretty self-explanatory. The Democrats have hit back with similarly aggressive sites such as <a href=\"http://www.IknowwhatyoudidinTexas.com\">IknowwhatyoudidinTexas.com</a> and <a href=\"http://www.MillionairesforBush.com\">MillionairesforBush.com</a>. The sites are considered significant enough by the parties for them to accuse each other bitterly of online negative campaigning. </p> <p>And while the big UK parties' sites have improved massively in the last year (the Labour party relaunched its site last week with live webcasts from the conference and full speeches), it's hard to imagine them displaying the flair and imagination - and cash - of their US counterparts. Some would say it's just a reflection of the difference in political culture. In the US, citizens demand access to information from their servants. In the UK, subjects accept what they are given and expect information to be handed to them. </p> <p>That is a view reflected by much of Britain's online political coverage. But I don't believe that. It's just up to the web to prove them wrong.</p> <p> &amp;149; Simon Rogers is deputy editor of Guardian Unlimited</p>",
  "Workers in Serbia's most powerful industry have swung against President Slobodan Milosevic, threatening to throttle the electricity system and plunge the entire country into darkness. <p>The 7,500 miners at the huge Kolubera open cast mine, 40 miles south of Belgrade, went on strike at the weekend in support of the opposition challenger, Vojislav Kostunica. </p> <p>Mr Kostunica claims outright victory against Mr Milosevic in the Yugoslav presidential poll on September 24. Mr Milosevic insists that a runoff is needed. </p> <p>A countrywide campaign of strikes and civil disobedience is due to start at dawn today, aimed at forcing Mr Milosevic to stand down, but the miners at Kolubera stayed away from work yesterday. Many of the other 900 workers at the complex are expected to join the boycott today. </p> <p>\"Kolubera is the single most powerful industrial weapon in the whole country. It is the biggest giant,\" said Milovan Rankovic, from the Serbian electrical industry union. </p> <p>Serbian ministers including the energy minister, Slobodan Tomovic, held urgent meetings with strike leaders yesterday while industry officials attempted to persuade the workers to call off the action. </p> <p>One mineworker said the director of coal at the Kolubera complex, Milovan Zunic, had threatened to expel strikers, threatening that \"they would kick us out with the help of police and then bring people from Kosovo to work instead\". </p> <p>Police tried to enter one of the complex's pits yesterday, apparently aiming to end the strike, but were stopped by workers, a member of the strike committee said. </p> <p>\"Two police jeeps and three patrol cars tried to enter the area of Tamnava pit,\" Nikola Simic said by telephone. \"But all the workers who were there stopped them coming in.\" </p> <p>Kolubera provides the coal for the Obrenovac thermonuclear electricity station, which provides power for Belgrade and the surrounding region. </p> <p>The miners' support is a significant gain for Mr Kostunica's Democratic Opposition of Serbia bloc. In the past the region of Lazarevac, where Kolubera is based, was a stronghold of Mr Milosevic's Socialist party of Serbia. </p> <p>\"If Kolubera goes on strike, the electrical system for the whole of Serbia is damaged,\" Mr Rankovic said. \"But people in positions of power in this country have to accept responsibility.\" </p> <p>Dragan Pantic, a 41-year-old coal worker, was defiant. \"We are not going to give up. Look at what I've got after 19 years here,\" he said, indicating his worn-out shoes. He earns 600 dinar (about \u00a3100) a month. </p> <p>\"Support is huge. The election was a referendum against Slobodan Milosevic. It is possible that strikebreakers will come in. It is possible that they could make us sign that we will not strike. Yesterday we were all threatened,\" he said. </p> <p>Another coal worker, Goran Djordjevic, 46, said: \"I think this time Milosevic will go. People are ready. There's a lot of readiness here and all around Serbia to make it happen. The regime knows that Kolubera is dangerous for them politically and because of the electrical power system.\" </p> <p>The extent of the coal stored at Obrenovac is not known. Experts suggest that an all-out strike at Kolubera could hit power supplies across Serbia within a week. </p> <p>\u0095 President Milosevic's son, Marco, visited his opponents' headquarters at the weekend, and warned opposition activists that his father was still in power and had no intention of leaving, an activist said. </p> <p>Useful links: <br><a href=\"http://www.serbia-info.com\" target=\"_NEW\">www.serbia-info.com</a> Serbian ministry of information <br> <a href=\"http://www.sps.org.yu\" target=\"_NEW\">www.sps.org.yu</a> Milosevic's Serbian Socialist party <br><a href=\"http://www.dos.org.yu\" target=\"_NEW\">www.dos.org.yu</a> Serbian Democratic opposition <br><a href=\"http://www.freeb92.net\" target=\"_NEW\">www.freeb92.net</a> Free B92 - independent Belgrade radio station <br><a href=\"http://www.otpor.net\" target=\"_NEW\">www.otpor.net</a> Otpor student resistance movement</p>"
